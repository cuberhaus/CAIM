Nonlinear frequency conversion provides essential tools for light generation, photon entanglement,
and manipulation. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) possess huge nonlinear susceptibilities
and 3R-stacked TMD crystals further combine broken inversion symmetry and aligned layering, representing
ideal candidates to boost the nonlinear optical gain with minimal footprint. Here, we report on
the efficient frequency conversion of 3R-MoS2, revealing the evolution of its exceptional second-order
nonlinear processes along the ordinary (in-plane) and extraordinary (out-of-plane) directions.
By measuring second harmonic generation (SHG) of 3R-MoS2 with various thickness - from monolayer
(~0.65 nm) to bulk (~1 {\mu}m) - we present the first measurement of the in-plane SHG coherence length
(~530 nm) at 1520 nm and achieve record nonlinear optical enhancement from a van der Waals material,
>10^4 stronger than a monolayer. It is found that 3R-MoS2 slabs exhibit similar conversion efficiencies
of lithium niobate, but within propagation lengths >100-fold shorter at telecom wavelengths.
Furthermore, along the extraordinary axis, we achieve broadly tunable SHG from 3R-MoS2 in a waveguide
geometry, revealing the coherence length in such structure for the first time. We characterize
the full refractive index spectrum and quantify both birefringence components in anisotropic
3R-MoS2 crystals with near-field nano-imaging. Empowered with these data we assess the intrinsic
limits of the conversion efficiency and nonlinear optical processes in 3R-MoS2 attainable in waveguide
geometries. Our analysis highlights the potential of 3R-stacked TMDs for integrated photonics,
providing critical parameters for designing highly efficient on-chip nonlinear optical devices
including periodically poled structures, resonators, compact optical parametric oscillators
and amplifiers, and optical quantum circuits.

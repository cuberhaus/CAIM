The Eulerian-Lagrangian method is applied to simulate pulsating propagation and extinction of
stoichiometric hydrogen/oxygen/argon detonations in ultrafine water sprays. Three detonation
propagation modes are found: (1) pulsating propagation, (2) propagation followed by extinction,
and (3) immediate extinction. For pulsating detonation, within one cycle, the propagation speeds
and the distance between reaction front (RF) and shock front (SF) change periodically. The pulsating
phenomenon originates from the interactions between gas dynamics, chemical kinetics, and droplet
dynamics inside the induction zone. Multiple pressure waves are emanated from the RF within one
cycle, which overtake and intensify the lead SF. An autoigniting spot arises in the shocked gas after
the contact surface. The relative locations of SF, RF, shock-frame sonic point, and two-phase contact
surface remain unchanged in a pulsating cycle, but their distances have periodic variations. Moreover,
the unsteady behaviors of detonation extinction include continuously increased distance between
the RF and SF and quickly reduced pressure peaks, temperature, and combustion heat release. The
decoupling of RF and SF leads to significantly increasing chemical timescale of the shocked mixture.
The hydrodynamic structure also changes considerably when detonation extinction occurs. Moreover,
the predicted map of detonation propagation and extinction illustrates that the critical mass
loading for detonation extinction reduces significantly when the droplet size becomes smaller.
It is also found that for the same droplet size, the average detonation speed monotonically decreases
with water mass loading. However, detonation speed and pulsating frequency have a non-monotonic
dependence on droplet size under a constant water mass loading.

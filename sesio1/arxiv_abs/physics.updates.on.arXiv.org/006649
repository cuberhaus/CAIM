The phenomenon of thermal and compositional (chemical) convection is very common in nature and
therefore of great importance from the point of view of understanding of many fundamental aspects
of the environment and universe. A number of books have been written on the topic, such as e.g. the
seminal work of Chandrasekhar (1961) on Hydrodynamic and Hydromagnetic Stability, a large portion
of which is devoted to the convective instability near its onset or the outstanding book of Getling
(1998) where systematization of the knowledge on convection has been continued with a thorough
description of the weakly nonlinear stages. Most of the works, however, considered weakly stratified,
that is the so-called Boussinesq convection. It is the aim of this book to continue the process of
systematization. It seems important to put the current knowledge on weakly and strongly stratified
convection in order and provide a comprehensive description of the marginal, weakly nonlinear
and fully developed stages of convective flow in both cases. To that end the book provides a short
compendium of knowledge on the linear and weakly nonlinear limits of the Boussinesq convection,
as a useful reference for a reader and than proceeds with a review of the theory on fully developed,
weakly stratified convection. The entire third chapter is devoted to a detailed derivation and
a study of the three aforementioned stages of stratified (anelastic) convection. The description
of stratified convection requires extreme care, since many aspects have to be considered simultaneously
for full consistency. Detailed and systematic explanations are therefore provided. This book
is meant as a textbook for courses on hydrodynamics and convective flows, for the use of lecturers
and students, however, it may also be of use for the entire scientific community as a practical reference.

The conceptual picture underlying resolvent analysis(RA) is that the nonlinear term in the Navier-Stokes(NS)
equations provides an intrinsic forcing to the linear dynamics, a description inspired by control
theory. The inverse of the linear operator, defined as the resolvent, is interpreted as a transfer
function between the forcing and the velocity response. This inversion obscures the physical interpretation
of the governing equations and is prohibitive to analytical manipulation, and for large systems
leads to significant computational cost and memory requirements. In this work we suggest an alternative,
inverse free, definition of the resolvent basis based on an extension of the Courant-Fischer-Weyl
min-max principle in which resolvent modes are defined as stationary points of a constrained variational
problem. This leads to a straightforward approach to approximate the resolvent (response) modes
of complex flows as expansions in any basis. The proposed method avoids matrix inversions and requires
only the spectral decomposition of a matrix of significantly reduced size as compared to the original
system. To illustrate this method and the advantages of the variational formulation we present
three examples. First, we consider streamwise constant fluctuations in turbulent channel flow
where an asymptotic analysis allows us to derive closed form expressions for the optimal resolvent
modes. Second, to illustrate the cost saving potential, and investigate the limits, of the proposed
method we apply our method to both a 2-dimensional, 3-component equilibrium solution in Couette
flow and, finally, to a streamwise developing turbulent boundary layer. For these larger systems
we achieve a model reduction of up to two orders of magnitude. Such savings have the potential to open
RA to the investigation of larger domains and more complex flow configurations.

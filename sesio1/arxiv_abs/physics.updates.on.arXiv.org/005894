Mass spectrometry of intact nanoparticles and viruses can serve as a potent characterization tool
for material science and biophysics. Inaccessible by widespread commercial techniques, the mass
of single nanoparticles and viruses (>10MDa) can be readily measured by NEMS (Nanoelectromechanical
Systems) based Mass Spectrometry, where charged and isolated analyte particles are generated
by Electrospray Ionization (ESI) in air and transported onto the NEMS resonator for capture and
detection. However, the applicability of NEMS as a practical solution is hindered by their miniscule
surface area, which results in poor limit-of-detection and low capture efficiency values. Another
hindrance is the necessity to house the NEMS inside complex vacuum systems, which is required in
part to focus analytes towards the miniscule detection surface of the NEMS. Here, we overcome both
limitations by integrating an ion lens onto the NEMS chip. The ion lens is composed of a polymer layer,
which charges up by receiving part of the ions incoming from the ESI tip and consequently starts to
focus the analytes towards an open window aligned with the active area of the NEMS electrostatically.
With this integrated system, we have detected the mass of gold and polystyrene nanoparticles under
ambient conditions and with two orders-of-magnitude improvement in capture efficiency compared
to the state-of-the-art. We then applied this technology to obtain the mass spectrum of SARS-CoV-2
and BoHV-1 virions. With the increase in analytical throughput, the simplicity of the overall setup
and the operation capability under ambient conditions, the technique demonstrates that NEMS Mass
Spectrometry can be deployed for mass detection of engineered nanoparticles and biological samples
efficiently.

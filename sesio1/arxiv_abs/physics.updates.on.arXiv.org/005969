CEvNS detectors could provide new opportunities in nuclear physics applications if they can improve
existing parameters such as neutrino detector size, portability, their sensitivity to a large
range of reactor antineutrino energies, and resources required for operation. Thus, modelling
the antineutrino spectrum is a crucial step to study the reactor antineutrino spectra and the CEvNS
detector response. The first objective of this paper is to study the importance of fission product
libraries in the construction of antineutrino spectrum using the summation method and with various
corrections. We have used ENDF/B-VIII and JEFF3.3 as our base data to model the spectrum. We have
also included the TAGS data (pandemonium free) when such data is available. The isomeric transitions
correction has the highest impact on the antineutrino spectra increasing the values 29% to 37% on
an average in the energy range of 0.5 MeV to 2 MeV. This correction also shows an increase of 4.71% to
7.13% in the range of 0 to 2 MeV, with improving isomeric transitions using the TAGS data. Next, the
spectra including the isomeric transition correction using the Gross Theory causes reduction
by 11.56 % to 69.46 % in the range of 6 to 8 MeV. The finite size, radiative, and weak magnetism corrections
cause no more than 3.27% difference between the corrected and uncorrected spectra. Our second objective
is to calculate pulse height distributions of Ge and Si based CEvNS sensors assuming a 20eV nuclear
recoil threshold. In our study, we have assumed a 100kg detector placed 10m away from the 1MW TRIGA
reactor. Our results show that the detector response with corrected spectra for a natural Ge and
Si detector are 44.25events/day and 7.99events/day. The biggest impact on the detector response
is due to the isomeric transition correction; with 37% difference between the corrected and uncorrected
detector response is observed.

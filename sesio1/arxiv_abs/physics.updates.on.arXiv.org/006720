The increasing relevance of energy storage technologies demands high-capacity cathode materials
for Li-ion batteries. Recently, Li-rich defect anti-fluorite Li$_5$FeO$_4$ has emerged as a high-capacity
cathode material exhibiting simultaneous anionic and cationic redox without significant oxygen
release. But suffers from irreversible structural change and capacity fade during cycling. Herein
we investigate the suppressed capacity fade reported in Co substituted Li$_5$FeO$_4$ and establish
the optimal performance through tuning the concentration and oxidation state of Co. We have substituted
Co at the Fe site and carried out a detailed analysis of structural, magnetic, electronic, and electrochemical
properties using first-principles density functional theory calculations. The extended stability
and suppressed capacity fading are found only in specific compositions depending on the Co/Li concentration
and the oxidation state of Co. The reasons behind suppressed capacity fading in Co substituted systems
have been unveiled on the basis of bonding analyses and proposed as a strategy to suppress the voltage
fading reported in Li-rich materials due to transition metal migration. From the evaluation of
thermodynamic stability and electronic structure, Li$_{5.5}$Fe$_{0.5}$Co$_{0.5}$O$_4$,
Li$_5$Fe$_{0.25}$Co$_{0.75}$O$_4$, and Li$_{4.5}$Fe$_{0.5}$Co$_{0.5}$O$_4$ are found to
exhibit better electrical conductivity than Li$_5$FeO$_4$. All these systems have voltage in
the range of 3 to 5 V and exhibit three dimensional Li diffusion pathway with a diffusion barrier height
of around 0.3 eV. From Li$_5$Fe$_{0.25}$Co$_{0.75}$O$_4$, one can delithiate three Li-ions without
structural change and oxygen release, therefore expected to acquire a reversible capacity of around
513 mAh/g. Moreover, as in pristine Li$_5$FeO$_4$, the selected Co substituted systems also exhibit
simultaneous anionic and cationic redox without significant O2 release.

Many real-world systems are often regarded as weakly coupled limit-cycle oscillators, in which
each oscillator corresponds to a dynamical system with many degrees of freedom that have collective
oscillations. One of the most practical methods for investigating the synchronization properties
of such a rhythmic system is to statistically extract phase coupling functions between limit-cycle
oscillators directly from observed time-series data. In Particular, using a method that combines
phase reduction theory and Bayesian inference, the phase coupling functions can be extracted from
the time-series data of even just one variable in each oscillatory dynamical system with many degrees
of freedom. However, it remains unclear how the choice of the observed variables affects the statistical
inference for the phase coupling functions. In this study, we examine the influence of observed
variable types on the extraction of phase coupling functions using some typical dynamical elements
under various conditions. We demonstrate that our method can consistently extract the macroscopic
phase coupling functions between two phases representing collective oscillations in a fully locked
state, regardless of the observed variable types; for example, even using one variable of any element
in one system and the mean-field value over all the elements in another system. We also study the case
of globally coupled phase oscillators in a partially locked state. Our results reveal directional
asymmetry in the robustness of extracting the macroscopic phase coupling function between two
networks. For instance, when an asynchronous oscillator in network $A$ and the macroscopic collective
oscillation of network $B$ is observed, the macroscopic phase coupling function from network $A$
to network $B$ can be extracted more robustly than in the opposite direction.

Most applications of Bayesian Inference for parameter estimation and model selection in astrophysics
involve the use of Monte Carlo techniques such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and nested sampling.
However, these techniques are time consuming and their convergence to the posterior could be difficult
to determine. In this work, we advocate Variational inference as an alternative to solve the above
problems, and demonstrate its usefulness for parameter estimation and model selection in Astrophysics.
Variational inference converts the inference problem into an optimization problem by approximating
the posterior from a known family of distributions and using Kullback-Leibler divergence to characterize
the difference. It takes advantage of fast optimization techniques, which make it ideal to deal
with large datasets and makes it trivial to parallelize on a multicore platform. We also derive a
new approximate evidence estimation based on variational posterior, and importance sampling
technique called posterior weighted importance sampling for the calculation of evidence (PWISE),
which is useful to perform Bayesian model selection. As a proof of principle, we apply variational
inference to five different problems in astrophysics, where Monte Carlo techniques were previously
used. These include assessment of significance of annual modulation in the COSINE-100 dark matter
experiment, measuring exoplanet orbital parameters from radial velocity data, tests of periodicities
in measurements of Newton's constant $G$, assessing the significance of a turnover in the spectral
lag data of GRB 160625B and estimating the mass of a galaxy cluster using weak gravitational lensing.
We find that variational inference is much faster than MCMC and nested sampling techniques for most
of these problems while providing competitive results. All our analysis codes have been made publicly
available.

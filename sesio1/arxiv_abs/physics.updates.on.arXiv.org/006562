It has been postulated that the delivery of radiotherapy at ultra-high dose rates ("FLASH") reduces
normal tissue toxicities by depleting them of oxygen. The fraction of normal tissue and cancer cells
surviving radiotherapy depends on dose and oxygen levels in an exponential manner and even a very
small fraction of tissue at low oxygen levels can determine radiotherapy response. The effect of
FLASH on radiation-induced normal and tumour tissue cell killing was studied by simulating oxygen
diffusion, metabolism, and radiolytic oxygen depletion over domains with simulated capillary
architectures. Two architectural models were used: 1.) randomly distributed capillaries and
2.) capillaries forming a regular square lattice array. The resulting oxygen partial pressure
distribution histograms were used to simulate normal and tumour tissue cell survival using the
linear quadratic model of cell survival, modified to incorporate oxygen-enhancement ratio (OER)
effects. Tumour cell survival was found to be increased by FLASH as compared to conventional radiotherapy,
with a 0-1 order of magnitude increase for expected levels of tumour hypoxia, depending on the relative
magnitudes of radiolytic oxygen depletion and tissue oxygen metabolism. Interestingly, for the
random capillary model, the impact of FLASH on well-oxygenated (normal) tissues was found to be
much greater, with an estimated increase in cell survival by up to 10 orders of magnitude, even though
reductions in mean tissue partial pressure were modest, less than 7 mmHg for the parameter values
studied. The presence of very small nearly hypoxic regions in otherwise well-perfused normal tissues
with high mean oxygen levels resulted in a greater proportional sparing of normal tissue than tumour
cells during FLASH irradiation, possibly explaining empirical normal tissue sparing and iso-tumour
control results.

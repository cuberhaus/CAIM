Concepts of the entropy variation sphere and variational (gravitational) potential on this sphere
are introduced to conclude that the variation of entropy formula near a holographic screen (Verlinde)
is equivalent to the variation of entropy formula on an equipotential sur-face (Hossenfelder),
and thus that all holographic screens and equipotential surfaces are equivalents and are necessarily
spherical. Variation of entropy on a holographic sphere ex-pressed in terms of its informational
capacity introduces the concept of binary potential in units of $0$ and $-c^2$, which shows that
the event horizon of a black hole, a limiting or fundamental holographic screen in thermodynamic
equilibrium having just one spherical side, is a non-compressible binary message maximizing Shannon
entropy and attaining the Landauer erasure limit. The concept of inertial potential is introduced
and shown to be equivalent to the variational potential, so that any inertial acceleration introduces
a non-equilibrium thermodynamic condition. The concept of complementary time period is introduced
and related with classical time period through Wick rotation to introduce the notions of unobservable
velocity and acceleration, respectively, perpendicular and tangential to the holographic sphere,
and bounded with observable velocity and acceleration, respectively, tangential and perpendicular
to this sphere, via Pythagorean relations. Certain dynamics scenarios between two masses are discussed.
The concept of black hole informationless emission as complementary to informationless Bekenstein
absorption is introduced and extended to arbitrary wavelengths. Bose-Einstein, Maxwell-Boltzmann,
and Fermi-Dirac statistics with degeneracy interpreted as the number of Planck areas on a black
hole event horizon are discussed.

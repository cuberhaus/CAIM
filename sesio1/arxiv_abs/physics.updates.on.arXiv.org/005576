Turbulence has been recognized as a factor of paramount importance for the survival or extinction
of sinking phytoplankton species. However, dealing with its multiscale nature in models of coupled
fluid and biological dynamics is a formidable challenge. Advection by coherent structures, as
those related to winter convection and Langmuir circulation, is also recognized to play a role in
the survival and localization of phytoplankton. In this work we revisit a theoretically appealing
model for phytoplankton vertical dynamics, and numerically investigate how large-scale fluid
motions affect the survival conditions and the spatial distribution of the biological population.
For this purpose, and to work with realistic parameter values, we adopt a kinematic flow field to
account for the different spatial and temporal scales of turbulent motions. The dynamics of the
population density are described by an advection-reaction-diffusion model with a spatially heterogeneous
growth term proportional to sunlight availability. We explore the role of fluid transport by progressively
increasing the complexity of the flow in terms of spatial and temporal scales. We find that, due to
the large-scale circulation, phytoplankton accumulates in downwelling regions and its growth
is reduced, confirming previous indications in slightly different conditions. We then explain
the observed phenomenology in terms of a plankton filament model. Moreover, by contrasting the
results in our different flow cases, we show that the large-scale coherent structures have an overwhelming
importance. Indeed, we find that smaller-scale motions only quite weakly affect the dynamics,
without altering the general mechanism identified. Such results are relevant for parameterizations
in numerical models of phytoplankton life cycles in realistic oceanic flow conditions.

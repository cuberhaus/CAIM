The mechanical performance of reinforced composites is strongly influenced at different scales
by the stress transferred at the matrix-fibre interfaces and at any surface where material discontinuity
occurs. In particular, the mechanical response of elastomeric composites where the reinforcement
is composed by cords with helically wound fibres is heavily compromised by fatigue and delamination
phenomena occurring at cord-rubber as well as at the ply interfaces, since rubber and polymeric
matrices are mainly vulnerable to the accumulation of deviatoric energy due to the shear stresses
transferred across the surfaces. Despite the large diffusion of composites in a vast field of applications
and the mature knowledge of their behaviour, some key mechanical aspects underlying failure mechanisms
are still partially unclear. For example, stress amplification and strain localization are often
difficult to predict by means of analytical solutions and averaging techniques that usually conceal
stress gradients. In this work, we analyse coupling between torsional and tensile loads in twisted
cords, which are adopted in many cases to reinforce composites and rubbers in tire applications.
We provide a model characterized by an enriched cord-matrix mechanical interplay able to theoretically
explain and predict actual stress distributions responsible for the onset of delamination and
fatigue-guided phenomena that are experimentally observed in these composites. In particular,
we demonstrate that the assumption of a monoclinic/trigonal behaviour for the mechanical response
of the hierarchical strands allows to estimate, by means of analytical formulas and a homogenization
approach, hitherto neglected shear stresses at the matrix-reinforcement interface. These stresses
are transferred to the neighbouring regions, leading to post-elastic behaviour and failure events.

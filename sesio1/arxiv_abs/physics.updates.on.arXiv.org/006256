We have developed multi-orbital tight-binding (MOTB) Hamiltonian models to describe the electronic
characteristics of intermetallic compounds Mg2Si, Mg2Ge, Mg2Sn, and Mg2Pb subject to strain.
We have incorporated spin-orbital mediated interactions and calibrated the MOTB models to the
band structures of density functional theory (DFT) by a massively parallelized multi-dimensional
Monte-Carlo search algorithm. The results show that a five-band tight-binding (TB) model reproduces
the key aspects of the band structures in the entire Brillouin zone. The five-band TB model reveals
that the compressive strain localizes the contribution of the 3s orbital of Mg to the conduction
bands and the outer shell p orbitals of X to the valence bands. The tensile strain, in contrast, has
a reversed effect and weakens the contribution of the 3s orbital of Mg and the outer shell p orbitals
of X to the conduction bands and valence bands, respectively. We have found that the $\pi$ bonding
in the Mg2X compounds is negligible compared to the $\sigma$ bondings, follow the hierarchy $|\sigma_{sp}|>|\sigma_{pp}|>|\sigma_{ss}|$,
and the largest variation against strain belongs to $\sigma_{pp}$. Moreover, the five-band TB
model allowed for estimating the strength of SOC in Mg2X and obtaining its functionality with respect
to the atomic number of X and strain. Additionally, the calculations find significant band gap tuning
and band splitting due to strain. It is shown that a compressive strain of -10% can open a band gap at
the $\Gamma$ point in metallic MgPb whereas a tensile strain of +10% closes the semiconducting band
gap of Mg_2Si. Also, +5% of tensile strain can remove the three-fold degeneracy of valence bands
at the $\Gamma$ point in semiconducting Mg2Ge. Our results and model approach can be useful in designing
devices made of Mg2X more accurately.

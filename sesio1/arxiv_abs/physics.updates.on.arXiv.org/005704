Time-lapse electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) is a popular geophysical method to estimate
three-dimensional (3D) permeability fields from electrical potential difference measurements.
Traditional inversion and data assimilation methods are used to ingest this ERT data into hydrogeophysical
models to estimate permeability. Due to ill-posedness and the curse of dimensionality, existing
inversion strategies provide poor estimates and low resolution of the 3D permeability field. Recent
advances in deep learning provide us with powerful algorithms to overcome this challenge. This
paper presents a deep learning (DL) framework to estimate the 3D subsurface permeability from time-lapse
ERT data. To test the feasibility of the proposed framework, we train DL-enabled inverse models
on simulation data. Subsurface process models based on hydrogeophysics are used to generate this
synthetic data for deep learning analyses. Results show that proposed weak supervised learning
can capture salient spatial features in the 3D permeability field. Quantitatively, the average
mean squared error (in terms of the natural log) on the strongly labeled training, validation, and
test datasets is less than 0.5. The R2-score (global metric) is greater than 0.75, and the percent
error in each cell (local metric) is less than 10%. Finally, an added benefit in terms of computational
cost is that the proposed DL-based inverse model is at least O(104) times faster than running a forward
model. Note that traditional inversion may require multiple forward model simulations (e.g.,
in the order of 10 to 1000), which are very expensive. This computational savings (O(105) - O(107))
makes the proposed DL-based inverse model attractive for subsurface imaging and real-time ERT
monitoring applications due to fast and yet reasonably accurate estimations of the permeability
field.

This work numerically investigates the role of viscosity and resistivity on Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities
in magnetized high-energy-density (HED) plasmas for a high Atwood number and high plasma beta regimes
surveying across plasma beta and magnetic Prandtl numbers. The numerical simulations are performed
using the visco-resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations. Results presented here show
that the inclusion of self-consistent viscosity and resistivity in the system drastically changes
the growth of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) as well as modifies its internal structure
at smaller scales. It is seen here that the viscosity has a stabilizing effect on the RTI. Moreover,
the viscosity inhibits the development of small scale structures and also modifies the morphology
of the tip of the RTI spikes. On the other hand, the resistivity reduces the magnetic field stabilization
supporting the development of small scale structures. The morphology of the RTI spikes is seen to
be unaffected by the presence of resistivity in the system. An additional novelty of this work is
in the disparate viscosity and resistivity profiles that may exist in HED plasmas and their impact
on RTI growth, morphology, and the resulting turbulence spectra. Furthermore, this work shows
that the dynamics of the magnetic field is independent of viscosity and likewise the resistivity
does not affect the dissipation of enstrophy and kinetic energy. In addition, power-law scalings
of enstrophy, kinetic energy, and magnetic field energy are provided in both injection range and
inertial sub-range which could be useful for understanding RTI induced turbulent mixing in HED
laboratory and astrophysical plasmas and could aid in the interpretation of observations of RTI-induced
turbulence spectra.

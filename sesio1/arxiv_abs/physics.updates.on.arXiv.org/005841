Objectives Studies that assess magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) induced radiofrequency (RF)
heating of the tissue in the presence of an active electronic implant are mostly performed in horizontal,
closed-bore scanners. Vertical, open-bore MRI systems have a 90{\deg} rotated magnet and generate
a fundamentally different RF field distribution in the body, yet little is known about the RF heating
of deep brain stimulation (DBS) systems in this class of scanners. Here, we investigated whether
RF heating of DBS devices was significantly different in a vertical, open-bore MRI scanner compared
to a horizontal, closed-bore MRI scanner. Materials and Methods In this phantom study, RF heating
around the lead of a commercial DBS system implanted in an anthropomorphic phantom was evaluated
in a 1.2 T vertical open-bore scanner (Oasis, Fujifilm Healthcare) and a 1.5 T horizontal closed-bore
scanner (Aera, Siemens Healthineers). DBS devices were implanted following 30 realistic lead
trajectories. Electromagnetic simulations were performed to assess the specific absorption
rate (SAR) of RF energy around leads with different internal structures. Results When controlling
for B1+rms, temperature increase around the lead-tip was significantly lower at the vertical scanner
compared to the horizontal scanner (p-value=9.1x10-7). Electromagnetic simulations demonstrated
up to a 14-fold reduction in the maximum 0.1g-averaged SAR deposited in the tissue surrounding the
lead-tip in a vertical scanner compared to a horizontal scanner for leads with straight and helical
internal wires. Conclusions RF experiments and electromagnetic simulations demonstrated consistently
lower RF heating and power deposition around the DBS lead-tip at the vertical scanner compared to
the horizontal scanner. Our simulation results suggest that this trend in heating may potentially
extend to leads from other manufacturers.

We show that in free surface flows, a uniform, streamwise current over small-amplitude rippled
bottom topography generates cross-stream drift velocity. This Lagrangian drift, referred to
as the current-bathymetry interaction induced drift (CBIID), is specifically understood in the
context of a simplified nearshore environment, consisting of uniform alongshore current, onshore
propagating surface waves, and monochromatic rippled bathymetry making an oblique angle with
the shoreline. CBIID is found to originate from the steady, non-homogeneous solution of the governing
system of equations. Similar to Stokes drift induced by surface waves, CBIID can also have important
implications in cross-shelf tracer transport. CBIID increases with particle's depth, bottom
ripple's wavelength and amplitude, and the magnitude of the alongshore current. Moreover, maximum
cross-shelf transport by CBIID is obtained when the bottom ripple wave-vector approximately makes
$\pi/4$ angle with the shoreline. Depending on the angle between the alongshore current and the
bottom ripple wave-vector, CBIID can lead to onshoreward or offshoreward tracer transport. Unlike
Stokes drift, particle excursions due to current-bathymetry interactions might not be small,
hence analytical expressions based on small-excursion approximation could be inaccurate. We
provide an alternative $z$-bounded approximation, which provides highly accurate expressions
of drift velocity and time period for particles near the free surface. Realistic parametric analysis
reveals that in situations where the Stokes drift and CBIID velocities have comparable magnitudes,
they are order separated both in length and time scales. We infer that high-resolution coastal bathymetry
maps are crucial for accurate predictions of tracer transport pathways in the nearshore environment.

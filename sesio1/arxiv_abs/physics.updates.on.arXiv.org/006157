Metalenses are ultrathin optical devices designed to replicate behavior of conventional refractive
lenses, or lens arrays, utilizing nanoscale resonant structures to redirect incident light. These
are often comprised of discrete meta-atoms such as nanoscale dielectric pillars. Achromatic focusing
- associated with traditional multi-element refractive counterparts - is frequently attempted
with single-layer metalens designs, which has proven difficult to achieve with bounded refractive
indices and total lens thickness. A recent study (F.Presutti and F.Monticone, 2020) formalized
this, applying optical delay-line limitations to metalenses, resulting in a generalized trade-off
in achromaticity for focusing systems. In this work, we (1) theoretically explore achromaticity
in metalens design, and (2) propose a thin-film multilayer design as an alternative to the discrete
meta-atom approach for large numerical aperture (NA) achromatic metalenses. It is shown that wavefront
modulation can also be achieved with spectrally-varying transmission magnitudes, rather than
purely matching a phase profile. In fact, even with a bounded refractive index, perfect achromatic
operation over a given spectral range can be offset by imperfect operation elsewhere, resulting
in a NA limited by the smallest general spectral feature controlled. These considerations lead
to a generalized phase-matching optimization routine, and a thin-film metalens is simulated,
utilizing layered TiO2/MgF2 with total thicknesses under 1 {\mu}m (20 layers), focusing across
6 simultaneous wavelengths (350-740 nm, {\Delta}{\lambda}~65 nm). A significant proportion
(>40% spectral average) of the reflected light is focused for moderate NA (~0.35). With the maturity
of the optical coating industry, the conformal thin-film approach reduces manufacturing complexity
from its discrete nanoscale meta-atom equivalents.

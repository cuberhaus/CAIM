Convective dissolution is the process by which CO$_2$ injected in deep geological formations dissolves
into the aqueous phase, which allows storing it perennially by gravity. The process results from
buoyancy-coupled Darcy flow and solute transport. Proper theoretical modeling of the process
should consider in the transport equation a diffusive term accounting for hydrodynamics (or, mechanical)
dispersion, with an effective diffusion coefficient that is proportional to the local interstitial
velocity. A few two-dimensional (2D) numerical studies, and three-dimensional (3D) experimental
investigations, have investigated the impact of hydrodynamic dispersion on convection dynamics,
with contradictory conclusions. Here, we investigate systematically the impact of the dispersion
strength $S$ (relative to molecular diffusion), and of the anisotropy $\alpha$ of its tensor, on
convective dissolution in 2D and 3D geometries. We use a new numerical model and analyze the solute
fingers' number density (FND), penetration depth and maximum velocity; the onset time of convection;
the dissolution flux in the quasi-constant flux regime; the mean concentration of the dissolved
CO2; and the scalar dissipation rate. The efficiency of convective dissolution over long times
is observed to be mostly controlled by the onset time of convection. For most natural porous media
($\alpha = 0.1$), the onset time is found to increase as a function of $S$, in agreement with previous
experimental findings and in stark contrast to previous numerical findings. However, if $\alpha$
is sufficiently large this behavior is reversed. Furthermore, results in 3D are fully consistent
with the 2D results on all accounts, except that in 3D the onset time is slightly smaller, the dissolution
flux in the quasi-constant flux regime is slightly larger, and the dependence of the FND on the dispersion
parameters is impacted by $Ra$.

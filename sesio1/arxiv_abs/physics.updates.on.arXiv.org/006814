Over the years, population-level tobacco control policies have considerably reduced smoking
prevalence worldwide. However, the rate of decline of smoking prevalence is slowing down. Therefore,
there is a need for models that capture the full complexity of the smoking epidemic. These models
can then be used as test-beds to develop new policies to limit the spread of smoking. Current models
of smoking dynamics mainly use ordinary differential equation (ODE) models, where studying the
effect of an individual's contact network is challenging. They also do not consider all the interactions
between individuals that can lead to changes in smoking behaviour, implying that they do not consider
valuable information on the spread of smoking behaviour. In this context, we develop an agent-based
model (ABM), calibrate and then validate it on historical trends observed in the US and UK. Our ABM
considers spontaneous terms, interactions between agents, and the agent's contact network. To
explore the effect of the underlying network on smoking dynamics, we test the ABM on six different
networks, both synthetic and real-world. In addition, we also compare the ABM with an ODE model.
Our results suggest that the dynamics from the ODE model are similar to the ABM only when the network
structure is fully connected (FC). The FC network performs poorly in replicating the empirical
trends in the data, while the real-world network best replicates it amongst the six networks. Further,
when information on the real-world network is unavailable, our ABM on Lancichinetti-Fortunato-Radicchi
benchmark networks (or networks with a similar average degree as the real-world network) can be
used to model smoking behaviour. These results suggest that networks are essential for modelling
smoking behaviour and that our ABM can be used to develop network-based intervention strategies
and policies for tobacco control.

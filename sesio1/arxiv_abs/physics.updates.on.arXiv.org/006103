A consistent averaging technique, using the weighted residual integral boundary layer (WRIBL)
method, is presented for flow through a thin-gap geometry wherein the fluid's viscosity varies
across the gap. In such situations, the flow has a non-parabolic cross-gap velocity profile -- an
effect that is ignored by Darcy models conventionally used for such Hele-Shaw flows. The WRIBL technique
systematically accounts for the cross-gap variation of viscosity and yields reduced-order equations
for the gap-averaged fluid flow rate. As a test case, we consider a fluid with a temperature-dependent
viscosity and analyse the previously-studied problem of thermoviscous fingering: a hot fluid
flowing through a Hele-Shaw geometry with cold walls spontaneously forms channels of low-viscosity,
hot fluid, separated by regions of high-viscosity, cold fluid. The temperature of the cold walls
is assumed either to be constant, a scenario that mimics the upward flow of magma through fissures
in the Earth's crust, or to vary linearly along the direction of flow. In both cases, the predictions
of the WRIBL model, regarding the multiplicity of uniform steady flow states and their linear stability,
are compared with that of the hitherto used, ad hoc, Darcy model (Helfrich, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 305,
1995, pp. 219-238), as well as with calculations of the full three-dimensional governing equations
(Wylie and Lister, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 305, 1995, pp. 239-261). Though the results are qualitatively
similar, the WRIBL model is found to be much more accurate than the Darcy model. The averaging method
is presented in a general manner to facilitate its application to other physical situations where,
for example, the viscosity depends on solute/particle concentration in a solution/suspension.

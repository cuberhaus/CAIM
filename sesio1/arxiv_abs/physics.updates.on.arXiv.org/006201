Novel radiotherapy techniques like synchrotron X-ray microbeam radiation therapy (MRT), require
fast dose distribution predictions that are accurate at the sub-mm level, especially close to tissue/bone/air
interfaces. Monte Carlo physics simulations are recognised to be one of the most accurate tools
to predict the dose delivered in a target tissue but can be very time consuming and therefore prohibitive
for treatment planning. Faster dose prediction algorithms are usually developed for clinically
deployed treatments only. In this work, we explore a new approach for fast and accurate dose estimations
suitable for novel treatments using digital phantoms used in pre-clinical development and modern
machine learning techniques. We develop a generative adversarial network (GAN) model, which is
able to emulate the equivalent Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation with adequate accuracy, and use it
to predict the radiation dose delivered by a broad synchrotron beam to various phantoms. The energy
depositions used for the training of the GAN are obtained using full Geant4 Monte Carlo simulations
of a synchrotron radiation broad beam passing through the phantoms. The energy deposition is scored
and predicted in voxel matrices of size 140x18x18 with a voxel edge length of 1 mm. The GAN model consists
of two competing 3D convolutional neural networks, which are conditioned on the photon beam and
phantom properties. The energy deposition predictions inside all phantom geometries under investigation
show deviations of less than 3% of the maximum deposited energy from the simulation for roughly 99%
of the voxels in the field of the beam. The computing time for a single prediction is reduced from several
hundred hours using Geant4 simulation to less than a second using the GAN model.

The Poisson equation is critical to get a self-consistent solution in plasma fluid simulations
used for Hall effect thrusters and streamer discharges, since the Poisson solution appears as a
source term of the unsteady nonlinear flow equations. As a first step, solving the 2D Poisson equation
with zero Dirichlet boundary conditions using a deep neural network is investigated using multiple-scale
architectures, defined in terms of number of branches, depth and receptive field. One key objective
is to better understand how neural networks learn the Poisson solutions and provide guidelines
to achieve optimal network configurations, especially when coupled to the time-varying Euler
equations with plasma source terms. Here, the Receptive Field is found critical to correctly capture
large topological structures of the field. The investigation of multiple architectures, losses,
and hyperparameters provides an optimal network to solve accurately the steady Poisson problem.
The performance of the optimal neural network solver, called PlasmaNet, is then monitored on meshes
with increasing number of nodes, and compared with classical parallel linear solvers. Next, PlasmaNet
is coupled with an unsteady Euler plasma fluid equations solver in the context of the electron plasma
oscillation test case. In this time-evolving problem, a physical loss is necessary to produce a
stable simulation. PlasmaNet is finally tested on a more complex case of discharge propagation
involving chemistry and advection. The guidelines established in previous sections are applied
to build the CNN to solve the same Poisson equation in cylindrical coordinates with different boundary
conditions. Results reveal good CNN predictions and pave the way to new computational strategies
using modern GPU-based hardware to predict unsteady problems involving a Poisson equation.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly utilized for image-guided radiotherapy due
to its outstanding soft-tissue contrast and lack of ionizing radiation. However, geometric distortions
caused by gradient nonlinearity (GNL) limit anatomical accuracy, potentially compromising the
quality of tumour treatments. In addition, slow MR acquisition and reconstruction limit the potential
for real-time image guidance. Here, we demonstrate a deep learning-based method that rapidly reconstructs
distortion-corrected images from raw k-space data for real-time MR-guided radiotherapy applications.
We leverage recent advances in interpretable unrolling networks to develop a Distortion-Corrected
Reconstruction Network (DCReconNet) that applies convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn
effective regularizations and nonuniform fast Fourier transforms for GNL-encoding. DCReconNet
was trained on a public MR brain dataset from eleven healthy volunteers for fully sampled and accelerated
techniques including parallel imaging (PI) and compressed sensing (CS). The performance of DCReconNet
was tested on phantom and volunteer brain data acquired on a 1.0T MRI-Linac. The DCReconNet, CS-
and PI-based reconstructed image quality was measured by structural similarity (SSIM) and root-mean-squared
error (RMSE) for numerical comparisons. The computation time for each method was also reported.
Phantom and volunteer results demonstrated that DCReconNet better preserves image structure
when compared to CS- and PI-based reconstruction methods. DCReconNet resulted in highest SSIM
(0.95 median value) and lowest RMSE (<0.04) on simulated brain images with four times acceleration.
DCReconNet is over 100-times faster than iterative, regularized reconstruction methods. DCReconNet
provides fast and geometrically accurate image reconstruction and has potential for real-time
MRI-guided radiotherapy applications.

There are compelling reasons to seek a new coherent description of the Quantum Hall Effects (QHE).
The theories of the `Integer' (IQHE) and the `Fractional' (FQHE) quantum Hall effects are very different
at present, despite their remarkable phenomenological similarity. The fractional effect invokes
multi-particle dynamics and collective phenomena in the presence of a dominant Coulomb interaction,
in a complex hierarchical scheme, whereas the integer effect is a simpler single-particle scenario.
The experimental situation, in contrast, shows that both the effects appear seamlessly, intermingling,
as either the magnetic field or the carrier density is varied. I prove that a crucial physics input
that is missing in the current theories is the relativistic gravity of the matter-energy in the Universe.
The dynamically induced relativistic gravitational potential play a startling role to modify
the quantum degeneracy, by coupling to the mass of electrons. The key point is that the quantum degeneracy
of Landau levels is modified by the relativistic cosmic gravitomagnetic field, thereby making
the degeneracy dependent on the number density of the electrons. I successfully derive the main
characteristics and the full sequence of both IQHE and FHQE in a seamless unified single-particle
scenario, without any quasiparticles, particle-flux composites, or extraneous postulates.
Apart from correctly reproducing all the observed filling factors of the QHE for the $\nu\geq1/3$,
this new unified theory has the natural explanation for the absence of the QHE at even fractions for
$\nu<1$. Further, there is a consistent description of the edge state charge transport and thermal
transport, in the FQHE states. The gravitational paradigm shows clearly the physical reason for
the phenomenological success of the effective theories with the quasiparticles.

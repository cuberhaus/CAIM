This work continues the parametric investigation on the sampling nuances of the Dynamic Mode Decomposition
(DMD) under the Koopman analysis. Through turbulent wakes, the investigation corroborated the
generality of the universal convergence states for all DMD implementations. It discovered the
implications of sampling range and resolution -- the determinants of the spectral discretisation
by discrete frequency bins and the highest resolved frequency, respectively. The work reaffirmed
the necessity of the Convergence state for sampling independence, too. Results also suggested
that the observables derived from the same flow may contain dynamically distinct information,
thus altering the DMD output. The static pressure and vortex identification criteria are optimal
variables for characterising structural response and fluid excitation. The pressure, velocity
magnitude, and turbulence kinetic energy fields also suffice for general applications, but the
Reynolds stresses and velocity components shall be avoided. Mean-subtraction is recommended
for best approximations of the Koopman eigen tuples. Furthermore, the parametric investigation
on truncation discovered some low-energy states that dictate a system's temporal integrity. The
best practice for order reduction is to avoid truncation and employ dominant mode selection on a
full-state subspace, though large-degree truncation supports fair data reconstruction with
low computational cost. Finally, this work demonstrated the synthetic noise resulting from pre-decomposition
interpolation. In unavoidable interpolations to increase the spatial dimension n, high-order
schemes are recommended for better retention of the original dynamics. Finally, the observations
herein, derived from inhomogeneous anisotropic turbulence, offer constructive references for
DMD on fluid systems, if not also others beyond fluid mechanics.

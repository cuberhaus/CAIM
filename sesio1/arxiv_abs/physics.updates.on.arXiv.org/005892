During the era of global warming and highly urbanized development, extreme and high impact weather
as well as air pollution incidents influence everyday life and might even cause the incalculable
loss of life and property. Although with the vast development of numerical simulation of atmosphere,
there still exists substantial forecast biases objectively. To predict extreme weather, severe
air pollution, and abrupt climate change accurately, the numerical atmospheric model requires
not only to simulate meteorology and atmospheric compositions and their impacts simultaneously
involving many sophisticated physical and chemical processes but also at high spatiotemporal
resolution. Global atmospheric simulation of meteorology and atmospheric compositions simultaneously
at spatial resolutions of a few kilometers remains challenging due to its intensive computational
and input/output (I/O) requirement. Through multi-dimension-parallelism structuring, aggressive
and finer-grained optimizing, manual vectorizing, and parallelized I/O fragmenting, an integrated
Atmospheric Model Across Scales (iAMAS) was established on the new Sunway supercomputer platform
to significantly increase the computational efficiency and reduce the I/O cost. The global 3-km
atmospheric simulation for meteorology with online integrated aerosol feedbacks with iAMAS was
scaled to 39,000,000 processor cores and achieved the speed of 0.82 simulation day per hour (SDPH)
with routine I/O, which enables us to perform 5-day global weather forecast at 3-km horizontal resolution
with online natural aerosol impacts. The results demonstrate the promising future that the increasing
of spatial resolution to a few kilometers with online integrated aerosol impacts may significantly
improve the global weather forecast.

We investigate how a combination of a nonmagnetic-impurity scattering rate $\gamma$ and finite
subgap states parametrized by Dynes $\Gamma$ affects various physical quantities relevant to
to superconducting devices: kinetic inductance $L_k$, complex conductivity $\sigma$, surface
resistance $R_s$, quality factor $Q$, and depairing current density $J_d$. All the calculations
are based on the Eilenberger formalism of the BCS theory. We assume the device materials are extreme
type-II $s$-wave superconductors. It is well known that the optimum impurity concentration ($\gamma/\Delta_0
\sim 1$) minimizes $R_s$. Here, $\Delta_0$ is the pair potential for the idealized ($\Gamma\to
0$) superconductor for the temperature $T\to 0$. We find the optimum $\Gamma$ can also reduce $R_s$
by one order of magnitude for a clean superconductor ($\gamma/\Delta_0 < 1$) and a few tens $\%$ for
a dirty superconductor ($\gamma/\Delta_0 > 1$). Also, we find a nearly-ideal ($\Gamma/\Delta_0
\ll 1$) clean-limit superconductor exhibits a frequency-independent $R_s$ for a broad range of
frequency $\omega$, which can significantly improve $Q$ of a very compact cavity with a few tens
of GHz frequency. As $\Gamma$ or $\gamma$ increases, the plateau disappears, and $R_s$ obeys the
$\omega^2$ dependence. The subgap-state-induced residual surface resistance $R_{\rm res}$
is also studied, which can be detected by an SRF-grade high-$Q$ 3D resonator. We calculate $L_k(\gamma,
\Gamma,T)$ and $J_d(\gamma, \Gamma,T)$, which are monotonic increasing and decreasing functions
of $(\gamma, \Gamma,T)$, respectively. Measurements of $(\gamma, \Gamma)$ of device materials
can give helpful information on engineering $(\gamma, \Gamma)$ via materials processing, by which
it would be possible to improve $Q$, engineer $L_k$, and ameliorate $J_d$.

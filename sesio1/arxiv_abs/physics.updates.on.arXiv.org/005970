In this work we investigate the behaviour of a human crowd in a cross-flow. We first analyse the results
of a set of controlled experiments in which subjects were divided into two groups, in such a way to
explore different density settings, and asked to walk through the crossing area. We study the results
of the experiment by analysing, along with traditional indicators such as density and velocity,
also walking and body orientation, studying how these microscopic observables are influenced
by density. Furthermore, we report a preliminary but quantitative analysis on the emergence of
self-organising stripes in the crossing area, a phenomenon that had been previously qualitatively
reported and reproduced in models, but whose quantitative analysis is a novel contribution. We
also try to reproduce the empirical results using a hierarchy of models, which differ in the details
of the body shape (using a disk-shaped body vs a more realistic elliptical shape) and in how collision
avoiding is performed (using only information regarding "centre of mass" distance and velocity,
or actually introducing body shape information). We verified that the most detailed model (i.e.,
using body shape information and an elliptical body) outperforms in a significant way the simplest
one (using only centre of mass distance and velocity, and disk-shaped bodies). Furthermore, we
observed that if elliptical bodies are introduced without using such information in collision
avoidance, the performance of the model is relatively poor. Nevertheless, the difference between
the different models is relevant only in describing the "tails" of the observable distributions,
suggesting that the more complex models could be of practical use only for describing high density
settings. We also verified that "stripe formation" emerges in all models.

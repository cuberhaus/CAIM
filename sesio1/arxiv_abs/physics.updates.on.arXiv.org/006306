The Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) is a multi-TeV high-luminosity linear e$^+$e$^-$-collider
under development by the CLIC accelerator collaboration, hosted by CERN. The CLIC accelerator
has been optimised for three energy stages at centre-of-mass energies 380 GeV, 1.5 TeV and 3 TeV.
CLIC uses a novel two-beam acceleration technique, with normal-conducting accelerating structures
operating in the range of 70-100 MV/m. The report describes recent achievements in accelerator
design, technology development, system tests and beam tests. Large-scale CLIC-specific beam
tests have taken place, for example, at the CLIC Test Facility CTF3 at CERN, at the Accelerator Test
Facility ATF2 at KEK, at the FACET facility at SLAC and at the FERMI facility in Trieste. Together,
they demonstrate that all implications of the CLIC design parameters are well understood and reproducible
in beam tests and prove that the CLIC performance goals are realistic. The implementation of CLIC
near CERN has been investigated. Focusing on a staged approach starting at 380 GeV, this includes
civil engineering aspects, electrical networks, cooling and ventilation and installation scheduling,
transport. All CLIC studies have put emphasis on optimising cost and energy efficiency, and the
resulting power and cost estimates are reported. The report follows very closely the accelerator
project description in the CLIC Summary Report for the European Particle Physics Strategy update
2018-19. Detailed studies of the physics potential and detector for CLIC, and R&D on detector technologies,
have been carried out by the CLIC detector and physics (CLICdp) collaboration. CLIC provides excellent
sensitivity to Beyond Standard Model physics, through direct searches and via a broad set of precision
measurements of Standard Model processes, particularly in the Higgs and top-quark sectors.

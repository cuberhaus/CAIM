Most geophysical inverse problems are nonlinear and rely upon numerical forward solvers involving
discretization and simplified representations of the underlying physics. As a result, forward
modeling errors are inevitable. In practice, such model errors tend to be either completely ignored,
which leads to biased and over-confident inversion results, or only partly taken into account using
restrictive Gaussian assumptions. Here, we rely on deep generative neural networks to learn problem-specific
low-dimensional probabilistic representations of the discrepancy between high-fidelity and
low-fidelity forward solvers. These representations are then used to probabilistically invert
for the model error jointly with the target geophysical property field, using the computationally-cheap,
low-fidelity forward solver. To this end, we combine a Markov-chain-Monte-Carlo (MCMC) inversion
algorithm with a trained convolutional neural network of the spatial generative adversarial network
(SGAN) type, whereby at each MCMC step, the simulated low-fidelity forward response is corrected
using a proposed model-error realization. Considering the crosshole ground-penetrating radar
traveltime tomography inverse problem, we train SGAN networks on traveltime discrepancy images
between: (1) curved-ray (high fidelity) and straight-ray (low fidelity) forward solvers; and
(2) finite-difference-time-domain (high fidelity) and straight-ray (low fidelity) forward
solvers. We demonstrate that the SGAN is able to learn the spatial statistics of the model error and
that suitable representations of both the subsurface model and model error can be recovered by MCMC.
In comparison with inversion results obtained when model errors are either ignored or approximated
by a Gaussian distribution, we find that our method has lower posterior parameter bias and better
explains the observed traveltime data.[...]

This work discusses a protocol for constructing highly accurate potential energy curves (PECs)
for the lowest two states of Rb$_{2}^+$, i.e. $X\,{}^2{\Sigma}{_g^+}$ and $(1) {}^2\Sigma{_u^+}$,
using an additivity scheme based on coupled-cluster theory. The approach exploits the findings
of our previous work [J. Schnabel, L. Cheng and A. K\"ohn, J. Chem. Phys. 155, 124101 (2021)] to avoid
the unphysical repulsive long-range barrier occurring for symmetric molecular ions when perturbative
estimates of higher-order cluster operators are employed. Furthermore, care was taken to reproduce
the physically correct exchange splitting of the $X {}^2{\Sigma}{_g^+}$ and $(1) {}^2{\Sigma}{_u^+}$
PECs. The accuracy of our computational approach is benchmarked for ionization energies of Rb and
for spectroscopic constants as well as vibrational levels of the $a {}^3{\Sigma}{_u^+}$ triplet
state of Rb\textsubscript{2}. We study high-level correlation contributions, high-level relativistic
effects and inner-shell correlation contributions and find very good agreement with experimental
reference values for the atomic ionization potential and the binding energy of Rb$_{2}$ in the $a\,{}^3{\Sigma}{_u^+}$
triplet state. Our final best estimate for the binding energy of the Rb$_{2}^+$ $X {}^2{\Sigma}{_g^+}$
state including zero-point vibrational contributions is $D_0 = 6179\,\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ with
an estimated error bound of $\mathcal{O}(\pm 30\,\mathrm{cm}^{-1})$. This value is smaller than
the experimentally inferred lower bond of $D_0\ge 6307.5\,\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ [Bellos et al.,
Phys. Rev. A 87, 012508 (2013)] and will require further investigation. For the $(1) {}^2{\Sigma}{_u^+}$
state a shallow potential with $D_0 = 78.4\,\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and an error bound of $\pm 9\,\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$
is computed.

Monin-Obukhov similarity theory (MOST) is a well tested approach for specifying the fluxes when
the roughness surfaces are homogeneous. For flow over waves (inhomogeneous surfaces), phase-averaged
roughness length scales are often prescribed through models based on the wave characteristics
and the wind speed. However, such approaches lack generalizability over different wave ages and
steepnesses due to the reliance on model coefficients tuned to specific datasets. In this paper,
a sea surface-based hydrodynamic drag model applicable to moving surfaces is developed to model
the pressure-based surface drag felt by the wind due to the waves. The model is based on the surface
gradient approach of \textit{Anderson & Meneveau (2010)} applicable to stationary obstacles
and extended here to the wind-wave problem. The wave drag model proposed specifies the hydrodynamic
force based on the incoming momentum flux, peak wave phase speed, and the surface frontal area. The
drag coefficient associated with the wind-wave momentum exchange is determined based on the wave
steepness. The wave drag model is used to simulate turbulent airflow above a monochromatic wave
train with different wave ages and wave steepnesses. The mean velocity profiles and model form stresses
are validated with available lab-scale experimental data and show good agreement across a wide
range of wave steepnesses and wave ages. The drag force is correlated with the wave surface gradient,
and out-of-phase with the wave height distribution by a factor $\pi/2$ for the sinusoidal wave-train
considered. The computational savings are significant over phase-resolved models with the effect
of the waves on the mean velocity profiles well represented. These results demonstrate that the
current approach is sufficiently general over a wide parameter space compared to wave phase-averaged
models with a minimal increase in computational cost.

Many references exist in the density functional theory (DFT) literature to the chemical potential
of the electrons in an atom or a molecule. The origin of this notion has been the identification of
the Lagrange multiplier $\mu = \partial E/\partial N$ in the Euler-Lagrange variational equation
for the ground state density as the chemical potential of the electrons. We first discuss why the
Lagrange multiplier in this case is an arbitrary constant and therefore cannot be a physical characteristic
of an atom or molecule. The switching of the energy derivative ("chemical potential") from $-I$
to $-A$ when the electron number crosses the integer, called integer discontinuity or derivative
discontinuity, is not physical but only occurs when the nonphysical noninteger electron systems
and the corresponding energy and derivative $\partial E/\partial N$ are chosen in a specific discontinuous
way. The question is discussed whether in fact the thermodynamical concept of a chemical potential
can be defined for the electrons in such few-electron systems as atoms and molecules. The conclusion
is that such systems lack important characteristics of thermodynamic systems and do not afford
the definition of a chemical potential. They also cannot be considered as analogues of the open systems
of thermodynamics that can exchange particles with an environment (a particles bath or other members
of a Gibbsian ensemble). Thermodynamical (statistical mechanical) concepts like chemical potential,
open systems, grand canonical ensemble etc. are not applicable to a few electron system like an atom
or molecule. A number of topics in DFT are critically reviewed in the light of these findings: jumps
in the Kohn-Sham potential when crossing an integer number of electrons, the band gap problem, the
deviation-from-straight-lines error, the role of ensembles in DFT.

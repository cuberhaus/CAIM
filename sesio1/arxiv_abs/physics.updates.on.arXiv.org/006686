We present our approach to modeling over 20 years of the solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere system
using version 5 of the Grand Unified Magnetosphere-Ionosphere Coupling Simulation (GUMICS-5).
As input we use 16-s resolution magnetic field and 1-min plasma measurements by the Advanced Composition
Explorer (ACE) satellite from 1998 to 2020. The modeled interval is divided into 28 h simulations,
which include 4 h overlap. We use a maximum magnetospheric resolution of 0.5 Earth radii (Re) up to
about 15 Re from Earth and decreasing resolution further away. In the ionosphere we use a maximum
resolution of approximately 100 km poleward of +-58 degrees magnetic latitude and decreasing resolution
towards the equator. With respect to the previous version GUMICS-4, we have parallelized the magnetosphere
of GUMICS-5 using the Message Passing Interface and have made several improvements which have e.g.
decreased its numerical diffusion. We compare the simulation results to several empirical models
and geomagnetic indices derived from ground magnetic field measurements. GUMICS-5 reproduces
observed solar cycle trends in magnetopause stand-off distance and magnetospheric lobe field
strength but consistency in plasma sheet pressure and ionospheric cross-polar cap potential is
lower. Comparisons with geomagnetic indices show better results for Kp index than for AE index.
The simulation results are available at https://doi.org/10.23729/ca1da110-2d4e-45c4-8876-57210fbb0b0d,
consisting of full ionospheric files and size-optimized magnetospheric files. The data used for
Figures is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6641258. Our extensive results can
serve e.g. as a foundation for a combined physics-based and black-box approach to real-time prediction
of near-Earth space, or as input to other physics-based models of the inner magnetosphere, upper
and middle atmosphere, etc.

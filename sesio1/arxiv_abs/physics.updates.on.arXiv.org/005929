Porosity is an important property of pharmaceutical tablets since it may affect tablet disintegration,
dissolution, and bio-availability. It is, therefore, essential to establish non-destructive,
fast, and compact techniques to assess porosity, in-situ, during the manufacturing process. In
this paper, the terahertz frequency-domain (THz-FD) technique was explored as a fast, non-destructive,
and sensitive technique for porosity measurement of pharmaceutical tablets. We studied a sample
set of 69 tablets with different design factors, such as particle size of the active pharmaceutical
ingredient (API), Ibuprofen, particle size of the filler, Mannitol, API concentration, and compaction
force. The signal transmitted through each tablet was measured across the frequency range 500-750
GHz using a vector network analyzer combined with a quasi-optical set-up consisting of four off-axis
parabolic mirrors to guide and focus the beam. We first extracted the effective refractive index
of each tablet from the measured complex transmission coefficients and then translated it to porosity,
using an empirical linear relation between effective refractive index and tablet density. The
results show that the THz-FD technique was highly sensitive to the variations of the design factors,
showing that filler particle size and compaction force had a significant impact on the effective
refractive index of the tablets and, consequently, porosity. Moreover, the fragmentation behaviour
of particles was observed by THz porosity measurements and was verified with scanning electron
microscopy of the cross-section of tablets. In conclusion, the THz-FD technique, based on electronic
solutions, allows for fast, sensitive, and non-destructive porosity measurement that opens for
compact instrument systems capable of in-situ sensing in tablet manufacturing.

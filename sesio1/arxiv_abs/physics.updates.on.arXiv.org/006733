The stair phase coding patterns have been widely used to determine the fringe order for phase unwrapping
of the wrapped phase in 3D shape measurement. Although the special coding sequence algorithm can
achieve with a large number of codewords, it needs current codeword and its adjacent codewords to
jointly determine the fringe order. If any codeword of the grouped adjacent codewords is incorrectly
recognized, it will result in false fringe order.Therefore, it is challenging to significantly
increase the number of codewords. When it is necessary to simultaneously measure more than two isolated
objects with large size differences, if the fringe frequency is high, the number of fringes on the
smaller objects is too few to determine the fringe orders. On the other hand, if the fringe frequency
is low, the image can not contain all isolated objects at the same time. To solve this problem, we propose
an absolute phase measurement method based on bidirectional coding patterns. The wrapped phase
of the object is obtained by fou step phase shifting patterns, and the fringe orders is obtained by
two bidirectional coded patterns. When coding the bidirectional patterns, we code two groups of
stair phase with different frequency along horizontal direction, which respectively represent
local fringe order information and partition information, then, we alternately repeated the two
groups of stair phase along the vertical direction to obtain the bidirectional coding patterns
in the whole pattern. Each local fringe order information and the corresponding partition information
in small region jointly determine the fringe order of each position in the wrapped phase. To verify
the effectiveness of our method, we did simulations and three experiments. Simulation and experimental
results show that our method is effective for complex surfaces and isolated objects with different
sizes.

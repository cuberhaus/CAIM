In this study, methane detonation propagation in dilute coal particle suspensions is studied based
on Eulerian-Lagrangian method. Two-dimensional configuration is considered, and a skeletal
chemical mechanism (24 species and 104 reactions) is applied for methane combustion. The gas and
particulate phase equations are solved using an OpenFOAM code for two-phase compressible reacting
flow, RYrhoCentralFOAM. The effects of char combustion on methane detonation dynamics are investigated
and devolatized coal particles are modelled. The results show that propagation of the methane detonation
wave in coal particle suspensions are considerably affected by coal particle concentration and
size. Detonation extinction occurs when the coal particle size is small and concentration is high.
The averaged lead shock speed generally decreases with increased particle concentration and decreased
particle size. Mean structure of methane and coal particle hybrid detonation is analysed, based
on the gas and particle quantities. It is found that char combustion proceeds in the subsonic region
behind the detonation wave and heat release is relatively distributed compared to that from gas
phase reaction. Moreover, for 1 {\mu}m particle, if the particle concentration is beyond a threshold
value, detonation re-initiation occurs after it is quenched at the beginning of the coal dust suspensions.
This is caused by hot spots from the shock focusing along the reaction front in a decoupled detonation
and these shocks are generated from char combustion behind the lead shock. A regime map of detonation
propagation and extinction is predicted. It is found that the re-initiation location decreases
with the particle concentration and approaches a constant value when the concentration exceeds
1000 g/m3. The results from this study are useful for prevention and suppression of methane/coal
dust hybrid explosion.

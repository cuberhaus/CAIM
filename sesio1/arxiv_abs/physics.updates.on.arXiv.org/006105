We report spatiotemporal evolution of emission and absorption signatures of Al species in a nanosecond
(ns) laser-produced plasma (LPP). The plasmas were generated from an Inconel target, which contained
$\sim $ 0.4 wt.% Al, using 1064 nm, ~ 6 ns full width half maximum pulses from an Nd:YAG laser at an Ar
cover gas pressure of ~ 34 Torr. The temporal distributions of the Al I (394.4 nm) transition were
collected from various spatial points within the plasma employing time-of-flight (TOF) emission
and laser absorption spectroscopy and they provide kinetics of the excited state and ground state
population of the selected transition. The emission and absorption signatures showed multiple
peaks in their temporal profiles, although they appeared at different spatial locations and times
after the plasma onset. The absorption temporal profiles showed an early time signature representing
shock wave propagation into the ambient gas. We also used emission and absorption spectral features
for measuring various physical properties of the plasma. The absorption spectral profiles are
utilized for measuring linewidths, column density, and kinetic temperature while emission spectra
were used to measure excitation temperature. A comparison between excitation and the kinetic temperature
was made at various spatial points in the plasma. Our results highlight that the TOF measurements
provide a resourceful tool for showing the spatiotemporal LPP dynamics with higher spatial and
temporal resolution than is possible with spectral measurements but are difficult to interpret
without additional information on excitation temperatures and linewidths. The combination of
absorption and emission TOF and spectral measurements thus provides a more complete picture of
LPP spatiotemporal dynamics than is possible using any one technique alone.

Purpose: To assess whether the three-dimensional (3D) structural configuration of the central
retinal vessel trunk and its branches (CRVT&B) could be used as a diagnostic marker for glaucoma.
Method: We trained a deep learning network to automatically segment the CRVT&B from the B-scans
of the optical coherence tomography (OCT) volume of the optic nerve head (ONH). Subsequently, two
different approaches were used for glaucoma diagnosis using the structural configuration of the
CRVT&B as extracted from the OCT volumes. In the first approach, we aimed to provide a diagnosis using
only 3D CNN and the 3D structure of the CRVT&B. For the second approach, we projected the 3D structure
of the CRVT&B orthographically onto three planes to obtain 2D images, and then a 2D CNN was used for
diagnosis. The segmentation accuracy was evaluated using the Dice coefficient, whereas the diagnostic
accuracy was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC).
The diagnostic performance of the CRVT&B was also compared with that of retinal nerve fiber layer
(RNFL) thickness. Results: Our segmentation network was able to efficiently segment retinal blood
vessels from OCT scans. On a test set, we achieved a Dice coefficient of 0.81\pm0.07. The 3D and 2D
diagnostic networks were able to differentiate glaucoma from non-glaucoma subjects with accuracies
of 82.7% and 83.3%, respectively. The corresponding AUCs for CRVT&B were 0.89 and 0.90, higher than
those obtained with RNFL thickness alone. Conclusions: Our work demonstrated that the diagnostic
power of the CRVT&B is superior to that of a gold-standard glaucoma parameter, i.e., RNFL thickness.
Our work also suggested that the major retinal blood vessels form a skeleton -- the configuration
of which may be representative of major ONH structural changes as typically observed with the development
and progression of glaucoma.

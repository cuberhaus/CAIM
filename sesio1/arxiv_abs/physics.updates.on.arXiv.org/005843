Chirping Alfv\'en modes are considered as potentially harmful for the confinement of energetic
particles in burning Tokamak plasmas. In this paper, the nonlinear evolution of a single-toroidal-number
chirping mode is analysed by numerical particle simulation. This analysis can be simplified if
the different resonant phase-space structures can be investigated as isolated ones. In our simulations,
we adopt as constants of motion, the magnetic momentum, and the initial particle coordinates. The
analysis is focused on the dynamics of two of them: namely, those yielding the largest drive during,
respectively, the linear phase and the nonlinear one. It is shown that, for each resonant structure,
a density-flattening region is formed around the respective resonance radius, with radial width
that increases as the mode amplitude grows. It is delimited by two large negative density gradients,
drifting inward and outward. If the mode frequency were constant, this density flattening would
be responsible for the exhausting of the drive yielded by the resonant structure, which would occur
as the large negative density gradients leave the resonance region. causes the resonance radius
and the resonance region to drift inward. This drift, along with a relevant resonance broadening,
delays the moment in which the inner density gradient reaches the inner boundary of the resonance
region, leaving it. On the other side, the island reconstitutes around the new resonance radius;
as a consequence, the large negative density gradient further moves inward. This process continues
as long as it allows to keep the large gradient within the resonance region. When this is no longer
possible, the resonant structure ceases to be effective in driving the mode. To further grow, the
mode has to tap a different resonant structure, possibly making use of additional frequency variations.

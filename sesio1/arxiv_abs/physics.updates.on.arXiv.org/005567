Detailed understanding of the coupling between fluid flow and solid deformation in porous media
is crucial for the development biomedical devices and novel energy technologies relating to a wide
range of geological and biological processes. Well established models based on poroelasticity
theory exist for describing coupled fluid-solid mechanics. However, these models are not adapted
to describe systems with multiple fluid phases or 'hybrid-scale' systems containing both solid-free
regions and porous matrices. To address this problem, we present a novel computational fluid dynamics
approach based on a unique set of volume-averaged partial differential equations that asymptotically
approach the Navier-Stokes Volume-of-Fluid equations in solid-free-regions and Biot's Poroelasticity
Theory in porous regions. Unlike existing multiscale multiphase solvers, it can match analytical
predictions of capillary, relative permeability, and gravitational effects at both the pore and
Darcy scales. Through careful consideration of interfacial dynamics and extensive benchmarking,
we show that our model accurately captures the strong two-way coupling that is often exhibited between
multiple fluids and deformable porous media during processes such as swelling, compression, and
fracturing. The versatility of the approach is illustrated through studies that 1) quantified
the effects of microporosity on sedimentary rock permeability, 2) identified the governing non-dimensional
parameters that predict capillary and viscous fracturing in porous media, 3) characterised the
effects of cracking on hydraulic fracture formation, and 4) described wave absorption and propagation
in poroelastic coastal barriers. The approach's open-source numerical implementation 'hybridBiotInterFoam',
marks the extension of computational fluid dynamics simulation packages into deformable, multi-phase,
multiscale porous systems.

Purpose: In this modelling study we pursued two main goals. The first was to establish a new CTV-to-PTV
expansion which considers the closest and most critical organ at risk (OAR). The second goal was
to investigate the impact of the planning target volume (PTV) margin size on the tumor control probability
(TCP) dependent on the geometrical setup uncertainties. The aim was to achieve a smaller margin
expansion close to the OAR while allowing a moderately larger expansion in less critical areas further
away from the OAR and most importantly while maintaining the TCP. Methods and Materials: Imaging
data of radiation therapy (RT) plans from pet dogs which had undergone RT for brain tumor were used
to estimate the clinic specific rotational setup uncertainties. A Monte-Carlo methodology used
to quantify the implications of those uncertainties on the TCP. A computational CTV-to-PTV expansion
method based on probability density was established. All required software modules were developed
and integrated into a software package which directly interacts with the Varian Eclipse treatment
planning system. Results: The rotational setup uncertainties were obtained from 44 dog patients.
Their frequency distributions were analysed, and the mean values and standard deviations were
determined. To investigate the impact on the TCP, several uniform and non-isotropic PTV targets
were created. Standardized RT plans with equal optimization constraints were defined and automatically
applied and calculated on these targets. The resulting TCPs were then evaluated and compared. Conclusion:
The non-isotropic margins were found to result in larger TCPs with smaller margin excess volume.
Further we have presented an additional application of the newly established CTV-to-PTV expansion
method for radiation therapy of the spinal axis of human patients.

It is much demanding to develop broadband dual-comb sources covering absorption lines of various
molecules for spectroscopic and imaging applications. Although the dual-comb technique is relatively
mature in the infrared wavelengths, it is, currently, not commercially capable of practical applications
in the terahertz regime due to the lack of high performance broadband terahertz dual-comb sources.
In the terahertz frequency range, the electrically pumped quantum cascade laser (QCL), demonstrating
high output power and good beam quality, is a suitable candidate for the dual-comb operation. However,
free running terahertz QCL dual-comb sources normally show limited optical bandwidths ($\sim$100-200
GHz). Although the resonant microwave injection locking has been widely used to broaden the emission
spectra of terahertz QCLs by modulating the laser drive current at the cavity round-trip frequency,
it is hard to be employed to broaden the dual-comb bandwidths due to the large phase noise induced
by the resonant injection and non-ideal microwave circuits. Therefore, it is challenging to obtain
broadband terahertz dual-comb sources that can fully exploits the laser gain bandwidth by utilizing
the current resonant microwave injection. Here, we employ an off-resonant microwave injection
to significantly broaden the dual-comb bandwidth of a terahertz QCL dual-comb source emitting
around 4.2 THz. Under the off-resonant injection, the optical dual-comb bandwidth is significantly
broadened from 147 GHz in free running to 620 GHz that is almost the double of the lasing bandwidth
of the laser measured using a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. The broadband dual-comb
bandwidth is resulted from the injection locking and mutual locking effects induced by the off-resonant
injection.

Infectious diseases usually originate from a specific location within a city. Due to the heterogenous
distribution of population and public facilities, and the structural heterogeneity of human mobility
network embedded in space, infectious diseases break out at different locations would cause different
transmission risk and control difficulty. This study aims to investigate the impact of initial
outbreak locations on the risk of spatiotemporal transmission and reveal the driving force behind
high-risk outbreak locations. First, integrating mobile phone location data, we built a SLIR (susceptible-latent-infectious-removed)-based
meta-population model to simulate the spreading process of an infectious disease (i.e., COVID-19)
across fine-grained intra-urban regions (i.e., 649 communities of Shenzhen City, China). Based
on the simulation model, we evaluated the transmission risk caused by different initial outbreak
locations by proposing three indexes including the number of infected cases (CaseNum), the number
of affected regions (RegionNum), and the spatial diffusion range (SpatialRange). Finally, we
investigated the contribution of different influential factors to the transmission risk via machine
learning models. Results indicates that different initial outbreak locations would cause similar
CaseNum but different RegionNum and SpatialRange. To avoid the epidemic spread quickly to more
regions, it is necessary to prevent epidemic breaking out in locations with high population-mobility
flow density. While to avoid epidemic spread to larger spatial range, remote regions with long daily
trip distance of residents need attention. Those findings can help understand the transmission
risk and driving force of initial outbreak locations within cities and make precise prevention
and control strategies in advance.

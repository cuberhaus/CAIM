Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is a valuable imaging technique to study the brain in vivo. However, the resolution
of dMRI is limited by the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of this technique. Various acquisition
strategies have been developed to achieve high resolutions, but they require long scan times. Imaging
at ultra-high fields (UHF) could further increase the SNR of single-shot dMRI; however, the shorter
T2* and the greater field non-uniformities will degrade image quality. In this study, we investigated
the trade-off between the SNR and resolution of different k-space trajectories, including echo
planar imaging (EPI), partial Fourier EPI, and spiral, over a range of resolutions at 7T. The effective
resolution, spatial specificity and sharpening effect were measured from the point spread function
(PSF) of the simulated diffusion sequences for a nominal resolution range of 0.6-1.8 mm. In-vivo
scans were acquired using the three readout trajectories. Field probes were used to measure dynamic
magnetic fields up to the 3rd order of spherical harmonics. Using a static field map and the measured
trajectories image artifacts were corrected, leaving T2* effects as the primary source of blurring.
The effective resolution was examined in fractional anisotropy (FA) maps. In-vivo scans were acquired
to calculate the SNR. EPI trajectories had the highest specificity, effective resolution, and
image sharpening effect, but also had substantially lower SNR. Spirals had significantly higher
SNR, but lower specificity. Line plots of the in-vivo scans in phase and frequency encode directions
showed ~0.2 units difference in FA values between the different trajectories. The difference between
the effective and nominal resolution is greater for spirals than for EPI. However, the higher SNR
of spiral trajectories at UHFs allows us to achieve higher effective resolutions compared to EPI
and PF-EPI trajectories.

This work provides an overview on deterministic and stochastic models that have previously been
proposed by us to study the transmission dynamics of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in
Europe and USA. Briefly, we describe realistic deterministic and stochastic models for the evolution
of the COVID-19 pandemic, subject to the lockdown and quarantine measures, which take into account
the time-delay for recovery or death processes. Realistic dynamic equations for the entire process
have been derived by adopting the so-called "kinetic-type reactions approach". The lockdown and
the quarantine measures are modelled by some kind of inhibitor reactions where susceptible and
infected individuals can be "trapped" into inactive states. The dynamics for the recovered people
is obtained by accounting people who are only traced back to hospitalised infected people. To model
the role of the Hospitals we take inspiration from the Michaelis-Menten's enzyme-substrate reaction
model (the so-called "MM reaction") where the "enzyme" is associated to the "available hospital
beds", the "substrate" to the "infected people", and the "product" to the "recovered people", respectively.
The statistical properties of the models, in particular the relevant correlation functions and
the probability density functions, have duly been evaluated. We validate our theoretical predictions
with a large series of experimental data for Italy, Germany, France, Belgium and United States,
and we also compare data for Italy and Belgium with the theoretical predictions of the logistic model.
We found that our predictions are in good agreement with the real world since the onset of COVID 19,
contrary to the the logistics model that only applies in the first days of the pandemic. In the final
part of the work, we can find the (theoretical) relationships that should be satisfied to obtain
the disappearance of the virus.

The concept of atoms in molecules (AIM) is one of the cornerstones of the structural theory of chemistry
however, in contrast to the free atoms a comprehensive quantum mechanical theory of AIM has never
been proposed. Currently the most satisfactory deduction of this concept is based on the partitioning
methodologies that are trying to recover AIM from the ab initio wavefunctions (WF). One of these
methodologies is the quantum theory of AIM (QTAIM), which retrieves AIM by an exhaustive partitioning
of the one-electron density into atomic basins in real space. The molecular properties are then
partitioned into the basin and inter-basin contributions as the incarnation of the AIM properties
and their interaction modes. The inputs of the QTAIM partitioning scheme are the electronic WF computed
from the electronic Schrodinger equation (SE), which is basically a single-component equation
treating electrons as quantum particles and the nuclei as clamped point charges (CPC). A recently
extended form of the QTAIM, called the multi-component QTAIM (MC-QTAIM), removes this restriction
and enables AIM partitioning to be applied to the MC quantum systems. This is done using MC-WF as inputs
that are derived from the MC-SE in which there are two or more types of quantum particles. This opens
the possibility for the AIM partitioning of molecular systems where certain nuclei, e.g. because
of their non-adiabatic coupling to electrons, must be treated as quantum particles instead of CPC.
The same formalism allows the partitioning of exotic molecular systems in which there are other
elementary particles like muons or positrons, in addition to electrons and nuclei. The application
of the MC-QTAIM partitioning to such systems reveals that the positively charged muon may shape
its own atomic basin, i.e. an example of exotic AIM, while positron may act as an agent of bonding,
i.e. an example of exotic bonds.

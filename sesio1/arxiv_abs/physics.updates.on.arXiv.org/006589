Neurons are the basic cells of the nervous system. During their growth neurons extend two types of
processes: axons and dendrites, which navigate to other neurons and form complex neuronal networks
that transmit electrical signals throughout the body. The basic process underlying the network
formation is axonal growth, a process involving the extension of axons from the cell body towards
target neurons. During growth axons sense their environment, process information, and respond
to external stimuli by adapting their growth dynamics. Environmental stimuli include intercellular
interactions, biochemical cues, and the mechanical and geometrical features of the growth substrate.
Axonal dynamics is controlled both by deterministic components (tendency to grow in certain preferred
directions imparted by surface properties), and a random deviation from these growth directions
due to stochastic processes. Despite recent impressive advances in our understanding of how neurons
grow and form functional connections, a fully quantitative description of axonal dynamics is still
missing. In this paper, we present a review of our work on stochastic models. We show that Langevin
and Fokker-Planck stochastic differential equations provide a powerful theoretical framework
for describing how collective axonal dynamics and the formation of neuronal network emerge from
biophysics of single neurons and their interactions. We combine this theoretical analysis with
experimental data to extract key parameters of axonal growth: diffusion coefficients, speed and
angular distributions, mean square displacements, and mechanical parameters describing the
cell-substrate coupling. These results have important implications for our understanding of
the fundamental mechanisms involved in the formation of functional neuronal networks, as well
as for bioengineering novel scaffolds to promote nerve regeneration.

Digital mammography is still the most common imaging tool for breast cancer screening. Although
the benefits of using digital mammography for cancer screening outweigh the risks associated with
the x-ray exposure, the radiation dose must be kept as low as possible while maintaining the diagnostic
utility of the generated images, thus minimizing patient risks. Many studies investigated the
feasibility of dose reduction by restoring low-dose images using deep neural networks. In these
cases, choosing the appropriate training database and loss function is crucial and impacts the
quality of the results. In this work, a modification of the ResNet architecture, with hierarchical
skip connections, is proposed to restore low-dose digital mammography. We compared the restored
images to the standard full-dose images. Moreover, we evaluated the performance of several loss
functions for this task. For training purposes, we extracted 256,000 image patches from a dataset
of 400 images of retrospective clinical mammography exams, where different dose levels were simulated
to generate low and standard-dose pairs. To validate the network in a real scenario, a physical anthropomorphic
breast phantom was used to acquire real low-dose and standard full-dose images in a commercially
avaliable mammography system, which were then processed through our trained model. An analytical
restoration model for low-dose digital mammography, previously presented, was used as a benchmark
in this work. Objective assessment was performed through the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and mean
normalized squared error (MNSE), decomposed into residual noise and bias. Results showed that
the perceptual loss function (PL4) is able to achieve virtually the same noise levels of a full-dose
acquisition, while resulting in smaller signal bias compared to other loss functions.

Electric field measurements of the Time Domain Sampler (TDS) receiver, part of the Radio and Plasma
Waves (RPW) instrument on board Solar Orbiter, often exhibit very intense broadband wave emissions
at frequencies below 20~kHz in the spacecraft frame. In this paper, we present a year-long study
of electrostatic fluctuations observed in the solar wind at an interval of heliocentric distances
from 0.5 to 1~AU. The RPW/TDS observations provide a nearly continuous data set for a statistical
study of intense waves below the local plasma frequency. The on-board and continuously collected
and processed properties of waveform snapshots allow for the mapping plasma waves at frequencies
between 200~Hz and 20~kHz. We used the triggered waveform snapshots and a Doppler-shifted solution
of the dispersion relation for wave mode identification in order to carry out a detailed spectral
and polarization analysis. Electrostatic ion-acoustic waves are the common wave emissions observed
between the local electron and proton plasma frequency in the soler wind. The occurrence rate of
ion-acoustic waves peaks around perihelion at distances of 0.5~AU and decreases with increasing
distances, with only a few waves detected per day at 0.9~AU. Waves are more likely to be observed when
the local proton moments and magnetic field are highly variable. A more detailed analysis of more
than 10000 triggered waveform snapshots shows the mean wave frequency at about 3 kHz and wave amplitude
about 2.5 mV/m. The wave amplitude varies as 1/R^(1.38) with the heliocentric distance. The relative
phase distribution between two components of the E-field shows a mostly linear wave polarization.
Electric field fluctuations are closely aligned with the directions of the ambient field lines.
Only a small number (3%) of ion-acoustic waves are observed at larger magnetic discontinuities.

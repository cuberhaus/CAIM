Identification of unknown physical processes and parameters of groundwater contaminant sources
is a challenging task due to their ill-posed and non-unique nature. Numerous works have focused
on determining nonlinear physical processes through model selection methods. However, identifying
corresponding nonlinear systems for different physical phenomena using numerical methods can
be computationally prohibitive. With the advent of machine learning (ML) algorithms, more efficient
surrogate models based on neural networks (NNs) have been developed in various disciplines. In
this work, a theory-guided U-net (TgU-net) framework is proposed for surrogate modeling of three-dimensional
(3D) groundwater contaminant problems in order to efficiently elucidate their involved processes
and unknown parameters. In TgU-net, the underlying governing equations are embedded into the loss
function of U-net as soft constraints. For the considered groundwater contaminant problem, sorption
is considered to be a potential process of an uncertain type, and three equilibrium sorption isotherm
types (i.e., linear, Freundlich, and Langmuir) are considered. Different from traditional approaches
in which one model corresponds to one equation, these three sorption types are modeled through only
one TgU-net surrogate. The three mentioned sorption terms are integrated into one equation by assigning
indicators. Accurate predictions illustrate the satisfactory generalizability and extrapolability
of the constructed TgU-net. Furthermore, based on the constructed TgU-net surrogate, a data assimilation
method is employed to identify the physical process and parameters simultaneously. This work shows
the possibility of governing equation discovery of physical problems that contain multiple and
even uncertain processes by using deep learning and data assimilation methods.

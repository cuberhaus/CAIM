Fluidic interfaces disintegrate under sufficiently strong electric fields, leading to electrohydrodynamic
(EHD) tip streaming. Taylor cones, which emit charged droplets from the tip of a conical cusp, are
among the most prominent and well-studied examples of EHD instabilities. In liquid-liquid systems,
more complex interface deformation modes than simple Taylor cones can be observed, with the interface
being pushed away from the electrode, and additional cone structures emerging from the rim of the
dimple. In this article, we investigate the mechanisms behind these deformation modes experimentally
and numerically, and demonstrate that the presence of droplets triggers the dimple at the interface.
In order to characterize the underlying processes, we replace the pin electrode by a hollow metallic
needle with a prescribed electrolyte volume flow. The submerged electrospray introduces droplets
of an aqueous KCl solution with varying ion concentrations into silicone oils with varying viscosities.
By measuring the corresponding electric current and by optical investigation of the interface
deformation, we study the system response to variations of the ionic concentration, viscosity,
applied voltage as well as flow rate. In addition to the experiments, we use a finite element solver
and compute the charge transport due to the droplets in the oil phase. Further, we compute the electric
potential distribution, flow field and interface deformation. After calibration of our model
with particle tracking velocimetry data of the flow inside the oil phase, we reproduce the experimentally
observed dimple at the liquid-liquid interface. In summary, this work highlights the importance
of charged droplets for the complex dynamic modes observed when a liquid-liquid interface is exposed
to a local electric field.

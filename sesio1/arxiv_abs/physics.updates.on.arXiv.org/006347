This work develops, discretizes, and validates a continuum model of a molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$)
monolayer interacting with a periodic holey silicon nitride substrate via van der Waals (vdW) forces.
The MoS$_2$ layer is modeled as a geometrically nonlinear Kirchhoff-Love shell, and vdW forces
are modeled by a Lennard-Jones potential, simplified using approximations for a smooth substrate
topography. The material parameters of the shell model are calibrated by comparing small-strain
tensile and bending tests with atomistic simulations. This model is efficiently discretized using
isogeometric analysis (IGA) for the shell structure and a pseudo-time continuation method for
energy minimization. The IGA shell model is validated against fully-atomistic calculations for
several benchmark problems with different substrate geometries. The continuum simulations reproduce
deflections, strains and curvatures predicted by atomistic simulations, which are known to strongly
affect the electronic properties of MoS$_2$, with deviations well below the modeling errors suggested
by differences between the widely-used reactive empirical bond order and Stillinger-Weber interatomic
potentials. Agreement with atomistic results depends on geometric nonlinearity in some cases,
but a simple isotropic St. Venant-Kirchhoff model is found to be sufficient to represent material
behavior. We find that the IGA discretization of the continuum model has a much lower computational
cost than atomistic simulations, and expect that it will enable efficient design space exploration
in strain engineering applications. This is demonstrated by studying the dependence of strain
and curvature in MoS$_2$ over a holey substrate as a function of the hole spacing on scales inaccessible
to atomistic calculations. The results show an unexpected qualitative change in the deformation
pattern below a critical hole separation.

Viscous flows through configurations manufactured from soft materials apply both pressure and
shear stress at the solid-liquid interface, leading to deformation of the cross-section, which
affects the flow rate-pressure drop relation. Conventionally, calculating this flow rate-pressure
drop relation requires solving the complete elastohydrodynamic problem, which couples the fluid
flow and elastic deformation. In this work, we use the reciprocal theorems for Stokes flow and linear
elasticity to derive a closed-form expression for the flow rate-pressure drop relation in deformable
channels, bypassing the detailed calculation of the solution to the fluid-structure-interaction
problem. For small deformations (under a domain perturbation scheme), our theory provides the
leading-order effect, of the interplay between the fluid stresses and the compliance of the channel,
on the flow rate-pressure drop relation. Our approach uses solely the fluid flow solution and the
elastic deformation due to the fluid stress distribution in an undeformed channel, eliminating
the need to solve the coupled elastohydrodynamic problem. Unlike previous theoretical studies
that neglected the presence of lateral sidewalls and considered shallow geometries of effectively
infinite width, our approach allows to determine the influence of confining sidewalls on the flow
rate-pressure drop relation. For the flow-rate-controlled situation and the plate-bending theory
for the elastic deformation, we show a trade-off between the effect of compliance of the deforming
top wall and the drag due to sidewalls on the pressure drop. While increased compliance decreases
the pressure drop, the effect of the sidewalls increases it. Our theoretical framework may provide
insight into existing experimental data and pave the way for the design of novel optimized soft microfluidic
configurations of different cross-sectional shapes.

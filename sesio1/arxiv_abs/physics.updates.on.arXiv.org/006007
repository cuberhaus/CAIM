This work investigates the electroviscous effects in the presence of the charge-dependent slip
in the steady pressure-driven laminar flow of the symmetric (1:1) electrolytes liquid through
a uniformly charged rectangular contraction - expansion (4:1:4) microfluidic device. The mathematical
model comprising the Poison, the Nernst-Plank, the Navier-Stokes, and the current continuity
equations are solved numerically using the finite element method (FEM). The flow fields (electrical
potential, charge, induced electric field strength, pressure drop, and electroviscous correction
factor) have been obtained and presented for the wide range of the governing parameters like inverse
Debye length ($2\le K\le 20$), surface charge density ($4\le S\le 16$) and the slip length ($0\le
B_0\le 0.20$) at fixed Schmidt number ($\mathit{Sc}=1000$) and low Reynolds number ($Re=0.01$).
The flow fields have shown complex dependence on the governing parameters. The charge-dependent
slip has further enhanced the complexity of the dependency in comparison to the no-slip condition.
In the presence of charge-dependent slip, total electrical potential and pressure drop changes
maximally by 78\% and 63\%, respectively, over the ranges of conditions. The electroviscous correction
factor ($Y$) increases by 22\% under the no-slip ($B_{\text{0}}=0$) condition. In contrast, $Y$
increases by 19 - 72\% for charge-dependent slip than that in no-slip flow for the considered ranges
of the conditions. A simple analytical model to estimate pressure drop in the electroviscous flow,
developed based on the Poiseuille flow in the individual uniform sections and pressure loss due
to orifice, overpredicts pressure drop by 2-4\%. Finally, the predictive relations, depicting
functional dependence of numerical results on the governing parameters, are presented for their
practical use in the design and engineering of microfluidic devices.

We estimate patterns of covariation between COVID-19 vaccination rates and a set of widely used
indicators of human, social, and economic capital across 146 countries in July 2021 and February
2022. About 70% of the variability in COVID-19 vaccination rates worldwide can be explained by differences
in the Human Development Index (HDI) and, specifically, in life expectancy at birth, one year after
the campaign debut. Trust in doctors and nurses adds predictive value beyond the HDI, clarifying
controversial discrepancies between vaccination rates in countries with similar levels of human
development and vaccine availability. Cardiovascular disease deaths, an indicator of general
health system effectiveness, and infant measles immunization coverage, an indicator of country-level
immunization effectiveness, are also significant, though weaker, predictors of COVID-19 vaccination
success. The metrics of economic inequality, perceived corruption, poverty, and inputs into the
health system have strong bivariate correlations with COVID-19 vaccination but no longer remain
statistically significant when controlling for the HDI. Our analysis identified the contours
of a social structure that sustains life and is reproduced through this process. COVID-19 vaccines
have proven to be part of the Matthew effect of accumulating advantages and aggravating disadvantages
that the pandemic inflicted on societies and communities across the world. At the same time, the
remaining variability in vaccination success that cannot be pinned down through these sets of metrics
points to a considerable scope for collective and individual agency in a time of crisis. The mobilization
and coordination in the vaccination campaigns of citizens, medical professionals, scientists,
journalists, and politicians, among others, account for at least some of this variability in overcoming
vaccine hesitancy and inequity.

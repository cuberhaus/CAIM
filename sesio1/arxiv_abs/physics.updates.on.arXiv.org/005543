This paper proposes a task-driven computational framework for assessing diffusion MRI experimental
designs which, rather than relying on parameter-estimation metrics, directly measures quantitative
task performance. Traditional computational experimental design (CED) methods may be ill-suited
to experimental tasks, such as clinical classification, where outcome does not depend on parameter-estimation
accuracy or precision alone. Current assessment metrics evaluate experiments' ability to faithfully
recover microstructural parameters rather than their task performance. The method we propose
addresses this shortcoming. For a given MRI experimental design, experiments are simulated start-to-finish
and task performance is computed from ROC curves and associated summary metrics (e.g. AUC). Two
experiments were performed: first, a validation of the pipeline's task performance predictions
against clinical results, comparing in-silico predictions to real-world ROC/AUC; and second,
a demonstration of the pipeline's advantages over traditional CED approaches, using two simulated
clinical classification tasks. Comparison with clinical datasets validates our method's predictions
of (a) the qualitative form of ROC curves, (b) the relative task performance of different experimental
designs, and (c) the absolute performance of each experimental design. Furthermore, we show that
our method outperforms traditional task-agnostic assessment methods, enabling improved, more
useful experimental design. Compared to current approaches, such task-driven assessment is more
likely to identify experimental designs that perform well in practice. Our method is not limited
to diffusion MRI; the pipeline generalises to any task-based quantitative MRI application, and
provides the foundation for developing future task-driven end-to end CED frameworks.

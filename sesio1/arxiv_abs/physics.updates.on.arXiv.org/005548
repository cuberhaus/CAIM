The growing market for sensors, internet of things, and wearable devices is fueling the development
of low-cost energy-harvesting materials and systems. Film based thermoelectric (TE) devices
offer the ability to address the energy requirements by using ubiquitously available waste-heat.
This review narrates recent advancements in fabricating high-performance TE films and superlattice
structures, from the aspects of microstructure control, doping, defects, composition, surface
roughness, substrate effect, interface control, nanocompositing, and crystal preferred orientation
realized by regulating various deposition parameters and subsequent heat treatment. The review
begins with a brief account of heat conduction mechanism, quantum confinement effect in periodic
layers, film deposition processes, thin film configurations and design consideration for TE in-plane
devices, and characterization techniques. It then proceeds to alayzing the latest findingd on
the TE properties of Bi2(Te,Se)3 and (Bi,Sb)2Te3, PbTe, GeTe, SnSe, SnTe, Cu2-xSe, and skutterudite
films, including superlattices and the performance of TE generators, sensors, and cooling devices.
Thickness dependent microstructure evolution and TE characteristics of films in relation to temperature
are also analyzed. In the context of spin Seebeck effect (SSE) based systems, SSE mechanism analysis,
developments in enhancing the spin Seebeck signal since its first observation, and recent developments
are covered from the facets of new system design, signal collection, magnetic manipulation, interface
conditions, thickness-dependent longitudinal spin Seebeck signal, and length scale of phonon
and magnon transport in longitudinal SSE (LSSE) in different bi-layer systems. At the end, possible
strategies for further enhancing zT of TE films and spin Seebeck signals of many systems are addressed.

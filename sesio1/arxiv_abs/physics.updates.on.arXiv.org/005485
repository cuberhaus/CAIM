Next-generation missions designed to detect biosignatures on exoplanets will also be capable
of placing constraints on the presence of technosignatures (evidence for technological life)
on these same worlds. Here, I estimate the detectability of nightside city lights on habitable,
Earth-like, exoplanets around nearby stars using direct-imaging observations from the proposed
LUVOIR and HabEx observatories. I use data from the Soumi National Polar-orbiting Partnership
satellite to determine the surface flux from city lights at the top of Earth's atmosphere, and the
spectra of commercially available high-power lamps to model the spectral energy distribution
of the city lights. I consider how the detectability scales with urbanization fraction: from Earth's
value of 0.05\%, up to the limiting case of an ecumenopolis -- or planet-wide city. I then calculate
the minimum detectable urbanization fraction using 300 hours of observing time for generic Earth-analogs
around stars within 8 pc of the Sun, and for nearby known potentially habitable planets. Though Earth
itself would not be detectable by LUVOIR or HabEx, planets around M-dwarfs close to the Sun would
show detectable signals from city lights for urbanization levels of 0.4\% to 3\%, while city lights
on planets around nearby Sun-like stars would be detectable at urbanization levels of $\gtrsim10\%$.
The known planet Proxima b is a particularly compelling target for LUVOIR A observations, which
would be able to detect city lights twelve times that of Earth in 300 hours, an urbanization level
that is expected to occur on Earth around the mid-22nd-century. An ecumenopolis, or planet-wide
city, would be detectable around roughly 50 nearby stars by both LUVOIR and HabEx, and a survey of
these systems would place a $1\,\sigma$ upper limit of $\lesssim2\%$ on the frequency of ecumenopolis
planets in the Solar neighborhood assuming no detections.

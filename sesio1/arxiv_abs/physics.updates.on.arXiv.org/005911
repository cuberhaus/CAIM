Progressive collapsing foot deformity results from degeneration of the ligaments and the posterior
tibial tendon (PTT). Our understanding of the relationship between the failures of them remains
incomplete. We sought to improve this understanding through computational modeling of force in
these soft tissues. The impact of PTT and ligament tears on force changes in the remaining ligaments
was investigated using a previously validated finite element model of the foot. The ability of the
PTT to restore foot alignment in a collapsed foot was evaluated by increasing the PTT force in a foot
with attenuated ligaments and comparing the alignment angles to the intact foot. Rupture of any
one of the ligaments led to overloading the remaining ligaments, except for the plantar naviculocuneiform,
first plantar tarsometatarsal, and spring ligaments, where removing one led to unloading the other
two. The attenuation of the plantar fascia, long plantar, short plantar, and spring ligaments significantly
overloaded the deltoid and talocalcaneal ligaments. Isolated PTT rupture had no effect on foot
alignment, but did increase the force in the deltoid and spring ligaments. Increasing the force
within the PTT to 30% of body weight was effective at restoring foot alignment during quiet stance,
primarily through reducing hindfoot valgus and forefoot abduction as opposed to improving arch
height. The attenuation of any one ligament often leads to overload of the remaining ligaments which
may lead to progressive degeneration. The PTT can maintain alignment in the collapsing foot, but
at an increased load which could lead to its injury. Early intervention, in the form of ligament repair
or reconstruction, might be used to prevent the progression of deformity. Moreover, strengthening
the PTT through therapeutic exercise might improve its ability to restore foot alignment.

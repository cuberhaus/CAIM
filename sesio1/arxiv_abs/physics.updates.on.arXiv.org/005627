There must exist a reformulation of quantum field theory which does not employ classical time to
describe evolution, even at low energies. To achieve this goal, we have proposed a prequantum, prespacetime
theory, which is a matrix valued Lagrangian dynamics on an octonionic spacetime. This is a deterministic
but nonunitary dynamics in which evolution is described by Connes time, a feature unique to noncommutative
geometry. From here, quantum field theory and its indeterminism, as well as classical spacetime
geometry, are emergent under suitable approximations. In the underlying theory, the algebra of
the octonions reveals evidence for the standard model of particle physics, and for its unification
with a precursor of gravitation, through extension to the Left Right symmetric model and the symmetry
group $E_6$. When elementary particles are described by spinors made from a Clifford algebra, the
exceptional Jordan algebra yields a theoretical derivation of the low energy fine structure constant,
and of the observed mass ratios for charged fermions. We identify the Left Right symmetry breaking
with electroweak symmetry breaking, which also results in separation of emergent four dimensional
Minkowski spacetime from the internal symmetries which describe the standard model. This compactification
without compactification is achieved through the Ghirardi Rimini Weber mechanism of dynamical
wave function collapse, which arises naturally in our theory, because the underlying fundamental
Hamiltonian is necessarily nonselfadjoint. Only classical systems live in four dimensions; quantum
systems always live in eight octonionic (equivalently ten Minkowski) dimensions. We explain how
our theory overcomes the puzzle of quantum nonlocality, while maintaining consistency with special
relativity.

Well-resolved direct numerical simulations (DNSs) have been performed of the flow in a smooth circular
pipe of radius $R$ and axial length $10\pi R$ at friction Reynolds numbers up to $Re_\tau=5200$.
Various turbulence statistics are documented and compared with other DNS and experimental data
in pipes as well as channels.Small but distinct differences between various datasets are identified.
The friction factor $\lambda$ overshoots by $2\%$ and undershoots by $0.6\%$ of the Prandtl friction
law at low and high $Re$ ranges, respectively. In addition, $\lambda$ in our results is slightly
higher than that in Pirozzoli et al. (J. Fluid. Mech., 926, A28, 2021), but matches well with the experiments
in Furuichi et al. (Phys. Fluids, 27, 095108, 2015). The log-law indicator function, which is nearly
indistinguishable between the pipe and channel flows up to $y^+=250$, has not yet developed a plateau
further away from the wall in the pipes even for the $Re_\tau=5200$ cases. The wall shear stress fluctuations
and the inner peak of the axial velocity intensity -- which grow monotonically with $Re_\tau$ --
are lower in the pipe than in the channel, but the difference decreases with increasing $Re_\tau$.
While the wall values are slightly lower in channel than pipe flows at the same $Re_\tau$, the inner
peaks of the pressure fluctuations show negligible differences between them. The Reynolds number
scaling of all these quantities agrees with both the logarithmic and defect power laws if the coefficients
are properly chosen. The one-dimensional spectrum of the axial velocity fluctuation exhibits
a $k^{-1}$ dependence at an intermediate distance from the wall -- as also seen in the channel flow.
In summary, this high-fidelity data enable us to provide better insights into the flow physics in
the pipes and the similarity/difference among different types of wall turbulence.

We present new constrained and free-swimming experiments and simulations of a pair of pitching
hydrofoils interacting in a minimal school. The hydrofoils have an out-of-phase synchronization
and they are varied through in-line, staggered, and side-by-side arrangements within the two-dimensional
interaction plane. It is discovered that there is a \textit{two-dimensionally} stable equilibrium
point for a side-by-side arrangement. In fact, this arrangement is super-stable, meaning that
hydrodynamic forces will passively maintain this arrangement even under external perturbations
and the school as a whole has no net forces acting on it, causing it to drift to one side or the other.
Moreover, previously discovered \textit{one-dimensionally} stable equilibria driven by wake
vortex interactions are shown to be, in fact, two-dimensionally \textit{unstable}, at least for
an out-of-phase synchronization. Additionally, it is discovered that a trailing-edge vortex
mechanism provides the restorative force to stabilize a side-by-side arrangement and the stable
equilibrium is further verified for freely-swimming foils where dynamic recoil motions are present.
When constrained, the swimmers experience a collective thrust and efficiency increase up to 100\%
and 40\%, respectively, in a side-by-side arrangement, whereas the staggered arrangements output
an even higher efficiency improvement of 87\% with a 94\% increase in thrust. For freely-swimming
foils, the recoil motion attenuates the improvements at the stable equilibrium, showing a more
modest speed and efficiency enhancement of up to 9\% and 6\%, respectively. These newfound schooling
performance and stability characteristics suggest that fluid-mediated equilibria may play a
role in the control strategies of schooling fish and fish-inspired robots.

Magnetic reconnection can convert magnetic energy into kinetic energy of non-thermal electron
beams. Those accelerated electrons can, in turn, cause radio emission in astrophysical plasma
environments such as solar flares via micro-instabilities. The properties of the electron velocity
distribution functions (EVDFs) of those non-thermal beams generated by reconnection are, however,
still not well understood. In particular properties that are necessary conditions for some relevant
micro-instabilities. We aim at characterizing the EVDFs generated in 3D magnetic reconnection
by means of fully kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) code simulations. In particular, our goal is to
identify the possible sources of free energy offered by the generated EVDFs and their dependence
on the strength of the guide field. By applying a machine learning algorithm on the EVDFs, we find
that: (1) electron beams with positive gradients in their 1D parallel (to the local magnetic field
direction) velocity distribution functions are generated in both diffusion region and separatrices.
(2) Electron beams with positive gradients in their perpendicular (to the local magnetic field
direction) velocity distribution functions are observed in the diffusion region and outflow region
near the reconnection midplane. In particular, perpendicular crescent-shaped EVDFs (in the perpendicular
velocity space) are mainly observed in the diffusion region. (3) As the guide field strength increases,
the number of locations with EVDFs featuring a perpendicular source of free energy significantly
decreases. The formation of non-thermal electron beams in the field-aligned direction is mainly
due to magnetized and adiabatic electrons, while in the direction perpendicular to the local magnetic
field it is attributed to unmagnetized electrons.

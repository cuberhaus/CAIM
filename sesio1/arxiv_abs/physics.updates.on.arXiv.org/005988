Extensive research has been performed on continuous, non-invasive, cuffless blood pressure (BP)
measurement using artificial intelligence algorithms. This approach involves extracting certain
features from physiological signals like ECG, PPG, ICG, BCG, etc. as independent variables and
extracting features from Arterial Blood Pressure (ABP) signals as dependent variables, and then
using machine learning algorithms to develop a blood pressure estimation model based on these data.
The greatest challenge of this field is the insufficient accuracy of estimation models. This paper
proposes a novel blood pressure estimation method with a clustering step for accuracy improvement.
The proposed method involves extracting Pulse Transit Time (PTT), PPG Intensity Ratio (PIR), and
Heart Rate (HR) features from Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals as
the inputs of clustering and regression, extracting Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) and Diastolic
Blood Pressure (DBP) features from ABP signals as dependent variables, and finally developing
regression models by applying Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR), Random Forest Regression (RFR),
and Multilayer Perceptron Regression (MLP) on each cluster. The method was implemented using the
MIMICII dataset with the silhouette criterion used to determine the optimal number of clusters.
The results showed that because of the inconsistency, high dispersion, and multi-trend behavior
of the extracted features vectors, the accuracy can be significantly improved by running a clustering
algorithm and then developing a regression model on each cluster, and finally weighted averaging
of the results based on the error of each cluster. When implemented with 5 clusters and GBR, this approach
yielded an MAE of 2.56 for SBP estimates and 2.23 for DBP estimates, which were significantly better
than the best results without clustering (DBP: 6.27, SBP: 6.36).

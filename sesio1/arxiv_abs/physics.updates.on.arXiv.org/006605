The slogan "nobody is safe until everybody is safe" is a dictum to raise awareness that in an interconnected
world, pandemics such as COVID-19, require a global approach. Motivated by the ongoing COVID-19
pandemic, we model here the spread of a virus in interconnected communities and explore different
vaccination scenarios, assuming that the efficacy of the vaccination wanes over time. We start
with susceptible populations and consider a susceptible-vaccinated-infected-recovered model
with unvaccinated ("Bronze"), moderately vaccinated ("Silver") and very well vaccinated ("Gold")
communities, connected through different types of networks via a diffusive linear coupling for
local spreading. We show that when considering interactions in "Bronze"-"Gold" and "Bronze"-"Silver"
communities, the "Bronze" community is driving an increase in infections in the "Silver" and "Gold"
communities. This shows a detrimental, unidirectional effect of non-vaccinated to vaccinated
communities. Regarding the interactions between "Gold", "Silver" and "Bronze" communities in
a network, we find that two factors play central role: the coupling strength in the dynamics and network
density. When considering the spread of a virus in Barab\'asi-Albert networks, infections in "Silver"
and "Gold" communities are lower than in "Bronze" communities. We find that the "Gold" communities
are the best in keeping their infection levels low. However, a small number of "Bronze" communities
are enough to give rise to an increase in infections in moderately and well-vaccinated communities.
When studying the spread of a virus in a dense Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi, and sparse Watts-Strogatz and
Barab\'asi-Albert networks, the communities reach the disease-free state in the dense Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi
networks, but not in the sparse Watts-Strogatz and Barab\'asi-Albert networks. However, we also
find that if all these networks...

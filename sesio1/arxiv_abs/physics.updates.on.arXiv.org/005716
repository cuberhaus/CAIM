Rabi-like splitting and self-referenced refractive index sensing in hybrid plasmonic-1D photonic
crystal structures have been theoretically demonstrated. The coupling between Tamm plasmon and
cavity photon modes are tuned by incorporating a low refractive index spacer layer adjacent to the
metallic layer to form their hybrid modes. Anticrossing of the modes observed at different values
of spacer layer thickness validates the strong coupling between the two modes and causes Rabi-like
splitting with different splitting energy. Rabi-like splitting energy decreases with increasing
number of periods (N) and refractive index contrast ({\eta}) of two dielectric materials used to
make the 1D photonic crystals, and the observed variation is explained by an analytical model. Angular
and polarization dependency of the hybrid modes shows that the polarization splitting of the lower
hybrid mode is much stronger than that of the upper hybrid mode. On further investigation, it is seen
that one of the hybrid modes remains unchanged while other mode undergoes significant change with
varying the cavity medium. This nature of the hybrid modes has been utilized for designing self-referenced
refractive index sensors for sensing different analytes. For {\eta}=1.333 and N=10 in a hybrid
structure, the sensitivity increases from 51 nm/RIU to 201 nm/RIU with increasing cavity thickness
from 170 nm to 892 nm. For the fixed cavity thickness of 892 nm, the sensitivity increases from 201
nm/RIU to 259 nm/RIU by increasing {\eta} from 1.333 to 1.605. The sensing parameters such as detection
accuracy, quality factor, and figure of merit for two different hybrid structures ([{\eta}=1.333,
N=10] and [{\eta}=1.605, N=6]) have been evaluated and compared. The value of resonant reflectivity
of one of the hybrid modes changes considerably with varying analyte medium which can be used for
refractive index sensing.

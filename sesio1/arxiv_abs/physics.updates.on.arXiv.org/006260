Multiple objective assessment of image-quality-based studies have reported that several deep-learning-based
denoising methods show limited performance on signal-detection tasks. Our goal was to investigate
the reasons for this limited performance. To achieve this goal, we conducted a task-based characterization
of a DL-based denoising approach for individual signal properties. We conducted this study in the
context of evaluating a DL-based approach for denoising SPECT images. The training data consisted
of signals of different sizes and shapes within a clustered-lumpy background, imaged with a 2D parallel-hole-collimator
SPECT system. The projections were generated at normal and 20% low count level, both of which were
reconstructed using an OSEM algorithm. A CNN-based denoiser was trained to process the low-count
images. The performance of this CNN was characterized for five different signal sizes and four different
SBR by designing each evaluation as an SKE/BKS signal-detection task. Performance on this task
was evaluated using an anthropomorphic CHO. As in previous studies, we observed that the DL-based
denoising method did not improve performance on signal-detection tasks. Evaluation using the
idea of observer-study-based characterization demonstrated that the DL-based denoising approach
did not improve performance on the signal-detection task for any of the signal types. Overall, these
results provide new insights on the performance of the DL-based denoising approach as a function
of signal size and contrast. More generally, the observer study-based characterization provides
a mechanism to evaluate the sensitivity of the method to specific object properties and may be explored
as analogous to characterizations such as modulation transfer function for linear systems. Finally,
this work underscores the need for objective task-based evaluation of DL-based denoising approaches.

Ultracold plasmas are a promising candidate for the creation of strongly-coupled Coulomb systems.
Unfortunately, the values of the coupling parameter Gamma_e actually achieved after photoionization
of the neutral atoms remain relatively small because of the large initial kinetic energy of the electrons.
A conceivable way to get around this obstacle might be to utilize a spontaneous ionization of the
ultracold Rydberg gas, where the initial kinetic energies could be much less. However, the spontaneous
avalanche ionization will result in a very inhomogeneous distribution (clusterization) of the
ions, which can change the efficiency of the electron relaxation in the vicinity of such clusters
substantially. In the present work, this hypothesis is tested by an extensive set of numerical simulations.
As a result, it is found that despite less initial kinetic energy, the subsequent relaxation of the
electron velocities in the clusterized plasmas proceeds much more violently than in the case of
the statistically-uniform ionic distribution. The electron temperature, firstly, experiences
a sharp initial jump (presumably, caused by the "virialization" of energies of the charged particles)
and, secondly, exhibits a gradual subsequent increase (presumably, associated with a multi-particle
recombination of the electrons at the ionic clusters). As a possible tool to reduce the anomalous
temperature increase, we considered also a two-step plasma formation, involving the blockaded
Rydberg states. This leads to a suppression of the clusterization due to a quasi-regular distribution
of ions. In such a case, according to the numerical simulations, the subsequent evolution of the
electron temperature proceeds more gently, approximately with the same rate as in the statistically-uniform
ionic distribution.

Broadband dual-comb spectroscopy has attracted increasing interests due to its unique advantages
in high spectral resolution, fast detection, and so on. Although the dual-comb technique is relatively
mature in the infrared wavelengths, it is, currently, not commercially capable of practical applications
in the terahertz regime due to the lack of high performance broadband terahertz dual-comb sources.
In the terahertz frequency range, the electrically pumped quantum cascade laser (QCL) is a suitable
candidate for the dual-comb operation. However, free running terahertz QCL dual-comb sources
normally show limited optical bandwidths ($\sim$100-200 GHz). Although the resonant microwave
injection locking has been widely used to broaden the emission spectra of terahertz QCLs by modulating
the laser drive current at the cavity round-trip frequency, it is hard to be employed to broaden the
dual-comb bandwidths due to the large phase noise induced by the resonant injection and non-ideal
microwave circuits. Therefore, it is challenging to obtain broadband terahertz dual-comb sources
that can fully exploits the laser gain bandwidth. Here, we employ an off-resonant microwave injection
to significantly broaden the dual-comb bandwidth of a terahertz QCL dual-comb source emitting
around 4.2 THz. The measured optical dual-comb bandwidth is broadened from 147 GHz in free running
to $>$450 GHz under the off-resonant injection. The broadened dual-comb bandwidth is experimentally
proved by the transmission measurements of a filter and a GaAs etalon. By performing a simple numerical
analysis based on a rate equation model, we explain that the broadband dual-comb operation under
the off-resonant microwave injection could be resulted from a wider lasing bandwidth and a higher
degree of phase matching.

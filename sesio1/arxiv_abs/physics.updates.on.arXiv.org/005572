Stationary-state Schr{\"o}dinger-Pauli theory is a description of electrons with a spin moment
in an external electromagnetic field. For 2-electron systems as described by the Schr{\"o}dinger-Pauli
theory Hamiltonian with a symmetrical binding potential, we report a new symmetry operation of
the electronic coordinates. The symmetry operation is such that it leads to the equality of the transformed
wave function to the wave function. This equality is referred to as the Wave Function Identity. The
symmetry operation is a two-step process: an interchange of the spatial coordinates of the electrons
whilst keeping their spin moments unchanged, followed by an inversion. The Identity is valid for
arbitrary structure of the binding potential, arbitrary electron interaction of the form $w(|{\bf{r}}
- {\bf{r}}'|)$, all bound electronic states, and arbitrary dimensionality. It is proved that the
exact wave functions satisfy the Identity. On application of the permutation operation for fermions
to the identity, it is shown that the parity of the singlet states is even and that of triplet states
odd. As a consequence, it follows that at electron-electron coalescence, the singlet state wave
functions satisfy the cusp coalescence constraint, and triplet state wave functions the node coalescence
condition. Further, we show that the parity of the singlet state wave functions about all points
of electron-electron coalescence is even, and that of the triplet state wave functions odd. The
Wave Function Identity and the properties on parity, together with the Pauli principle, are then
elucidated by application to the $2$-dimensional $2$-electron `artificial atoms' or semiconductor
quantum dots in a magnetic field in their first excited singlet $2^{1}S$ and triplet $2^{3} S$ states.

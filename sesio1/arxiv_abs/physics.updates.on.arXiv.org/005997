Degassing of CO2 and precipitation of calcite to the surface of stalagmites can strongly impact
isotope signals imprinted into the calcite of these speleothems. Here, we show that in all the variety
of conditions occurring in nature only two distinct types of degassing exist. First, when a thin
film of calcareous solution comes in contact to cave air lower pCO2 value than that of the aqueous
CO2 in the water, molecular CO2 escapes by physical diffusion in several seconds. In a next step lasting
several ten seconds, pH and DIC in the solution achieve chemical equilibrium with respect to the
CO2 in the cave atmosphere. This solution becomes supersaturated with respect to calcite. During
precipitation for each unit CaCO3 deposited one molecule of CO2 is generated and escapes from the
solution. This precipitation driven degassing is active during precipitation only. We show that
all variations of out gassing proposed in the literature are either diffusive outgassing or precipitation
driven degassing and that diffusive outgassing has no influence on the isotope composition of the
HCO3 - pool and consequently on that of calcite. Its isotope imprint is determined solely by precipitation
driven degassing in contrast to most explanations in the literature. We present a theoretical model
of d13C and d18O that explains the contributions of various parameters such as changes in temperature,
changes of pCO2 in the cave atmosphere, and changes in the drip intervals to the isotope composition
of calcite precipitated to the apex of the stalagmite. We use this model to calculate quantitatively
changes of d13C and d18O observed in field experiments (Carlson et al., 2020) in agreement to their
experimental data. We also apply our model to prior calcite precipitation (PCP) in the field as reported
by Mickler et al. (2019). We discuss how PCP influences isotope composition signals. ...

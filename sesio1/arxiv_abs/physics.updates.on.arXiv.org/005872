This work delineates a new architecture of the Koopman operatory theory called the Koopman Linearly-Time-Invariant
(Koopman-LTI) analysis. The Koopman-LTI is formulated to explain fluid-structure interactions
by providing a constitutive relationship between fluid excitation and structural pressure response.
Results from a demonstrative rendering on a prototypical fluid-structure system, the subcritical
prism wake, showed that the Koopman-LTI globally linearizes and approximates the original flow
into a linear superposition of temporally orthogonal Ritz descriptors. The approximation proved
close to exact and perennially stable. The subsequent analysis of 18 Koopman-LTI systems also alluded
to the a posteriori existence of a configuration-wise universal Koopman system. Spectral characterization
of the system suggested the complex morphology of the prism wake during the shear layer transition
II consists of only six dominant and constitutively interactive excitation-response mechanisms.
Merely two excitations at St=0.1242 and 0.0497 primarily dictate the behaviours of the upstream
and crosswind walls, and four other collectively distinct mechanisms at St=0.0683, 0.1739, 0.1925,
and 0.2422 overshadow the downstream wall. The success with a free-shear configuration and inhomogeneous
and anisotropic turbulence attests to the applicability of the Koopman-LTI to a range of fluid-structure
systems. The Koopman-LTI also stands as a new system identification method of vast practical significance
because, through it, one can pinpoint the exact fluid origin of a specific pressure pattern of structural
response, or vice versa. It also illuminates one visionary possibility to reduce the intricacies
of fluid-structure interaction into constitutive correspondences that are identifiable by inspection
-- making the complicated matter ever so straightforward.

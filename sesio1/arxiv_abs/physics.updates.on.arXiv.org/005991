The presence of undesirable large-amplitude self-sustained oscillations in combustors -- called
thermoacoustic instability -- can lead to performance loss and structural damage to components
of gas turbine and rocket engines. Traditional feedback controls to mitigate thermoacoustic instability
possess electromechanical components, which are expensive to maintain regularly and unreliable
in the harsh environments of combustors. In this study, we demonstrate the quenching of thermoacoustic
instability through self-coupling -- a method wherein a hollow tube is used to provide acoustic
self-feedback to a thermoacoustic system. Through experiments and modeling, we identify the optimal
coupling conditions for attaining amplitude death, i.e., complete suppression of thermoacoustic
instabilities, in a horizontal Rijke tube. We examine the effect of both system and coupling parameters
on the occurrence of amplitude death. We thereby show that the parametric regions of amplitude death
occur when the coupling tube length is an odd multiple of the length of the Rijke tube. The optimal
location of the coupling tube for achieving amplitude death is near the anti-node position of the
acoustic standing wave in the Rijke tube. We also find that self-coupling mitigates thermoacoustic
instability in a Rijke tube more effectively than mutual coupling of two identical Rijke tubes.
Furthermore, our model shows that the combined application of self and mutual coupling in two identical
Rijke tubes can completely suppress oscillations that are not quenched by the individual application
of either self or mutual coupling. Thus, we believe that self-coupling can prove to be a simple, cost-effective
solution for mitigating thermoacoustic instability in gas turbine combustors.

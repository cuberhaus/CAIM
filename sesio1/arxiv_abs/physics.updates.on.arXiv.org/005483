Full-size turbulence simulations of the divertor and scrape-off-layer of existing tokamaks have
recently become feasible, allowing direct comparisons of turbulence simulations to experimental
measurements. We present a validation of three flux-driven turbulence codes (GBS, GRILLIX and
TOKAM3X) against an experimental dataset from diverted Ohmic L-mode discharges on the TCV tokamak.
The dataset covers the divertor targets, volume, entrance and OMP via 5 diagnostic systems, giving
a total of 45 comparison observables over two toroidal field directions. The simulations show good
agreement at the OMP for most observables. At the targets and in the divertor volume, several observables
show good agreement, but the overall match is lower than at the OMP. The simulations typically find
the correct order-of-magnitude and the approximate shape for the divertor mean profiles. The experimental
profiles of the divertor density, potential, current and velocity vary strongly with field direction,
while a weaker effect is found in the simulations. The simulated divertor profiles are found to be
sensitive to the choice of sheath boundary conditions and the use of increased collisionality.
The observed divertor flows suggest that divertor neutral ionisation is non-negligible. This
indicates that the match could be improved by using improved boundary conditions, more realistic
parameters and including self-consistent neutral physics. Future validation and benchmarking
against the TCV-X21 reference dataset will assess the impact of improvements to the codes and will
guide their targeted development - a process which can be extended to other turbulence codes via
the freely available TCV-X21 reference dataset. As such, this work assesses the current capabilities
of edge/divertor turbulence simulations and provides a systematic path towards their improved
interpretive and predictive capability.

Our long-range goal is to improve current whole-heart CT calcium score by extracting quantitative
features from individual calcifications. We performed deconvolution to improve small calcifications
assessment which challenge conventional CT calcium score scanning resolution. We analyzed features
of individual calcifications on repeated standard (2.5-mm) and thin (1.25-mm) slice scans from
QRM-Cardio phantom, cadaver hearts, and CARDIA study participants. Pre-processing to improve
resolution involved of Lucy-Richardson deconvolution with a measured PSF or 3D blind deconvolution
where the PSF was iteratively optimized on high detail structures like calcifications in the images.
Using QRM with inserts having known mg-calcium, we determined that both blind and conventional
deconvolution improved mass measurements nearly equally well on standard images. Further, de-convolved
thin images gave excellent recovery of actual mass scores, suggesting that such processing could
be our gold standard. For CARDIA images, blind deconvolution greatly improved results on standard
slices. Accuracy across 33 calcifications (without, with deconvolution) was (23%,9%), (18%,1%),
and (-19%,-1%), for Agatston, volume, and mass scores, respectively. Reproducibility was (0.13,0.10),
(0.12,0.08), and (0.11,0.06), respectively. Mass scores were more reproducible than Agatston
scores or vol-ume scores. Cadaver volumes showed similar improvements in accuracy/reproducibility
and slightly better results with a measured PSF. For many other calcification features in CARDIA
data, blind deconvolution improved reproducibility in 21 out of 24 features. Deconvolution improves
accuracy and reproducibility of multiple features extracted from individual calcifications
in CT calcium score exam. Blind deconvolution improves feature assessments of coronary calcification
in archived datasets.

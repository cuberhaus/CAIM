In this chapter we focus first on the theoretical methods and relevant computational approaches
to calculate the electronic structure of atoms, molecules, and clusters containing heavy elements
for which relativistic effects become significant. In particular, we discuss the mean-field approximation
of the Dirac equation for many-electron systems, and its self-consistent numerical solution by
using either radial mesh or Gaussian basis sets. The former technique is appropriate for spherical
symmetric problems, such as atoms, while the latter approach is better suited to study non-spherical
non-periodic polycentric systems, such as molecules and clusters. We also outline the pseudopotential
approximation in relativistic context to deal with the electron-ion interaction in extended systems,
where the unfavourable computational scaling with system size makes it necessary. As test cases
we apply our theoretical and numerical schemes to the calculation of the electronic structure i)
of the gold atom, and ii) of the superatom W@Au, where the inclusion of spin-orbit effects is crucial
to the accurate understanding of the electronic properties. Furthermore, we describe the extension
of our relativistic approach to deal with nuclear reactions driven by the weak force, such as the
electron capture and $\beta$-decay, also at finite temperature in astrophysical scenarios, using
the Fermi-Dirac statistics. The latter processes are indeed major drivers of the nucleosynthesis
of the elements in stars and, thus, their understanding is crucial to model the chemical evolution
of the Universe. Finally, we show the application of our relativistic quantum mechanical framework
to the assessment of the elastic differential scattering cross section of electrons impinging
on molecular targets, notably liquid water.

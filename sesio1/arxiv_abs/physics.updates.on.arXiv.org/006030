The diffusion of opinions in Social Networks is a relevant process for adopting positions and attracting
potential voters in political campaigns. Opinion polarization, bias, targeted diffusion, and
the radicalization of postures are key elements for understanding voting dynamics. In particular,
social bots are a new element that can have a pronounced effect on the formation of opinions during
elections by, for instance, creating fake accounts in social networks to manipulate elections.
Here we propose a voter model incorporating bots and radical or intolerant individuals in the decision-making
process. The dynamics of the system occur in a multiplex network of interacting agents composed
of two layers, one for the dynamics of opinions where agents choose between two possible alternatives,
and the other for the tolerance dynamics, in which agents adopt one of two tolerance levels. The tolerance
accounts for the likelihood to change opinion in an interaction, with tolerant (intolerant) agents
switching opinion with probability $1.0$ ($\gamma \le 1$). We find that intolerance leads to a consensus
of tolerant agents during an initial stage that scales as $\tau^+ \sim \gamma^{-1} \ln N$, who then
reach an opinion consensus during the second stage in a time that scales as $\tau \sim N$, where $N$
is the number of agents. Therefore, very intolerant agents ($\gamma \ll 1$) could considerably
slow down dynamics towards the final consensus state. We also find that the inclusion of a fraction
$\sigma_{\mathbb{B}}^-$ of bots breaks the symmetry between both opinions, driving the system
to a consensus of intolerant agents with the bots' opinion. Thus, bots eventually impose their opinion
to the entire population, in a time that scales as $\tau_B^- \sim \gamma^{-1}$ for $\gamma \ll \sigma_{\mathbb{B}}^-$
and $\tau_B^- \sim 1/\sigma_{\mathbb{B}}^-$ for $\sigma_{\mathbb{B}}^- \ll \gamma$.

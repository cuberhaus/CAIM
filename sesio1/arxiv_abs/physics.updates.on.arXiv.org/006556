Chromospheric swirls are considered to play a significant role in the dynamics and heating of the
upper solar atmosphere. It is important to automatically detect and track them in chromospheric
observations and determine their properties. We applied a recently developed automated chromospheric
swirl detection method to time-series observations of a quiet region of the solar chromosphere
obtained in the H$\alpha$-0.2 \r{A} wavelength of the H$\alpha$ spectral line by the CRISP instrument
at the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope. The algorithm exploits the morphological characteristics
of swirling events in high contrast chromospheric observations and results in the detection of
these structures in each frame of the time series and their tracking over time. We conducted a statistical
analysis to determine their various properties, including a survival analysis for deriving the
mean lifetime. A mean number of 146 $\pm$ 9 swirls was detected within the FOV at any given time. The
mean surface density is found equal to $\sim$0.08 swirls$ $Mm$^{-2}$ and the occurrence rate is
$\sim$10$^{-2}$ swirls$ $Mm$^{-2}$ min$^{-1}$. These values are much higher than those previously
reported from chromospheric observations. The radii of the detected swirls range between 0.5 and
2.5 Mm, with a mean value equal to 1.3 $\pm$ 0.3 Mm, which is slightly higher than previous reports.
The lifetimes range between 1.5 min and 33.7 min with an arithmetic mean value of $\sim$8.5 min. A
survival analysis of the lifetimes, however, using the Kaplan-Meier estimator in combination
with a parametric model results in a mean lifetime of 10.3 $\pm$ 0.6 min. An automated method sheds
more light on their abundance than visual inspection, while higher cadence, higher resolution
observations will most probably result in the detection of a higher number of such features on smaller
scales and with shorter lifetimes.

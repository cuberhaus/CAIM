A high sensitivity Cardiac SPECT system using curved crystals with pinhole collimation was proposed
previously (Dey, IEEE TNS 2012, Bhusal et al, Med. Phys. 2019). Here, we hypothesize that a high curvature
hemi-ellipsoid detector results in measurable differences in light distribution from events
at different depths in the crystal. This was tested by analyzing the scintillation light in hemi-ellipsoid
detector using Monte-Carlo (Geant4) and evaluation of both the localization error at detector
and the back-projected errors in object-space. We used Geant4 to simulate the propagation of scintillation
light in a monolithic hemi-ellipsoidal CsI crystal. A look-up table (LUT) was created to map the
points inside the crystal to the expected light pattern on the crystal surface using Geant4. In thirteen
zones across the crystal, gamma-rays were simulated and the resulting scintillator light intensity
on the surface was captured, serving as our experimental interactions. A Poisson-statistics-based
algorithm was developed to limit the search of the gamma-ray event locations into small regions
of the LUT and fine-tuned by interpolating between selected LUT points by comparing the light distribution
of the gamma interactions and LUT light patterns. The localized events were individually back-projected
to the object mid-plane, and the errors recorded. Excluding some outliers (up to 2%), the localized
errors averaged over all the zones was 0.71 (+/-0.44) mm with a worse case of 1.36 (+/-0.67) mm at the
apex. When back-projected to the midplane of the object for Cardiac SPECT, the errors were <1mm and
average error was 0.4(+/-0.22) mm, due to the high system magnification afforded by the detector.
Thus, for our high sensitivity system, we were also able to achieve high resolution, assuming perfect
pinhole collimator resolution recovery for Cardiac SPECT application.

Over recent decades, motivated either by practicality or the need to tap into new types of measurements,
the science of Magnetic Resonance has expanded into more adverse conditions: deliberately chosen
lower frequencies, inhomogeneous fields, and/or time-variable fields. In particular, Overhauser
Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (ODNP) presents a case study that challenges previous expectations
and offers an interesting test-bed for further developments. For example, an interest in the nanoscale
heterogeneities of hydration dynamics demand increasingly sophisticated and automated measurements
deploying ODNP on a modular, open source instrument operating at 15 MHz. ODNP demands the acquisition
and automated processing of large quantities of one dimensional NMR spectra, which can present
various problems: in particular, unambiguous identification of signal in newly configured instruments
presents a practical challenge, while field drift tends to remain an issue even in fully configured
instruments. Recent advances in the capabilities of open-source libraries opened up the opportunity
to address these issues at the fundamental level, by developing a specific schema that treats the
phase cycle of a pulse as an explicit "phase domain" dimension that Fourier transforms into the "coherence
domain." In particular, a standardized protocol for organizing and visualizing the resulting
data clearly presents all the information available from all coherence transfer pathways of a phase-cycled
experiment, with intelligible results that don't rely on preliminary phase corrections. It thus
organizes and visualizes data in ways that more accurately reflect the rich physics of the underlying
NMR experiments, and that more fully bear out the original fundamental concepts of coherence transfer
pathways.

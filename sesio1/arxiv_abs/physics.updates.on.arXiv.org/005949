The effects of entropic-instabilities on the laminar-turbulent transition dynamics of a blunted
flat plate at Mach $4$ are numerically investigated through linear and nonlinear approaches. Linear
wavepacket analysis reveals amplifying oblique first-modes as well as planar and oblique entropy-layer
disturbances. The receptivity of entropic-instabilities is found to be largest for actuation
seeded in the entropy-layer; the corresponding linear evolution is characterized by an intensification
in the wall-normal plane, coupled with streamwise tilting. Disturbances in the entropy-layer
interact non-linearly with each other through the oblique breakdown mechanism, inducing streamwise
streaks in the boundary-layer. These undergo further destabilization downstream leading to turbulence
onset. Different mechanisms of interest are extracted with modal decomposition techniques best
suited for each. Dynamic mode decomposition reveals sinuous subharmonic oscillations induced
by the entropic-disturbances as the dominant streak instability mechanism. On the other hand,
spectral proper orthogonal decomposition elicits the slanted hook-shaped structures in the temperature
perturbations, which are attributable to the Orr like-mechanism in the entropy-layer. Furthermore,
cross-bispectral mode decomposition shows that the temperature perturbations amplify on the
crests of the low-speed streaks in the entropy-layer and generates disturbances through triadic
interactions. These newer disturbances further interact, resulting in the transfer of perturbation
energy into the boundary-layer. This eventually leads to spanwise homogenization and near-wall
streak generation, reflecting late nonlinear stages of transition. Towards the end of breakdown
region, spectral broadening accompanied by the appearance of an inertial sub-range in the boundary-layer
indicates the approach of the flow towards turbulence.

Weakly ionised plasmas, formed in high enthalpy hypersonic flows, can be actively manipulated
via imposed magnetic fields - a concept termed magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flow control. Imposed
MHD effects, within flows which exhibit multiple shock interactions, are consequential for emerging
aerospace technologies: including aerodynamic control via magnetic actuation. However, numerical
modelling of this flow type remains challenging due to the sensitivity of feature formation and
the real gas modelling of weakly ionised, electrically conductive, air plasma. In this work, numerical
simulation capabilities have been developed for the study of MHD affected, hypersonic flows, around
2D axisymmetric non-simple geometries. The validated numerical methodology, combined with an
advanced 19 species equation of state for air plasma, achieves quantitative agreement between
simulation and experiment for a Mach 5.6 double cone geometry with applied magnetic field. Numerical
studies are conducted for varied conical surface angle and magnetic field configuration. This
paper demonstrates how, for hypersonic flows with complex shock interactions, the MHD affected
flow is not only augmented in terms of shock position, but may exhibit topological adaptations in
the fundamental flow structure. A classification system is introduced for the emergent flow topologies.
The applied numerical studies examine the mechanisms by which the magnetic field configuration
influences the MHD augmented shock structure, leading to: (1) differences in magnitude of MHD enhancement
effect, and (2) structural adaptations of the flow topology. Most critically, classes of conditions
are identified which produce topological equivalence between the magnetic interaction effects
and a generalised mechanical control surface.

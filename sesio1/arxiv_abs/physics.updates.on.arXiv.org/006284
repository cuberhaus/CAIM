Premixed flames exhibit different asymptotic regimes of interaction between heat release and
turbulence depending on their respective length scales. At high Karlovitz number, the dilatation
caused by heat release does not have any relevant effect on turbulent kinetic energy with respect
to non-reacting flow, while at low Karlovitz number, the mean shear is a sink of turbulent kinetic
energy, and counter-gradient transport is observed. This latter phenomenon is not well captured
by closure models commonly used in Large Eddy Simulations that are based on gradient diffusion.
The massive amount of data available from Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) opens the possibility
to develop data-driven models able to represent physical mechanisms and non-linear features present
in both these regimes. In this work, the databases are formed by DNSs of two planar hydrogen/air flames
at different Karlovitz numbers corresponding to the two asymptotic regimes. In this context, the
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) gives the possibility to successfully recognize and reconstruct
both gradient and counter-gradient phenomena if trained with databases where both regimes are
included. Two GAN models were first trained each for a specific Karlovitz number and tested using
the same dataset in order to verify the capability of the models to learn the features of a single asymptotic
regime and assess its accuracy. In both cases, the GAN models were able to reconstruct the Reynolds
stress subfilter scales accurately. Later, the GAN was trained with a mixture of both datasets to
create a model containing physical knowledge of both combustion regimes. This model was able to
reconstruct the subfilter scales for both cases capturing the interaction between heat release
and turbulence closely to the DNS as shown from the turbulent kinetic budget and barycentric maps.

All high field superconductors producing magnetic fields above 12 T are brittle. Nevertheless,
they will probably be the materials of choice in commercial tokamaks because the fusion power density
in a tokamak scales as the fourth power of magnetic field. Here we propose using robust, ductile superconductors
during the reactor commissioning phase in order to avoid brittle magnet failure while operational
safety margins are being established. Here we use the PROCESS systems code to inform development
strategy and to provide detailed capital-cost-minimised tokamak power plant designs. We propose
building a 'demonstrator' tokamak with an electric power output of 100 MWe, a plasma fusion gain
Qplasma = 17, a net gain Qnet = 1.3, a cost of electricity (COE) of \$ 1148 (2021 US) per MWh (at 75 % availability)
and high temperature superconducting operational TF magnets producing 5.4 T on-axis and 12.5 T
peak-field. It uses Nb-Ti training magnets and will cost about \$ 9.75 Bn (2021 US). An equivalent
500 MWe plant has a COE of \$ 608 per MW suggesting that large tokamaks may eventually dominate the
commercial market. We consider a range of designs optimised for capital cost (as the reactors considered
are pilot plants) consisting of both 100 MWe and 500 MWe plants with each of two approaches for the
magnets: training and upgrading. With training magnets, the plant is cost-optimised for REBCO
TF magnets. For a 100 MWe plant, the Nb-Ti training magnets typically produce 70 % peak field on the
toroidal field coils compared to REBCO magnets, 65 % peak field on the central solenoid and cost approx.
10 % of the total machine cost. Training magnets could in principle be reused for each of say 10 subsequent
(commercial) machines and hence at 1 % bring only marginal additional cost.

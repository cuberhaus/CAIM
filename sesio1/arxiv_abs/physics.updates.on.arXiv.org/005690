In this paper is considered nonlinear electrodynamics (NE) which does not satisfy the linear superposition
principle (LSP). Since the presentation of the special theory of relativity, it has been commonly
accepted that a famous formula E = mc^2 = m_0c^2 /(1-v^2/c^2)^(1/2) expresses the energy of a free
particle only. However, while studying the experiment for the annihilation of particle and antiparticle
and the production of the photon in terms of the law of energy conservation of particle and field,
we obtain a conclusion that E includes not only the energy of a free particle but also the energy of
its self -fields (electromagnetic field and gravitational field). Hence, a formula for the energy
in the special theory of relativity comes to have a more inclusive meaning than Einstein had thought
of it. Based upon such an idea and the correspondence principle, through introducing a new non-Euclidean
four-dimensional space, so-called KR space in which the metric is the function of coordinates and
4-velocity, we reformulate the action function to be a function defined in the nonlinear version
and from it find equation system for a charge and the field with a modified version, which is reduced
to that in the Maxwell theory under the weak field condition: here, weak field condition is given
by |U/m_0c^2|<<1, U; interactional energy. With the equation system, we show that the divergence
problem arising from the Maxwell theory, without invoking renormalization, is very naturally
solved by sensible mathematics and then demonstrate that the total energy of a free charge and its
field equals mc^2 and so the energy of an electrostatic field leads to the finite. In this course are
derived the modified version of Coulomb potential and of radiation reaction without renormalization
which contains an interference effect (a nonlinear effect that does not obey LSP).

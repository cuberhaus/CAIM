Inertial pumping is a promising new method of moving fluids through microchannels but many of its
properties remain unexplored. In this work, inertial flow rates are investigated for different
channel lengths, operating temperatures, and resistor pulse energies. Flow in closed channels
is visualized by adding fluorescent tracer beads to the test fluid (pure water). A robust methodology
of extracting flow rates from high-resolution video recordings is developed. Flow rates are found
to scale inversely with the channel length. The observed dependence is explained based on a simple
phenomenological "kick" model of inertial pumping. Flow rates are also fitted to the more fundamental
one-dimensional model of inertial pumping from which the intrinsic drive bubble strength is extracted.
The measured flow rates vary strongly with temperature. For well-developed drive bubbles, flow
rates at T = 70C are about 12x higher than at T = 30C. Three separate effects contribute to increasing
flow rates at high temperatures: (i) lower viscosity of the test fluid, (ii) a stronger drive bubble,
and (iii) increasing mechanical efficiency of the pump, i.e., better conversion of the drive bubble
strength to unidirectional post-collapse kick. Relative contributions of the three effects are
quantified. The energy dependence of flow rates exhibits a clear saturation behavior. The bubble
strength is fitted to a phenomenological saturation model. In the end, a complete predictive length-temperature-energy
model of flow rates is constructed. The observed strong temperature dependence of inertial pumping
should be considered when designing microfluidic workflows. It also highlights the need for integrated
flowmeters that could stabilize complex flow patterns via sensory feedback.

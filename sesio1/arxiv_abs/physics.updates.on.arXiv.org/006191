In this work, oblique detonation of n-heptane/air mixture in high-speed wedge flows is simulated
by solving the reactive Euler equations with a two-dimensional (2D) configuration. This is a first
attempt to model complicated hydrocarbon fuel ODWs with a detailed chemistry (44 species and 112
reactions). Effects of freestream equivalence ratios and velocities are considered, and the abrupt
and smooth transition from oblique shock to detonation are predicted. Ignition limit, ODW characteristics,
and predictability of the transition mode are discussed. Firstly, homogeneous constant-volume
ignition calculations are performed for both fuel-lean and stoichiometric mixtures. The results
show that the ignition delay generally increases with the wedge angle. However, a negative wedge
angle dependence is observed, due to the negative temperature coefficient effects. The wedge angle
range for successful ignition of n-heptane/air mixtures decreases when the wedge length is reduced.
From 2D simulations of stationary ODWs, the initiation length generally decreases with the freestream
equivalence ratio, but the transition length exhibits weakly non-monotonic dependence. Smooth
ODW typically occurs for lean conditions (equivalence ratio < 0.4). The interactions between shock
/ compression waves and chemical reaction inside the induction zone are also studied with the chemical
explosive mode analysis. Moreover, the predictability of the shock-to-detonation transition
mode is explored through quantifying the relation between ignition delay and chemical excitation
time. It is demonstrated that the ignition delay (excitation time) increases (decreases) with
the freestream equivalence ratio for the three studied oncoming flow velocities. Smaller excitation
time corresponds to stronger pressure waves from the ignition location behind OSW.

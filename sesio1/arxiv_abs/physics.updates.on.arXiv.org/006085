In this study, by attempting to eliminate the disadvantageous complexity of the existing particle
generators, we present a discrete probabilistic scheme adapted for the discrete energy spectra
in the GEANT4 simulations. In our multi-binned approach, we initially compute the discrete probabilities
for each energy bin, the number of which is flexible depending on the computational goal, and we solely
satisfy the imperative condition that requires the sum of the discrete probabilities to be the unity.
Regarding the implementation in GEANT4, we construct a one-dimensional probability grid that
consists of sub-cells equaling the number of the energy bin, and each cell represents the discrete
probability of each energy bin by fulfilling the unity condition. Through uniformly generating
random numbers between 0 and 1, we assign the discrete energy in accordance with the associated generated
random number that corresponds to a specific cell in the probability grid. This probabilistic methodology
does not only permits us to discretize the continuous energy spectra based on the Monte Carlo generators,
but it also gives a unique access to utilize the experimental energy spectra measured at the distinct
particle flux values. Ergo, we initially perform our simulations by discretizing the muon energy
spectrum acquired via the CRY generator over the energy interval between 0 and 8 GeV along with the
measurements from the BESS spectrometer and we determine the average scattering angle, the root-mean-square
of the scattering angle, and the number of the muon absorption by using a series of slabs consisting
of aluminum, copper, iron, lead, and uranium. Eventually, we express a computational strategy
in the GEANT4 simulations that grants us the ability to verify as well as to modify the energy spectrum
depending on the nature of the information source in addition to the exceptional tracking speed.

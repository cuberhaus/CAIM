Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flow of liquid metals through conduits play an important role in the
proposed systems for harnessing fusion energy, and various other engineering and scientific problems.
The interplay between the magnetic fields and the fluid motion gives rise to complex flow physics,
which depend on the electrical conductivity of the bounding walls. An effective approach to represent
the latter is via the Shercliff boundary condition for thin conducting walls relating the induced
magnetic field and its wall normal gradient at the boundary via a parameter referred to as the wall
conductance ratio (Shercliff, JA, J. Fluid Mech. 1, 644 (1956)). Within the framework of the highly
parallelizable lattice Boltzmann (LB) method, a lattice kinetic scheme for MHD involving a vector
distribution function for the magnetic fields was proposed by Dellar (Dellar, PJ, J. Comp. Phys.
179, 95 (2002)). However, the prior LB algorithms only accounted for limiting special cases involving
perfectly insulated boundaries and did not consider the finite conductivity effects. In this paper,
we present two new boundary schemes that enforce the Shercliff boundary condition in the LB schemes
for MHD. It allows for the specification of the wall conductance ratio to any desired value based
on the actual conductivities and length scales of the container and the wall thicknesses. One approach
is constructed using a link-based formulation involving a weighted combination of the bounce back
and anti-bounce back of the distribution function for the magnetic field and the other approach
involves an on-node moment-based implementation. Moreover, their extensions to representing
moving walls are also presented. Numerical validations of the boundary schemes for body force or
shear driven MHD flows for a wide range of the values of the wall conductance ratio and their second
order grid convergence are demonstrated.

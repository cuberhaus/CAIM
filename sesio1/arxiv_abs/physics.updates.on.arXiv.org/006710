The halo-mediated inverse cascade is a key feature of the intermediate statistically steady state
for self-gravitating collisionless dark matter flow (SG-CFD). How the inverse mass and energy
cascade maximize system entropy and develop limiting velocity/energy distributions are fundamental
questions to answer. We present a statistical theory concerning the maximum entropy distributions
of velocity, speed, and energy for system involving a power-law interaction with an arbitrary exponent
$n$. For $-2<n<0$ (long-range interaction with $n=-1$ for gravity), a broad spectrum of halos and
halo groups are necessary to form from inverse mass cascade to maximize system entropy. While velocity
in each halo group is still Gaussian, velocity distribution in entire system can be non-Gaussian.
With virial equilibrium for mechanical equilibrium in halo groups, the maximum entropy principle
is applied for statistical equilibrium of global system to derive the limiting velocity distribution
(the \textit{X} distribution). Halo mass function is not required in this formulation, but a direct
result of maximizing entropy. The predicted velocity (\textit{X}) distribution involves a shape
parameter $\alpha$ that is dependent on the exponent $n$. Velocity distribution approaches Laplacian
with $\alpha\rightarrow0$ and Gaussian with $\alpha\rightarrow\infty$. For intermediate $\alpha$,
distribution naturally exhibits a Gaussian core at small velocity and exponential wings at large
velocity. The total energy $\epsilon$ of dark matter particles at a given speed $v$ follows a parabolic
scaling for small speed ($\epsilon \propto v^2$) and linear scaling ($\epsilon \propto v$) for
large speed, which might be relevant to understand the deep-MOND behavior in MOND theory. Results
are compared with N-body simulations with good agreement.

Medium- and high-entropy alloys based on the CrCoNi-system have been shown to display outstanding
strength, tensile ductility and fracture toughness (damage-tolerance properties), especially
at cryogenic temperatures. Here we examine the JIc and (back-calculated) KJIc fracture toughness
values of the face-centered cubic, equiatomic CrCoNi and CrMnFeCoNi alloys at 20 K. At flow stress
values of ~1.5 GPa, crack-initiation KJIc toughnesses were found to be exceptionally high, respectively
235 and 415 MPa(square-root)m for CrMnFeCoNi and CrCoNi, with the latter displaying a crack-growth
toughness Kss exceeding 540 MPa(square-root)m after 2.25 mm of stable cracking, which to our knowledge
is the highest such value ever reported. Characterization of the crack-tip regions in CrCoNi by
scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy reveal deformation structures at 20 K
that are quite distinct from those at higher temperatures and involve heterogeneous nucleation,
but restricted growth, of stacking faults and fine nano-twins, together with transformation to
the hexagonal closed-packed phase. The coherent interfaces of these features can promote both
the arrest and transmission of dislocations to generate respectively strength and ductility which
strongly contributes to sustained strain hardening. Indeed, we believe that these nominally single-phase,
concentrated solid-solution alloys develop their fracture resistance through a progressive
synergy of deformation mechanisms, including dislocation glide, stacking-fault formation,
nano-twinning and eventually in situ phase transformation, all of which serve to extend continuous
strain hardening which simultaneously elevates strength and ductility (by delaying plastic instability),
leading to truly exceptional resistance to fracture.

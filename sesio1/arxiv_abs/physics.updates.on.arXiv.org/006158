Next generation online and real-time adaptive radiotherapy workflows require precise particle
transport simulations in sub-second times, which is unfeasible with current analytical pencil
beam algorithms (PBA) or stochastic Monte Carlo (MC) methods. We present a data-driven millisecond
speed dose calculation algorithm (DoTA) accurately predicting the dose deposited by mono-energetic
proton pencil beams for arbitrary energies and patient geometries. Given the forward-scattering
nature of protons, we frame 3D particle transport as modeling a sequence of 2D geometries in the beam's
eye view. DoTA combines convolutional neural networks extracting spatial features (e.g., tissue
and density contrasts) with a transformer self-attention backbone that routes information between
the sequence of geometry slices and a vector representing the beam's energy, and is trained to predict
low noise MC simulations of proton beamlets using 80,000 different head and neck, lung, and prostate
geometries. Predicting beamlet doses in 5 ms with a very high gamma pass rate of 99.37% (1%, 3 mm) compared
to the ground truth MC calculations, DoTA significantly improves upon analytical pencil beam algorithms
both in precision and speed. Offering MC accuracy 100 times faster than PBAs for pencil beams, our
model calculates full treatment plan doses in 10 to 15 s depending on the number of beamlets, achieving
a 99.70% (2%, 2 mm) gamma pass rate across 9 test patients. Outperforming all previous analytical
pencil beam and deep learning based approaches, DoTA represents a new state of the art in data-driven
dose calculation and can directly compete with the speed of even commercial GPU MC approaches. Providing
the sub-second speed required for adaptive treatments, straightforward implementations could
offer similar benefits to other steps of the radiotherapy workflow or other modalities such as helium
or carbon treatments.

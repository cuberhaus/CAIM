In this work we implement the real-time time-dependent block-orthogonalized Manby-Miller embedding
(rt-BOMME) approach alongside our previously developed real-time frozen density embedding time-dependent
density functional theory (rt-TDDFT-in-DFT FDE) code, and investigate these methods' performance
in reproducing X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) obtained with standard rt-TDDFT simulations, for
model systems comprised of solvated fluoride and chloride ions ([X@(H$_2$O)$_8$]$^-$, X = F, Cl).
We observe that, for ground-state quantities such as core orbital energies, the BOMME approach
shows significantly better agreement with supermolecular results than FDE for the strongly interacting
fluoride system, while for chloride the two embedding approaches show more similar results. For
the excited states, we see that while FDE (constrained not to have the environment densities relaxed
in the ground state) is in good agreement with the reference calculations for the region around the
K and L$_1$ edge, and is capable of reproducing the splitting of the $\mathrm{1s^{1} (n+1)p^1}$
final states ($n+1$ being the lowest virtual p orbital of the halides), it by and large fails to properly
reproduce the $\mathrm{1s^{1} (n+2)p{^1}}$ states and misses the electronic states arising from
excitation to orbitals with important contributions from the solvent. The BOMME results, on the
other hand, provide a faithful qualitative representation of the spectra in all energy regions
considered, though its intrinsic approximation of employing a lower-accuracy exchange-correlation
functional for the environment induces non-negligible shifts in peak positions for the excitations
from the halide to the environment. Our results thus confirm that QM/QM embedding approaches are
viable alternatives to standard real-time simulations of X-ray absorption spectra of species
in complex or confined environments.

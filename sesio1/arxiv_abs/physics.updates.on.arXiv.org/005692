In this article, the stability of a complex plasma monolayer levitating in the sheath of the poweredelectrode
of an asymmetric capacitively coupled radio-frequency argon discharge is studied. Com-pared
to earlier studies, a better integration of the experimental results and theory is achieved byoperating
with actual experimental control parameters such as the gas pressure and the dischargepower. It
is shown that for a given microparticle monolayer at a fixed discharge power there existtwo threshold
pressures: (i) above a specific pressure p cryst , the monolayer always crystallises; (ii)below
a specific pressure p MCI , the crystalline monolayer undergoes the mode-coupling instability
andthe two-dimensional complex plasma crystal melts. In-between p MCI and p cryst , the microparticlemonolayer
can be either in the fluid phase or the crystal phase: when increasing the pressure frombelow p MCI
, the monolayer remains in the fluid phase until it reaches p cryst at which it recrystallises;when
decreasing the pressure from above p cryst , the monolayer remains in the crystalline phase untilit
reaches p MCI at which the mode-coupling instability is triggered and the crystal melts. A simpleself-consistent
sheath model is used to calculate the rf sheath profile, the microparticle charges and themicroparticle
resonance frequency as a function of power and background argon pressure. Combinedwith calculation
of the lattice modes the main trends of p MCI as a function of power and backgroundargon pressure are
recovered. The threshold of the mode-coupling instability in the crystalline phaseis dominated
by the crossing of the longitudinal in-plane lattice mode and the out-of plane latticemode induced
by the change of the sheath profile. Ion wakes are shown to have a significant effecttoo.

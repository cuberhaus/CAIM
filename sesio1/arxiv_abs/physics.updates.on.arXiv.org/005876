A recently proposed classical field theory in which Maxwell's equations are replaced by an equation
that couples the Maxwell tensor to the Riemann-Christoffel curvature tensor in a fundamentally
new way is reviewed and extended. This proposed geometrization of the Maxwell tensor provides a
succinct framework for the classical Maxwell equations which are left intact as a derivable consequence.
Beyond providing a basis for the classical Maxwell equations, the coupling of the Riemann-Christoffel
curvature tensor to the Maxwell tensor leads to the emergence of gravity, with all solutions of the
proposed theory also being solutions of Einstein's equation of General Relativity augmented by
a term that can mimic the properties of dark matter and/or dark energy. Both electromagnetic and
gravitational phenomena are put an equal footing with both being tied to the curvature of space-time.
Using specific solutions to the proposed theory, the unification brought to electromagnetic and
gravitational phenomena as well as the consistency of solutions with those of the classical Maxwell
and Einstein field equations is emphasized throughout. Unique to the proposed theory and based
on specific solutions are the emergence of antimatter and its behavior in gravitational fields,
the emergence of dark matter and dark energy mimicking terms in the context of General Relativity,
an underlying relationship between electromagnetic and gravitational radiation, and the impossibility
of negative mass solutions that would generate repulsive gravitational fields or antigravity.
Finally, a method for quantizing the charge, mass, and angular momentum of particle-like solutions
as well as the possibility of superluminal transport of specific curvature related quantities
is conjectured.

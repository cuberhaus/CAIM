To achieve high thermal conductivity (k) of polymer graphene nanocomposites, it is critically
important to achieve efficient thermal coupling between graphene and its surrounding polymers
through effective functionalization schemes. In this work, we demonstrate that edge-functionalization
of graphene nanoplatelets (GnPs) can enable a larger enhancement of effective thermal conductivity
in polymer-graphene nanocomposites, relative to basal plane functionalization. Effective thermal
conductivity for edge case is predicted, through molecular dynamics simulations, to be up to 48%
higher relative to basal plane bonding for 35 wt.% graphene loading with 10 layers thick nanoplatelets.
This unique result opens up promising new avenues for achieving high thermal-conductivity polymer
materials, which is of key importance for a wide range of thermal management technologies. The anisotropy
of thermal transport in single layer graphene leads to very high in-plane thermal conductivity
(~2000 W/mK) compared to the low out-of-plane thermal conductivity (~10 W/mK). Likewise, in multilayer
graphene nanoplatelet (GnP), the thermal conductivity across the layers is even lower due to the
weak van der Waals bonding between each pair of layers. Edge functionalization couples the polymer
chains to the high in-plane thermal conduction pathway of graphene, thus leading to high overall
high composite thermal conductivity. Basal-plane functionalization, however, lowers the thermal
resistance between the polymer and the surface graphene sheets of the nanoplatelet only, causing
the heat conduction through inner layers to be less efficient, thus resulting in basal plane scheme
to be outperformed by edge scheme. The present study fundamentally enables novel pathways for achieving
high thermal-conductivity polymer composites.

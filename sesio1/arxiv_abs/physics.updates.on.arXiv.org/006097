NISQ era devices suffer from a number of challenges like limited qubit connectivity, short coherence
times and sizable gate error rates. Thus, quantum algorithms are desired that require shallow circuit
depths and low qubit counts to take advantage of these devices. We attempt to realize this with the
help of classical quantum chemical theories of canonical transformation and explicit correlation.
In this work, compact ab initio Hamiltonians are generated classically through an approximate
similarity transformation of the Hamiltonian with a) an explicitly correlated two-body unitary
operator with generalized pair excitations that remove the Coulombic electron-electron singularities
from the Hamiltonian and b) a unitary one-body operator to efficiently capture the orbital relaxation
effects required for accurate description of the excited states. The resulting transcorelated
Hamiltonians are able to describe both ground and excited states of molecular systems in a balanced
manner. Using the fermionic-ADAPT-VQE method based on the unitary coupled cluster with singles
and doubles (UCCSD) ansatz and only a minimal basis set (ANO-RCC-MB), we demonstrate that the transcorrelated
Hamiltonians can produce ground state energies comparable to the much larger cc-pVTZ basis. This
leads to a potential reduction in the number of required CNOT gates by more than three orders of magnitude
for the chemical species studied in this work. Furthermore, using the qEOM formalism in conjunction
with the transcorrelated Hamiltonian, we reduce the errors in excitation energies by an order of
magnitude. The transcorrelated Hamiltonians developed here are Hermitian and contain only one-
and two-body interaction terms and thus can be easily combined with any quantum algorithm for accurate
electronic structure simulations.

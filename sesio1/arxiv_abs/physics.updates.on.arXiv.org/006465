This paper introduces a sharp-interface approach to simulating fluid-structure interaction
involving flexible bodies described by general nonlinear material models and across a broad range
of mass density ratios. This new flexible-body immersed Lagrangian-Eulerian (ILE) approach incorporates
the geometrical and domain solution flexibility of the immersed boundary (IB) method with an accuracy
comparable to body-fitted approaches that sharply resolve flows and stresses up to the fluid-structure
interface. Unlike many IB methods, our ILE formulation uses distinct momentum equations for the
fluid and solid subregions with a Dirichlet-Neumann coupling strategy that connects fluid and
solid subproblems through simple interface conditions. We use a penalty method involving two representations
of the fluid-structure interface. These two representations are connected by approximate Lagrange
multiplier forces that impose kinematic interface conditions. This approach also enables the
use of multi-rate time stepping, which allows us to take different time step sizes for the fluid and
structure subproblems. Our fluid solver relies on an immersed interface method for discrete surfaces
to impose stress jump conditions along complex interfaces. The dynamics of the volumetric structural
mesh are determined using a standard finite element approach to large-deformation nonlinear elasticity
via a nearly incompressible solid mechanics formulation. This formulation also readily accommodates
compressible structures for cases in which part of the solid boundary does not contact the incompressible
fluid. Comparisons are made with computational and experimental benchmarks. We also demonstrate
the capabilities of this methodology by applying it to model the transport and capture of a cylindrical
blood clot in an inferior vena cava filter.

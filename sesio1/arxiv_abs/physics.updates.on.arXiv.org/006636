We show the impact that stretching and mixing has on the fate of plumes of waterborne contaminant
solutes transported though a chemically heterogeneous, partially adsorbing, porous medium,
at a typical P\'eclet number characterizing saturated flows in subsurfaces, $\textit{Pe}= O(1)$.
Via pore-scale lattice Boltzmann simulations, we follow the dynamic of a passive scalar injected
in a packed bed consisting of a mixture of chemically inert and adsorbing spherical particles. By
varying the fraction of the adsorbers, uniform randomly distributed in the porous volume, and the
adsorption rate, we find that the solute differentiates to form different plumes emerging between
pairs of adsorbing particles. The plumes are stretched at a rate linearly increasing with time and
inversely proportional to the adsorbers' interparticle dimensionless distance $\ell_\xi^*=\ell_\xi/d$,
with $d$ being the pore size. This stretching process competes with diffusion broadening to determine
the characteristic small-scale scalar concentration width $\sigma_B$, which results $\sigma_B/d\propto({\textit{Pe}/\ell_\xi^*})^{-1/2}$,
larger than the characteristic pore size, that is $\sigma_B>d$. Because of the latter condition,
small scalar structures overlap among adjacent pores until mass transport and adsorption are equilibrated
at a time $t_\xi$, when the plume is well-mixed at a larger scale, corresponding to its transverse
cross-section dimension. The plume mixing rate related to the average flow velocity $1/(U t_\xi
)$ very well approximates a macrohomogeneous adsorption coefficient, thus predicting the macroscopic
adsorption process and the probability of solute leakage from the porous volume. On the basis of
these observations, we also derive the probability of formation of large solute plume volumes,
which we find to exponentially decay with large $\ell_\xi^*$ and small fraction of adsorbers.

The last IPCC assessment states that clouds and aerosols remain a challenge in climate prediction
with Global Climate Models. Therefore, NASA's 2017 Decadal Survey has made them, along with convection
and precipitation, a priority target for future missions under the ACCP banner, now Atmospheric
Observing System. Atmospheric science is now more than ever driving renewal in remote sensing to
probe clouds and aerosols more accurately and with improved sampling. Here, we bring new results
that support Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) using oxygen absorption features
in the visible/near-IR spectrum. With known concentration and cross-section, the remaining unknown
in O$_2$ DOAS is the path the light followed through the absorbing gas. In presence of scattering
by cloud or aerosol particles, that path is broken at each interaction. Cumulative pathlength through
the gas is a random variable, and its probability distribution function (PDF) will contain desirable
information about the clouds or aerosols. Here, we compute statistical moments of the that PDF,
showing that mean and variance convey different pieces of information, namely, size and opacity
of the medium. We also extend the connection between geometric thickness and mean pathlength in
presence of absorption by the scattering particles. We view pathlength moments as intermediate
products that can be obtained from O$_2$ spectroscopy, and describe an algorithm to do that. In turn,
these moments yield cloud or aerosol profile parameters of interest: layer geometric and optical
thicknesses. One normally thinks about active sensors, radars and lidars, for such atmospheric
profiling. Here, the profile is parameterized and representative of a horizontal average determined
by multiple scattering. However, there are advantages in passive vs active instrumentation, starting
with the possibility of imaging over a large swath.

Predicting geomagnetic conditions based on in-situ solar wind observations allows us to evade
disasters caused by large electromagnetic disturbances originating from the Sun to save lives
and protect economic activity. In this study, we aimed to examine the relationship between the Kp
index, representing global magnetospheric activity level, and solar wind conditions using an
interpretable neural network known as potential learning (PL). Data analyses based on neural networks
are difficult to interpret; however, PL learns by focusing on the "potentiality of input neurons"
and can identify which inputs are significantly utilized by the network. Using the full advantage
of PL, we extracted the influential solar wind parameters that disturb the magnetosphere under
southward Interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) conditions. The input parameters of PL were the
three components of the IMF (Bx, By, -Bz(Bs)), solar wind flow speed (Vx), and proton number density
(Np) in geocentric solar ecliptic (GSE) coordinates obtained from the OMNI solar wind database
between 1998 and 2019. Furthermore, we classified these input parameters into two groups (targets),
depending on the Kp level: Kp = 6- to 9 (positive target) and Kp = 0 to 1+ (negative target). Negative
target samples were randomly selected to ensure that numbers of positive and negative targets were
equal. The PL results revealed that solar wind flow speed is an influential parameter for increasing
Kp under southward IMF conditions, which was in good agreement with previous reports on the statistical
relationship between the Kp index and solar wind velocity, and the Kp formulation based on the IMF
and solar wind plasma parameters. Based on this new neural network, we aim to construct a more correct
and parameter-dependent space weather forecasting model.

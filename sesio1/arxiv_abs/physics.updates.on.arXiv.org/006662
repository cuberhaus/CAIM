The time instant -- the first-passage time (FPT) -- when a diffusive particle (e.g., a ligand such
as oxygen or a signalling protein) for the first time reaches an immobile target located on the surface
of a bounded three-dimensional domain (e.g., a hemoglobin molecule or the cellular nucleus) is
a decisive characteristic time-scale in diverse biophysical and biochemical processes, as well
as in intermediate stages of various inter- and intra-cellular signal transduction pathways.
Adam and Delbr\"uck put forth the reduction-of-dimensionality concept, according to which a ligand
first binds non-specifically to any point of the surface on which the target is placed and then diffuses
along this surface until it locates the target. In this work, we analyse the efficiency of such a scenario
and confront it with the efficiency of a direct search process, in which the target is approached
directly from the bulk and not aided by surface diffusion. We consider two situations: (i) a single
ligand is launched from a fixed or a random position and searches for the target, and (ii) the case
of "amplified" signals when $N$ ligands start either from the same point or from random positions,
and the search terminates when the fastest of them arrives to the target. For such settings, we go
beyond the conventional analyses, which compare only the mean values of the corresponding FPTs.
Instead, we calculate the full probability density function of FPTs for both scenarios and study
its integral characteristic -- the "survival" probability of a target up to time $t$. On this basis,
we examine how the efficiencies of both scenarios are controlled by a variety of parameters and single
out realistic conditions in which the reduction-of-dimensionality scenario outperforms the
direct search.

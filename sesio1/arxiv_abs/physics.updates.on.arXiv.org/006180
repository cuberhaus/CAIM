A computational analysis is presented to qualify traditional and fractal vane-in-cup geometries
for the rheometry of simple viscoplastic fluids with and without slip. Numerical simulations based
on an adaptive augmented Lagrangian scheme are used to study the full two-dimensional flow field
of yield-stress fluids within and around vane tools with $N=3$ to $24$ arms for a wide range of Bingham
numbers, $\mathcal{B}$ (i.e.~the ratio of the yield stress over the characteristic viscous stress).
This allows for accurate calculations of the velocity and stress fields around vanes with varying
geometry, as well as direct comparison to experimental observations of the output torque measured
by a rheometer, revealing sources of variation and error. We describe the impact of the vane structure
on the fluid velocity field, from few-arm cruciform vanes ($N\leq6$) that significantly perturb
the flow away from ideal azimuthal kinematics, to many-arm fractal vanes ($N\geq12$) in which the
internal structural features are successfully "cloaked" by a yield surface. This results in the
shearing of an almost-circular ring of viscoplastic fluid that is indistinguishable from the annular
ring of fluid deformed around a slip-free rotating cylindrical bob and leads to more accurate rheometric
measurements of the material flow curve. Moreover, in direct comparison with data from previous
literature, we show that slip conditions on the vane surface do not impact the velocity field or measured
overall torque $\mathcal{T}$, while slip conditions on a smooth outer wall have significant impact
on data, even when using a vane geometry. Finally, we describe the impact of vane topography and Bingham
number, $\mathcal{B}$, on the measured torque and rheometric accuracy of vane-in-cup geometries
for "simple" (inelastic) yield-stress fluids described by either the Bingham plastic or Herschel-Bulkley
constitutive model.

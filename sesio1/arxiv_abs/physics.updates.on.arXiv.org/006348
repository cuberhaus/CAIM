Lasers with hertz-level linewidths on timescales up to seconds are critical for precision metrology,
timekeeping, and manipulation of quantum systems. Such frequency stability typically relies
on bulk-optic lasers and reference cavities, where increased size is leveraged to improve noise
performance, but with the trade-off of cost, hand assembly, and limited application environments.
On the other hand, planar waveguide lasers and cavities exploit the benefits of CMOS scalability
but are fundamentally limited from achieving hertz-level linewidths at longer times by stochastic
noise and thermal sensitivity inherent to the waveguide medium. These physical limits have inhibited
the development of compact laser systems with frequency noise required for portable optical clocks
that have performance well beyond conventional microwave counterparts. In this work, we break
this paradigm to demonstrate a compact, high-coherence laser system at 1548 nm with a 1 s integrated
linewidth of 1.1 Hz and fractional frequency instability less than 10$^{-14}$ from 1 ms to 1 s. The
frequency noise at 1 Hz offset is suppressed by 11 orders of magnitude from that of the free-running
diode laser down to the cavity thermal noise limit near 1 Hz$^2$/Hz, decreasing to 10$^{-3}$ Hz$^2$/Hz
at 4 kHz offset. This low noise performance leverages wafer-scale integrated lasers together with
an 8 mL vacuum-gap cavity that employs micro-fabricated mirrors with sub-angstrom roughness to
yield an optical $Q$ of 11.8 billion. Significantly, all the critical components are lithographically
defined on planar substrates and hold the potential for parallel high-volume manufacturing. Consequently,
this work provides an important advance towards compact lasers with hertz-level linewidths for
applications such as portable optical clocks, low-noise RF photonic oscillators, and related
communication and navigation systems.

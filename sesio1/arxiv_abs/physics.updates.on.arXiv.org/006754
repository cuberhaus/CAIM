The Hamiltonian of a pure hydrogen atom possesses the SO(4) symmetry group generated by the integrals
of motion: the angular momentum and the Runge-Lenz vector. The pure hydrogen atom is a supersymmetric
and superintegrable system, since the Hamilton-Jacobi and the Schr\"odinger equations are separable
in several different coordinate systems and has an exact analytical solution. The Schr\"odinger
equation for a hydrogen atom in a uniform electric field (Stark effect) is separable in parabolic
coordinates. The system has two conserved quantities: z-projections of the generalized Runge-Lenz
vector and of the angular momentum. The problem is integrable and has the symmetry group SO(2)xSO(2).
The ion of the hydrogen molecule (problem of two Coulomb centers) has similar symmetry group SO(2)xSO(2)
generated by two conserved z-projections of the generalized Runge-Lenz and of the angular momentum
on the internuclear axis. The corresponding Schr\"odinger equation is separable in the elliptical
coordinates. For the hydrogen atom in a uniform magnetic field, the respective Schr\"odinger equation
is not separable. The problem is non-separable and non-integrable and is considered as a representative
example of quantum chaos that cannot be solved by any analytical method. Nevertheless, an exact
analytical solution describing the quantum states of a hydrogen atom in a uniform magnetic field
can be obtained as a convergent power series in two variables, the radius and the sine of the polar
angle. The energy levels and wave functions for the ground and excited states can be calculated exactly,
with any desired accuracy, for an arbitrary strength of the magnetic field. Therefore, the problem
can be considered superintegrable, although it does not possess supersymmetry and additional
integrals of motion.

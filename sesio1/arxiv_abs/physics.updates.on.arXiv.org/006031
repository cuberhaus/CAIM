Time delay estimation (TDE) between two radio-frequency (RF) frames is one of the major steps of
quasi-static ultrasound elastography, which detects tissue pathology by estimating its mechanical
properties. Regularized optimization-based techniques, a prominent class of TDE algorithms,
optimize a non-linear energy functional consisting of data constancy and spatial continuity constraints
to obtain the displacement and strain maps between the time-series frames under consideration.
The existing optimization-based TDE methods often consider the L2-norm of displacement derivatives
to construct the regularizer. However, such a formulation over-penalizes the displacement irregularity
and poses two major issues to the estimated strain field. First, the boundaries between different
tissues are blurred. Second, the visual contrast between the target and the background is suboptimal.
To resolve these issues, herein, we propose a novel TDE algorithm where instead of L2-, L1-norms
of both first- and second-order displacement derivatives are taken into account to devise the continuity
functional. We handle the non-differentiability of L1-norm by smoothing the absolute value function's
sharp corner and optimize the resulting cost function in an iterative manner. We call our technique
Second-Order Ultrasound eLastography with L1-norm spatial regularization (L1-SOUL). In terms
of both sharpness and visual contrast, L1-SOUL substantially outperforms GLUE, OVERWIND, and
SOUL, three recently published TDE algorithms in all validation experiments performed in this
study. In cases of simulated, phantom, and in vivo datasets, respectively, L1-SOUL achieves 67.8%,
46.81%, and 117.35% improvements of contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) over SOUL. The L1-SOUL code

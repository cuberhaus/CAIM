Cardiac pulsation is a physiological confound of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
time-series that introduces spurious signal fluctuations in proximity to blood vessels. fMRI
alone is not sufficiently fast to resolve cardiac pulsation. Depending on the ratio between the
instantaneous heart-rate and the acquisition sampling frequency (1/TR, with TR being the repetition
time), the cardiac signal may alias into the frequency band of neural activation. The introduction
of simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) imaging has significantly reduced the chances of cardiac aliasing.
However, the necessity of covering the entire brain at high spatial resolution restrain the shortest
TR to just over 0.5 seconds, which is in turn not sufficiently short to resolve cardiac pulsation
beyond 60 beats per minute. Recently, hyper-sampling of the fMRI time-series has been introduced
to overcome this issue. While each anatomical location is sampled every TR seconds, the time between
consecutive excitations is shorter and thus adequate to resolve cardiac pulsation. In this study,
we show that it is feasible to temporally and spatially resolve cardiac waveforms at each voxel location
by combining a dedicated hyper-sampling decomposition scheme with SMS. We developed the technique
on 774 healthy subjects selected from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and validated the technology
against the RETROICOR method. The proposed approach, which we name Data-driven WHOle-brain CArdiac
signal REgression from highly accelerated simultaneous multi-Slice fMRI acquisitions (WHOCARES),
is fully data-driven, does not make specific assumptions on cardiac pulsatility, and is independent
from external physiological recordings so that the retrospective correction of fMRI data becomes
possible when such measurements are not available. WHOCARES is freely available at https://github.com/gferrazzi/WHOCARES.

Cold plasma technologies are an efficient approach to improve the germination properties of seeds,
especially in a stacking configuration within a dielectric barrier device. In such dry atmospheric
plasma priming process, we show that a He-N2 plasma treatment of 20 min can reduce the median germination
time of lentil seeds from 1420 min to 1145 minutes, ie a gain in vigor of 275 min (or +19.4 %). Considering
that this result depends on the plasma-seed interaction and therefore on the contact surfaces between
the seeds and the plasma, a topographic modeling of a 100 seeds-stack is performed in the dielectric
barrier device. This model drives to the distinction between the seed-seed contact surfaces (276
contacts standing for a total area of 230.6 mm2) and the seed-wall contact surfaces (134 contacts
standing for a total area of 105.9 mm2). After a single plasma treatment, the outer envelope of each
seed is 92% exposed to plasma: a value high enough to support the relevance of the plasma process but
which also opens the way to process optimizations. In this outlook, we propose to replace the single
20-minute plasma treatment by a "plasma sequence", ie a succession of shorter plasma treatments
whose total duration remains 20 min. Between two successive plasma treatments, the seeds can follow
either a trapping procedure (seeds in same positions and orientations) or a randomizing procedure
(seeds in same positions but reoriented) or a stirring procedure (seeds vigorously shaken). A sequence
of 10 plasma treatments (upon 2 min) separated by short stirring procedures leads to a gain in vigor
as high as 405 min vs 275 min for a single plasma treatment of 20 min. We propose to understand these
results by correlating the gain in vigor with the water uptake of the seeds and the wettability state
of their coating.

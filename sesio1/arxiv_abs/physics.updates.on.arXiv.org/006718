Neutron grating interferometry provides information on phase and small-angle scatter in addition
to attenuation. Previously, phase grating moir\'e interferometers (PGMI) with two or three phase
gratings have been developed. These phase-grating systems use the moir\'e far-field technique
to avoid the need for high-aspect absorption gratings used in Talbot-Lau interferometers (TLI)
which reduce the neutron flux reaching the detector. We demonstrate through simulations a novel
phase grating interferometer system for cold neutrons that requires a single modulated phase grating
(MPG) for phase-contrast imaging, as opposed to the two or three phase gratings in previously employed
PGMI systems. We compare the MPG system to experiments in the literature that use a two-phase-grating-based
PGMI with best-case visibility of around 39% (Pushin et al. 2017). The simulations of the MPG system
show improved visibility in comparison to that two-phase-grating-based PGMI. For example, an
MPG with a modulation period of 120 micron, pitch of 1 micron, and grating heights with a phase modulation
of (${\pi}$,${\pi}/4$), illuminated by a monochromatic beam, produces visibility of 85% with
a comparable source-to-detector distance (SDD) as the two-phase-grating-based PGMI. Phase sensitivity,
another important performance metric of the grating interferometer was compared to values available
in the literature, viz. the conventional TLI with phase sensitivity of 4.5 x 10^3 for an SDD of 3.5
m and a beam wavelength of 0.44 nm (Kim et al. 2014). For a range of modulation periods, the MPG system
provides comparable or greater theoretical maximum phase sensitivity of 4.1 x 10^3 to 10.0 x 10^3
for SDDs of up to 3.5 m. This proposed MPG system appears capable of providing high-performance PGMI
that obviates the need for the alignment of 2 phase gratings.

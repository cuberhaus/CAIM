We propose to use techniques from Bayesian inference and deep neural networks to translate uncertainty
in seismic imaging to uncertainty in tasks performed on the image, such as horizon tracking. Seismic
imaging is an ill-posed inverse problem because of bandwidth and aperture limitations, which is
hampered by the presence of noise and linearization errors. Many regularization methods, such
as transform-domain sparsity promotion, have been designed to deal with the adverse effects of
these errors, however, these methods run the risk of biasing the solution and do not provide information
on uncertainty in the image space and how this uncertainty impacts certain tasks on the image. A systematic
approach is proposed to translate uncertainty due to noise in the data to confidence intervals of
automatically tracked horizons in the image. The uncertainty is characterized by a convolutional
neural network (CNN) and to assess these uncertainties, samples are drawn from the posterior distribution
of the CNN weights, used to parameterize the image. Compared to traditional priors, it is argued
in the literature that these CNNs introduce a flexible inductive bias that is a surprisingly good
fit for a diverse set of problems. The method of stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics is employed
to sample from the posterior distribution. This method is designed to handle large scale Bayesian
inference problems with computationally expensive forward operators as in seismic imaging. Aside
from offering a robust alternative to maximum a posteriori estimate that is prone to overfitting,
access to these samples allow us to translate uncertainty in the image, due to noise in the data, to
uncertainty on the tracked horizons. For instance, it admits estimates for the pointwise standard
deviation on the image and for confidence intervals on its automatically tracked horizons.

In Stathas and Stefanou (2022) we presented the frictional response of a bounded fault gouge under
largecoseismic slip. We did so by taking into account the evolution of the Principal Slip Zone (PSZ)
thickness using a Cosserat micromorphic continuum model for the description of the fault's mechanical
response. The numerical results obtained differ significantly from those predicted by the established
model of thermal pressurization during slip on a mathematical plane (see Mase and Smith (1987);
Rice (2006a); Platt et al. (2014a) among others). These differences prompt us to reconsider the
basic assumptions of a stationary strain localization on an unbounded domain present in the original
model. We depart from these assumptions, extending the model to incorporate different strain localization
modes, temperature and pore fluid pressure boundary conditions. The new model allows us to gain
significant understanding of the detailed numerical results of Part I. We investigate the influence
of a traveling strain localization inside the fault gouge considering isothermal, drained boundary
conditions for the bounded and unbounded domain respectively. Our results establish that when
a stationary strain localization profile is applied on a bounded domain, the boundary conditions
lead to a steady state, where total strength regain is achieved. In the case of a traveling instability
such a steady state is not possible and the fault only regains part of its frictional strength, depending
on the seismic slip velocity and the traveling velocity of the shear band. In this case frictional
oscillations increasing the frequency content of the earthquake are also developed. Our results
indicate a reappraisal of the role of thermal pressurization as a frictional weakening mechanism.

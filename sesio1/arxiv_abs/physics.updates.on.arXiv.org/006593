The predictions of resolvent analysis for turbulent channel flow are evaluated for a friction Reynolds
number of Retau = 550. In addition to the standard resolvent operator with kinematic viscosity,
a resolvent operator augmented with the Cess eddy viscosity is considered. Adding eddy viscosity
significantly alters the low-rank behavior of the resolvent. Regardless of the wave speed selected,
the eddy resolvent is low-rank for spanwise wavelengths of ly+ = 80 and ly/h = 3.5 in comparison to
the standard resolvent whose low-rank behavior depends on the wave speed. The leading eddy modes
have higher projections onto the leading mode from spectral proper orthogonal decomposition in
comparison to standard resolvent modes. Neither analysis, however, reliably predicts the most
energetic wave speed. The standard resolvent tends to overestimate it while the eddy resolvent
underestimates it. When the most energetic wave speed is underestimated, the eddy modes are energetic
too close to the wall. The eddy resolvent does, however, correctly identify the most energetic wave
speed and mode shapes for structures associated with the near-wall cycle or that are most energetic
at z/h = 0.5. These structures are likely to be correctly predicted for any friction Reynolds number
due to the scaling of the Cess eddy viscosity profile. Finally, it is shown that the accuracy of eddy
predictions relies on the right balance between positive and negative energy transfers. Even though
eddy viscosity primarily adds dissipation, its wall-normal gradient injects energy in the near-wall
region, resulting in mode shapes that are attached to the wall. For some scales the predicted positive
energy transfer is too strong thus biasing structures towards the wall. The ability of the Cess eddy
viscosity profile to model both positive and negative energy transfers suggests that it could be
optimized for individual scales.

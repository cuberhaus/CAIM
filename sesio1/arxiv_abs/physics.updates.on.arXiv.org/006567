AIMS: Clinical radiographic imaging is seated upon the principle of differential keV photon transmission
through an object. At clinical x-ray energies the scattering of photons causes signal noise and
is utilized solely for transmission measurements. However, scatter - particularly Compton scatter,
is characterizable. In this work we hypothesized that modern radiation sources and detectors paired
with deep learning techniques can use scattered photon information constructively to resolve
superimposed attenuators in planar x-ray imaging. METHODS: We simulated a monoenergetic x-ray
imaging system consisting of a pencil beam x-ray source directed at an imaging target positioned
in front of a high spatial- and energy-resolution detector array. The signal was analyzed by a convolutional
neural network, and a description of scattering material along the axis of the beam was derived.
The system was virtually designed/tested using Monte Carlo processing of simple phantoms consisting
of 10 pseudo-randomly stacked air/bone/water materials, and the network was trained by solving
a classification problem. RESULTS: The average accuracy of the material identification along
the beam was 0.91 +- 0.01, with slightly higher accuracy towards the entrance/exit peripheral surfaces
of the object. The average sensitivity and specificity was 0.91 and 0.95, respectively. CONCLUSIONS:
Our work provides proof of principle that deep learning techniques can be used to analyze scattered
photon patterns which can constructively contribute to the information content in radiography,
here used to infer depth information in a traditional 2D planar setup. This principle, and our results,
demonstrate that the information in Compton scattered photons may provide a basis for further development.
The ability to scale performance to the clinic remains unexplored and requires further study.

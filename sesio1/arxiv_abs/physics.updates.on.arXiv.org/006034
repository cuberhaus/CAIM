An experimental Lagrangian study based on particle tracking velocimetry has been completed in
an incompressible turbulent round water jet freely spreading into water. The jet is seeded with
tracers only through the nozzle: inhomogeneous seeding called nozzle seeding. The Lagrangian
flow tagged by these tracers therefore does not contain any contribution from particles entrained
into the jet from the quiescent surrounding fluid. The mean velocity field of the nozzle seeded flow,
$\langle \boldsymbol{U_\varphi} \rangle$, is found to be essentially indistinguishable from
the global mean velocity field of the jet, $\langle \boldsymbol{U} \rangle$, for the axial velocity
while significant deviations are found for the radial velocity. This results in an effective compressibility
of the nozzle seeded flow for which $\boldsymbol{\nabla \cdot} \langle \boldsymbol{U_\varphi}
\rangle \neq 0$ even though the global background flow is fully incompressible. By using mass conservation
and self-similarity, we quantitatively explain the modified radial velocity profile and analytically
express the missing contribution associated to entrained fluid particles. By considering a classical
advection-diffusion description, we explicitly connect turbulent diffusion of mass (through
the turbulent diffusivity $K_T$) and momentum (through the turbulent viscosity $\nu_T$) to entrainment.
This results in new practical relations to experimentally determine the non-uniform spatial profiles
of $K_T$ and $\nu_T$ (and hence of the turbulent Prandtl number $\sigma_T = \nu_T/K_T$) from simple
measurements of the mean tracer concentration and axial velocity profiles. Overall, the proposed
approach based on nozzle seeded flow gives new experimental and theoretical elements for a better
comprehension of turbulent diffusion and entrainment in turbulent jets.

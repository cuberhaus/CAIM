While welding of thermoplastic composites (TPCs) is a promising rivetless method to reduce weight,
higher confidence in joints' structural integrity and failure prediction must be achieved for
widespread use in industry. In this work, we present an innovative study on damage detection for
ultrasonically welded TPC joints with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and embedded buckypaper
films. MWCNTs show promise for structural health monitoring (SHM) of composite joints, assembled
by adhesive bonding or fusion bonding, through electrical resistance changes. This study focuses
on investigating multifunctional films and their suitability for ultrasonic welding (USW) of
TPCs, using two approaches: 1) MWCNT/filled polypropylene (PP) nanocomposites prepared via solvent
dispersion, and 2) high conductivity MWCNT buckypaper embedded between PP films by hot pressing.
Nanocomposite formulations containing 5 wt and 10 wt MWCNTs were synthesized using solvent dispersion
method, followed by compression molding to manufacture films. The effect of MWCNT concentration
on electrical and dynamic mechanical behavior of multifunctional films was examined with a Sourcemeter
and Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer, and a comparison was made between 5 to 20 wt MWCNT-PP films based
on previous research. Glass fiber/polypropylene (GF/PP) composite joints were ultrasonically
welded in a single lap shear configuration using buckypaper and MWCNT/PP films. Furthermore, electrical
resistance measurements were carried out for joints under bending loads. It was observed that 15
wt and 20 wt MWCNT/PP films had higher stability and sensitivity for resistance response than embedded
buckypaper and films with low MWCNT contents, demonstrating their suitability for USW and potential
for SHM.

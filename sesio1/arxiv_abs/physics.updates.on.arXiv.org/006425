In this work, the Nusselt number is examined for periodically developed heat transfer in micro-
and mini-channels with arrays of offset strip fins, subject to a constant heat flux. The Nusselt
number is defined on the basis of a heat transfer coefficient which represents the spatially constant
macro-scale temperature difference between the fluid and solid during conjugate heat transfer.
Its values are determined numerically on a single unit cell of the array for Reynolds numbers between
1 and 600. Two combinations of the Prandtl number and the thermal conductivity ratio are selected,
corresponding to air and water. It is shown that the Nusselt number correlations from the literature
mainly apply to air in the transitional flow regime in larger conventional channels if the wall temperature
remains uniform. As a result, they do not correctly capture the observed trends for the Nusselt number
in micro- and mini-channels subject to a constant heat flux. Therefore, new Nusselt number correlations,
obtained through a least-squares fitting of 2282 numerical simulations, are presented for air
and water. The suitability of these correlations is assessed via the Bayesian approach for parameter
estimation and model validation. The correlations respect the observed asymptotic trends and
limits of the Nusselt number for all the geometrical parameters of the offset strip fins. In addition,
they predict a linear dependence of the Nusselt number on the Reynolds number, in good agreement
with the data from this work. Nevertheless, a detailed analysis reveals a more complex scaling of
the Nusselt number with the Reynolds number, closely related to the underlying flow regimes, particularly
the weak and strong inertia regimes. Finally, through 62 additional simulations, the influence
of the material properties on the Nusselt number is illustrated and compared to the available literature.

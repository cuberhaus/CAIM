This review presents an upgraded wave theory adapted to the high fluctuation level of driven realistic
i.e. non-idealized plasmas. Above all, this means giving up the well-known concept of a linear wave
theory in favor of a thoroughly nonlinear theory. Based on the author's early publication (H. Schamel,
Plasma Phys. 14 (1972) 905) and supported by recent Vlasov-Poisson simulations of realistic noisy
plasmas, an extended framework is presented which not only covers the essential features of coherent
hole structures, but which also enables to make the necessary corrections to the current wave theory.
These corrections are long overdue and can be briefly summarized under the heading: loss of linear
Vlasov dynamics when adequately addressing equilibrium states (i.e. failure of linear Landau
theory and of continuous van Kampen spectra, respectively). A linear stability analysis for single
harmonic waves that successfully incorporates trapped particle effects (in contrast to previous
analyses) shows an unconditional marginal stability independent of the drift between electrons
and ions, which irrevocably contradicts Landau's theory. Moreover, holes of negative energy are
of particular interest because they act as attractors in the dynamical system. They are the source
for the release of further modes and thus increase the level of intermittent turbulence. In summary,
pattern formation in collisionless plasmas is inherently nonlinear and kinetic. However, to have
a satisfactory, if not yet complete, understanding of its processes a twofold paradigm shift is
imperative: one from the conventional linear, discrete wave models to the nonlinear wave models
dealing with continuous spectra due to trapping and a second from the BGK to the present method for
the correct handling of equilibria.

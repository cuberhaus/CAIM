The use of machine learning techniques in classical and quantum systems has led to novel techniques
to classify ordered and disordered phases, as well as uncover transition points in critical phenomena.
Efforts to extend these methods to dynamical processes in complex networks is a field of active research.
Network-percolation, a measure of resilience and robustness to structural failures, as well as
a proxy for spreading processes, has numerous applications in social, technological, and infrastructural
systems. A particular challenge is to identify the existence of a percolation cluster in a network
in the face of noisy data. Here, we consider bond-percolation, and introduce a sampling approach
that leverages the core-periphery structure of such networks at a microscopic scale, using onion
decomposition, a refined version of the $k-$core. By selecting subsets of nodes in a particular
layer of the onion spectrum that follow similar trajectories in the percolation process, percolating
phases can be distinguished from non-percolating ones through an unsupervised clustering method.
Accuracy in the initial step is essential for extracting samples with information-rich content,
that are subsequently used to predict the critical transition point through the confusion scheme,
a recently introduced learning method. The method circumvents the difficulty of missing data or
noisy measurements, as it allows for sampling nodes from both the core and periphery, as well as intermediate
layers. We validate the effectiveness of our sampling strategy on a spectrum of synthetic network
topologies, as well as on two real-word case studies: the integration time of the US domestic airport
network, and the identification of the epidemic cluster of COVID-19 outbreaks in three major US
states. The method proposed here allows for identifying phase transitions in empirical time-varying
networks.

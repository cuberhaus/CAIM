We present and analyze video-microscopy-based single-particle-tracking measurements of the
budding yeast (S. cerevisiae) membrane protein, Pma1, fluorescently-labeled either by direct
fusion to the switchable fluorescent protein, mEos3.2, or by a light-touch, labeling scheme, where
a 5 amino acid tag is directly fused to the C-terminus of Pma1. This tag specifically and reversibly
binds to a tetratricopeptide repeat affinity protein (TRAP) which is directly fused to mEos3.2
[ChemBioChem 17, 1652 (2016)]. Diffusivity distributions of these two populations of single particle
tracks differ significantly, demonstrating that labeling method can be an important determinant
of diffusive behavior. To further analyze the diffusive dynamics, we applied perturbation expectation
maximization (pEMv2) [Physical Review E 94, 052412 (2016)], which sorts trajectories into a statistically-optimum
number of diffusive states. For both TRAP-labeled Pma1 and Pma1-mEos3.2, pEMv2 sorts the tracks
into two diffusive states: an essentially immobile state and a more mobile state. However, the mobile
fraction of Pma1-mEos3.2 tracks is much smaller than the mobile fraction of the TRAP-labeled Pma1
tracks. In addition, the diffusivity of Pma1-mEos3.2's mobile state is several times smaller than
TRAP-labeled Pma1's mobile state. Thus, Pma1-mEos3.2 is essentially immobile. By contrast, 50%
of TRAP labeled Pma1 molecules are mobile with a diffusivity, typical for membrane proteins. To
assess pEMv2's performance, we compare the diffusivity and covariance distributions of the experimental
pEMv2-sorted populations to corresponding theoretical distribution, assuming Pma1 displacements
realize a Gaussian random process. The experiment-theory comparisons for both the TRAP-labeled
Pma1 and Pma1-mEos3.2 reveal good agreement. Overall, this work develops a template for how to analyze
heterogenous biological diffusion data.

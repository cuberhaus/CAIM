In this paper we consider the machine learning (ML) task of predicting tipping point transitions
and long-term post-tipping-point behavior associated with the time evolution of an unknown (or
partially unknown), non-stationary, potentially noisy and chaotic, dynamical system. We focus
on the particularly challenging situation where the past dynamical state time series that is available
for ML training predominantly lies in a restricted region of the state space, while the behavior
to be predicted evolves on a larger state space set not fully observed by the ML model during training.
In this situation, it is required that the ML prediction system have the ability to extrapolate to
different dynamics past that which is observed during training. We investigate the extent to which
ML methods are capable of accomplishing useful results for this task, as well as conditions under
which they fail. In general, we found that the ML methods were surprisingly effective even in situations
that were extremely challenging, but do (as one would expect) fail when ``too much" extrapolation
is required. For the latter case, we investigate the effectiveness of combining the ML approach
with conventional modeling based on scientific knowledge, thus forming a hybrid prediction system
which we find can enable useful prediction even when its ML-based and knowledge-based components
fail when acting alone. We also found that achieving useful results may require using very carefully
selected ML hyperparameters and we propose a hyperparameter optimization strategy to address
this problem. The main conclusion of this paper is that ML-based approaches are promising tools
for predicting the behavior of non-stationary dynamical systems even in the case where the future
evolution (perhaps due to the crossing of a tipping point) includes dynamics on a set outside of that
explored by the training data.

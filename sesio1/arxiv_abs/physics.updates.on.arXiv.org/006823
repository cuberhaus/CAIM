In a desired environmental protection system, groundwater may not be excluded. In addition to the
problem of over-exploitation, in total disagreement with the concept of sustainable development,
another not negligible issue concerns the groundwater contamination. Mainly, this aspect is due
to intensive agricultural activities or industrialized areas. In literature, several papers
have dealt with transport problem, especially for inverse problems in which the release history
or the source location are identified. The innovative aim of the paper is to develop a data-driven
model that is able to analyze multiple scenarios, even strongly non-linear, in order to solve forward
and inverse transport problems, preserving the reliability of the results and reducing the uncertainty.
Furthermore, this tool has the characteristic of providing extremely fast responses, essential
to identify remediation strategies immediately. The advantages produced by the model were compared
with literature studies. In this regard, a feedforward artificial neural network, which has been
trained to handle different cases, represents the data-driven model. Firstly, to identify the
concentration of the pollutant at specific observation points in the study area (forward problem);
secondly, to deal with inverse problems identifying the release history at known source location;
then, in case of one contaminant source, identifying the release history and, at the same time, the
location of the source in a specific sub-domain of the investigated area. At last, the observation
error is investigated and estimated. The results are satisfactorily achieved, highlighting the
capability of the ANN to deal with multiple scenarios by approximating nonlinear functions without
the physical point of view that describes the phenomenon, providing reliable results, with very
low computational burden and uncertainty.

This work investigates electroviscous effects in presence of charge-dependent slip in steady
pressure-driven laminar flow of a symmetric (1:1) electrolyte liquid through a uniformly charged
slit contraction - expansion (4:1:4) microfluidic device. The mathematical model comprising
Poisson's, Nernst-Planck, Navier-Stokes, and current continuity equations are solved numerically
using finite element method (FEM). The flow fields (electrical potential, charge, induced electric
field strength, pressure drop, and electroviscous correction factor) have been obtained and presented
for a wide range of parameters like inverse Debye length (K=2-20), surface charge density (S=4-16)
and slip length ($0\le B_0\le 0.20$) at fixed Schmidt number (Sc=1000) and low Reynolds number (Re=0.01).
The flow fields have shown complex dependence on governing parameters. The charge-dependent slip
has further enhanced complexity of dependency in comparison to no-slip condition. The total electrical
potential ($|\Delta U|$) maximally increases by 78.68%, and pressure drop ($|\Delta P|$) maximally
decreases by 63.42%, relative to no-slip flow, over the ranges of conditions. The electroviscous
correction factor ($Y=$ ratio of apparent to physical viscosity) increases by 33.58% under the
no-slip ($B_0=0$) condition. It ($Y$) increases maximally by 72.10% for charge-dependent slip
than in no-slip flow for considered ranges of the conditions. A simple analytical model to estimate
the pressure drop in the electroviscous flow has been developed based on the Poiseuille flow in individual
uniform sections and pressure loss due to thin orifice. The model overpredicts pressure drop by
2 - 4% from the numerical values. Finally, the predictive relations, depicting the functional dependence
of numerical results on governing parameters, are presented for their practical use in design and
engineering of microfluidic devices.

Helium-3 has nowadays become one of the most important candidates for studies in fundamental physics
[1, 2, 3], nuclear and atomic structure [4, 5], magnetometry and metrology [6] as well as chemistry
and medicine [7, 8]. In particular, $^3$He nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) probes have been proposed
as a new standard for absolute magnetometry [6, 9]. This requires a high-accuracy value for the $^3$He
nuclear magnetic moment, which, however, has so far been determined only indirectly and with a relative
precision of $12$ parts per billon (p.p.b.) [10,11]. Here we investigate the $^3$He$^+$ ground-state
hyperfine structure in a Penning trap to directly measure the nuclear $g$-factor of $^3$He$^+$
$g'_I=-4.255\, 099\, 606\, 9(30)_{stat}(17)_{sys}$, the zero-field hyperfine splitting $E_{\rm
HFS}^{\rm exp}=-8\, 665\, 649\, 865.77(26)_{stat}(1)_{sys}$ Hz and the bound electron $g$-factor
$g_e^\text{exp}=-2.002\, 177\, 415\, 79(34)_{stat}(30)_{sys}$. The latter is consistent with
our theoretical value $g_e^\text{theo}=-2.002\, 177\, 416\, 252\, 23(39)$ based on parameters
and fundamental constants from [12]. Our measured value for the $^3$He$^+$ nuclear $g$-factor
allows for the determination of the $g$-factor of the bare nucleus $g_I=-4.255\, 250\, 699\, 7(30)_{stat}(17)_{sys}(1)_{theo}$
via our accurate calculation of the diamagnetic shielding constant [13] $\sigma_{^3He^+}=0.000\,035\,507\,38(3)$.
This constitutes the first direct calibration for $^3$He NMR probes and an improvement of the precision
by one order of magnitude compared to previous indirect results. The measured zero-field hyperfine
splitting improves the precision by two orders of magnitude compared to the previous most precise
value [14] and enables us to determine the Zemach radius [15] to $r_Z=2.608(24)$ fm.

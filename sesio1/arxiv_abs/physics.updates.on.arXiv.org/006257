Quantifying uncertainties in estimating future hydropower production directly or indirectly
affects India's energy security, planning, and management. The chaotic and nonlinear nature of
atmospheric processes results in considerable Internal Climate Variability (ICV) for future
projections of climate variables. Multiple Initial Condition Ensembles (MICE) and Multi-Model
Ensembles (MME) are often used to analyze the role of ICV and model uncertainty in precipitation
and temperature. However, there are limited studies focusing on quantifying the role of internal
variability on impact variables, including hydropower production. In this study, we analyze the
role of ICV and model uncertainty on three prominent hydropower plants of India using MICE of EC-Earth3
and MME from CMIP6. We estimate the streamflow projections for all ensembles using the Variable
Infiltration Capacity hydrological model for four time periods, historical, near, mid and far-term.
We estimate maximum hydropower production generated using monthly release and hydraulic head
available at the reservoir. We also analyzed the role of bias correction in hydropower production.
The results show that ICV plays a significant role in estimating streamflow and hydropower estimation
for monsoon and throughout the year, respectively. Model uncertainty contributes more to total
uncertainty than ICV in estimating the streamflow and potential hydropower. However, ICV is increasing
towards the far-term. We also show that bias correction does not preserve the internal variability
in estimating the streamflow. Although there is an increase in uncertainty for estimated streamflow,
mean hydropower shows the decrease towards the far-term for February to May, more prominent for
MICE than MME. The results suggest a need to incorporate uncertainty due to internal variability
for addressing power security in changing climate scenarios.

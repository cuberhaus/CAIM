The transition to chaos is ubiquitous in nonlinear systems ranging from fluid dynamics and superconducting
circuits to biological organisms. Optical systems driven out of equilibrium such as lasers and
supercontinuum generation exhibit chaotic states of light with fluctuations of both amplitude
and phase and can give rise to Levy statistics, turbulence, and rogue waves. Spatio-temporal chaos
also occurs in continuous-wave driven photonic chip based Kerr micro-resonators, where it is referred
to as chaotic modulation instability. Such modulation instability states have generally been
considered impractical for applications, in contrast to their coherent light state counterparts,
which include soliton or dark-pulse states. Here we demonstrate that incoherent and chaotic states
of light in an optical microresonator can be harnessed to implement unambiguous and interference-immune
massively parallel coherent laser ranging by using the intrinsic random amplitude and phase modulation
of the chaotic comb lines. We utilize 40 distinct lines of a microresonator frequency comb operated
in the modulation instability regime. Each line carries more than 1 GHz noise bandwidth, which greatly
surpasses the cavity linewidth, and enables to retrieve the distance of objects with cm-scale resolution.
Our approach utilizes one of the most widely accessible microcomb states, and offers -- in contrast
to dissipative Kerr soliton states -- high conversion efficiency, as well as flat optical spectra,
and alleviates the need for complex laser initiation routines. Moreover the approach generates
wideband signal modulation without requiring any electro-optical modulator or microwave synthesizer.
Viewed more broadly, similar optical systems capable of chaotic dynamics could be applied to random
modulation optical ranging as well as spread spectrum communication and optical cryptography
systems.

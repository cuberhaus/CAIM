Large-scale turbulent structures in the form of coherent wavepackets play a significant role in
the generation of prominent shallow angle noise radiation of jets. Economical prediction tools
often model these wavepackets in the frequency-domain using stability modes of the mean flow. The
use of simplifying choices, such as parabolized equations and azimuthal decomposition, provide
efficient methods but can impose constraints on rate of streamwise variation of the mean state or
geometric complexity. The current investigation develops a time-domain linearized Navier-Stokes-based
approach predicated on the mean basic state for two goals: i) to obtain the radiated shallow-angle
noise field, including that from imperfectly expanded jets containing shock trains, and ii) to
estimate noise control trends with actuator frequency. A previously developed implicit linearization
technique repurposing native non-linear Navier-Stokes code capabilities avoids any additional
constraints on nozzle geometry, while its time-domain nature facilitates control analysis through
transient pulse response. Two other integral components of the method are the sifting of linearized
perturbations to isolate the acoustic component with Doak's Momentum Potential Theory, and subsequently
Dynamic Mode Decomposition to analyze the response in different spectral ranges. Comparisons
with well-validated LES databases show accurate model predictions for super-radiative shallow
angle noise, including for hot jets from military-style nozzles. For a specific jet with extensive
published experimental data using plasma actuators, it is shown that the method correctly predicts
noise amplification at lower frequencies and reduction at higher values, at the observed crossover
location. Considerations on the costs associated with the approach, which exploits linearity
to extract multiple frequencies with each simulation, are outlined.

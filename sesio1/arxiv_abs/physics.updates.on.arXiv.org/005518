Radio-frequency carpets with ultra-fine pitches are examined for ion transport in gases at atmospheric
pressures and above. We develop new analytic and computational methods for modeling ion behavior
on phased radio-frequency (RF) carpets in gas densities where ion dynamics are strongly influenced
by buffer gas collisions. The analytic theory of phased RF arrays is obtained by generalizing the
conventional Dehmelt potential treatment, and the emergence of levitating and sweeping forces
from a single RF wave is demonstrated. We consider the effects of finite electrode width and demonstrate
the existence of a surface of no return at around 0.25 times the carpet pitch. We then apply thermodynamic
and kinetic theory arguments to calculate ion loss rates from RF carpets in the presence of stochastic
effects from ion-neutral collisions. Comparison to collision-by-collision simulations in SIMION
validate this new and efficient approach to calculation of transport efficiencies. We establish
the dependence of transport properties on array phasing, and explore a parameter space that is of
special interest to neutrinoless double beta decay experiments using xenon gas: RF transport of
barium ions in xenon gas at pressures from 1 to 10 bar, which could represent a promising technique
for barium daughter ion tagging. We explore the allowed parameter space for efficient transport,
accounting for the detailed microphysics of molecular ion formation and pressure dependent mobility,
as well as finite temperature effects for both room temperature and cooled gases. The requirements
of such systems lie significantly beyond those of existing devices in terms of both voltage and electrode
pitch, and we discuss the challenges associated with achieving these operating conditions with
presently available or near-future technologies.

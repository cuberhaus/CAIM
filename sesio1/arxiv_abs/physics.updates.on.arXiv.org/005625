Purpose Nanopore-based molecular sensing and measurement, specifically Deoxyribonucleic acid
(DNA) sequencing, is advancing at a fast pace. Some embodiments have matured from coarse particle
counters to enabling full human genome assembly. This evolution has been powered not only by improvements
in the sensors themselves, but also in the assisting microelectronic Complementary Metal Oxide
Semiconductor (CMOS) readout circuitry closely interfaced to them. In this light, this paper reviews
established and emerging nanopore-based sensing modalities considered for DNA sequencing and
CMOS microelectronic methods currently being used. Design/methodology/approach Readout and
amplifier circuits which are potentially appropriate for conditioning and conversion of nanopore
signals for downstream processing are studied. Furthermore, arrayed CMOS readout implementations
are focused on and the relevant status of the nanopore sensor technology is reviewed as well. Findings
Ion channel nanopore devices have properties unique compared with other electrochemical cells.
Currently biological nanopores are the only variants reported which can be used for actual DNA sequencing.
The translocation rate of DNA through such pores, the current range at which these cells operate
on and the cell capacitance effect, all impose the necessity of using low noise circuits in the process
of signal detection. The requirement of using in-pixel low noise circuits in turn tends to impose
challenges in the implementation of large size arrays. Originality/value The study presents an
overview on the readout circuits used for signal acquisition in electrochemical cell arrays and
investigates the specific requirements necessary for implementation of nanopore type electrochemical
cell amplifiers and their associated readout electronics.

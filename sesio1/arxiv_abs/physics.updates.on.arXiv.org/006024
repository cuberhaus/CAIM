A PET scanner based on silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) has been widely used as an advanced nuclear
medicine imaging technique that yields quantitative images of regional in vivo biology and biochemistry.
The compact size of the SiPM allows direct one to one coupling between the scintillation crystal
and the photosensor, yielding better timing and energy resolutions than the light sharing methods
that have to be used in photomultiplier tube (PMT) PET systems. To decrease the volume of readout
electronics, a front end multiplexer with position decoder is a common choice for the one to one system
without a highly integrated application specific integrated circuit (ASIC). However, in this
case we cannot measure each crystal's deposited energy inspired by an annihilation photon, so the
inter-crystal scatter (ICS) events will lead to the crystal mispositioning and then deteriorate
the detector intrinsic resolution. Besides, considering the events rejection within the energy
window resulting from the gain dispersion and nonlinear outputs of the SiPMs, an energy correction
mechanism is needed. Yet, lack of the information of each crystal's energy will introduce large
energy correction error for the ICS events. For this issue, an online energy correction mechanism
implemented on a Kintext-7 Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) device is presented in this paper.
Experiments in the laboratory were performed using an 8 x 8 segmented LYSO crystals coupled with
an 8 x 8 SiPM (J-series, from ON Semiconductor) array which is under 22Na point source excitation.
Test results indicate that both the energy of the non-ICS and ICS events can be precisely corrected
and the energy resolution is better than 12 %. We also applied this method to an actual clinical PET
scanner under a 68Ge line source to verify its multi-channel reliability.

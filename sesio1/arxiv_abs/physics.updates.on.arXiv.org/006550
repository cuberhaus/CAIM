This paper considers dynamic fracturing of the rockmass surrounding a tunnel statically loaded
by compressional stress as a possible source of seismic events in underground mines. This begins
with two-dimensional dynamic modelling of failure for six plausible scenarios. In each case, the
seismic source derived from these models has significant negative isotropic and negative compensated
linear vector dipole components as well as a P-axis approximately aligned with the direction of
maximum compressional principal stress. These features indicate that at wavelengths larger than
the diameter of the tunnel and the extent of damage along it, seismic radiation is controlled by the
elastic convergence of the surrounding rockmass rather than by rock fracturing. An analytical
approximation of the source mechanism is suggested that is based solely on mechanical and geometric
properties: the magnitudes $\sigma_{\mathrm{max}}$ and $\sigma_{\mathrm{min}}$ of the maximum
and minimum principal stresses orthogonal to the tunnel's axis, the Poisson's ratio $\nu$ of the
rockmass, the length $L_{3}$ of dynamic fracturing along the tunnel, the effective tunnel dimension
$\bar{L_{A}}$, and the increase in depth of failure $\triangle d_{f}^{A}$ in the direction of $\sigma_{\mathrm{min}}$.
Furthermore, it is shown that the scalar seismic moment can be approximated as $|\mathbf{M}|\approx2[(1-\nu)/(1-2\nu)]|\sigma_{max}|L_{3}\bar{L_{A}}\triangle
d_{f}^{A}$. The suggested approximations are considered in the context of seismic data from a real
underground mine. It is shown that many mechanisms inverted from observed waveforms are consistent
with the suggested model and that the proposed source mechanism approximation can be used for the
forensic analysis of damaging seismic events and quantitative monitoring of the evolution of fractured
zones around tunnels.

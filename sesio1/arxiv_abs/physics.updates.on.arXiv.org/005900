The average deflection angle of the tracked muons in the muon scattering tomography exponentially
declines in function of the initial kinetic energy, the angular dependence of which provides an
opportunity to set out a binary relation between the initial kinetic energy and the average deflection
angle, thereby leading to a coarse energy prediction founded on the mean deflection angle in the
case of experimental incapabilities or limitations. In this study, we address the problem of the
muon energy classification for a tomographic system consisting of 0.4-cm plastic scintillators
manufactured from polyvinyl toluene and we explore a four-group structure besides a ternary partitioning
between 0.25 and 8 GeV. In the first instance, we determine the deflection angles by tracking the
hit locations in the detector layers on the sub-divided uniform energy intervals through the GEANT4
simulations. In the latter step, we express two misclassification probabilities where the first
approach assumes a symmetrical linear propagation bounded by one standard deviation in one dimension,
whereas the second procedure employs a positively defined modified Gaussian distribution that
governs the overlapping area in two dimensions. In the final stage, we compare qualitatively and
quantitatively the adjacent energy groups by using the computed misclassification probabilities.
In the absence of any further data manipulation, we explicitly show that the misclassification
probabilities increase when the number of energy groups augments. Furthermore, we also conclude
that it is feasible to benefit from the mean deflection angle to roughly estimate the muon energies
up to four energy groups by taking the misclassification probabilities into consideration, while
the classification viability significantly diminishes when the partition number exceeds four
on the basis of standard deviation.

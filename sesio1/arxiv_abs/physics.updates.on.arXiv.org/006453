The geometric interpretation of (pseudo)spin 1/2 systems on the Bloch sphere has been appreciated
across different areas ranging from condensed matter to quantum information and high energy physics.
Although similar notions for larger Hilbert spaces are established in mathematics, they have been
so far less explored beyond the two-level case for practical usage in condensed matter settings,
or have involved restrictions to sub manifolds within the full Hilbert space. We here employ a coherence
vector description to theoretically characterize a general N-level system on the higher dimensional
generalized Bloch (hyper)sphere by respecting the structure of the underlying SU(N) algebra and
construct physically intuitive geometric pictures for topological concepts. Focusing on two
spatial dimensions, we reveal a geometric interpretation for the Chern number in larger Hilbert
spaces in terms of a nested structure comprising N-1 two-spheres. We demonstrate that for the N-level
case, there is an exterior two-sphere that provides a useful characterization of the system, notably
by playing a primary role in determining the Chern number. The external sphere can be directly measured
in ultracold atoms via well-established band mapping techniques, thereby imparting knowledge
of the topological nature of state. We also investigate how the time evolution of the coherence vector
defined on the generalized Bloch hypersphere can be utilized to extract the full state vector in
experiments, allowing us to develop a tomography scheme involving quenches for three-level systems.
Our geometric description opens up a new avenue for the interpretation of the topological classification
and the dynamical illustration of multi-level systems, which in turn is anticipated to help in the
design of new experimental probes.

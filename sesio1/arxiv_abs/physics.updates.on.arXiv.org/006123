Our understanding of radiation induced cellular damage has greatly improved over the past decades.
Despite this progress, there are still many obstacles to fully understanding how radiation interacts
with biologically relevant cellular components to form observable endpoints. One hurdle is the
difficulty faced by members of different research groups in directly comparing results. Multiple
Monte Carlo codes have been developed to simulate damage induction at the DNA scale, while at the
same time various groups have developed models that describe DNA repair processes with varying
levels of detail. These repair models are intrinsically linked to the damage model employed in their
development, making it difficult to disentangle systematic effects in either part of the modelling
chain. The modelling chain typically consists of track structure Monte Carlo simulations of the
physics interactions creating direct damages to the DNA; followed by simulations of the production
and initial reactions of chemical species causing indirect damages. After the DNA damage induction,
DNA repair models combine the simulated damage patterns with biological models to determine the
biological consequences of the damage. We propose a new Standard data format for DNA Damage to unify
the interface between the simulation of damage induction and the biological modelling of cell repair
processes. Such a standard greatly facilitates inter model comparisons, providing an ideal environment
to tease out model assumptions and identify persistent, underlying mechanisms. Through inter
model comparisons, this unified standard has the potential to greatly advance our understanding
of the underlying mechanisms of radiation induced DNA damage and the resulting observable biological
effects.

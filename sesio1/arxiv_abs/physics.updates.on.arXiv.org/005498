Lubricant-infused surfaces (LISs) can promote stable dropwise condensation and improve heat
transfer rates due to a low nucleation free-energy barrier and high droplet mobility. Topographical
differences in the oil surface cause water microdroplets to rigorously self-propel long distances,
continuously redistributing the oil film and potentially refreshing the surface for re-nucleation.
Using high-speed microscopy, we reveal that during water condensation on LISs, the smallest visible
droplets (diameter ~ 1um, qualitatively representing nucleation) predominantly emerge in oil-poor
regions due to a smaller thermal activation barrier. Considering the significant heat transfer
performance of microdroplets (< 10um) and transient characteristic of microdroplet movement,
we compare the apparent nucleation rate density and water collection rate for LISs with oils of different
viscosity and a solid hydrophobic surface at a wide range of subcooling temperatures. Generally,
the lowest lubricant viscosity leads to the highest nucleation rate density. We characterize the
length and frequency of microdroplet movement and attribute the nucleation enhancement primarily
to higher droplet mobility and surface refreshing frequency. Interestingly and unexpectedly,
hydrophobic surfaces outperform high-viscosity LISs at high subcooling temperatures, but are
generally inferior to any of the tested LISs at low temperature differences. To explain the observed
non-linearity between LISs and the solid hydrophobic surface, we introduce two dominant regimes
that influence the condensation efficiency: mobility-limited and coalescence-limited. Our
findings advance the understanding of dynamic water-lubricant interactions and provide new design
rationales for choosing surfaces for enhanced dropwise condensation and water collection efficiencies.

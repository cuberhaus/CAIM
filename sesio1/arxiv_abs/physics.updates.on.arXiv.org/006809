Purpose: To develop a free-breathing myocardial T1 mapping technique using inversion-recovery
(IR) radial fast low-angle shot (FLASH) and calibrationless motion-resolved model-based reconstruction.
Methods: Free-running (free-breathing, retrospective cardiac gating) IR radial FLASH is used
for data acquisition at 3T. First, to reduce the waiting time between inversions, an analytical
formula is derived that takes the incomplete T1 recovery into account for an accurate T1 calculation.
Second, the respiratory motion signal is estimated from the k-space center of the contrast varying
acquisition using an adapted singular spectrum analysis (SSA-FARY) technique. Third, a motion-resolved
model-based reconstruction is used to estimate both parameter and coil sensitivity maps directly
from the sorted k-space data. Thus, spatio-temporal total variation, in addition to the spatial
sparsity constraints, can be directly applied to the parameter maps. Validations are performed
on an experimental phantom, eleven human subjects, and a young landrace pig with myocardial infarction.
Results: In comparison to an IR spin-echo reference, phantom results confirm good T1 accuracy,
when reducing the waiting time from five seconds to one second using the new correction. The motion-resolved
model-based reconstruction further improves T1 precision compared to the spatial regularization-only
reconstruction. Aside from showing that a reliable respiratory motion signal can be estimated
using modified SSA-FARY, in vivo studies demonstrate that dynamic myocardial T1 maps can be obtained
within two minutes with good precision and repeatability. Conclusion: Motion-resolved myocardial
T1 mapping during free-breathing with good accuracy, precision and repeatability can be achieved
by combining inversion-recovery radial FLASH, self-gating and a calibrationless motion-resolved
model-based reconstruction.

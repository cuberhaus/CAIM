While previous model sensitivity studies have mainly focused on discerning the soil moisture-precipitation
feedback processes over the Indian region, the present study investigates the impact of soil moisture-temperature
(SM-T) coupling on the temperature extremes (ExT) using the high-resolution (~60 km) model simulations.
These simulations include the control and soil moisture (SM) sensitivity experiments (DRY-SM
and WET-SM) initialized by perturbing (decreasing/increasing) SM from the historical (HIST:
1951-2010) and future 4K warming (FUT: 2051-2100) control runs. The analysis identifies the transitional
regions of north-central India (NCI) as the hotspot of strong SM-T coupling. Over NCI, the HIST experiment
shows an occurrence of 4-5 extreme events per year, with an average duration of 5-6 days per event
and intensity exceeding 46oC. Whereas, FUT estimates indicate relatively severe, long-lasting,
and more frequent extreme events. The SM sensitivity experiments reveal the significant influence
of SM-T coupling on the ExT over NCI in both historical and future climates. We find that the DRY-SM
results in significant enhancement of frequency, duration and intensity of ExT, in contrast to
WET-SM. We note that the difference between DRY-SM and WET-SM 50-year return value of the block maxima
GEV fit can reach upto 1.25oC and 3oC for historical and future climate, respectively. The enhanced
(reduced) extreme temperature conditions in DRY-SM (WET-SM) simulation are caused by the intensification
(abridgement) of sensible heat flux by limiting (intensifying) available total energy for evaporative
cooling due to faster (slower) dissipation of positive soil moisture anomalies (also called as
soil moisture memory). In addition, the influence of SM on ExT over NCI is found to be larger during
the post-monsoon season as compared to the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons.

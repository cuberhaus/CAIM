Thermal flows characterized by high Prandtl number are numerically challenging as the transfer
of momentum and heat occurs at different time scales. To account for very low thermal conductivity
and obey the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition, the numerical diffusion of the scheme has to be
reduced. As a consequence, the numerical artefacts are dominated by dispersion errors commonly
known as wiggles. In this study, we explore possible remedies in the framework of the lattice Boltzmann
method by applying novel collision kernels, lattices with a large number of discrete velocities,
namely D3Q27, and second-order boundary conditions. For the first time, the cumulant-based collision
operator is utilised to simulate both the hydrodynamic and the thermal field. Alternatively, the
advected field is computed using the central moments' collision operator. Different relaxation
strategies have been examined to account for additional degrees of freedom introduced by a higher-order
lattice. To validate the proposed kernels for a pure advection-diffusion problem, the numerical
simulations are compared against an analytical solution of a Gaussian hill. The structure of the
numerical dispersion is shown by simulating advection and diffusion of a square indicator function.
Finally, a study of steady forced heat convection from a confined cylinder is performed and compared
against a FEM solution. It has been found, that the relaxation scheme of the advected field must be
adjusted to profit from lattice with a larger number of discrete velocities. Obtained results show
clearly that it is not sufficient to assume that only the first-order central moments/cumulants
contribute to solving the macroscopic advection-diffusion equation. In the case of central moments,
the beneficial effect of the two relaxation time approach is presented.

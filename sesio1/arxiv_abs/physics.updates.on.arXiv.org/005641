Geological storage of CO$_2$ in deep saline aquifers is a promising measure to mitigate global warming
by reducing the concentration of this greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. When CO$_2$ is injected
in the geological formation, it dissolves partially in the interstitial brine, thus rendering
it denser than the CO$_2$-devoid brine below, which creates a convective instability. The resulting
convection accelerates the rate of CO$_2$ perennial trapping by dissolution in the brine. The instability
and resulting convection have been intensively discussed by numerical and theoretical approaches
at the Darcy scale, but few experimental studies have characterized them quantitatively. By using
both refractive index matching and planar laser induced fluorescence, we measure for the first
time the onset characteristics of the convective dissolution instability in a 3-D porous medium
located below a gas compartment. Our results highlight that the dimensional growth rate of the instability
remains constant when the CO$_2$ partial pressure in the compartment is varied, in clear discrepancy
with the theoretical predictions. Furthermore, within the CO$_2$ partial pressure range studied,
the measured growth rate is 1 to 3 orders of magnitude larger than the predicted value. The Fourier
spectrum of the front is very broad, highlighting the multi-scale nature of the flow. Depending
on the measurement method and CO$_2$ partial pressure, the mean wavelength is 1 to 3 times smaller
than the predicted value. Using a theoretical model developed recently by Tilton (J.~Fluid Mech.,
2018), we demonstrate that our experimental results are consistent with a forcing of convection
by porosity fluctuations. Finally, we discuss the possible effects of this forcing by the porous
medium's pore structure on the CO$_2$ flux across the interface, measured in our experiments about
one order of magnitude higher than expected.

The results of computer simulation of the high-energy electrons passage through thin layers of
titanium and polyimide Kapton(R) in the energy range from 3 MeV to 20 MeV are presented. Simulation
is carried out using the Geant4 toolkit. The thickness of the titanium foil in the model experiment
is 50 microns, the thickness of the Kapton(R) film is 110 microns. The purpose of the calculations
is to reveal the possibility of using the Kapton(R) film in the output devices of linear electron
accelerators. It was necessary to calculate the probable values of the energy absorbed in a Kapton(R)
film and in a titanium foil for each value of primary electrons energy. Another important characteristic
is the divergence radius of the electron beam at a predetermined distance from the film, or the electron
scattering angle. As a result of calculations, the energy spectra of bremsstrahlung gamma-quanta,
formed during the passage of electrons through the materials of the films, are obtained. The most
probable values of the energy absorbed in the titanium foil and in the Kapton(R) film are calculated.
The scattering radii of an electron beam for the Kapton(R) film and also for the titanium foil at a
distance of 20 centimeters are estimated. It is shown that the ratio of the total amount of bremsstrahlung
gamma quanta in the case of use the Kapton(R) film is approximately 0.56 of the total amount of bremsstrahlung
gamma quanta when using the titanium foil. The analysis of the calculated data showed that the use
of Kapton(R) as a material for the manufacture of output devices for high-energy electron beams
is more preferable in comparison to titanium films. The use of Kapton(R) instead of titanium makes
it possible to significantly reduce the background of the generated bremsstrahlung gamma quanta
and reduce the scattering radius of the electron beam.

High-brightness beams generated by particle sources based on advanced accelerator concepts have
the potential to become an essential part of future accelerator technology. High-gradient accelerators
can generate and rapidly accelerate particle beams to relativistic energies while minimizing
irreversible detrimental effects to the beam brightness that occur at low beam energies. Due to
the high accelerating gradients, these novel accelerators are also significantly more compact
than conventional technology. The beam parameters of these particle sources are largely determined
by the injection and subsequent acceleration processes. While there has been significant progress
crucial parameters that are required for a future collider or more near-term applications, including
X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs), such as a sufficiently small energy spread and small emittance
for bunches with a high charge and at high pulse repetition rate. Major research and development
efforts are required to realize these approaches for a front-end injector for a future collider
in order to address these limitations. In particular, this includes methods to control and manipulate
the phase-space and spin degrees-of-freedom of ultrashort LWFA electron bunches with high accuracy,
methods that increase the laser-to-electron beam efficiency and increased repetition rate. This
also includes the development of high-resolution diagnostics, such as full 6D phase-space measurements,
beam polarimetry and high-fidelity simulation tools. A further increase in beam luminosity can
be achieve through emittance damping. For future colliders, the damping rings might be replaced
by a substantially more compact plasma-based approach. Here, plasma wigglers are used to achieve
similar damping performance but over a two orders of magnitude reduced length.

We investigate the incompressible flow past a square cylinder immersed in the wake of an upstream
nearby splitter plate separating two streams of different velocity. The bottom stream Reynolds
number, based on the square side, $Re_B=56$ is kept constant while the top-to-bottom Reynolds numbers
ratio $R\equiv Re_T/Re_B$ is increased in the range $R\in[1,6.5]$, corresponding to a coupled
variation of the bulk Reynolds number $Re\equiv(Re_T+Re_B)/2\in[56,210]$ and an {\it equivalent}
nondimensional shear parameter $K\equiv2(R-1)/(R+1)\in[0,1.4667]$. The onset of vortex-shedding,
at $R=2.1\pm0.1$ (corresponding to $Re=86.8\pm2.8$, $K=0.71\pm0.04$), is pushed to higher $Re$
as compared to the square cylinder in the classic configuration. The advent of three-dimensionality
is triggered by a mode-C-type instability at $R\simeq3.1$ ($Re\simeq115$, $K\simeq1.02$) with
wavelength $\lambda_z\simeq2.4$, much as reported for open circular rings and square cylinders
placed at an incidence. The resulting solution is period-doubled and exhibits a triad of spanwise
symmetries: a mirror reflection and two spatiotemporal symmetries involving the evolution by
half a period (two vortex-shedding cycles) followed by either specular reflection or a half-wavelength
shift. The path towards spatio-temporal chaos is initiated thereafter with a modulational period-doubling
tertiary bifurcation at $R\in(3.4,3.8)$ that also doubles the spanwise periodicity. The ensuing
nonlinear solution repeats only after four vortex shedding periods and retains only a spatiotemporal
invariance consisting in the evolution by half a period (two vortex-shedding cycles) followed
by mirror reflection about a streamwise-cross-stream plane. At slighlty higher values of $R\geq4$,
the flow has become spatio-temporally chaotic, but the main features of mode C are still clearly
distinguishable.

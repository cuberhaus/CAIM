The physical and clinical benefits of charged particle therapy (CPT) are well recognised and recent
developments have led to the rapid emergence of facilities, resulting in wider adoption worldwide.
Nonetheless, the availability of CPT and complete exploitation of dosimetric advantages are still
limited by high facility costs and technological challenges. There are extensive ongoing efforts
to improve upon these, which will lead to greater accessibility, superior delivery, and therefore
better treatment outcomes. Several of these aspects can be addressed by developments to the beam
delivery system (BDS) which determine the overall shaping and timing capabilities to provide high
quality treatments. Modern delivery techniques are necessary but are limited by extended treatment
times. The energy layer switching time (ELST) is a limiting constraint of the BDS and a determinant
of the beam delivery time (BDT), along with the accelerator and other factors. This review evaluates
the delivery process in detail, presenting the limitations and developments for the BDS and related
accelerator technology, toward decreasing the BDT. As extended BDT impacts motion and has dosimetric
implications for treatment, we discuss avenues to minimise the ELST and overview the clinical benefits
and feasibility of a large energy acceptance BDS. These developments support the possibility of
delivering advanced methodologies such as volumetric rescanning, FLASH and arc therapy and can
further reduce costs given a faster delivery for a greater range of treatment indications. Further
work to realise multi-ion, image guided and adaptive therapies is also discussed. In this review
we examine how increased treatment efficiency and efficacy could be achieved with an improved BDS
and how this could lead to faster and higher quality treatments for the future of CPT.

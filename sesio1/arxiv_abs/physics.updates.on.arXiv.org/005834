Self-consistent full-size turbulent-transport simulations of the divertor and SOL of existing
tokamaks have recently become feasible. This enables the direct comparison of turbulence simulations
against experimental measurements. In this work, we perform a series of diverted Ohmic L-mode discharges
on the TCV tokamak, building a first-of-a-kind dataset for the validation of edge turbulence models.
This dataset, referred to as TCV-X21, contains measurements from 5 diagnostic systems -- giving
a total of 45 1- and 2-D comparison observables in two toroidal magnetic field directions. The dataset
is used to validate three flux-driven 3D fluid-turbulence models: GBS, GRILLIX and TOKAM3X. With
each model, we perform simulations of the TCV-X21 scenario, tuning the particle and power source
rates to achieve a reasonable match of the upstream separatrix value of density and electron temperature.
We find that the simulations match the experimental profiles for most observables at the OMP -- both
in terms of profile shape and absolute magnitude -- while a poorer agreement is found towards the
divertor targets. The match between simulation and experiment is seen to be sensitive to the value
of the resistivity, the heat conductivities, the power injection rate and the choice of sheath boundary
conditions. Additionally, despite targeting a sheath-limited regime, the discrepancy between
simulations and experiment also suggests that the neutral dynamics should be included. The results
of this validation show that turbulence models are able to perform simulations of existing devices
and achieve reasonable agreement with experimental measurements. Where disagreement is found,
the validation helps to identify how the models can be improved. By publicly releasing the experimental
dataset, this work should help to guide and accelerate the development of predictive turbulence
simulations of the edge and SOL.

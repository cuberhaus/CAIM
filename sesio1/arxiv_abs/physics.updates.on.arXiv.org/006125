Biodegradable elastic scaffolds have attracted more and more attention in the field of soft tissue
repair and tissue engineering. These scaffolds made of porous bioelastomers support tissue ingrowth
along with their own degradation. It is necessary to develop a computer-aided analyzing method
based on ultrasound images to identify the degradation performance of the scaffold, not only to
obviate the need to do destructive testing, but also to monitor the scaffold's degradation and tissue
ingrowth over time. It is difficult using a single traditional image processing algorithm to extract
continuous and accurate contour of a porous bioelastomer. This paper proposes a joint algorithm
for the bioelastomer's contour detection and a texture feature extraction method for monitoring
the degradation behavior of the bioelastomer. Mean-shift clustering method is used to obtain the
bioelastomer's and native tissue's clustering feature information. Then the OTSU image binarization
method automatically selects the optimal threshold value to convert the grayscale ultrasound
image into a binary image. The Canny edge detector is used to extract the complete bioelastomer's
contour. The first-order and second-order statistical features of texture are extracted. The
proposed joint algorithm not only achieves the ideal extraction of the bioelastomer's contours
in ultrasound images, but also gives valuable feedback of the degradation behavior of the bioelastomer
at the implant site based on the changes of texture characteristics and contour area. The preliminary
results of this study suggest that the proposed computer-aided image processing techniques have
values and potentials in the non-invasive analysis of tissue scaffolds in vivo based on ultrasound
images and may help tissue engineers evaluate the tissue scaffold's degradation and cellular ingrowth
progress and improve the scaffold designs.

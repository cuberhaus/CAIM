Long distance transmission of quantum information is a central ingredient of distributed quantum
information processors for both computing and secure communication. Transmission between superconducting/solid-state
quantum processors necessitates transduction of individual microwave photons to optical photons.
Current approaches to transduction employ solid state links between electrical and optical domains,
facing challenges from the thermal noise added by the strong classical pumps required for high conversion
efficiency and bandwidth. Neutral atoms are an attractive alternative transducer: they couple
strongly to optical photons in their ground states, and to microwave/millimeter-wave photons
in their Rydberg states. Nonetheless, strong coupling of atoms to both types of photons, in a cryogenic
environment to minimize thermal noise, has yet to be achieved. Here we demonstrate quantum-limited
transduction of millimeter-wave (mmwave) photons into optical photons using cold $^{85}$Rb atoms
as the transducer. We achieve this by coupling an ensemble of atoms simultaneously to a first-of-its-kind,
optically accessible three-dimensional superconducting resonator, and a vibration suppressed
optical cavity, in a cryogenic ($5$ K) environment. We measure an internal conversion efficiency
of $58(11)\%$, a conversion bandwidth of $360(20)$ kHz and added thermal noise of $0.6$ photons,
in agreement with a parameter-free theory. Extensions to this technique will allow near-unity
efficiency transduction in both the mmwave and microwave regimes. More broadly, this state-of-the-art
platform opens a new field of hybrid mmwave/optical quantum science, with prospects for operation
deep in the strong coupling regime for efficient generation of metrologically or computationally
useful entangled states and quantum simulation/computation with strong nonlocal interactions.

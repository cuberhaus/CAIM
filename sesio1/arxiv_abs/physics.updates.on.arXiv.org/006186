Local environmental interactions are a major factor in determining the success of a new mutant in
structured populations. Spatial variations of concentration of a resource change the fitness
of competing strategies locally and thus can drastically change the outcome of evolutionary process
in unintuitive ways. Environmental interactions can be asymmetric, i.e. the same local resource
value affects the fitness of strategies differently. The question is how such local environmental
variations in network population structures change the condition for selection and fixation probability
of an advantageous (or deleterious) mutant. We consider linear graph structure and focus on the
case where resources have a spatial periodic pattern. Our model covers several biologically relevant
cases. We numerically calculate fixation probability and fixation time for a Moran birth-death
process as fitness heterogeneity and period vary. The fixation probability is affected by not only
the level of fitness heterogeneity, but also spatial scale of resource variations set by period
of distribution $T$. For most (weak) asymmetric environmental interactions the chance of success
of a mutant increases with heterogeneity. We identify conditions for which a previously deleterious
mutant (in a uniform environment) becomes beneficial as fitness heterogeneity is increased. We
observe cases where the fixation probability of both mutant and resident types are less than their
neutral value, $1/N$, simultaneously. This corresponds to potential coexistence of resident
and mutant types. Finally, we discuss the effect of 'fitness shift' where the fitness function of
two types has a phase difference. This happens when there are more than one type of resources in the
environment. We observe significant increase (or decrease) in the fixation probability of the
mutant as a result of such phase shift.

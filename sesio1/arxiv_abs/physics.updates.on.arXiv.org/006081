There is a wide consensus within the polar science, meteorology, and oceanography communities
that more in-situ observations of the ocean, atmosphere, and sea ice, are required to further improve
operational forecasting model skills. Traditionally, the volume of such measurements has been
limited by the high cost of commercially available instruments. An increasingly attractive solution
to this cost issue is to use instruments produced in-house from open source hardware, firmware,
and post processing building blocks. In the present work, we release the next iteration of the open
source drifter and waves monitoring instruments. The new design is both significantly less expensive,
much easier to build and assemble for people without specific microelectronics and programming
competence, more easily extendable and customizable, and two orders of magnitude more power efficient.
Improving performance and reducing noise levels and costs compared with our previous generation
of instruments is possible in large part thanks to progress from the electronics component industry.
As a result, we believe that this will allow scientists in geosciences to increase by an order of magnitude
the amount of in-situ data they can collect under a constant instrumentation budget. In the following,
we offer 1) detailed overview of our hardware and software solution, 2) in-situ validation and benchmarking
of our instrument, 3) full open source release of both hardware and software blueprints. We hope
that this work, and the associated open source release, may be a milestone that will allow our scientific
fields to transition towards open source, community driven instrumentation. We believe that this
could have a considerable impact on many fields, by making in-situ instrumentation at least an order
of magnitude less expensive and more customizable than it has been for the last 50 years.

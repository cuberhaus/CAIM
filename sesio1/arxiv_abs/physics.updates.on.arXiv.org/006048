Machine learning has long been considered as a black box for predicting combustion chemical kinetics
due to the extremely large number of parameters and the lack of evaluation standards and reproducibility.
The current work aims to understand two basic questions regarding the deep neural network (DNN)
method: what data the DNN needs and how general the DNN method can be. Sampling and preprocessing
determine the DNN training dataset, further affect DNN prediction ability. The current work proposes
using Box-Cox transformation (BCT) to preprocess the combustion data. In addition, this work compares
different sampling methods with or without preprocessing, including the Monte Carlo method, manifold
sampling, generative neural network method (cycle-GAN), and newly-proposed multi-scale sampling.
Our results reveal that the DNN trained by the manifold data can capture the chemical kinetics in
limited configurations but cannot remain robust toward perturbation, which is inevitable for
the DNN coupled with the flow field. The Monte Carlo and cycle-GAN samplings can cover a wider phase
space but fail to capture small-scale intermediate species, producing poor prediction results.
A three-hidden-layer DNN, based on the multi-scale method without specific flame simulation data,
allows predicting chemical kinetics in various scenarios and being stable during the temporal
evolutions. This single DNN is readily implemented with several CFD codes and validated in various
combustors, including (1). zero-dimensional autoignition, (2). one-dimensional freely propagating
flame, (3). two-dimensional jet flame with triple-flame structure, and (4). three-dimensional
turbulent lifted flames. The results demonstrate the satisfying accuracy and generalization
ability of the pre-trained DNN. The Fortran and Python versions of DNN and example code are attached
in the supplementary for reproducibility.

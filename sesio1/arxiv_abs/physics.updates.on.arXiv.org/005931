For the first time, the non-equilibrium time-relaxation kinetic model (NTRKM) is proposed for
compressible turbulence modeling on unresolved grids. Within the non-equilibrium time-relaxation
framework, NTRKM is extended in the form of modified Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook model. Based on the
first-order Chapman-Enskog expansion, NTRKM connects with the six-variable macroscopic governing
equations. The first five governing equations correspond to the conservative laws in mass, momentum
and total energy, while the sixth equation governs the evolution of unresolved turbulence kinetic
energy Kutke. The unknowns in NTRKM, including turbulent relaxation time and source term, are determined
by essential gradient-type assumption and standard dynamic modeling approach. Current generalized
kinetic model on unresolved grids consequently offers a profound mesoscopic understanding for
one-equation subgrid-scale turbulence kinetic energy Ksgs model in compressible large eddy simulation.
To solve NTRKM accurately and robustly, a non-equilibrium gas-kinetic scheme is developed, which
succeeds the well-established gas-kinetic scheme for simulating Navier-Stokes equations. Three-dimensional
decaying compressible isotropic turbulence and temporal compressible plane mixing layer on unresolved
grids are simulated to evaluate the generalized kinetic model and non-equilibrium gas-kinetic
scheme. The performance of key turbulent quantities up to second-order statistics confirms that
NTRKM is comparable with the widely-used eddy-viscosity Smagorinsky model (SM) and dynamic Smagorinsky
model (DSM). Specifically, compared with the DNS solution in temporal compressible plane mixing
layer, the performance of NTRKM is much closer with DSM and better than SM. This study provides a workable
approach for compressible turbulence modeling on unresolved grids.

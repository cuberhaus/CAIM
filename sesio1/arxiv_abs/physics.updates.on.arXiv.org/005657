Continuous developments in Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies are opening opportunities
in novel machining, and improving design alternatives for modern particle accelerator components.
One of the most critical, complex, and delicate accelerator elements to manufacture and assemble
is the Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) linear accelerator, used as an injector for all large modern
proton and ion accelerator systems. For this reason, the RFQ has been selected by a wide European
collaboration participating in the AM developments of the I.FAST (Innovation Fostering in Accelerator
Science and Technology) Horizon 2020 project. RFQ is as an excellent candidate to show how sophisticated
pure-copper accelerator components can be manufactured by AM and how their functionalities can
be boosted by this evolving technology. To show the feasibility of the AM process, a prototype RFQ
section has been designed, corresponding to one-quarter of a 750 MHz 4-vane RFQ, which was optimised
for production with state-of-art Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) technology, and then manufactured
in pure copper. To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first RFQ section manufactured in
the world by AM. Subsequently, geometrical precision and surface roughness of the prototype were
measured. The results obtained are encouraging and confirm the feasibility of AM manufactured
high-tech accelerator components. It has been also confirmed that the RFQ geometry, in particular
the critical electrode modulation and the complex cooling channels, can be successfully realised
thanks to the opportunities provided by the AM technology. Further prototypes will aim to improve
surface roughness and to test vacuum properties. In parallel, laboratory measurements will start
to test and improve the voltage holding properties of AM manufactured electrode samples.

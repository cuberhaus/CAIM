To better understand the dynamics of human settlements, thorough knowledge of the uncertainty
in geospatial built-up surface datasets is critical. While frameworks for localized accuracy
assessments of categorical gridded data have been proposed to account for the spatial non-stationarity
of classification accuracy, such approaches have not been applied to (binary) built-up land data.
Such data differs from other data such as land cover data, due to considerable variations of built-up
surface density across the rural-urban continuum resulting in switches of class imbalance, causing
sparsely populated confusion matrices based on small underlying sample sizes. In this paper, we
aim to fill this gap by testing common agreement measures for their suitability and plausibility
to measure the localized accuracy of built-up surface data. We examine the sensitivity of localized
accuracy to the assessment support, as well as to the unit of analysis, and analyze the relationships
between local accuracy and density / structure-related properties of built-up areas, across rural-urban
trajectories and over time. Our experiments are based on the multi-temporal Global Human Settlement
Layer (GHSL) and a reference database for the state of Massachusetts (USA). We find strong variation
of suitability among commonly used agreement measures, and varying levels of sensitivity to the
assessment support. We then apply our framework to assess localized GHSL data accuracy over time
from 1975 to 2014. Besides increasing accuracy along the rural-urban gradient, we find that accuracy
generally increases over time, mainly driven by peri-urban densification processes in our study
area. Moreover, we find that localized densification measures derived from the GHSL tend to overestimate
peri-urban densification processes that occurred between 1975 and 2014, due to higher levels of
omission errors in the GHSL epoch 1975.

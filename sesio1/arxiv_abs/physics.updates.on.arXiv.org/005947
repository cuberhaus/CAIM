Plexcitonic strong coupling has ushered in an era of room-temperature quantum electrodynamics
that is achievable at the nanoscale, with potential applications ranging from high-precision
single-molecule spectroscopy to quantum technologies functional under ambient conditions.
Realizing these applications on an industrial scale requires scalable and mass-producible plasmonic
cavities that provide ease of access and control for quantum emitters. Via a rational selection
of substrates and the canonical gold bowtie nanoantenna, we propose a novel design strategy for
multidimensional engineering of nanocavity antenna-mode hotspots, which facilitates their
elevation to the top of the nanobowtie gap and provides a field enhancement of ~500 fold (a 1.6-fold
increase compared to a conventional nanobowtie-on-glass cavity at the bottom of the nanobowtie
gap). We discuss the formation mechanism for such antenna modes using different material substrates
from the perspective of charge carrier motion, and analyze their sensitivity to the geometrical
parameters of the device. The advantages of these antenna modes, particularly in view of their dominantly
in-plane polarized near-fields, are further elaborated in a spatiotemporal study of plexcitonic
strong coupling involving single emitters and layered ensembles thereof, which reveals ultrafast
quantum dynamics dependent on both the substrate and nanobowtie geometry, as well as the potential
for applications related to 2D materials whose excitonic dipoles are typically oriented in-plane.
The conceptual discovery of this substrate-enabled antenna-mode nanoengineering could readily
be extended to tailor hotspots in other plasmonic platforms, and we anticipate that this work could
inspire a wide range of novel research directions from photoluminescence spectroscopy and sensing
to the design of quantum logic gates and systems for long-range energy transfer.

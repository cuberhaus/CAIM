Although quantum computation (QC) is regarded as a promising numerical method for computational
quantum chemistry, current applications of quantum-chemistry calculations on quantum computers
are limited to small molecules. This limitation can be ascribed to technical problems in building
and manipulating more qubits and the associated complicated operations of quantum gates in a quantum
circuit when the size of the molecular system becomes large. As a result, reducing the number of required
qubits is necessary to make QC practical. Currently, the minimal STO-3G basis set is commonly used
in benchmark studies because it requires the minimum number of spin orbitals. Nonetheless, the
accuracy of using STO-3G is generally low and thus cannot provide useful predictions. We propose
to adopt Daubechies wavelet functions as an accurate and efficient method for QCs of molecular electronic
properties. We demonstrate that a minimal basis set constructed from Daubechies wavelet basis
can yield accurate results through a better description of the molecular Hamiltonian, while keeping
the number of spin orbitals minimal. With the improved Hamiltonian through Daubechies wavelets,
we calculate vibrational frequencies for H$_2$ and LiH using quantum-computing algorithm to show
that the results are in excellent agreement with experimental data. As a result, we achieve quantum
calculations in which accuracy is comparable with that of the full configuration interaction calculation
using the cc-pVDZ basis set, whereas the computational cost is the same as that of a STO-3G calculation.
Thus, our work provides a more efficient and accurate representation of the molecular Hamiltonian
for efficient QCs of molecular systems, and for the first time demonstrates that predictions in
agreement with experimental measurements are possible to be achieved with quantum resources available
in near-term quantum computers.

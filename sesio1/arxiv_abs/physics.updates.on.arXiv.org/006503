In this study, a series of simulations are carried out to understand the motion of a small cylinder
in the expansion tube. The simulations are fixed at two-dimensional. These simulations are performed
on the FLUENT platform employing the Overset function. The collision between the cylinder and the
tube wall is considered a positive rigid body collision without losing energy. Two key parameters,
the dimensionless gravity (Mg*) and the Reynolds number (Re), are focused. Mg* and Re is taken into
account for 4.9-79.4 and 1-300, respectively. Two types of inflow are considered: the regular inflow
or superimposed a sinusoidal inflow of periodical fluctuation. For regular inflow, three patterns
of motion are found in the phase diagrams of (Mg*, Re), which can be divided into four rigimes. At low
Mg* and low Re, such as Mg* =4.9, Re =1, the cylinder may drain at high thrust. At higher Mg* and Re, such
as Mg* =4.9, Re =4 or Mg* =19.6, Re =3, the cylinder may eventually be fixed at a certain position for
the balance of gravity and thrust. At higher Mg* and Re, such as Mg* =9.8, Re =5, the cylinder may vibrate
in the dilation tube for the wake vortex shedding. At elevated Mg* and Re, such as Mg* =78.4, Re =300,
a strange phenomenon is discovered that the cylinder may stop at a point where deviate from the central
axis. The high amplitude vibrations of the cylinder is proved widespread within the range of Reynolds
numbers from 5 to 40 for regular inflow. Re =300, Mg* =39.25 with sinusoidal periodic fluctuation
incoming flow is also considered. Unlike the regular inflow, the cylinder can also vibrate violently
that way. The two-dimensional cylinder may be considered as a simplification of a sphere if the three-dimensional
motion of the sphere is disregarded. Our research may help to understand this ancient flow problem.

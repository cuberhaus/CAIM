Scientific research and engineering practice often require the modeling and decomposition of
nonlinear systems. The Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) is a novel Koopman-based technique that
effectively dissects high-dimensional nonlinear systems into periodically distinct constituents
on reduced-order subspaces. As a novel mathematical hatchling, the DMD bears vast potentials yet
an equal degree of unknown. This serial effort investigates the nuances of DMD sampling with an engineering-oriented
emphasis. This Part I aimed at elucidating how sampling range and resolution affect the convergence
of DMD modes. We employed the most classical nonlinear system in fluid mechanics as the test subject--the
turbulent free-shear flow over a prism--for optimal pertinency. We numerically simulated the
flow by the dynamic-stress Large-Eddies Simulation with Near-Wall Resolution. With the large-quantity,
high-fidelity data, we parametrized and identified four global convergence states: Initialization,
Transition, Stabilization, and Divergence with increasing sampling range. Results showed that
the Stabilization is the optimal state for modal convergence, in which DMD output becomes independent
of the sampling range. The Initialization state also yields sufficient accuracy for most system
reconstruction tasks. Moreover, defying popular beliefs, over-sampling causes algorithmic
instability: as the temporal dimension, n, approaches and transcends the spatial dimension, m
(i.e., m < n), the output diverges and becomes meaningless. Additionally, the convergence of the
sampling resolution depends on the mode-specific dynamics, such that the resolution of 15 frames
per cycle for target activities is suggested for most engineering implementations. Finally, a
bi-parametric study revealed that the convergence of the sampling range and resolution are mutually
independent.

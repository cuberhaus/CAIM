We propose a model to describe the evolution of the political voting trends in Brazil after the dictatorship
from 1985 to nowadays. We consider a population divided in two voting groups, left and right. Each
group includes three kinds of agents, sensitives, inflexibles and radicals. While sensitives
may shift their left or right voting, inflexibles and radicals do not. Excluding political interactions
with radicals, we found sets of pair interaction parameters which reproduce all the voting outcomes
of past presidential elections from 1989 till 2014 excluding 2018. At this stage, we found that adding
an empty third voting group overlapping left and right, the populist voting group, can yield Bolsonaro
2018 victory. The initial filling of the populist group is triggered by the breaking of the interaction
barrier between sensitives and radicals, which had prevailed for decades. Some of the interacting
pairs sensitive/radical recast the sensitive into a populist. This status change from sensitive
to populist allows the populist to interact with sensitives of both left and right, thus creating
an additional source of filling of the populist group. The process is shown to yield the 2018 $55\%$
for Bolsonaro. From the 2018 distribution of votes, we evaluate the parameter changes which recover
the recent 2021 poll yielding a victory of Lula against Bolsonaro at a score of 64/36. We also present
an alternative explanation for the Bolsonaro victory in 2018 election. The aim was to reproduce
all elections outcomes (1989 - 2018) and the 2021 poll. For 2018 election and 2021 poll, we compare
the results of the two scenarios, with and without populists. Regarding the two possible scenarios
for the 2018 Bolsonaro victory, we discuss about a hypothetic Lula/Bolsonaro 2022 second round
voting and the requirements to yield either Lula or Bolsonaro victory in 2022. Both scenarios are
feasible.

This work describes three diffuse-interface methods for the simulation of immiscible, compressible
multiphase fluid flows and elastic-plastic deformation in solids. The first method is the localized-artificial-diffusivity
approach of Cook (2007), Subramaniam et al., (2018), and Adler and Lele (2019), in which artificial
diffusion terms are added to the conservation equations. The second method is the gradient-form
approach that is based on the quasi-conservative method of Shukla et al., (2010) and Tiwari et al.,
(2013), in which the diffusion and sharpening terms (together called regularization terms) are
added to the conservation equations. The third approach is the divergence-form approach that is
based on the fully conservative method of Jain et al., (2020), in which the regularization terms
are added to the conservation equations. The primary objective of this work is to compare these three
methods in terms of their ability to maintain: constant interface thickness; the conservation
property; and accurate interface shape for long-time integration. The second objective of this
work is to consistently extend these methods to model interfaces between solid materials with strength.
To assess and compare the methods, they are used to simulate a wide variety of problems, including
(1) advection of an air bubble in water, (2) shock interaction with a helium bubble in air, (3) shock
interaction and the collapse of an air bubble in water, and (4) Richtmyer-Meshkov instability of
a copper-aluminum interface. The current work focuses on comparing these methods in the limit of
relatively coarse grid resolution, which illustrates the true performance of these methods. This
is because it is rarely practical to use hundreds of grid points to resolve a single bubble or drop
in large-scale simulations of engineering interest.

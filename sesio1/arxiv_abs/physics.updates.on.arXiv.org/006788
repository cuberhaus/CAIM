High Reynolds Homogeneous Isotropic Turbulence (HIT) is fully described within the Navier-Stocks
(NS) equations, which are notoriously difficult to solve numerically. Engineers, interested
primarily in describing turbulence at reduced but sufficiently large range of resolved scales,
have designed heuristics, known under the name of Large Eddy Simulation (LES). LES is described
in terms of the evolving in time Eulerian velocity field defined over the points of a spatial grid
with the mean-spacing correspondent to the resolved scale. This classic Eulerian LES depends on
assumptions about effects of sub-grid scales on the resolved scales. In this manuscript, we take
an alternative approach and design novel LES heuristics stated in terms of Lagrangian particles
moving with the turbulent flow. Lagrangian LES, thus L-LES, is described by equations that generalize
the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) formulation with extended parametric and functional
freedom which is then resolved/fixed via Machine Learning (ML) training on Lagrangian data from
a Direct Numerical Simulation of the NS equations. The L-LES framework includes parameters which
are explainable in clear physical terms, e.g. parameters describing effects of eddy-diffusivity
and smoothing kernels, and Neural Networks (NN) to represent effects of unresolved scales. We utilize
modern methodology of Differentiable Programming and Deep NN to train the parametric and functional
degrees of freedom. We experiment with loss functions of different types, including physics-informed
ones accounting for statistics of Lagrangian particles. We show, through a series of diagnostic
tests, that the developed Lagrangian model allows to describe turbulence from a unique perspective
that is inaccessible from Eulerian LES. We also show that the L-LES is capable to reproduce Lagrangian
and Eulerian statistics of the flow at the resolved scales.

Extreme events gain tremendous attention due to their utmost importance in a variety of diverse
contexts ranging from climate science to neuroscience. Excursions of a relevant observable from
its long-term average to extraordinary values have the capability of bringing adverse consequences.
We provide here a comprehensive review to incorporate the recent efforts in understanding such
extremely large-amplitude events from the perspective of dynamical systems and random walkers.
We emphasize, in detail, the mechanisms responsible for the emergence of such events in the complex
systems. We discuss the prediction of extreme events from two different contexts using (i) dynamical
instabilities and (ii) machine learning algorithms. Tracking of instabilities in the phase space
is not always feasible and precise knowledge of the dynamics of extreme events does not necessarily
help in forecasting extreme events. Moreover, in most studies on high-dimensional systems, only
a few degrees of freedom participate in extreme events' formation. Thus, the notable inclusion
of prediction through machine learning is of enormous significance, particularly for those cases
where the governing equations of the model are explicitly unavailable. Besides, random walk on
the complex networks is capable of representing several transport processes, and exceedances
of the flux of walkers above a prescribed threshold may describe extreme events. We unveil the theoretical
studies on random walkers with their enormous potential for applications in reducing extreme events
and also discuss possible controlling strategies. This review presents an overview of the current
trend of research on extreme events in dynamical systems and networks, including random walkers,
and discusses future possibilities. We conclude this review with the extended outlook and compelling
perspective for further investigation.

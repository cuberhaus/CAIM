Bayesian networks are graphical models to represent the probabilistic relationships between
variables in the Bayesian framework. The knowledge of all variables can be updated using new information
about some of the variables. We show that relying on the Bayesian network interpretation enables
large scale inference and gives flexibility in incorporating prior assumptions and constraints
into the nuclear data evaluation process, such as sum rules and the non-negativity of cross sections.
The latter constraint is accounted for by a non-linear transformation and therefore we also discuss
inference in Bayesian networks with non-linear relationships. Using Bayesian networks, the evaluation
process yields detailed information, such as posterior estimates and uncertainties of all statistical
and systematic errors. We also elaborate on a sparse Gaussian process construction compatible
with the Bayesian network framework that can for instance be used as prior on energy-dependent model
parameters, model deficiencies and energy-dependent systematic errors of experiments. We present
three proof-of-concept examples that emerged in the context of the neutron data standards project
and in the ongoing international evaluation efforts of $^{56}$Fe. In the first example we demonstrate
the modelization and explicit estimation of relative energy-dependent error components of experimental
datasets. Then we show an example evaluation using the outlined Gaussian process construction
in an evaluation of $^{56}$Fe in the energy range between one and two MeV, where R-Matrix and nuclear
model fits are difficult. Finally, we present a model-based evaluation of $^{56}$Fe between 5 MeV
and 30 MeV with a sound treatment of model deficiencies. The R scripts to reproduce the Bayesian network
examples and the nucdataBaynet package for Bayesian network modeling and inference have been made
publicly available.

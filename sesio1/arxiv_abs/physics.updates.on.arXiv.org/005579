We put forward the complex helicity theorem. It constitutes a novel law that rules the build-up of
the reactive helicity through its zero time-average flow. Its imaginary Poynting momentum accounts
for the accretion of reactive power, are illustrated in: evanescent waves and fields scattered
from magnetodielectric dipolar nanoparticles. As for the former, we show that its reactive helicity
may be experimentally observed as we introduce a reactive spin momentum and a reactive orbital momentum
in terms of which we express the imaginary field momentum, whose transversal component produces
an optical force on a magnetoelectric particle that, as we illustrate, may surpass and can be discriminated
from, the known force due to the so-called extraordinary momentum. We also uncover a non-conservative
force on such a magnetoelectric particle, acting in the decay direction of the evanescent wave,
and that may also be discriminated from the standard gradient force; thus making the reactive power
of the wavefield also observable. Concerning the light scattered by magnetoelectric nanoparticles,
we establish two optical theorems that govern the accretion of reactive helicity and reactive power
on extinction of incident wave helicity and energy. Like a nule total -- internal plus external --
reactive power is at the root of a resonant scattered power, we show that a zero total reactive helicity
underlies a resonant scattered helicity. The first Kerker condition, under which the particle
becomes dual on illumination with circularly polarized light, we demonstrate to amount to a nule
overall scattered reactive helicity. and emission. We discover a discriminatory property of the
reactive helicity of chiral light incident on a chiral nanoparticle by excitation of the external
reactive power. This for optical near-field enantiomeric separation, we call reactive dichroism.

Speed-of-sound and attenuation of ultrasound waves vary in the tissues. There exist methods in
the literature that allow for spatially reconstructing the distribution of group speed-of-sound
(SoS) and frequency-dependent ultrasound attenuation (UA) using reflections from an acoustic
mirror positioned at a known distance from the transducer. These methods utilize a conventional
ultrasound transducer operating in pulse-echo mode and a calibration protocol with measurements
in water. In this study, we introduce a novel method for reconstructing local SoS and UA maps as a function
of acoustic frequency through Fourier-domain analysis and by fitting linear and power-law dependency
models in closed form. Frequency-dependent SoS and UA together characterize the tissue comprehensively
in spectral domain within the utilized transducer bandwidth. In simulations, our proposed methods
are shown to yield low reconstruction error: 0.01 dB/cmMHz^y for attenuation coefficient and 0.05
for the frequency exponent. For tissue-mimicking phantoms and ex-vivo bovine muscle samples,
a high reconstruction contrast was achieved. Attenuation exponents in a gelatin-cellulose mixture
and an ex-vivo bovine muscle sample were found to be, respectively, 1.3 and 0.6 on average. Linear
dispersion of SoS in a gelatin-cellulose mixture and an ex-vivo bovine muscle sample were found
to be, respectively, 1.3 and 4.0 m/sMHz on average. These findings were reproducible when the inclusion
and substrate materials were exchanged. Bulk loss modulus in the bovine muscle sample was computed
to be approximately 4 times the bulk loss modulus in the gelatin-cellulose mixture. Such frequency-dependent
characteristics of SoS and UA, and bulk loss modulus may therefore differentiate tissues as potential
diagnostic biomarkers.

Silicon nitride (SiN) drumhead resonators offer a promising platform for thermal sensing due to
their high mechanical quality factor and the high temperature sensitivity of their resonance frequency.
As such, gaining an understanding of heat transport in SiN resonators as well as their sensing noise
limitations is of interest, both of which are goals of the present work. We first present new experimental
results on radiative heat transport in SiN membrane, which we use for benchmarking two recently
proposed theoretical models. We measure the characteristic thermal response time of square SiN
membranes with a thickness of 90 $\pm$ 1.7 nm and side lengths from 1.5 to 12 mm. A clear transition
between radiation and conduction dominated heat transport is measured, in close correspondence
with theory. In the second portion of this work, we use our experimentally validated heat transport
model to provide a closed-form expression for thermal fluctuation-induced frequency noise in
SiN membrane resonators. We find that, for large area SiN membranes, thermal fluctuations can be
greater than thermomechanical contributions to frequency noise. For the specific case of thermal
radiation sensing applications, we also derive the noise equivalent power resulting from thermal
fluctuation-induced frequency noise, and we show in which conditions it reduces to the classical
detectivity limit of thermal radiation sensors. Our work therefore provides a path towards achieving
thermal radiation sensors operating at the never attained fundamental detectivity limit of bolometric
sensing. We also identify questions that remain when attempting to push the limits of radiation
sensing, in particular, the effect of thermal fluctuation noise in closed-loop frequency tracking
schemes remains to be clarified.

As field surveys used for manual lithological mapping are costly and time-consuming, digital lithological
mapping (DLM) that utilizes remotely sensed spectral imaging provides a viable and economical
alternative. Generally, DLM has been performed using spectral imaging with the use of laboratory-generated
generic endmember signatures. To that end, this paper proposes generating a single-target abundance
mineral map for DLM, where the generated map can further be used as a guide for the selection or avoidance
of a field survey. For that, a stochastic cancellation-based methodology was used to generate a
site-specific endemic signature for the mineral in concern to reduce the inclusive nature otherwise
present in DLM. Furthermore, a soil pixel alignment strategy to visualize the relative purity level
of the target mineral has been introduced in the proposed work. Then, for the method validation,
mapping of limestone deposits in the Jaffna peninsula of Sri Lanka was conducted as the case study
using satellite-based spectral imaging as the input. It was observed that despite the low signal-to-noise
ratio of the input hyperspectral data the proposed methodology was able to robustly extract the
rich information contained in the input data. Further, a field survey was conducted to collect soil
samples of four sites chosen by the proposed DLM from the Jaffna peninsula as an algorithm validation
and to demonstrate the application of the proposed solution. The proposed abundance threshold
of 0.1 coincided with the industrial standard X-ray diffraction (XRD) threshold of 5% for the mineral
presence. The results of the XRD test validated the use of the algorithm in the selection of sites
to be surveyed, hence could avoid conducting a costly field survey on the assumption of the existence
of a mineral.

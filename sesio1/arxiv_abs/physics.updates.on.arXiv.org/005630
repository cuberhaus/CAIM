Floating offshore structures often exhibit low-frequency oscillatory motions in the horizontal
plane, with amplitudes in the same order as their characteristic dimensions and larger than the
corresponding wave-frequency responses, making the traditional formulations in an inertial
coordinate system inconsistent and less applicable. To address this issue, we extend and explore
an alternative formulation completely based on a non-inertial body-fixed coordinate system.
Unlike the traditional seakeeping models, this formulation consistently allows for large-amplitude
horizontal motions. A numerical model based on a higher-order boundary element is applied to solve
the resulting boundary-value problems in the time domain. A recently developed new set of explicit
time-integration methods, which do not necessitate the use of upwind schemes for spatial derivatives,
are adopted to deal with the convective-type free-surface conditions. To suppress the weak saw-tooth
instabilities on the free surface in time marching, we also present novel low-pass filters based
on optimized weighted-least-squares, which are in principle applicable for both structured and
unstructured meshes. The presented schemes for the convection equation and the low-pass filter
are also relevant for other engineering fields dealing with similar mathematical problems. For
ship seakeeping and added resistance analyses, we show that the present computational model does
not need to use soft-springs for surge and sway, in contrast to the traditional models. For a floating
monopile, the importance of consistently taking into account the effects of large horizontal motions
is demonstrated considering the bi-chromatic incident waves. The present model is considered
as a complete 2nd order wave-load model, as all the 2nd order wave loads, including the sum-frequency
and difference-frequency components, are solved simultaneously.

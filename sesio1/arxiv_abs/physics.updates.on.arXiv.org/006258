The employment of atmospheric pressure plasma jets (APPJs) in a large sort of applications is limited
by the adversities related to the size of the treated area and the difficulty to reach the target.
The use of devices that employ long tubes in their structure has contributed significantly to overcome
these challenges. In this work, a comparison between two different plasma systems employing the
jet transfer technique is presented. The main difference between the two devices is how the long
plastic tube was assembled. The first one uses a copper wire placed inside a long plastic tube. The
other device has a metallic mesh installed in a concentric arrangement between two coaxial plastic
tubes. As a result, the two APPJ systems exhibit different properties, with the wire assembly being
more powerful, also presenting higher values for the electrical current and rotational temperature
when compared to the mesh mounting. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) demonstrates that
both configurations were capable of inserting O-containing functional groups on the polypropylene
(PP) surface. However, the transferred plasma jet with wire assembly was able to add more functional
groups on the PP surface. The results from XPS analysis were corroborated with water contact angle
measurements (WCA), being that lower WCA values were obtained when the PP surface presented higher
amounts of O-containing groups. Surface morphology evaluation showed that the plasma treatment
tends to slightly increase the surface roughness of the PP samples with both wire and mesh configurations.
Furthermore, the findings in this work suggest that the APPJ with wire configuration is more appropriate
for material treatments, while the transferred jet with mesh arrangement tends to present lower
electrical current values which makes it more suitable for biological applications.

A CFD-driven deterministic symbolic identification algorithm for learning explicit algebraic
Reynolds-stress models (EARSM) from high-fidelity data is developed building on the frozen-training
SpaRTA algorithm of [1]. Corrections for the Reynolds stress tensor and the production of transported
turbulent quantities of a baseline linear eddy viscosity model (LEVM) are expressed as functions
of tensor polynomials selected from a library of candidate functions. The CFD-driven training
consists in solving a blackbox optimization problem in which the fitness of candidate EARSM models
is evaluated by running RANS simulations. Unlike the frozen-training approach, the proposed methodology
is not restricted to data sets for which full fields of high-fidelity data are available. However,
the solution of a high-dimensional expensive blackbox function optimization problem is required.
Several steps are then undertaken to reduce the associated computational burden. First, a sensitivity
analysis is used to identify the most influential terms and to reduce the dimensionality of the search
space. Afterwards, the Constrained Optimization using Response Surface (CORS) algorithm, which
approximates the black-box cost function using a response surface constructed from a limited number
of CFD solves, is used to find the optimal model parameters. Model discovery and cross-validation
is performed for three configurations of 2D turbulent separated flows in channels of variable section
using different sets of training data to show the flexibility of the method. The discovered models
are then applied to the prediction of an unseen 2D separated flow with higher Reynolds number and
different geometry. The predictions for the new case are shown to be not only more accurate than the
baseline LEVM, but also of a multi-purpose EARSM model derived from purely physical arguments.

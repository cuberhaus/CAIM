Hyperpolarized nuclear magnetic resonance and lab-on-a-chip microfluidics are two dynamic,
but until recently quite distinct, fields of research. Recent developments in both areas increased
their synergistic overlap. By microfluidic integration, many complex experimental steps can
be brought together onto a single platform. Microfluidic devices are therefore increasingly finding
applications in medical diagnostics, forensic analysis, and biomedical research. In particular,
they provide novel and powerful ways to culture cells, cell aggregates, and even functional models
of entire organs. Nuclear magnetic resonance is a non-invasive, high-resolution spectroscopic
technique which allows real-time process monitoring with chemical specificity. It is ideally
suited for observing metabolic and other biological and chemical processes in microfluidic systems.
However, its intrinsically low sensitivity has limited its application. Recent advances in nuclear
hyperpolarization techniques may change this: under special circumstances, it is possible to
enhance NMR signals by up to 5 orders of magnitude, which dramatically extends the utility of NMR
in the context of microfluidic systems. At the same time, hyperpolarization requires complex chemical
and/or physical manipulations, which in turn may benefit from microfluidic implementation. In
fact, many hyperpolarization methodologies rely on processes that are more efficient at the micro-scale,
such as molecular diffusion, penetration electromagnetic radiation into the sample, or restricted
molecular mobility on a surface. In this review we examine the confluence between the fields of hyperpolarization-enhanced
NMR and microfluidics, and assess how these areas of research have mutually benefited one another,
and will continue to do so.

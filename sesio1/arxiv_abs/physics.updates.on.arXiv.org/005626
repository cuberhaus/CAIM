The tendency of a jet to stay attached to a flat or convex surface is called the Coand\u{a} effect and
has many potential technical applications. The aim of this thesis is to assess how well Computational
Fluid Dynamics can capture it. A Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes approach with a 2-dimensional
domain was first used to simulate an offset jet on a flat plane. Whether it was for $k-\omega$ SST or
$k-\epsilon$ turbulence model, a good prediction of the flow was found. Since it is known that streamline
curvature can have an important impact on the numerical results, a jet blown tangentially to a cylinder
was then considered. Using the same approach as for the flat plane, with $k-\omega$ SST turbulence
model, some of the flow features such as the separation location or velocity profiles near the jet
exit were accurately predicted. However, the jet development was overall poorly captured. A Curvature
Correction was then introduced in the turbulence model and if it did slightly improve the jet development,
the negative impact on other quantities makes its benefits questionable. Due to the known presence
of longitudinal and spanwise vortices in the flow, a Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes approach
with a 3-dimensional domain was attempted but was only able to reproduce the 2-dimensional results.
Although if the longitudinal vortices are artificially generated at the inlet, their development
is supported by the simulation. Finally, since the shortcomings of the numerical results obtained
might be due to limitations of the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes approach, a Large Eddy Simulation
was attempted. Unfortunately, due to time and computational restrictions a fully developed flow
could not be obtained, the methodology and preliminary results are however presented.

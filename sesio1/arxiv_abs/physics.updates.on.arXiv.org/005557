The high demand for machine intelligence of doubling every three months is driving novel hardware
solutions beyond charging of electrical wires given a resurrection to application specific integrated
circuit (ASIC)-based accelerators. These innovations include photonic ASICs (P-ASIC) due to
prospects of performing optical linear (and also nonlinear) operations, such as multiply-accumulate
for vector matrix multiplications or convolutions, without iterative architectures. Such photonic
linear algebra enables picosecond delay when photonic integrated circuits are utilized, via on-the-fly
mathematics. However, the neurons full function includes providing a nonlinear activation function,
knowns as thresholding, to enable decision making on inferred data. Many P-ASIC solutions performing
this nonlinearity in the electronic domain, which brings challenges in terms of data throughput
and delay, thus breaking the optical link and introducing increased system complexity via domain
crossings. This work follows the notion of utilizing enhanced light-matter-interactions to provide
efficient, compact, and engineerable electro-optic neuron nonlinearity. Here, we introduce
and demonstrate a novel electro-optic device to engineer the shape of this optical nonlinearity
to resemble a rectifying linear unit (ReLU) - the most-commonly used nonlinear activation function
in neural networks. We combine the counter-directional transfer functions from heterostructures
made out of two electro-optic materials to design a diode-like nonlinear response of the device.
Integrating this nonlinearity into a photonic neural network, we show how the electrostatics of
this thresholders gating junction improves machine learning inference accuracy and the energy
efficiency of the neural network.

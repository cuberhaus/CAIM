In this article we present an algorithm to efficiently evaluate the exchange matrix in periodic
systems when Gaussian basis set with pseudopotentials are used. The usual algorithm for evaluating
exchange matrix scales cubically with the system size because one has to perform $O(N^{2})$ fast
Fourier transforms (FFT). Here we introduce an algorithm that retains the cubic scaling but reduces
the prefactor significantly by eliminating the need to do FFTs during each exchange build. This
is accomplished by representing the products of Gaussian basis function using a linear combination
of an auxiliary basis the number of which scales linearly with the size of the system. We store the
potential due to these auxiliary functions in memory which allows us to obtain the exchange matrix
without the need to do FFT, albeit at the cost of additional memory requirement. Although the basic
idea of using auxiliary functions is not new, our algorithm is cheaper due to a combination of three
ingredients: (a) we use robust Pseudospectral method that allows us to use a relatively small number
of auxiliary basis to obtain high accuracy (b) we use occ-RI exchange which eliminates the need to
construct the full exchange matrix and (c) we use the (interpolative separable density fitting)
ISDF algorithm to construct these auxiliary basis that are used in the robust pseudospectral method.
The resulting algorithm is accurate and we note that the error in the final energy decreases exponentially
rapidly with the number of auxiliary functions. Finally, we find that the wall time of 62 s and 118
s are needed for a single build of the Coulomb and exchange matrices respectively on 16 nodes for a
Li$_{256}$H$_{256}$ unit cell that contains 1024 electrons and 4864 basis functions.

The advent of fast sensing technologies allows for real-time model updates in many applications
where the model parameters are uncertain. Bayesian algorithms, such as ensemble smoothers, offer
a real-time probabilistic inversion accounting for uncertainties. However, they rely on the repeated
evaluation of the computational models, and deep neural network (DNN) based proxies can be useful
to address this computational bottleneck. This paper studies the effects of the approximate nature
of the deep learned models and associated model errors during the inversion of extra-deep borehole
electromagnetic (EM) measurements, which are critical for geosteering. Using a deep neural network
(DNN) as a forward model allows us to perform thousands of model evaluations within seconds, which
is very useful for quantifying uncertainties and non-uniqueness in real-time. While significant
efforts are usually made to ensure the accuracy of the DNN models, it is known that they contain unknown
model errors in the regions not covered by the training data. When DNNs are utilized during inversion
of EM measurements, the effects of the model errors could manifest themselves as a bias in the estimated
input parameters and, consequently, might result in a low-quality geosteering decision. We present
numerical results highlighting the challenges associated with the inversion of EM measurements
while neglecting model error. We further demonstrate the utility of a recently proposed flexible
iterative ensemble smoother in reducing the effect of model bias by capturing the unknown model
errors, thus improving the quality of the estimated subsurface properties for geosteering operation.
Moreover, we describe a procedure for identifying inversion multimodality and propose possible
solutions to alleviate it in real-time.

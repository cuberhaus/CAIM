One approach to reduce the cost to simulate transitional compressible boundary layer flow is to
adopt a near body reduced domain with boundary conditions enforced to be compatible with a computationally
cheaper 3D RANS simulation. In such an approach it is desirable to enforce a consistent pressure
distribution which is not typically the case when using the standard Riemann inflow boundary condition.
We revisit the Riemann problem adopted in many DG based high fidelity formulations. Through analysis
of the 1D linearised Euler equations it is demonstrated that maintaining entropy compatibility
with the RANS simulation is important for a stable solution. The maintenance of Riemann invariant
at outflow leaves one condition that can be imposed at the inflow. Therefore the entropy-pressure
enforcement is the only stable boundary condition to enforce a known pressure distribution. We
further demonstrate that all the entropy compatible inflow Riemann boundary conditions are stable
providing the invariant compatible Riemann outflow boundary condition is also respected. Although
the entropy-pressure compatible Riemann inflow boundary condition is stable from the 1D analysis,
2D tests highlight divergence in the inviscid problem and neutrally stable wiggles in the velocity
fields in viscous simulations around the stagnation point. A 2D analysis about a non-uniform baseflow
assumption provides insight into this stability issue (ill-posedness) and motivate the use of
a mix of inflow boundary conditions in this region of the flow. As a validation we apply the proposed
boundary conditions to a reduced domain of a wing section normal to the leading-edge of the CRM-NLF
model taken out of a full 3D RANS simulation at Mach 0.86 and a Reynolds number of 8.5 million. The results
show that the entropy-pressure compatible Riemann inflow boundary condition leads to a good agreement
in pressure distribution.

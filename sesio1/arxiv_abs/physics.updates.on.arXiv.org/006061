It is possible to describe a universal scalar field of time but not a universal coordinate of time
and to attribute its non-geodesic alignment to the electromagnetic phenomena. A very surprising
outcome is that not only mass generates gravity but also electric charge does. Charge is, however,
coupled to a non-geodesic vector field and thus is not totally equivalent to inertial mass. The model
can be seen as misalignment of physically accessible events in an observer spacetime and of gravity
as a controlling response by volumetric contraction of the observer spacetime in the direction
where events bend or accelerate to. This non geodesic acceleration is described by a generalization
of the Reeb vector. Misalignment of events can be described by 1, 2, and 3 such vectors. The paper presents
a term with 4 vectors but does not discuss its physical meaning. The paper also discusses particle
mass ratios and the Fine Structure Constant where added or subtracted area in relation to a disk does
not involve a ratio 1/24 but 1/96 due to the physical meaning of the orientation of a space foliation
which is perpendicular to a time-like vector and due to the orientation of a plane which is perpendicular
to a time-like vector and its Reeb vector. These two orientations mean that only one side of a 3 dimensional
foliation has a physical meaning and only one side of a sub-plane of that foliation has a physical
meaning then 1/2 1/2 1/24=1/96. An additional coefficient 4/{\pi} describes an acceleration field
strength and also has a compelling source in mainstream physics. Other two field strength coefficients
are less understood but are very intuitive, these are 95/96 and a critical value due to an imbalance

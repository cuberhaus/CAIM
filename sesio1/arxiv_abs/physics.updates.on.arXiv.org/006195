Thin-film evaporation and the replenishing capillary liquid flow have paramount importance for
various technological applications spanning from desalination to electronics cooling. With
the developments enabling faster and cheaper yet more precise fabrication, evaporators with micropillar
arrays have attracted substantial attention to sustain efficient evaporation fed by passive liquid
transport. Although considerable effort has been devoted to designing optimized wicks, the full
picture is still blurry due to complexities in modeling the liquid-vapor interface and the flow
around the micropillars. Fundamentally, the heat transfer from a micropillar wick evaporator
is a problem governed by various interfacial phenomena such as the capillarity induced liquid flow,
thin-film evaporation intensifying near the contact lines, and thermocapillarity induced Marangoni
flow. However, past works have not been able to assess the effect Marangoni flow due to the missing
coupling between cell- and device-level modeling. In this work, we develop a comprehensive model
for the evaporation from a micropillar wick evaporator by coupling the liquid flow with the energy
transfer in both liquid and solid domains at both cell- and device-levels. The model is successfully
validated with previous experiments. When Ma number is sufficiently high, the model identifies
a sharp reduction in the evaporator temperature attributed to the thermocapillary convection
creating circulations beneath the liquid-vapor interface. This temperature reduction cannot
be identified when thermocapillarity is switched off in the model and the model's prediction substantially
deviates from the experimental measurement. Therefore, the current study reveals a hitherto unexplored
role of Marangoni flow in the evaporation of water from micropillar wick evaporators.

Purpose: Patient-specific ridge filters can modulate proton energy to obtain a conformal dose.
We describe a new framework for optimization of filter design and spot maps to meet the unique demands
of FLASH radiotherapy. We demonstrate an Integrated Biological Optimization IMPT (IBO-IMPT)
approach for optimization of dose, dose-averaged dose rate (DADR), and dose-averaged LET (LETd).
Methods: We developed inverse planning software to design patient-specific ridge filters that
spread the Bragg peak from a fixed-energy, 250 MeV beam to a proximal beam-specific planning target
volume. The software optimizes patient-specific ridge filter and uses a Monte Carlo calculation
engine, based on Geant4, to provide dose and LET influence matrices. Plan optimization, using matRAD,
accommodates the IBO-IMPT objective function considering dose, dose rate, and LET simultaneously
with minimum MU constraints. The framework enables design of both regularly spaced and sparse-optimized
ridge filters, which allow faster delivery and selective LET optimization. Volume distributions
and histograms for dose, DADR, and LETd are compared using evaluation structures specific to the
heart and lung. Results: We used IBO-IMPT to design ridge filters for a central lung tumor patient.
The IBO-IMPT framework selectively spared heart and lung by reducing LET and increasing dose rate,
relative to IMPT planning. Sparse-optimized ridge filters were superior to regularly spaced ridge
filters in dose rate. Together, these innovations substantially increased the DADR in the heart
and lung while maintaining good target coverage. The volume that received a FLASH dose rate of higher
40 Gy/second increased by 31% for heart and 50% for lung. Conclusion: This proof-of-concept study
demonstrates the feasibility of using an IBO-IMPT framework to accomplish proton FLASH SBPT, accounting
for dose, DADR, and LETd simultaneously.

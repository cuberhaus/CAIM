Information avalanches in social media are typically studied in a similar fashion as avalanches
of neuronal activity in the brain. Whereas a large body of literature reveals substantial agreement
about the existence of a unique process characterizing neuronal activity across organisms, the
dynamics of information in online social media is far less understood. Statistical laws of information
avalanches are found in previous studies to be not robust across systems, and radically different
processes are used to represent plausible driving mechanisms for information propagation. Here,
we analyze almost 1 billion time-stamped events collected from a multitude of online platforms
-- including Telegram, Twitter and Weibo -- over observation windows longer than 10 years to show
that the propagation of information in social media is a universal and critical process. Universality
arises from the observation of identical macroscopic patterns across platforms, irrespective
of the details of the specific system at hand. Critical behavior is deduced from the power-law distributions,
and corresponding hyperscaling relations, characterizing size and duration of avalanches of
information. Neuronal activity may be modeled as a simple contagion process, where only a single
exposure to activity may be sufficient for its diffusion. On the contrary, statistical testing
on our data indicates that a mixture of simple and complex contagion, where involvement of an individual
requires exposure from multiple acquaintances, characterizes the propagation of information
in social media. We show that the complexity of the process is correlated with the semantic content
of the information that is propagated. Conversational topics about music, movies and TV shows tend
to propagate as simple contagion processes, whereas controversial discussions on political/societal
themes obey the rules of complex contagion.

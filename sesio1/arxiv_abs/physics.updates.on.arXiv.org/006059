Non-covalent bonding patterns are commonly harvested as a design principle in the field of catalysis,
supramolecular chemistry and functional materials to name a few. Yet, their computational description
generally neglects finite temperature and environment effects, which promote competing interactions
and alter their static gas-phase properties. Recently, neural network potentials (NNPs) trained
on Density Functional Theory (DFT) data have become increasingly popular to simulate molecular
phenomena in condensed phase with an accuracy comparable to ab initio methods. To date, most applications
have centered on solid-state materials or fairly simple molecules made of a limited number of elements.
Herein, we focus on the persistence and strength of chalcogen bonds involving a benzotelluradiazole
in condensed phase. While the tellurium-containing heteroaromatic molecules are known to exhibit
pronounced interactions with anions and lone pairs of different atoms, the relevance of competing
intermolecular interactions, notably with the solvent, is complicated to monitor experimentally
but also challenging to model at an accurate electronic structure level. Here, we train direct and
baselined NNPs to reproduce hybrid DFT energies and forces in order to identify what are the most
prevalent non-covalent interactions occurring in a solute-Cl$^-$-THF mixture. The simulations
in explicit solvent highlight the clear competition with chalcogen bonds formed with the solvent
and the short-range directionality of the interaction with direct consequences for the molecular
properties in the solution. The comparison with other potentials (e.g., AMOEBA, direct NNP and
continuum solvent model) also demonstrates that baselined NNPs offer a reliable picture of the
non-covalent interaction interplay occurring in solution.

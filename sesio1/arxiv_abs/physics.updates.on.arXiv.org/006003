A molecule of size 125nm has caused around 272 million infections and 5.3 million deaths worldwide.
Those numbers are 50.4 million and 802,951 in the USA. It is called SARS-CoV-2, which causes a disease
known as COVID-19. The high damaging cost of the pandemic had incentivized various private, government,
and academic entities to work towards finding a cure for this disease. As an outcome, multiple vaccine
candidates are discovered to avoid the infection in the first place. But so far, there has been no
success in finding therapeutics candidates. In this paper, we attempted to provide multiple therapy
candidates based upon a sophisticated multi-scale in-silico framework, which increases the probability
of the candidates surviving an in-vivo trial. We have selected a group of ligands from the ZINC database
based upon previously partially successful candidates, i.e., Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir,
Remdesivir, Ritonavir. We have used the following robust framework to screen the ligands; Step-I:
high throughput molecular docking, Step-II: molecular dynamics analysis, Step-III: density
functional theory analysis. In total, we have analyzed 242,000(ligands)*9(proteins)= 2.178
million unique protein binding site/ligand combinations. The proteins were selected based on
recent studies evaluating potential inhibitor binding sites. Step-I had filtered that number
down to 10 ligands/protein-based on molecular docking binding energy, which is further filtered
down to 2 ligands/protein based on drug-likeness analysis. Additionally, these two ligands per
protein were analyzed in Step-II with a molecular dynamics modeling-based RMSD filter of less than
1{\AA}. It finally suggested three ligands (ZINC001176619532, ZINC000517580540, ZINC000952855827)
attacking different binding sites of the same protein(7BV2), which were further analyzed in Step
III to find the rationale behind higher ligand stability.

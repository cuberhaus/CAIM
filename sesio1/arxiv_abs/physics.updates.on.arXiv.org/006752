Numerous efforts have been devoted to improve the electronic and optical properties of III-V compound
materials via reduction of their nonradiative states, aiming at highly-efficient III-V sub-micrometer
devices. Despite many advances, there is still a controversial debate on which combination of chemical
treatment and capping dielectric layer can best reproducibly protect the crystal surface of III-Vs,
while being compatible with readily available plasma deposition methods. This work reports on
a systematic experimental study on the role of sulfide ammonium chemical treatment followed by
dielectric coating in the passivation effect of GaAs/AlGaAs nanopillars. Our results conclusively
show that the best surface passivation is achieved using ammonium sulfide followed by encapsulation
with a thin layer of silicon nitride by low frequency plasma enhanced chemical deposition. Here,
the sulfurized GaAs surfaces, the high level of hydrogen ions and the low frequency (380 kHz) excitation
plasma that enable intense bombardment of hydrogen, all seem to provide a combined active role in
the passivation mechanism of the pillars. We observe up to a 29-fold increase of the photoluminescence
(PL) integrated intensity for the best samples as compared to untreated nanopillars. X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy analysis confirms the best treatments show remarkable removal of gallium and arsenic
native oxides. Time-resolved micro-PL measurements display nanosecond lifetimes resulting
in a record-low surface recombination velocity for dry etched GaAs nanopillars. We achieve robust,
stable and long-term passivated nanopillar surfaces which creates expectations for remarkable
high internal quantum efficiency (IQE>0.5) in nanoscale light-emitting diodes. The enhanced
performance paves the way to many other nanostructures and devices such as miniature resonators,
lasers, photodetectors and solar cells.

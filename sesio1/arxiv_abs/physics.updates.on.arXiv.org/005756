Conventional damage localization algorithms used in ultrasonic guided wave-based structural
health monitoring (GW-SHM) rely on physics-defined features of GW signals. In addition to requiring
domain knowledge of the interaction of various GW modes with various types of damages, they also
suffer from errors due to variations in environmental and operating conditions (EOCs) in practical
use cases. While several machine learning tools have been reported for EOC compensation, they need
to be custom-designed for each combination of damage and structure due to their dependence on physics-defined
feature extraction. In this work, we propose a CNN-based automated feature extraction framework
coupled with Gaussian mixture model (GMM) based EOC compensation and damage classification and
localization method. Features learnt by the CNNs are used for damage classification and localization
of damage by modeling the probability distribution of the features using GMMs. The Kullback-Leibler
(KL) divergence of these GMMs with respect to corresponding baseline GMMs are used as signal difference
coefficients (SDCs) to compute damage indices (DIs) along various GW sensor paths, and thus for
damage localization. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated using FE generated GW-data
for an aluminum plate with a network of six lead zirconate titanate (PZT) sensors, for three different
types of damages (rivet hole, added mass, notch) at various temperatures, with added white noise
and pink noise to incorporate errors due to EOCs. We also present experimental validation of the
method through characterization of notch damage in an aluminum panel under varying and non-uniform
temperature profiles, using a portable custom-designed field programmable gate array (FPGA)
based signal transduction and data acquisition system.

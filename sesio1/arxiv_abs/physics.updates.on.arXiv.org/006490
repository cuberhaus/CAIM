Investigation of the magnetic switching and magnetoresistive behaviour of nanoscale spin valve
elements of different sizes, shapes and arrays is of vital importance for their application in future
magnetic memory and storage devices. To this end, we have inspected the magnetic switching mechanism
and magnetoresistive behaviour of nanoscale spin valve (Co/Cu/Ni80Fe20) elements of two different
shapes with varying lateral aspect ratios (ARs) by computational micromagnetic simulation. Further,
we have inspected the same for 2x2 and 3x3 arrays of the elliptical elements with AR = 1.25 of varying
interelement spacing. We have analysed how the shape of the hysteresis loop and its various parameters
such as the coercive field, remanence, saturation field were altered by the variation in magnetic
field. The magnetization reversal states were simulated to explore the spatial coherence of magnetization
switching. We observe that the elements with higher AR show the Ni80Fe20 and Co layers forming antiparallel
states in the plateau similar to synthetic antiferromagnets. As we reduce the AR, more complex quasi-uniform
magnetic states are observed which are even more complicated for elliptical elements. The elliptical
elements with the aspect ratio of 1.25 shows coherent and predictable switching behaviour, showing
its suitability for the application in magnetic memory elements. We observe a gradual increase
in magnetoresistance (MR%) with the increase in AR of the spin valve elements, and the decrease in
interelement spacing between the spin valve elements in their arrays. The magnetic flux density
decreases, as we increase the cell spacing between the elements. The magnetic hysteresis loops,
magnetoresistance and spatial coherence of magnetic switching give a guiding principle for selection
of geometric parameters of nanoscale spin valve arrays towards their application in magnetic memory
devices.

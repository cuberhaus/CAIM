Our ability to predict the structure and evolution of stars is in part limited by complex, 3D hydrodynamic
processes such as convective boundary mixing. Hydrodynamic simulations help us understand the
dynamics of stellar convection and convective boundaries. However, the codes used to compute such
simulations are usually tested on extremely simple problems and the reliability and reproducibility
of their predictions for turbulent flows is unclear. We define a test problem involving turbulent
convection in a plane-parallel box, which leads to mass entrainment from, and internal-wave generation
in, a stably stratified layer. We compare the outputs from the codes FLASH, MUSIC, PPMSTAR, PROMPI,
and SLH, which have been widely employed to study hydrodynamic problems in stellar interiors. The
convection is dominated by the largest scales that fit into the simulation box. All time-averaged
profiles of velocity components, fluctuation amplitudes, and fluxes of enthalpy and kinetic energy
are within $\lesssim 3\sigma$ of the mean of all simulations on a given grid ($128^3$ and $256^3$
grid cells), where $\sigma$ describes the statistical variation due to the flow's time dependence.
They also agree well with a $512^3$ reference run. The $128^3$ and $256^3$ simulations agree within
$9\%$ and $4\%$, respectively, on the total mass entrained into the convective layer. The entrainment
rate appears to be set by the amount of energy that can be converted to work in our setup and details
of the small-scale flows in the boundary layer seem to be largely irrelevant. Our results lend credence
to hydrodynamic simulations of flows in stellar interiors. We provide in electronic form all outputs
of our simulations as well as all information needed to reproduce or extend our study.

Plumes in a convective flow, whose flow structure is localised in space and time, are considered
to be relevant to the turbulent transport in convection. The effective mass, momentum, and heat
transports in the convective turbulence are investigated in the framework of time--space double
averaging procedure, where a field quantity is decomposed into three parts: the spatiotemporal
mean (spatial average of the time-averaged) field, the dispersion or coherent fluctuation (deviation
from the spatiotemporal mean), and the random or incoherent fluctuation. With this double-averaging
framework, turbulent correlations such as the Reynolds stress, turbulent mass flux, turbulent
internal-energy flux, etc., in the mean-field equations are divided into the dispersion/coherent
correlation part and the random/incoherent correlation part. The evolution equations of these
two parts of the correlation show what are responsible for the conversion of the fluctuation energy
between the coherent and incoherent components. By reckoning the plume as the coherent fluctuation,
a transport model for the convective turbulence is constructed with the aid of the non-equilibrium
effect along plume motions, and applied to a stellar convective flow. One of the prominent characteristics
of a surface cooling-driven convection, the enhanced and localised turbulent mass flux below the
surface layer, which cannot be reproduced at all by the usual eddy-diffusivity model with mixing
length theory (MLT), is well reproduced by the present model with the non-equilibrium effect. Our
results show that the incorporation of plume motion into turbulent transport model through the
non-equilibrium effect is an important and very relevant extension of mean-field theory beyond
the heuristic gradient transport model with MLT.

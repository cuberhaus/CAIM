Reconstruction of a stable and reliable solution from noisy incomplete Fourier intensity data
recorded in a coherent X-ray imaging (CXI) experiment is a challenging problem. The Relaxed Averaged
Alternating Reflections (RAAR) algorithm that is concluded with a number of Error Reduction (ER)
iterations is a popular choice. The RAAR-ER algorithm is usually employed for several hundreds
of times starting with independent random guesses to obtain trial solutions that are then averaged
to obtain the phase retrieval transfer function (PRTF). In this paper, we examine the phase retrieval
solution obtained using the RAAR-ER methodology from perspective of the complexity parameter
that was introduced by us in recent works. We observe that a single run of the RAAR-ER algorithm produces
a solution with higher complexity compared to what is expected based on the complexity parameter
as manifested by spurious high frequency grainy artifacts in the solution that do not seem to go away
completely even after a number of trial solutions are averaged. We then describe a CG-RAAR (Complexity
Guided RAAR) phase retrieval method that can effectively address this inconsistency problem and
provides artifact-free solutions. The CG-RAAR methodology is first illustrated with simulated
unblocked noisy Fourier intensity data and later applied to centrally-blocked noisy cyanobacterium
data which is available from the CXIDB database. Our simulation and experimental results using
CG-RAAR suggest two important improvements over the popular RAAR-ER algorithm. The CG-RAAR solutions
after the averaging procedure is more reliable in the sense that it contains smallest features consistent
with the resolution estimated by the PRTF curve. Secondly, since the single run of the CG-RAAR solution
does not have grainy artifacts, the number of trial solutions needed for the averaging process is
reduced.

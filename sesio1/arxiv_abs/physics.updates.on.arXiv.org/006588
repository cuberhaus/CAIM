Carbon sequestration was studied in the planted Israeli Yatir forest, a 28 ${km}^2$ Aleppo pine
forest growing at the semi-arid timberline (with no irrigation or fertilization). The organic
carbon sequestration rate (above and below ground) was measured as 550 gram $CO_2 {m}^{-2} {yr}^{-1}$,
by Eddy Covariance flux and Carbon Stock counting methods. Assuming that the soil composition at
Yatir is representative, we estimate a global organic sequestration rate of roughly 7.5 billion
tons $CO_2$ per year, after future global forestation, by extrapolating to 50% of the global semi-arid
area. Consider now the inorganic carbon sequestration rate. $CO_2$ exhaled into the soil by tree
roots is hydrated by soil water to produce mainly bicarbonate ${{HCO}_3}^-$, which combines with
soil ${Ca}^{2+}$ to precipitate calcite ${CaCO}_3$. We quantify the annual sequestration rate
in Yatir soil cores by measuring the decreased density versus depth, of bicarbonates in the liquid
phase of the soil unsaturated zone (USZ). We found that the bicarbonate concentration decreases
with depth, as the calcite precipitates and is incorporated within the USZ. The depth profiles were
converted to time profiles, taking into account the $\approx 11 cm/yr$ annual rate of downward water
percolation at Yatir. In 1 Liter of sediment, using data from a core depth of 2.2 meters, the calcite
precipitation rate was measured as 22 mg $CO_2 {yr}^{-1} L^{-1}$. Taking 6 m as the global semi-arid
average depth of root respiration, extrapolating as above, roughly 2 billion tons of $CO_2$ could
potentially be sequestered globally each year. The total organic plus inorganic sequestration
rate is then $\approx 10$ billion tons $CO_2$ per year. This demonstrates the global potential,
the need for further measurements, and the need to begin implementing a global land management policy
of widespread tree planting in semi-arid regions.

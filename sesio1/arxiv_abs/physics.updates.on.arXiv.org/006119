Due to its angular dependency, Cerenkov light has long been considered a contamination signal in
plastic scintillating dosimeters. In this study, we propose a novel approach designed to take advantage
of this angular dependency to perform a direct measurement of an external beam radiation angle of
incidence. A Cerenkov probe composed of a 10-mm long filtered sensitive volume of clear PMMA optical
fibre was built. Both filtered and raw Cerenkov signals from the transport fibre were collected
through a single 1-mm diameter transport fibre. An independent PSD composed of 10-mm BCF12 scintillating
fibre was also used for simultaneous dose measurements. A first series of measurements aimed at
validating the ability to account for the Cerenkov electron energy spectrum dependency by simultaneously
measuring the deposited dose. A cylindrical phantom was then used to obtain an angular calibration
curve for fixed dose irradiations and perform incident angle measurements using electron and photon
beams. The beam nominal energy was found to have a significant impact on the shapes of the angular
calibration curves obtained for irradiation angle measurements. This can be linked to the electron
energy spectrum dependency of the Cerenkov emission cone. Irradiation angle measurements exhibit
an absolute mean error of 1.86{\deg} and 1.02{\deg} at 6 and 18 MV, respectively. Similar results
were obtained with electron beams and the absolute mean error reaches 1.97, 1.66, 1.45 and 0.95 degrees
at 9, 12, 16 and 20 MeV, respectively. Reducing the numerical aperture of the Cerenkov probe leads
to an increased angular dependency for the lowest energy while no major changes were observed at
higher energy. This allowed irradiation angle measurements at 6 MeV with a mean absolute error of
4.82{\deg}. The detector offers promising perspectives for external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy
applications.

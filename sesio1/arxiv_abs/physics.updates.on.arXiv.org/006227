We reconcile for the first time the strict mathematical formalism of multivariate cumulants with
the usage of cumulants in anisotropic flow analyses in high-energy nuclear collisions. This reconciliation
yields to the next generation of estimators to be used in flow analyses. We review all fundamental
properties of multivariate cumulants and use them as a foundation to establish two simple necessary
conditions to determine whether some multivariate random variable is a multivariate cumulant
in the basis they are expressed in. We argue that properties of cumulants are preserved only for the
stochastic variables on which the cumulant expansion has been performed directly, and if there
are no underlying symmetries due to which some terms in the cumulant expansion are identically zero.
We illustrate one possibility of new multivariate cumulants of azimuthal angles by defining them
event-by-event and by keeping all non-isotropic terms in the cumulant expansion. Further, we introduce
new cumulants of flow amplitudes named Asymmetric Cumulants, which generalize recently introduced
Symmetric Cumulants for the case when flow amplitudes are raised to different powers. Finally,
we present the new concept of Cumulants of Symmetry Plane Correlations and provide the first realisation
for the lowest orders. The new estimators can be used directly to constrain the multivariate probability
density function of flow fluctuations, since its functional form can be reconstructed only from
its true moments or cumulants. The new definition for cumulants of azimuthal angles enables separation
of nonflow and flow contributions, and offers first insights into how the combinatorial background
contributes for small multiplicities to flow measurements with correlation techniques. All the
presented results are supported by Monte Carlo studies using state-of-the-art models.

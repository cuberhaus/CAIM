The $\mathbb{C}^{\wedge 18}$ analogue model contains counterparts to the full particle spectrum
and interactions of the Standard Model, but has only three tunable parameters. As the structure
of this model is highly constrained, predictive relationships between its counterparts to the
constants of the Standard Model may be obtained. In Part VI, the model values for the masses of the
tau, the $W$ and $Z$ bosons, and a Higgs-like scalar boson are calculated as functions of $\alpha$,
$m_e$, and $m_\mu$, with no free fitting parameters. They are shown to be $1.7768715(2)$ GeV/$c^2$,
$80.3784(24)$ GeV/$c^2$, $91.1875(37)$ GeV/$c^2$, and $125.2498(51)$ GeV/$c^2$ respectively.
All are within $0.1\,\sigma$ or better of the corresponding observed values of $1.77686(12)$ GeV/$c^2$,
$80.379(12)$ GeV/$c^2$, $91.1876(21)$ GeV/$c^2$, and $125.25(17)$ GeV/$c^2$ respectively.
In Part VII the final ungauged freedom of the $\mathbb{C}^{\wedge 18}$ model is used to eliminate
the right-handed weak interaction, while simultaneously introducing space--time curvature,
and a gravitational interaction which emulates general relativity in experimentally observed
regimes. The model is then predictive of the value of Newton's constant, yielding $G_N=6.67427(240)\times
10^{-11}~\mathrm{m}^3\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\mathrm{s}^{-2}$. Although the error bars on this calculated
value are quite large, the central value is in agreement with the observed value of $G_N=6.67430(15)\times
10^{-11}~\mathrm{m}^3\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\mathrm{s}^{-2}$ to a precision of better than $0.18\,\sigma_\mathrm{exp}$.
This congruence with observation suggests the existence of a unifying relationship between lepton
generations and the electroweak mass scale, which is proposed to arise from preon interactions
mediated by the strong nuclear force.

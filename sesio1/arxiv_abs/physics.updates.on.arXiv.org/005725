We study the conditions of propagation of an initial emergent practice qualified as extremist within
a population adept at a practice perceived as moderate, whether political, societal or religious.
The extremist practice is carried by an initially ultra-minority of Radicals (R) dispersed among
Conventionals (C) who are the overwhelming majority in the community. Both R and C are followers,
that is, agents who, while having arguments to legitimize their current practice, are likely to
switch to the other practice if given more arguments during a debate. The issue being controversial,
most C tend to avoid social confrontation with R about it. They maintain a neutral indifference assuming
it is none of their business. On the contrary, R aim to convince C through an expansion strategy to
spread their practice as part of a collective agenda. However, aware of being followers, they implement
an appropriate strategy to maximize their expansion and determine when to force a debate with C.
The effect of this asymmetry between initiating or avoiding an update debate among followers is
calculated using a weighted version of the Galam model of opinion dynamics. An underlying complex
landscape is obtained as a function of the respective probabilities to engage in a local discussion
by R and C. It discloses zones where R inexorably expand and zones where they get extinct. The results
highlight the instrumental character of above asymmetry in providing a decisive advantage to R
against C. It also points to a barrier in R initial support to reach the extension zone. In parallel,
the landscape reveals a path for C to counter R expansion pushing them back into their extinction
zone. It relies on the asymmetry of C being initially a large majority which puts the required involvement
of C at a low level.

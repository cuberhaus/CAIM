Surface buoyancy gradients over a quasigeostrophic fluid permit the existence of surface-trapped
Rossby waves. The interplay of these Rossby waves with surface quasigeostrophic turbulence results
in latitudinally inhomogeneous mixing that, under certain conditions, culminates in a surface
buoyancy staircase: a meridional buoyancy profile consisting of mixed-zones punctuated by sharp
buoyancy gradients, with eastward jets centred at the sharp gradients and weaker westward flows
in between. In this article, we investigate the emergence of this buoyancy staircase limit in surface
quasigeostrophic turbulence and we examine the dependence of the resulting dynamics on the vertical
stratification. Over decreasing stratification [$\mathrm{d}N(z)/\mathrm{d}z\leq0$, where
$N(z)$ is the buoyancy frequency], we obtain flows with a longer interaction range (than in uniform
stratification) and highly dispersive Rossby waves. In the staircase limit, we find straight jets
that are perturbed by eastward propagating along jet waves, similar to two-dimensional barotropic
$\beta$-plane turbulence. In contrast, over increasing stratification [$\mathrm{d}N(z)/\mathrm{d}z\geq0$],
we obtain flows with shorter interaction range and weakly dispersive Rossby waves. In the staircase
limit, we find sinuous jets with large latitudinal meanders whose shape evolves in time due to the
westward propagation of weakly dispersive along jet waves. These along jet waves have larger amplitudes
over increasing stratification than over decreasing stratification, and, as a result, the ratio
of domain-averaged zonal to meridional speeds is two to three times smaller over increasing stratification
than over decreasing stratification. Finally, we find that, for a given Rhines wavenumber, jets
over increasing stratification are closer together than jets over decreasing stratification.

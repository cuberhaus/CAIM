The order/dimension of models derived on the basis of data is commonly restricted by the number of
observations, or in the context of monitored systems, sensing nodes. This is particularly true
for structural systems (e.g. civil or mechanical structures), which are typically high-dimensional
in nature. In the scope of physics-informed machine learning, this paper proposes a framework -
termed Neural Modal ODEs - to integrate physics-based modeling with deep learning (particularly,
Neural Ordinary Differential Equations -- Neural ODEs) for modeling the dynamics of monitored
and high-dimensional engineered systems. In this initiating exploration, we restrict ourselves
to linear or mildly nonlinear systems. We propose an architecture that couples a dynamic version
of variational autoencoders with physics-informed Neural ODEs (Pi-Neural ODEs). An encoder,
as a part of the autoencoder, learns the abstract mappings from the first few items of observational
data to the initial values of the latent variables, which drive the learning of embedded dynamics
via physics-informed Neural ODEs, imposing a \textit{modal model} structure to that latent space.
The decoder of the proposed model adopts the eigenmodes derived from an eigen-analysis applied
to the linearized portion of a physics-based model: a process implicitly carrying the spatial relationship
between degrees-of-freedom (DOFs). The framework is validated on a numerical example, and an experimental
dataset of a scaled cable-stayed bridge, where the learned hybrid model is shown to outperform a
purely physics-based approach to modeling. We further show the functionality of the proposed scheme
within the context of virtual sensing, i.e., the recovery of generalized response quantities in
unmeasured DOFs from spatially sparse data.

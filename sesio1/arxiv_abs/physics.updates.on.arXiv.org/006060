Purpose: A newly designed diode EDGE Detector has been characterized for use in an UHDR electron
beam and demonstrated appropriateness for UHDR FLASH radiotherapy dosimetry. Methods: Dose linearity,
mean dose rate, and dose per pulse dependencies of the EDGE Detector were quantified and compared
with dosimeters including a W1 scintillator detector, radiochromic film, and ionization chamber,
irradiated with a 10 MeV UHDR beam. The dose, dose rate and dose per pulse were controlled via an in-house
developed scintillation-based feedback mechanism, repetition rate of the linear accelerator,
and source-to-surface distance, respectively. Depth-dose profiles and temporal profiles at
single pulse resolution were compared to the film and scintillation measurements, respectively.
The radiation-induced change in response sensitivity was quantified via irradiation of ~5kGy.
Results: The EDGE Detector agreed with film measurements in the measured range with varying dose
(up to 70 Gy), dose rate (nearly 200 Gy/s), and dose per pulse (up to 0.63 Gy/pulse) on average to within
2%, 5%, and 1%, respectively. The EDGE Detector signal was proportional to IC measured dose, and
mean dose rate in the bremsstrahlung tail to within 0.4% and 0.2% respectively. The EDGE Detector
measured percent depth dose agreed with film to within 3% and per pulse output agreed with W1 scintillator
to within 4%. The radiation-induced response decrease was 0.4% per kGy. Conclusions: The EDGE Detector
demonstrated dose linearity, mean dose rate independence, and dose per pulse independence for
UHDR electron beams. It can quantify the beam spatially, and temporally at sub millisecond resolution.
It's robustness and single pulse detectability of treatment deliveries can potentially lead to
its implementation for in vivo FLASH dosimetry, and dose monitoring.

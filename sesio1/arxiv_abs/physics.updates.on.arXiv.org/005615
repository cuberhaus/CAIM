Abstract Our ab initio all-electron relativistic Dirac-Fock (DF) calculations for seaborgium
hexacarbonyl Sg(CO)6 and seaborgium hexaisocarbonyl Sg(OC)6 predict atomization energies of
68.80 and 64.30 eV. Our Dirac-Fock-Breit-Gaunt (DFBG) calculations for Sg(CO)6 and Sg(OC)6 yield
atomization energies of 69.18 and 64.77 eV. However, our calculated non-relativistic (NR) Ae for
Sg (CO)6 and Sg(OC)6 are 68.46 and 62.62 eV. The calculated isomerization energies at the DFBG, DF,
and NR levels are 4.41,4.50 and 5.83 eV. The contribution of relativity to the Eiso is - ~1.33 eV. The
optimized bond distances Sg-C and C-O for octahedral Sg(CO)6 using our DF (NR) calculations are
2.151 ( 2.318 and 1.119 ( 1.114 (ang}). The optimized six Sg-O and C-O bond distances for octahedral
Sg(OC)6 at the DF level are equal to 4.897 and 1.108 {ang}. However, the optimized four Sg-O bond distances
for the octahedral Sg(OC)6 at the NR level are 5.160 {ang} each, and two Sg-O bonds of 2.721 {ang} each,
but all six C-O bonds are 1.108{ang} each. The energies at the DF level of theory for the reaction Sg+6CO
to yield Sg (CO)6 and Sg(OC)6 are calculated as -7.30 and -2.80 eV. Moreover, the energies of the reaction
at the DFBG level to yield Sg(CO)6 and Sg(OC)6 are very close to those predicted at the DF level of theory
of -7.17 and -2.76 eV. However, the NR energies of the above-mentioned reaction are -6.99 and -1.15
eV. The mean bond energies predicted for Sg(CO)6 with our DF, DFBG, and NR calculations are 117.40
, 115.31, and 112.41 kJ/mol, whereas the mean bond energies calculated for the isomer Sg(OC)6 at
DF, DFBG and NR levels are 45.03 ,44.39 and 18.49 kJ/mole. The predicted existence of both the isomers
with Eiso of ~ 4.50 and ~ 5.80 eV, may cause problems for experimental identification of seaborgium
hexacarbonyl.

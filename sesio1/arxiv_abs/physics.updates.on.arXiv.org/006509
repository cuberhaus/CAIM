We introduce a novel approach to improving the resolution of PIV measurements. The method blends
information from different snapshots without the need for time-resolved measurements on grounds
of similarity of flow regions in different snapshots. The main hypothesis is that, with a sufficiently
large ensemble of statistically-independent snapshots, the identification of flow structures
that are morphologically similar but occurring at different time instants is feasible. Measured
individual vectors from different snapshots with similar flow organisation can thus be merged,
resulting in an artificially increased particle concentration. This allows to refine the interrogation
region and, consequently, increase the spatial resolution. The measurement domain is split in
subdomains. The similarity is enforced only on a local scale, i.e. morphologically-similar regions
are sought only among subdomains corresponding to the same flow region. The identification of locally-similar
snapshots is based on unsupervised K-nearest neighbours search in a space of significant flow features.
Such features are defined in terms of a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition, performed in subdomains
on the original low-resolution data, obtained either with standard cross-correlation or with
binning of Particle Tracking Velocimetry data with a relatively large bin size. A refined bin size
is then selected according to the number of "sufficiently close" snapshots identified. The statistical
dispersion of the velocity vectors within the bin is then used to estimate the uncertainty and to
select the optimal K which minimises it. The method is tested and validated against datasets with
a progressively increasing level of complexity: two virtual experiments based on direct simulations
of the wake of a fluidic pinball and a channel flow and the experimental data collected in a turbulent
boundary layer.

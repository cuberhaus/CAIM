We present an in-depth study of the reflectance spectra of 39 equilibrated and 41 unequilibrated
ordinary chondrites. We demonstrate that consistent measuring conditions are vital for the direct
comparison of spectral features between chondrites, otherwise hampering any conclusions. We
include a comparison with a total of 466 S-type asteroid reflectance spectra. We analyze (i) if a
difference between EOCs and UOCs as well as between H, L and LL can be seen, (ii) if it is possible to
identify unequilibrated and equilibrated S-type asteroid surfaces and (iii) if we can further
constrain the match between OCs and S-type asteroids all based on reflectance spectra. We checked
the classification of the 31 Antarctic UOCs analyzed in the present work, using petrography and
magnetic measurements, and evidenced that 74% of them were misclassified. Reflectance spectra
were compared between EOCs and UOCs as well as between H, L and LL chondrites using a set of spectral
features including band depths and positions, peak reflectance values, spectral slopes and the
Ol/(Ol + Px) ratio. UOCs and EOCs reflectance spectra show no clear-cut dichotomy, but a continuum
with some EOCs showing stronger absorption bands and peak reflectance values, while others are
comparable to UOCs. We show by the example of 6 EOCs that their band depths decrease with decreasing
grain size. Based on reflectance spectra alone, it is thus highly challenging to objectively identify
an unequilibrated from an equilibrated S-type surface. There is no clear distinction of the chemical
groups: only LL EOCs of petrographic type > 4 can be distinguished from H and L through less deep 2-mic
band depths and 1-mic band positions at longer wavelengths. Lastly, an anti-correlation between
the diameter of the asteroids and their 1000 nm band depth is found indicating that larger sized S-type
asteroids show finer grained surfaces.

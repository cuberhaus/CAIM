In the ever-increasing energy demand scenario, the development of novel photovoltaic (PV) technologies
is considered to be one of the key solutions to fulfil the energy request. In this context, graphene
and related two-dimensional (2D) materials (GRMs), including nonlayered 2D materials and 2D perovskites,
as well as their hybrid systems, are emerging as promising candidates to drive innovation in PV technologies.
The mechanical, thermal, and optoelectronic properties of GRMs can be exploited in different active
components of solar cells to design next-generation devices. These components include front (transparent)
and back conductive electrodes, charge transporting layers, and interconnecting-recombination
layers, as well as photoactive layers. The production and processing of GRMs in the liquid phase,
coupled with the ability to on-demand tune their optoelectronic properties exploiting wet-chemical
functionalization, enable their effective integration in advanced PV devices through scalable,
reliable, and inexpensive printing-coating processes. Herein, we review the progresses in the
use of solution-processed 2D materials in organic solar cells, dye-sensitized solar cells, perovskite
solar cells, quantum dot solar cells, and organic-inorganic hybrid solar cells, as well as in tandem
systems. We first provide a brief introduction on the properties of 2D materials and their production
methods by solution-processing routes. Then, we discuss the functionality of 2D materials for
electrodes, photoactive layer components-additives, charge transporting layers, and interconnecting
layers through figures of merit, which allow the performance of solar cells to be determined and
compared with the state-of-the-art values. We finally outline the roadmap for the further exploitation
of solution-processed 2D materials to boost the performance of PV devices.

Scattering experiments can be leveraged to extract the effective properties of a heterogeneous
metamaterial slab based on multi-point measurements in surrounding media. In this technique,
two measurements are made in the ambient media on each side of a finite thickness micro-structured
slab to decompose incoming and outgoing waves. The method is applied to an example with locally resonant
micro-structured inclusions while paying close attention to parameters that influence the extracted
material parameters. It is observed that the extracted overall parameters converge to limiting
values when the number of unit cells across the slab thickness or ambient media modulus are increased.
Dependence of extracted material parameters on the number of cells through thickness or ambient
media properties are attributed to the different response of boundary (skin) and interior cells.
A method is presented which represents a finite array with different effective properties for the
skin regions vs. the interior regions with great success in reproducing the scattering for different
slab thicknesses, and through which the interior regions properties become independent of ambient
media properties. In stop bands with lower material loss, challenges arise that are associated
with extremely small transmission. The assumption of continuity in transmission phase is enforceable
to remove phase ambiguity, although in certain cases (associated with nearly lossless specimens)
this assumption appears to fail. In such cases, interference from coupled shear modes may lead to
apparent higher longitudinal transmission within the stop band. This work provides a proof of concept
for the development of an experimental methodology capable of extracting the effective properties
and dispersion behavior of heterogeneous mechanical metamaterials without any knowledge of the
internal fields.

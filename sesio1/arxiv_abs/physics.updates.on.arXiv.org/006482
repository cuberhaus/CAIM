The distribution of the prompt gamma emissions induced by proton interactions in a target material
carries information concerning the proton range and target composition. We propose multiple approaches
for prompt gamma imaging depending on the quantity of interest and the detection scenario. The first
approach is a practical design based on knife-edge collimator utilized in tandem with a compact
PET type detector to verify range by measuring depth distribution of prompt gamma in an efficient
manner. A second approach aims at unambiguously identifying the presence of protons in a region
of interest by introducing a fiducial marker and measuring the characteristic prompt gamma of the
marker against background material. A third approach illustrates a novel design for position sensitive
gamma imaging with a millimeter level adjustable position resolution with a high detection efficiency
which is a step towards 3D prompt gamma imaging, useful if the goal is to better understand the target
composition. Simulations of the designs were performed using GATE/Geant4 Monte Carlo framework.
Experimental tests for some cases were conducted at the proton facilities in INER and Chang Gung
Memorial hospital. Using the knife-edge PET approach a range verification of $\pm$ 0.7 mm can be
achieved for shifts within a 1 cm near the tumor region and up to $\pm$ 4 mm for shifts within a 4 cm window.
For the fiducial marker approach we identify 984 keV as the dominant prompt gamma and show that for
the 50% relative PG intensity, the R80 position falls within a 3 mm thick $^{48}$Ti marker. Using
the position sensitive gamma imaging approach we present a feasible design to achieve spatial resolution
values of 2.6 mm with a detection efficiency of 5.4E-6 and up to eight depth positions in a single run.
The relative advantage of these methods and the challenges in the implementation are discussed.

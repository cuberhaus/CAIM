The modeling and simulation of stochastic reaction-diffusion processes is a topic of steady interest
that is approached with a wide range of methods. \rev{At the level of particle-resolved descriptions,
where chemical reactions are coupled to the spatial diffusion of individual particles, there exist
comprehensive numerical simulation schemes, while the corresponding mathematical formalization
is relatively underdeveloped. The aim of this paper is to provide a framework to systematically
formulate the probabilistic evolution equation, termed chemical diffusion master equation (CDME),
that governs particle-based stochastic reaction-diffusion processes. To account for the non-conserved
and unbounded particle number of this type of open systems, we employ a classical analogue of the
quantum mechanical Fock space that contains the symmetrized probability densities of the many-particle
configurations in space. Following field-theoretical ideas of second quantization, we introduce
creation and annihilation operators that act on single-particle densities and provide natural
representations of symmetrized probability densities as well as of reaction and diffusion operators.
These operators allow us to consistently and systematically formulate the CDME for arbitrary reaction
schemes. The resulting form of the CDME further serves as the foundation to derive more coarse-grained
descriptions of reaction-diffusion dynamics. In this regard, we show that a discretization of
the evolution equation by projection onto a Fock subspace generated by a finite set of single-particle
densities leads to a generalized form of the well-known reaction-diffusion master equation, which
supports non-local reactions between grid cells and which converges properly in the continuum
limit.

The coupling of the internal mechanisms of cell polarization to cell shape deformations and subsequent
cell crawling poses many interdisciplinary scientific challenges. Several mathematical approaches
have been proposed to model the coupling of both processes, where one of the most successful methods
relies on a phase field that encodes the morphology of the cell, together with the integration of
partial differential equations that account for the polarization mechanism inside the cell domain
as defined by the phase field. This approach has been previously employed to model the motion of single
cells of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, a widely used model organism to study actin-driven
motility and chemotaxis of eukaryotic cells. Besides single cell motility, Dictyostelium discoideum
is also well-known for its collective behavior. Here, we extend the previously introduced model
for single cell motility to describe the collective motion of large populations of interacting
amoebae by including repulsive interactions between the cells. We performed numerical simulations
of this model, first characterizing the motion of single cells in terms of their polarity and velocity
vectors. We then systematically studied the collisions between two cells that provided the basic
interaction scenarios also observed in larger ensembles of interacting amoebae. Finally, the
relevance of the cell density was analyzed, revealing a systematic decrease of the motility with
density, associated with the formation of transient cell clusters that emerge in this system. This
model is a prototypical active matter system for the investigation of the emergent collective dynamics
of deformable, self-driven cells with a highly complex, nonlinear coupling of cell shape deformations,
self-propulsion and repulsive cell-cell interactions.

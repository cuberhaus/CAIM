The recent uptake in popularity in vehicles with zero tailpipe emissions is a welcome development
in the fight against traffic induced airborne pollutants. As vehicle fleets become electrified,
and tailpipe emissions become less prevalent, non-tailpipe emissions (from tires and brake disks)
will become the dominant source of traffic related emissions, and will in all likelihood become
a major concern for human health. This trend is likely to be exacerbated by the heavier weight of electric
vehicles, their increased power, and their increased torque capabilities, when compared with
traditional vehicles. While the problem of emissions from tire wear is well-known, issues around
the process of tire abrasion, its impact on the environment, and modelling and mitigation measures,
remain relatively unexplored. Work on this topic has proceeded in several discrete directions
including: on-vehicle collection methods; vehicle tire-wear abatement algorithms and controlling
the ride characteristics of a vehicle, all with a view to abating tire emissions. Additional approaches
include access control mechanisms to manage aggregate tire emissions in a geofenced area with other
notable work focussing on understanding the particle size distribution of tire generated PM, the
degree to which particles become airborne, and the health impacts of tire emissions. While such
efforts are already underway, the problem of developing models to predict the aggregate picture
of a network of vehicles at the scale of a city, has yet to be considered. Our objective in this paper
is to present one such model, built using ideas from Markov chains. Applications of our modelling
approach are given toward the end of this note, both to illustrate the utility of the proposed method,
and to illustrate its application as part of a method to collect tire dust particles.

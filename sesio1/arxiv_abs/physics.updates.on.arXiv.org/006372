On-demand mobility platforms play an increasingly important role in urban mobility systems. Impacts
are still debated, as these platforms supply personalized and optimized services, while also contributing
to existing sustainability challenges. Recently, microtransit services have emerged, promising
to combine advantages of pooled on-demand rides with more sustainable fixed-route public transit
services. Understanding traveler behavior becomes a primary focus to analyze adoption likelihood
and perceptions of different microtransit attributes. The COVID-19 pandemic context adds an additional
layer of complexity to analyzing mobility innovation acceptance. This study investigates the
potential demand for microtransit options against the background of the pandemic. We use a stated
choice experiment to study the decision-making of Israeli public transit and car commuters when
offered to use novel microtransit options (sedan vs. passenger van). We investigate the tradeoffs
related to traditional fare and travel time attributes, along with microtransit features; namely
walking time to pickup location, vehicle sharing, waiting time, minimum advanced reservation
time, and shelter at designated boarding locations. Additionally, we analyze two latent constructs:
attitudes towards sharing, as well as experiences and risk-perceptions related to the COVID-19
pandemic. We develop Integrated Choice and Latent Variable models to compare the two commuter groups
in terms of the likelihood to switch to microtransit, attribute trade-offs, sharing preferences
and pandemic impacts. The results reveal high elasticities of several time and COVID effects for
car commuters compared to relative insensitivity of transit commuters to the risk of COVID contraction.
Moreover, for car commuters, those with strong sharing identities were more likely to be comfortable
in COVID risk situations, and to accept microtransit.

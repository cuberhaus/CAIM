This study investigates the influence of several Monte Carlo radiation transport codes and nuclear
models on the simulation of secondary neutron spectra and its impact on calculating and measuring
neutron doses in proton therapy. Three different multi-purpose Monte Carlo radiation transport
codes (FLUKA, MCNPX, Geant4) were used with different available nuclear models to calculate secondary
neutron energy spectra at various points inside a water tank phantom with PMMA walls using a 10 cm
x 10 cm rectangular, mono-energetic proton beam (110, 150, 180, and 210 MeV). Using Kerma approximation
secondary neutron doses were calculated applying fluence-to-dose equivalent conversion coefficients
in water. Moreover, the impact of varying spectra for electrochemically etched CR39 detector calibration
was analyzed for different codes and models. In distal positions beyond the Bragg peak, results
show largest variations between the codes, up to 53% for the high energy neutron fluence at 16 cm from
the Bragg peak of the 110 MeV proton beam. In lateral positions, the variation between the codes is
smaller and for the total neutron fluence within 20%. Variation in the nuclear models in MCNPX was
only visible for the proton beam energies of 180 and 210 MeV and modeling the high energy neutron fluence
which reached up to 23% for 210 MeV at 11 cm lateral from the beam axis. Impact on neutron dose equivalent
was limited for the different models used (<8%) while it was pronounced for the different codes (45%
at 16 cm from the Bragg peak of the 110 MeV proton beam). CR39 calibration factors in lateral positions
were on average varying 10% between codes and 5 % between nuclear models.This study demonstrated
a large impact on the neutron fluence spectra calculated by different codes while the impact of different
models in MCNPX proved to be less prominent for the neutron modeling in proton therapy.

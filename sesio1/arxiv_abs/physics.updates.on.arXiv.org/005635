The threat of global warming and the demand for confident climate predictions pose a formidable
challenge. The climate system is multiscale, high-dimensional and nonlinear. However, spatiotemporal
recurrences of the system hint to the presence of low-dimensional manifolds containing the high-dimensional
climate trajectory. Reproducing the geometrical and topological properties of the low-dimensional
attractor is an important constraint for models to generate meaningful probabilistic climate
projections. Here we propose a framework to characterize and compare the climate attractor across
observations and models. This framework is showcased in the tropical Pacific ocean using a reanalysis
as observational proxy and two state-of-the-art models. The analysis spans four variables over
the periods 1979-2019 and 2060-2100. At each time t, the system can be uniquely described by a state
space vector parameterized by N variables and their spatial variability. The dynamics is confined
on a manifold with dimension lower than the full state space that can be characterized through manifold
learning algorithms, both linear and nonlinear. The manifold learning step allows for quantifying
nonlinear contributions as well as the relative role of each variable in the system's dynamics.
Geometric properties of the high-dimensional attractor are further quantified through the local
dimension and persistence metrics, recently proposed in the climate literature. The metrics quantify
the local geometry of the climate attractor and its local stability. Both models underestimate
the average dimension and overestimate persistence compared to observations. These biases limit
climate predictability and are nearly identical among the chosen models during the historical
period while diverging in the near future under the warming scenario considered.

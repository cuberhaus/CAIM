Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instabilities are prevalent in many physical regimes ranging from astrophysical
to laboratory plasmas and have primarily been studied using fluid models, the majority of which
have been ideal fluid models. This work is the first of its kind to present a 5-dimensional (2 spatial
dimensions, 3 velocity space dimensions) simulation using the continuum-kinetic model to study
the effect of the collisional mean-free-path and transport on the instability growth. The continuum-kinetic
model provides noise-free access to the full particle distribution function permitting a detailed
investigation of the role of kinetic physics in hydrodynamic phenomena such as the RT instability.
For long mean-free-path, there is no RT instability growth, but as collisionality increases, particles
relax towards the Maxwellian velocity distribution, and the kinetic simulations reproduce the
fluid simulation results. An important and novel contribution of this work is in the intermediate
collisional cases that are not accessible with traditional fluid models and require kinetic modeling.
Simulations of intermediate collisional cases show that the RT instability evolution is significantly
altered compared to the highly collisional fluid-like cases. Specifically, the growth rate of
the intermediate collisionality RT instability is lower than the high collisionality case while
also producing a significantly more diffused interface. The higher moments of the distribution
function play a more significant role relative to inertial terms for intermediate collisionality
during the evolution of the RT instability interface. Particle energy-flux is calculated from
moments of the distribution and shows that transport is significantly altered in the intermediate
collisional case and deviates much more so from the high collisionality limit of the fluid regime.

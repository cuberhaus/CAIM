Many engineering problems require the prediction of realization-to-realization variability
or a refined description of modeled quantities. In that case, it is necessary to sample elements
from unknown high-dimensional spaces with possibly millions of degrees of freedom. While there
exist methods able to sample elements from probability density functions (PDF) with known shapes,
several approximations need to be made when the distribution is unknown. In this paper the sampling
method, as well as the inference of the underlying distribution, are both handled with a data-driven
method known as generative adversarial networks (GAN), which trains two competing neural networks
to produce a network that can effectively generate samples from the training set distribution.
In practice, it is often necessary to draw samples from conditional distributions. When the conditional
variables are continuous, only one (if any) data point corresponding to a particular value of a conditioning
variable may be available, which is not sufficient to estimate the conditional distribution. This
work handles this problem using an a priori estimation of the conditional moments of a PDF. Two approaches,
stochastic estimation, and an external neural network are compared here for computing these moments;
however, any preferred method can be used. The algorithm is demonstrated in the case of the deconvolution
of a filtered turbulent flow field. It is shown that all the versions of the proposed algorithm effectively
sample the target conditional distribution with minimal impact on the quality of the samples compared
to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the procedure can be used as a metric for the diversity
of samples generated by a conditional GAN (cGAN) conditioned with continuous variables.

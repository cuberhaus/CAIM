Structured light mechanically interacts with matter via optical forces and torques. The optical
torque is traditionally calculated via the flux of total angular momentum (AM) into a volume enclosing
an object. In [Phys. Rev. A 92, 043843 (2015)] a powerful method was suggested to calculate optical
torque separately from the flux of the spin and the orbital parts of optical AM, providing useful
physical insight. However, the method predicted a new type of dipolar torque dependent on the gradient
of the helicity density of the optical beam, inconsistent with prior torque calculations. In this
work we intend to clarify this discrepancy and clear up the confusion. We re-derive, from first principles
and with detailed derivations, both the traditional dipolar total torque using total AM flux, and
the spin and orbital torque components based on the corresponding AM contributions, ensuring that
their sum agrees with the total torque. We also test our derived analytical expressions against
numerical integration, with exact agreement. We find that `helicity gradient' torque terms indeed
exist in the spin and orbital components separately, but we present corrected prefactors, such
that upon adding them, they cancel out, and the `helicity gradient' term vanishes from the total
dipolar torque, reconciling literature results. We also derive the analytical expression of the
quadrupolar torque, showing that it is proportional to the spin of the EM field gradient, rather
than the local EM field spin, as sometimes wrongly assumed in the literature. We provide examples
of counter-intuitive situations where the spin of the EM field gradient behaves very differently
to the local EM spin. Naively using the local EM field spin leads to wrong predictions of the torque
on large particles with strong contributions of quadrupole and higher-order multipoles, especially
in a structured incident field.

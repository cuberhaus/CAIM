It has been experimentally demonstrated that reaction rates for molecules embedded in microfluidic
optical cavities are altered (decelerated) when compared to rates observed under "ordinary" reaction
conditions. Precise mechanisms of how the strong coupling of an optical cavity mode to molecular
vibrations affect the reactivity and how resonance behavior emerges are still under dispute. In
the present work, we perform quantum mechanical and transition state theory rate calculations
for a thermal model reaction, the inversion of ammonia along the umbrella mode, in presence of a single
cavity mode of varying frequency and coupling strength. Using a Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian including
dipole self-energies, two-dimensional cavity Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surfaces (cPES)
are derived. It is found that while classical activation energies for inversion are unaffected
by the cavity mode, reaction rates in cavities are nevertheless decelerated in qualitative agreement
with experiments, due to two quantum effects: The stiffening of quantized modes perpendicular
to the reaction path at the transition state, which reduces the number of thermally accessible reaction
channels, and the broadening of the barrier region which suppresses tunneling. We also find that
these two effects are very robust in a fluctuating environment, which causes statistical variations
of potential parameters such as the barrier height. Further, by solving the time-dependent Schr\"odinger
equation in the vibrational strong coupling (VSC) regime we find, in qualitative agreement with
experimental and earlier theoretical work, a resonance behavior. The latter manifests as reduced
reaction probability when the cavity frequency $\omega_c$ is tuned in resonance with a reactant
molecular frequency. The effect is due to dynamical localization of the vibropolaritonic wavepacket
in the reactant well.

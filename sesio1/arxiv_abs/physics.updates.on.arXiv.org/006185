The paper is concerned with a node-based, gradient-driven, continuous adjoint two-phase flow
procedure to optimize the shapes of free-floating vessels and discusses three topics. First, we
aim to convey that elements of a Cahn-Hilliard formulation should augment the frequently employed
Volume-of-Fluid two-phase flow model to maintain dual consistency. It is seen that such consistency
serves as the basis for a robust primal/adjoint coupling in practical applications at huge Reynolds
and Froude numbers. The second topic covers different adjoint coupling strategies. A central aspect
of the application is the floating position, particularly the trim and the sinkage, that interact
with a variation of hydrodynamic loads induced by the shape updates. Other topics addressed refer
to the required level of density coupling and a more straightforward -- yet non-frozen -- adjoint
treatment of turbulence. The third part discusses the computation of a descent direction within
a node-based environment. We will illustrate means to deform both the volume mesh and the hull shape
simultaneously and at the same time obey technical constraints on the vessel's displacement and
its extensions. The Hilbert-space approach provides smooth shape updates using the established
coding infrastructure of a computational fluid dynamics algorithm and provides access to managing
additional technical constraints. Verification and validation follow from a submerged 2D cylinder
case. The application includes a full-scale offshore supply vessel at Re=3E+08 and Fn=0.37. Results
illustrate that the fully parallel procedure can automatically reduce the drag of an already pre-optimized
shape by 9-13 within approximately O(10.000-30.000) CPUh depending on the considered couplings
and floatation aspects.

Optical interferometry has proven extremely powerful to investigate some of the most fundamental
laws of physics, using light with very precisely controlled geometry. In the past few decades, various
speckle metrology methods have emerged to harness the interferometric properties of strongly
disordered light instead, using time-domain analysis of speckle patterns at a maximum rate limited
by the frequency of image acquisition. The present work is based on using a centimeter-sized quartz-powder
cavity with an arbitrary shape that is engineered with very high Lambertian reflectivity. When
filled with a coherent monochromatic photon gas, a statistically isotropic and homogeneous 3D
speckle interference pattern is obtained. A single-mode fiber is then used in combination with
photon number autocorrelation analysis to detect minute changes of the speckle decorrelation
spectrum, caused either by cavity deformations or fluctuations of the dielectric tensor field
inside. The decorrelation spectrum is acquired over 8 to 10 frequency decades below 100 MHz, with
a sensitivity that is only limited by the intrinsic photon statistics and the extrinsic instrumental
noises. With typically 1700 reflections and an average photon transit path length of 62m, our 3D
stochastic interferometer yields a typical finesse of 10500, and cavity deformations are detected
in an ergodic fashion over a six-decade dynamic range with a power noise floor of 4x{10}^{-3} pm^2
which corresponds to 2.7 pm at 1 kHz. The cavity also operates as a speckle fluctuation amplifier
that reveals decorrelation spectra due to picometric thermal motions of colloids in both single
and multiple scattering regimes with a typical 100-fold sensitivity gain compared to conventional
light scattering techniques.

Contours are used in radiotherapy treatment planning to identify regions to be irradiated with
high dose and regions to be spared. Therefore, any contouring uncertainty influences the whole
treatment. Even though this is the biggest remaining source of uncertainty when daily IGRT or adaptation
is used, it has not been accounted for quantitatively in treatment planning. Using probabilistic
planning allows to directly account for contouring uncertainties in plan optimisation. The first
step is to create an algorithm that can generate many realistic contours with variation matching
actual inter-observer variation. We propose a methodology to generate random contours, based
on measured spatial inter-observer variation, IOV, and a single parameter that controls its geometrical
dependency: alpha, the width of the 3D Gaussian used as point spread function (PSF). We used a level
set formulation of the median shape, with the level set function defined as the signed distance transform.
To create a new contour, we added the median level set and a noise map which was weighted with the IOV
map and then convolved with the PSF. Thresholding the level set function reconstructs the newly
generated contour. We used data from 18 patients from the golden atlas, consisting of five prostate
delineations on T2-w MRI scans. To evaluate the similarity between the contours, we calculated
the maximum distance to agreement to the median shape (maxDTA), and the minimum dose of the contours
using an ideal dose distribution. We used the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to compare the
distributions for maxDTA and minDose between the generated and manually delineated contours.
Only alpha=0.75cm produced maxDTA and minDose distributions that were not significantly different
from the manually delineated structures. Accounting for the PSF is essential to correctly simulate
inter-observer variation.

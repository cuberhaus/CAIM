We often associate compound growth with the Anthropocene and our overwhelming economic impacts
on the Earth. Today our actual choices for future society appear to lie with studying the class of
emergent natural systems that first develop by compound growth, called 'new lives' here, or "natural
complex adaptive systems" (NCAS). The key to their success is first starting with compound growth,
a system for growing the system. Its self-organization needs to shift resources from multiplying
its scale to maturing and adapting its design for its new environment, a challenging environmental
coordination process. We see that taking place in biological reproduction all the time, of course,
but it all needs to occur for businesses, economies, cultures, and even for creative work and personal
relationships to survive their initial periods of compound growth. Why economic growth as a process
that accelerates ever faster still seems unlimited to some seems to come from representing growth
as a numerical rather than organizational development process. For example, all kinds of adaptive
system organization have limits to how fast they can rearrange their systems. To understand the
kinds of limits and adaptations that lead to a successful growth climax and perhaps a long creative
life to follow, we combine the most notable observed milestones of successful growth found in nature,
divided into 3 main development periods. Those milestones of new lives (MNL) teach us alternative
paths to follow The primary milestones include 3 critical events, initiating 3 feedback periods,
for 3 organizational development stages, occurring in 3 environments. Together they can be called
the A, B, C, egg, nest, world, or natural growth pattern. By observing them in familiar cases, we learn
the patterns that also apply in others.

This study explores nonwoven and woven fabrics to improve upon the performance of the widespread
all-cotton mask, and examines the effect of layering, machine washing and drying on their filtration
and breathability for submicron and supermicron particles. Individual materials were evaluated
for their quality factor, Q, which combines filtration efficiency and breathability. Filtration
was tested against particles 0.5 to 5 micron aerodynamic diameter. Nonwoven polyester and nonwoven
polypropylene (craft fabrics, medical masks, and medical wraps) showed higher quality factors
than woven materials (flannel cotton, Kona cotton, sateen cotton). Materials with meltblown nonwoven
polypropylene filtered best, especially against submicron particles. Subsequently, we combined
high performing fabrics into multi-layer sets, evaluating the sets quality factors before and
after our washing protocol, which included machine washing, machine drying, and isopropanol soak.
Sets incorporating meltblown nonwoven polypropylene designed for filtration (Filti and surgical
mask) degraded significantly post-wash in the submicron range where they excelled prior to washing
(Q = 57 and 79 at 1 micron, respectively, degraded to Q = 10 and 15 post-wash). Washing caused lesser
quality degradation in sets incorporating spunbond non-woven polypropylene or medical wraps
(Q = 12 to 24 pre-wash, Q = 8 to 10 post-wash). Post-wash quality factors are similar for all multi-layer
sets in this study, and higher than Kona quilting cotton (Q = 6). Washed multi-layer sets filtered
12-42 percent of 0.5 micron, 27-76 percent of 1 micron, 58-96 percent of 2.8 micron, and 72-100 percent
of 4.2 micron particles. The measured filtration and pressure drop of both the homogeneous and heterogeneous
multi-layer fabric combinations agreed with the estimations from the layering model.

We study negative streamers in ambient air using a 2D axisymmetric fluid model. Depending on the
background electric field, we observe accelerating, steady and fading negative streamers. Fading
occurs in low background fields, in which negative streamers undergo a streamer-to-avalanche
transition: their field enhancement keeps decreasing and the streamer velocity becomes comparable
to the maximal electron drift velocity. Our focus is on the steady propagation mode, during which
streamer properties like radius and velocity hardly change. However, this mode is unstable, in
the sense that a small change in conditions leads to acceleration or deceleration. We observe steady
negative streamers in background fields ranging from 9.19 kV/cm to 15.75 kV/cm, indicating that
there is no unique steady propagation field (or stability field). Another finding is that steady
negative streamers are able to keep propagating over tens of centimeters, with only a finite conductive
length behind their heads, similar to steady positive streamers. Approximately linear relationships
are observed between the optical diameter and properties like the streamer velocity and the streamer
head potential. From these linear relations, we obtain rough lower bounds of about 0.27 mm to 0.35
mm for the minimal optical diameter of steady negative streamers. The lowest background field in
which a steady negative streamer could be obtained is 9.19 kV/cm. In contrast, steady positive streamers
have recently been obtained in a background field as low as 4.07 kV/cm. We find that the properties
of steady negative and positive streamers differ significantly. For example, for steady negative
streamers the ratio between streamer velocity and maximal electron drift velocity ranges from
about 2 to 4.5, whereas for steady positive streamers this ratio ranges from about 0.05 to 0.26.

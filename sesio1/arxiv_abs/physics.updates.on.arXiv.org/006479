Neutron-induced reactions with charged particle emission play an important role in a variety of
research fields ranging from fundamental nuclear physics and nuclear astrophysics to applications
of nuclear technologies to energy production and material science. Recently, the capability to
study reactions with radioactive targets has become important to significantly advance research
in explosive nucleosynthesis and nuclear applications. To achieve the relevant research goals
and study (n,x) reactions over a broad neutron beam energy range, the Low Energy Neutron-induced
charged-particle (Z) chamber (LENZ) at Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE) was developed
along with varied ancillary instrumentation to enable the aforementioned research program. For
the (n,x) reactions of interest at low energies, a precise simulation of the discrete spectrum of
emitted charged particles is essential. In addition, since LANSCE is a user facility, a simulation
application that can be easily accessible by users has high value. With these goals in mind, we have
developed a detailed simulation using the GEANT4 toolkit. In this work, we present the implementation
and the validation of the simulation using experimental data from recent campaigns with the LENZ
instrument. Specifically, we benchmark the simulation against a similar MCNP-based tool and determine
the realistic range of applicability for the probability biasing technique used. We describe our
implementation of an evaluated library with angular distribution and partial cross-section data,
and we perform a validation of the application based on comparisons of simulated spectra with the
experimental ones, for a number of targets used in previous experimental campaigns. Last, we discuss
the limitations, caveats, and assets of the simulation code and techniques used.

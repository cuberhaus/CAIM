Invasive intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) or electrocorticography (ECoG) measures
electrical potential directly on the surface of the brain, and, combined with numerical modeling,
can be used to inform treatment planning for epilepsy surgery. Accurate solution of the iEEG or ECoG
forward problem, which is a crucial prerequisite for solving the inverse problem in epilepsy seizure
onset localization, requires accurate representation of the patient's brain geometry and tissue
electrical conductivity after implantation of electrodes. However, implantation of subdural
grid electrodes causes the brain to deform, which invalidates preoperatively acquired image data.
Moreover, postoperative MRI is incompatible with implanted electrodes and CT has insufficient
range of soft tissue contrast, which precludes both MRI and CT from being used to obtain the deformed
postoperative geometry. In this paper, we present a biomechanics-based image warping procedure
using preoperative MRI for tissue classification and postoperative CT for locating implanted
electrodes to perform non-rigid registration of the preoperative image data to the postoperative
configuration. We solve the iEEG forward problem on the predicted postoperative geometry using
the finite element method (FEM) which accounts for patient-specific inhomogeneity and anisotropy
of tissue conductivity. Results for the simulation of a current source in the brain show large differences
in electrical potential predicted by the models based on the original images and the deformed images
corresponding to the brain geometry deformed by placement of invasive electrodes. Computation
of the leadfield matrix also showed significant differences between the different models. The
results suggest that significant improvements in source localization accuracy may be realized
by the application of the proposed modeling methodology.

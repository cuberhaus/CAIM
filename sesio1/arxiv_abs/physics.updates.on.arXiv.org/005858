Porous electrodes are found in energy storage devices such as supercapacitors and pseudocapacitors.
However, the effect of electrode-pore-size distribution over their energy storage properties
remains unclear. Here, we develop a model for the charging of electrical double layers inside a cylindrical
pore for arbitrary pore size. We assume small applied potentials and perform a regular perturbation
analysis to predict the evolution of electrical potential and ion concentrations in both the radial
and axial directions. We validate our perturbation model with direct numerical simulations of
the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations, and obtain quantitative agreement between the two approaches
for small and moderate potentials. Our analysis yields two main characteristic features of arbitrary
pore size: i) a monotonic decrease of the charging timescale with an increase in relative pore size
(pore size relative to Debye length); ii) large potential changes for overlapping double layers
in a thin transition region, which we approximate mathematically by a jump discontinuity. We quantify
the contributions of electromigration and charge diffusion fluxes which provide mechanistic
insights into the dependence of charging timescale and capacitance on pore size. We develop a modified
transmission circuit model that captures the effect of arbitrary pore size and demonstrate that
a time-dependent transition-region resistor needs to be included in the circuit. We also derive
phenomenological expressions for average effective capacitance and charging timescale as a function
of pore-size distribution. We show that the capacitance and charging timescale increase with smaller
average pore sizes and with smaller polydispersity, resulting in a gain of energy density at a constant
power density. Overall, our results advance the mechanistic understanding of electrical-double-layer
charging.

Here, we report the development of a detailed "Materials Informatics" framework for the design
of acoustic coatings for underwater sound attenuation through integrating Machine Learning (ML)
and statistical optimization algorithms with a Finite Element Model (FEM). The finite element
models were developed to simulate the realistic performance of the acoustic coatings based on polyurethane
(PU) elastomers with embedded cylindrical voids. The FEM results revealed that the frequency-dependent
viscoelastic behavior of the polyurethane matrix has a significant impact on the magnitude and
frequency of the absorption peak associated with the cylinders at low frequencies, which has been
commonly ignored in previous studies on similar systems. The data generated from the FEM was used
to train a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to accelerate the design process, and subsequently, was integrated
with a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to determine the optimal geometric parameters of the cylinders to
achieve maximized, broadband, low-frequency waterborne sound attenuation. A significant, broadband,
low-frequency attenuation is achieved by optimally configuring the layers of cylindrical voids
and using attenuation mechanisms, including Fabry-P\'erot resonance and Bragg scattering of
the layers of voids. Integration of the machine learning technique into the optimization algorithm
further accelerated the exploration of the high dimensional design space for the targeted performance.
The developed DNN exhibited significantly increased speed (by a factor of $4.5\times 10^3$ ) in
predicting the absorption coefficient compared to the conventional FEM(s). Therefore, the acceleration
brought by the materials informatics framework brings a paradigm shift to the design and development
of acoustic coatings compared to the conventional trial-and-error practices.

The general topic of energy is regarded to be one of the most important areas for any research and development
activities at the start of the twentyfirst century. Therefore, large research efforts are already
based on or will be targeted on the development of clean fuels to replace fossil fuels, the improvement
of the existing resources and the discovery of new sustainable energy resources, the establishment
of new efficient ways to store sustainable energy, and the replacement of the existing high energy
consuming technologies with the more energy efficient ones. The latter concept has resulted in
considerable efforts recently to renovate the conventional synthetic chemical industry by introducing
new green chemistry concepts, where the energy requirements for chemical processing or synthesis
would be drastically reduced. In this context, a vast amount of novel chemical synthesis techniques
have been developed during the last decades. Such innovative techniques include combustion, sol
gel and coprecipitation methods, sonochemistry, hydrothermal synthesis, and microwave-assisted
techniques. Significant qualitative drawbacks in materials synthesized by such novel ways in
terms of crystal quality and physical properties are usually not encountered. In some cases, even
quantitative improvements, novel crystal arrangements, and interesting particle shapes can
be achieved. The concept of combining several of the recently developed nonconventional and innovative
synthesis techniques is an interesting concept to even further reduce the energy requirements
and particle sizes as compared to one technique alone. Microwave assisted combustion and sol gel
synthesis are now employed frequently, as well as the combination of hydrothermal and microwave
assisted synthesis, where the latter technique is the topic of this review.

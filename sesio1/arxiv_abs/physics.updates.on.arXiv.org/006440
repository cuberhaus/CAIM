Alternative synthetic fuels can be produced by renewable energy sources and represent a potential
route for solving long-term energy storage. Among them, oxygenated fuels have the advantage of
significantly reducing pollutant emissions and can therefore be used as carbon-neutral substitute
fuels for transportation. In this work, the sooting propensity of different oxymethylene ethers
(OMEn) is investigated using a combined experimental and numerical study on a series of burner-stabilized
premixed flames under mild to severe sooting conditions. Herein, mixtures of ethylene in combination
with the three individual OMEn for n=2-4 are compared in terms of soot formation behavior with pure
ethylene flames. The kinetic mechanism from Sun et al. (Proc. Combust. Inst. 36, 1269-1278, 2017)
for oxymethylene ether OMEn combustion with n=1-3 is extended to include OME4 decomposition and
combustion kinetics. In the numerical simulations, the kinetic mechanism is combined with a detailed
quadvariate soot model which uses the Conditional Quadrature Method of Moments and validated with
Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF) and Laser-Induced Incandescence (LII) measurements. It is
observed, that the three investigated OMEn with n=2-4 show similar sooting behavior, mainly reducing
larger aggregates while not significantly affecting the formation of smaller particles. Furthermore,
the extent of soot reduction is comparable among the three OMEn. The trends and overall reduction
are very well captured by the model. The modeling results are analyzed through reaction path analyses
and sensitivity studies which show the important role of OMEn decomposition and the formation of
CH2O under these rich conditions to reduce species relevant for soot formation. This is at the base
of the negligible observed differences in terms of soot formation for the different OMEn fuels.

The coupling of the atmosphere to the space environment has become recognized as an important driver
of atmospheric chemistry and dynamics. In order to quantify the effects of particle precipitation
on the atmosphere, reliable global energy inputs on spatial scales commensurate with particle
precipitation variations are required. To that end, we have validated auroral electron densities
derived from the SSUSI data products for average electron energy and electron energy flux by comparing
them to EISCAT electron density profiles. This comparison shows that SSUSI FUV observations can
be used to provide ionization rate and electron density profiles throughout the auroral region.
The SSUSI on board the DMSP Block 5D3 satellites provide nearly hourly, 3000 km wide, 10 km x 10 km UV
snapshots of auroral emissions. Here we use the SSUSI-derived energies and fluxes as input to standard
parametrizations in order to obtain electron-density profiles in the E region (90--150 km), which
are then compared to EISCAT ground-based electron density measurements. We compare the data from
DMSP F17 and F18 to the Troms{\o} UHF radar profiles. We find that differentiating between the magnetic
local time (MLT) morning (03:00--11:00 MLT) and evening (15:00--23:00 MLT) provides the best fit
to the ground-based data. The data agree well in the MLT morning sector using a Maxwellian electron
spectrum, while in the evening sector using a Gaussian spectrum and accounting for backscattered
electrons achieved optimum agreement with EISCAT. Depending on the satellite and MLT, the median
of the differences varies between 0% and 20% above 105 km (F17) and $\pm$15% above 100 km (F18). Because
of the large density gradient below those altitudes, the relative differences get larger, albeit
without a substantially increasing absolute difference, with virtually no statistically significant
differences at the 1-sigma level.

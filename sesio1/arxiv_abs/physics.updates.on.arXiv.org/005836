Condensable species are crucial in shaping planetary climate. A wide range of planetary climate
systems involve understanding non-dilute condensable substances and their influence on climate
dynamics. There has been progress on large-scale dynamical effects and on 1D convection parameterization,
but resolved 3D moist convection remains unexplored in non-dilute conditions, though it can have
a profound impact on temperature/humidity profiles and cloud structure. We tackle this problem
for pure-steam atmospheres using three-dimensional, high-resolution numerical simulations
of convection in post-runaway atmospheres where the water reservoir at the surface has been exhausted.
We show that the atmosphere is comprised of two characteristic regions, an upper condensing region
dominated by gravity waves and a lower noncondensing region characterized by convective overturning
cells. Velocities in the condensing region are much smaller than those in the lower noncondensing
region, and the horizontal temperature variation is small overall. Condensation in the thermal
photosphere is largely driven by radiative cooling and tends to be statistically homogeneous.
Some condensation also happens deeper, near the boundary of the condensing region, due to triggering
by gravity waves and convective penetrations and exhibit random patchiness. This qualitative
structure is insensitive to varying model parameters, but quantitative details may differ. Our
results confirm theoretical expectations that atmospheres close to the pure-steam limit do not
have organized deep convective plumes in the condensing region. The generalized convective parameterization
scheme discussed in Ding & Pierrehumbert (2016) is appropriate to handle the basic structure of
atmospheres near the pure-steam limit but is difficult to capture gravity waves and their mixing
that appear in 3D convection-resolving models.

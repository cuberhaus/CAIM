We present an interface and geometry preserving (IGP) method for the modeling of fully Eulerian
fluid-structure interaction via phase-field formulation. While the hyperbolic tangent interface
profile is preserved by the time-dependent mobility model, the proposed method maintains the geometry
of the solid-fluid interface by reducing the volume-conserved mean curvature flow. To achieve
the reduction in the curvature flow, we construct a gradient-minimizing velocity field (GMV) for
the convection of the order parameter. The constructed velocity field enables the preservation
of the solid velocity in the solid domain while extending the velocity in the normal direction throughout
the diffuse interface region. With this treatment, the GMV reduces the normal velocity difference
of the level sets of the order parameter which alleviates the undesired thickening or thinning of
the diffuse interface region due to the convection. During this process, the time-dependent mobility
coefficient is substantially reduced and there is a lesser curvature flow. The GMV ensures that
the diffuse interface region moves with the solid bulk such that the fluid-solid interface conforms
to the geometry of the solid. Using the unified momentum equation and the phase-dependent interpolation,
we integrate the IGP method into a fully Eulerian variational FSI solver based on the incompressible
viscous fluid and the neo-Hookean solid. We first demonstrate the ability of the phase-field-based
IGP method for the convection of circular and square interfaces with a prescribed velocity field.
The variational FSI framework with the IGP method is then examined for the flow passing a fixed deformable
block in a channel domain. Finally, the vibration of a plate attached behind a stationary cylinder
subjected to incoming flow is employed to assess the fully Eulerian framework for a large aspect
ratio and sharp corners.

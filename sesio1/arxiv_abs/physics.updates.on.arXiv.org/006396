Thrombosis under high-shear conditions is mediated by the mechanosensitive blood glycoprotein
von Willebrand Factor (vWF). vWF unfolds in response to strong flow gradients and facilitates rapid
recruitment of platelets in flowing blood. While the thrombogenic effect of vWF is well recognized,
its conformational response in complex flows has largely been omitted from numerical models of
thrombosis. We recently presented a continuum model for the unfolding of vWF, where we represented
vWF transport and its flow-induced conformational change using convection-diffusion-reaction
equations. Here, we incorporate the vWF component into our multi-constituent model of thrombosis,
where the local concentration of stretched vWF amplifies the deposition rate of free-flowing platelets
and reduces the shear cleaning of deposited platelets. We validate the model using three benchmarks:
in vitro model of atherothrombosis, a stagnation point flow, and the PFA-100, a clinical blood test
commonly used for screening for von Willebrand Disease (vWD). The simulations reproduced the key
aspects of vWF-mediated thrombosis observed in these experiments, such as the thrombus location,
thrombus growth dynamics, and the effect of blocking platelet-vWF interactions. The PFA-100 simulations
closely matched the reported occlusion times for normal blood and several hemostatic deficiencies,
namely, thrombocytopenia, vWD Type 1, and vWD Type 3. Overall, the multi-constituent model of thrombosis
presented in this work enables macro-scale 3-D simulations of thrombus formation in complex geometries
over a wide range of shear rates and accounts for qualitative and quantitative hemostatic deficiencies
in patient blood. The results also demonstrate the utility of the continuum model of vWF unfolding
that could be adapted to other numerical models of thrombosis.

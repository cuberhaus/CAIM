As a means to extract biomarkers from medical imaging, radiomics has attracted increased attention
from researchers. However, reproducibility and performance of radiomics in low dose CT scans are
still poor, mostly due to noise. Deep learning generative models can be used to denoise these images
and in turn improve radiomics' reproducibility and performance. However, most generative models
are trained on paired data, which can be difficult or impossible to collect. In this article, we investigate
the possibility of denoising low dose CTs using cycle generative adversarial networks (GANs) to
improve radiomics reproducibility and performance based on unpaired datasets. Two cycle GANs
were trained: 1) from paired data, by simulating low dose CTs (i.e., introducing noise) from high
dose CTs; and 2) from unpaired real low dose CTs. To accelerate convergence, during GAN training,
a slice-paired training strategy was introduced. The trained GANs were applied to three scenarios:
1) improving radiomics reproducibility in simulated low dose CT images and 2) same-day repeat low
dose CTs (RIDER dataset) and 3) improving radiomics performance in survival prediction. Cycle
GAN results were compared with a conditional GAN (CGAN) and an encoder-decoder network (EDN) trained
on simulated paired data.The cycle GAN trained on simulated data improved concordance correlation
coefficients (CCC) of radiomic features from 0.87 to 0.93 on simulated noise CT and from 0.89 to 0.92
on RIDER dataset, as well improving the AUC of survival prediction from 0.52 to 0.59. The cycle GAN
trained on real data increased the CCCs of features in RIDER to 0.95 and the AUC of survival prediction
to 0.58. The results show that cycle GANs trained on both simulated and real data can improve radiomics'
reproducibility and performance in low dose CT and achieve similar results compared to CGANs and
EDNs.

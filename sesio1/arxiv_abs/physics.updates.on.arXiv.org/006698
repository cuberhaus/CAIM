The presence of pathogens in complex, multi-cellular samples such as blood, urine, mucus, and wastewater
can serve as indicators of active infection, and their identification can impact how human and environmental
health are treated. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and machine learning (ML) can
distinguish multiple pathogen species and strains, but processing complex fluid samples to sensitively
and specifically detect pathogens remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we develop an acoustic
bioprinting platform to digitize samples into millions of droplets, each containing just a few
cells, which are then identified with SERS and ML. As a proof of concept, we focus on bacterial bloodstream
infections. We demonstrate ~2pL droplet generation from solutions containing S. epidermidis,
E. coli, and mouse red blood cells (RBCs) mixed with gold nanorods (GNRs) at 1 kHz ejection rates;
use of parallel printing heads would enable processing of mL-volume samples in minutes. Droplets
printed with GNRs achieve spectral enhancements of up to 1500x compared to samples printed without
GNRs. With this improved signal-to-noise, we train an ML model on droplets consisting of either
pure cells with GNRs or mixed, multicellular species with GNRs, using scanning electron microscopy
images as our ground truth. We achieve >=99% classification accuracy of droplets printed from cellularly-pure
samples, and >=87% accuracy in droplets printed from mixtures of S. epidermidis, E. coli, and RBCs.
We compute the feature importance at each wavenumber and confirm that the most significant spectral
bands for classification correspond to biologically relevant Raman peaks within our cells. This
combined acoustic droplet ejection, SERS and ML platform could enable clinical and industrial
translation of SERS-based cellular identification.

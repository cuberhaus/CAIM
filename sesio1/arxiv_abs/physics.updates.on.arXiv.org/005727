The identification of regions of similar climatological behavior can be utilized for the discovery
of spatial relationships over long-range scales, including teleconnections. In this regard,
the global picture of the interdependence patterns of extreme rainfall events (EREs) still needs
to be further explored. To this end, we propose a top-down complex-network-based clustering workflow,
with the combination of consensus clustering and mutual correspondences. Consensus clustering
provides a reliable community structure under each dataset, while mutual correspondences build
a matching relationship between different community structures obtained from different datasets.
This approach ensures the robustness of the identified structures when multiple datasets are available.
By applying it simultaneously to two satellite-derived precipitation datasets, we identify consistent
synchronized structures of EREs around the globe, during boreal summer. Two of them show independent
spatiotemporal characteristics, uncovering the primary compositions of different monsoon systems.
They explicitly manifest the primary intraseasonal variability in the context of the global monsoon,
in particular the `monsoon jump' over both East Asia and West Africa and the mid-summer drought over
Central America and southern Mexico. Through a case study related to the Asian summer monsoon (ASM),
we verify that the intraseasonal changes of upper-level atmospheric conditions are preserved
by significant connections within the global synchronization structure. Our work advances network-based
clustering methodology for (i) decoding the spatiotemporal configuration of interdependence
patterns of natural variability and for (ii) the intercomparison of these patterns, especially
regarding their spatial distributions over different datasets.

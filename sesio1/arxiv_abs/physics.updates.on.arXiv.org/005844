PURPOSE: To develop an automated algorithm allowing extraction of quantitative corneal transparency
parameters from clinical spectral-domain OCT images. To establish a representative dataset of
normative transparency values from healthy corneas. METHODS: SD-OCT images of 83 normal corneas
(ages 22-50 years) from a standard clinical device (RTVue-XR Avanti, Optovue Inc.) were processed.
A pre-processing procedure is applied first, including a derivative approach and a PCA-based correction
mask, to eliminate common central artifacts (i.e., apex-centered column saturation artifact
and posterior stromal artifact) and enable standardized analysis. The mean intensity stromal-depth
profile is then extracted over a 6-mm-wide corneal area and analyzed according to our previously
developed method deriving quantitative transparency parameters related to the physics of light
propagation in tissues, notably tissular heterogeneity (Birge ratio; $B_r$), followed by the
photon mean-free path ($l_s$) in homogeneous tissues (i.e., $B_r \sim 1$). RESULTS: After confirming
stromal homogeneity ($B_r < 10$, IDR: 1.9-5.1), we measured a median $l_s$ of 570 $\mu$m (IDR: 270-2400
$\mu$m). Considering corneal thicknesses, this may be translated into a median fraction of transmitted
(coherent) light $T_{coh(stroma)}$ of 51$\%$ (IDR: 22-83$\%$). No statistically significant
correlation between transparency and age or thickness was found. CONCLUSIONS: Our algorithm provides
robust and quantitative measurement of corneal transparency from standard clinical SD-OCT images.
It yields lower transparency values than previously reported, which may be attributed to our method
being exclusively sensitive to spatially coherent light. Excluding images with central artifacts
wider than 300 $\mu$m also raises our median $T_{coh(stroma)}$ to 70$\%$ (IDR: 34-87$\%$).

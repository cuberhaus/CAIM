This study presents an artificial neural network and proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)-based
reduced-order model (ROM) of turbulent flow around a finite wall-mounted square cylinder. The
proposed model is suitable for turbulent wake control applications because it can predict the dynamics
of the main features of the flow field without computing Navier-Stokes equations. Long short-term
memory neural network (LSTM NN) and bidirectional long short-term memory neural network (BLSTM
NN) are used to predict the temporal evolution of the POD time coefficients at different planes along
the height of the obstacle. The improved delayed detached-eddy simulation (IDDES) is performed
to generate the training datasets. Transfer learning (TL) approach is utilized in the training
process by using the weights of the LSTM/BLSTM NN that are used to predict the POD time coefficients
of the planes at lower elevations to initialize the weights of the networks at higher elevations
along the height of the obstacle. The use of TL results in a remarkable improvement in the capability
of the LSTM/BLSTM NN prediction compared with the one when the network is initialized with random
weights. BLSTM NN shows better results compared with LSTM NN in terms of training and prediction
error, indicating that the BLSTM-POD model is more suitable to be used as a ROM for predicting the
turbulent wake. Furthermore, the temporal behavior of the time coefficients is carefully examined
using the phase space plots and Poincar$\acute{e}$ sections. The results of using different lengths
of the prediction time window showed that the prediction error of the POD time coefficients increases
as the prediction time window increases and the error increasing rate decreases with the ranking
of the POD time coefficients.

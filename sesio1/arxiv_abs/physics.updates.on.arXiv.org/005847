Background modelling is one of the main challenges in particle physics data analysis. Commonly
employed strategies include the use of simulated events of the background processes, and the fitting
of parametric background models to the observed data. However, reliable simulations are not always
available or may be extremely costly to produce. As a result, in many cases, uncertainties associated
with the accuracy or sample size of the simulation are the limiting factor in the analysis sensitivity.
At the same time, parametric models are limited by the a priori unknown functional form and parameter
values of the background distribution. These issues become ever more pressing when large datasets
become available, as it is already the case at the CERN Large Hadron Collider, and when studying exclusive
signatures involving hadronic backgrounds. Two novel and widely applicable non-parametric data-driven
background modelling techniques are presented, which address these issues for a broad class of
searches and measurements. The first, relying on ancestral sampling, uses data from a relaxed event
selection to estimate a graph of conditional probability density functions of the variables used
in the analysis, accounting for significant correlations. A background model is then generated
by sampling events from this graph, before the full event selection is applied. In the second, a generative
adversarial network is trained to estimate the joint probability density function of the variables
used in the analysis. The training is performed on a relaxed event selection which excludes the signal
region, and the network is conditioned on a blinding variable. Subsequently, the conditional probability
density function is interpolated into the signal region to model the background. The application
of each method on a benchmark analysis is presented in detail, and the performance is discussed.

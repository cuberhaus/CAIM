Aeolian sediment transport shapes erodible surfaces and affects the dust cycles and climates of
planetary bodies. For the approximately unidirectional near-surface winds often temporarily
prevailing in planetary atmospheres, sediment transport approaches an equilibrium state when
given enough fetch to adapt. Here, we use grain scale-resolved numerical sediment transport simulations
to derive scaling laws for equilibrium transport. The simulations cover seven orders of magnitude
in the particle-fluid-density ratio $s$, ranging from water to extremely rarefied air on Pluto.
They suggest that the threshold fluid shear velocity needed to sustain aeolian transport exhibits
a parabolic dependency on the grain size with a pronounced threshold minimum. We show that this behavior
originates from the equations of motion describing quasicontinuous saltation driven by Stokes
drag in a hydrodynamically smooth turbulent boundary layer. In particular, the threshold minimum,
rescaled using units of particle density, gravity, and dynamic fluid viscosity, scales as $s^{1/3}$,
contrary to the $s^{1/2}$-scaling measured in nonequilibrium wind tunnel experiments. Furthermore,
the simulations suggest that the aeolian transport rate and grain impact energy flux, which drives
dust emission into a planetary body's atmosphere, obey scaling laws resembling the classical law
by Ungar and Haff (Sedimentology 34, 289-299, 1987), but with nonconstant scaling coefficients
proportional to $s^{1/3}$ and $s^{1/4}$, respectively. The simulation-derived semiempirical
master curves for the cessation threshold and the threshold-dependent transport rate and impact
flux, supported by their agreement with terrestrial measurements in air and water, provide a simple
means to make predictions of aeolian processes across a large range of planetary conditions.

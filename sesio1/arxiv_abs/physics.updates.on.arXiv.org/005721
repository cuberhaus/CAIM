Well placement optimization is commonly performed using population-based global stochastic
search algorithms. These optimizations are computationally expensive due to the large number
of multiphase flow simulations that must be conducted. In this work, we present an optimization
framework in which these simulations are performed with low-fidelity (LF) models. These LF models
are constructed from the underlying high-fidelity (HF) geomodel using a global transmissibility
upscaling procedure. Tree-based machine-learning methods, specifically random forest and light
gradient boosting machine, are applied to estimate the error in objective function value (in this
case net present value, NPV) associated with the LF models. In the offline (preprocessing) step,
preliminary optimizations are performed using LF models, and a clustering procedure is applied
to select a representative set of 100--150 well configurations to use for training. HF simulation
is then performed for these configurations, and the tree-based models are trained using an appropriate
set of features. In the online (runtime) step, optimization with LF models, with the machine-learning
correction, is conducted. Differential evolution is used for all optimizations. Results are presented
for two example cases involving the placement of vertical wells in 3D bimodal channelized geomodels.
We compare the performance of our procedure to optimization using HF models. In the first case, 25
optimization runs are performed with both approaches. Our method provides an overall speedup factor
of 46 relative to optimization using HF models, with the best-case NPV within 1% of the HF result.
In the second case fewer HF optimization runs are conducted (consistent with actual practice),
and the overall speedup factor with our approach is about 8. In this case, the best-case NPV from our
procedure exceeds the HF result by 3.8%

We experimentally investigate the drag modification by neutrally buoyant finite-size particles
with various aspect ratios in a Taylor-Couette (TC) turbulent flow. The current Reynolds number,
$Re$, ranges from $6.5\times10^3$ to $2.6\times10^4$, and the particle volume fraction, $\Phi$,
is up to $10\%$. Particles with three kinds of aspect ratio, $\lambda$, are used: $\lambda=1/3$
(oblate), $\lambda=1$ (spherical) and $\lambda=3$ (prolate). Unlike the case of bubbly TC flow,
we find that the suspended finite-size particles increase the drag of the TC system regardless of
their aspect ratios. In addition, the normalized friction coefficient, $c_{f,\Phi}/c_{f,\Phi=0}$,
decreases with increasing $Re$, the reason could be that in the current low volume fractions the
turbulent stress becomes dominant at higher $Re$. As $Re$ increases, the particles distribute
more evenly in the entire system, which results from both the greater turbulence intensity and the
more pronounced finite-size effects of the particles at higher $Re$. Moreover, it is found that
the variation of the particle aspect ratios leads to different particle collective effects. The
suspended spherical particles, which tend to cluster near the walls and form a particle layer, significantly
affect the boundary layer and result in maximum drag modification. The minimal drag modification
is found in the oblate case, where the particles preferentially cluster in the bulk region, and thus
the particle layer is absent. Based on the optical measurement results, it can be concluded that,
in the low volume fraction ranges ($\Phi=0.5\%$ and $\Phi = 2\%$ here), the larger drag modification
is connected to the near-wall particle clustering. The present findings suggest that the particle
shape plays a significant role in drag modification.

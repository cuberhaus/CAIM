Population-wide screening to identify and isolate infectious individuals is a powerful tool for
controlling COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. Testing an entire population, however, requires
significant resources. Group testing can enable large-scale screening, but dilution degrades
its sensitivity, reducing its effectiveness as an infection control measure. Analysis of this
tradeoff typically assumes pooled samples are independent. Building on recent empirical results
in the literature, we argue that this assumption significantly underestimates group testing's
true benefits. Indeed, placing samples from a social group into the same pool correlates a pool's
samples. Hence, a positive pool likely contains multiple positive samples, increasing a pooled
test's sensitivity and also tending to reduce the number of pools requiring follow-up testing.
We prove that under a general correlation structure, pooling correlated samples together (called
correlated pooling) achieves higher sensitivity and requires fewer tests per positive identified
compared to independently pooling the samples (called naive pooling) using the same pool size within
the classic two-stage Dorfman procedure. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to theoretically
characterize correlation's effect on sensitivity and test usage under models of general correlation
structure and realistic test errors. Under a 1% starting prevalence, simulation results estimate
that correlated pooling requires 12.9% fewer tests than naive pooling to achieve infection control.
Thus, we argue that correlation is an important consideration for policy-makers designing infection
control interventions: it makes screening more attractive for infection control and it suggests
that sample collection should maximize correlation.

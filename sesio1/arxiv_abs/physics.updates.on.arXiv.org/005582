Current methods of estimating the change in stress caused by injecting fluid into subsurface formations
require choosing the type of constitutive model and the model parameters based on core, log, and
geophysical data during the characterization phase, with little feedback from operational observations
to validate or refine these choices. It is shown that errors in the assumed constitutive response,
even when informed by laboratory tests on core samples, are likely to be common, large, and underestimate
the magnitude of stress change caused by injection. Recent advances in borehole-based strain instruments
and borehole and surface-based tilt and displacement instruments have now enabled monitoring
of the deformation of the storage system throughout its operational lifespan. This data can enable
validation and refinement of the knowledge of the geomechanical properties and state of the system,
but brings with it a challenge to transform the raw data into actionable knowledge. We demonstrate
a method to perform a gradient-based deterministic inversion of geomechanical monitoring data.
This approach allows autonomous integration of the instrument data without the need for time consuming
manual interpretation and selection of updated model parameters. The approach presented is very
flexible as to what type of geomechanical constitutive response can be used. The approach is easily
adaptable to nonlinear physics-based constitutive models to account for common rock behaviors
such as creep and plasticity. The approach also enables training of machine learning-based constitutive
models by allowing back propagation of errors through the finite element calculations. This enables
strongly enforcing known physics, such as conservation of momentum and continuity, while allowing
data-driven models to learn the truly unknown physics such as the constitutive or petrophysical
responses.

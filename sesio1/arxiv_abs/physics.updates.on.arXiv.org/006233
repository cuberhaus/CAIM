Optical resonators enable the generation, manipulation, and storage of electromagnetic waves.
They are widely used in technology and fundamental research, in telecommunications, lasers and
nonlinear optics, ultra-sensitive measurements in cavity optomechanics, and the study of light-matter
interactions in the context of cavity QED. The physics underlying their operation is determined
by the constructive interference of electromagnetic waves at specific frequencies, giving rise
to the resonance spectrum. This mechanism causes the limitations and trade-offs of resonator design,
such as the difficulty of confining waves larger than the resonator and the fixed relationship between
free spectral range, modal linewidth, and the resonator's refractive index and size. Here, we introduce
a new class of optical resonators, generating resonances by designing the optical path through
transverse mode coupling in a cascaded process created by mode-converting mirrors. The generalized
round-trip phase condition leads to resonator characteristics that are markedly different from
Fabry-Perot resonators and can be tailored over a wide range, such as the largest resonant wavelength,
the free spectral range, the linewidth, and the quality factor. We confirm the existence of these
modes experimentally in an integrated waveguide cavity with mode converters coupling two transverse
modes into one supermode. The resonance signature of the cascaded-mode resonator is a spectrum
resulting from the coherent superposition of the coupled transverse modes. We also demonstrate
a transverse mode-independent transmission through the resonator and show that its engineered
spectral properties agree with theoretical predictions. Cascaded-mode resonators introduce
properties not found in traditional resonators and provide a mechanism to overcome the existing
trade-offs in the design of resonators in various application areas.

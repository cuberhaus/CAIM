The results from a series of well characterised, unstable, miscible displacement experiments
in a Hele Shaw cell with a quarter five-spot source-sink geometry are presented, with comparisons
to detailed numerical simulation. We perform repeated experiments at adverse viscosity ratios
from 1 - 20 and Peclet numbers from 10$^4$ - 10$^6$ capturing the transition from 2D to 3D radial fingering
and experimental uncertainty. The open-access dataset provides time-lapse images of the fingering
patterns, transient effluent profiles, and meta-information for use in model validation. We find
the complexity of the fingering pattern increases with viscosity ratio and Peclet number, and the
onset of fingering is delayed compared to linear displacements, likely due to Taylor dispersion
stabilisation. The transition from 2D to 3D fingering occurs at a critical Peclet number that is
consistent with recent experiments in the literature. 2D numerical simulations with hydrodynamic
dispersion and different mesh orientations provide good predictions of breakthrough times and
sweep efficiency obtained at intermediate Peclet numbers across the range of viscosity ratios
tested, generally within the experimental uncertainty. Specific finger wavelengths, tip shapes,
and growth are hard to replicate; model predictions using velocity dependent longitudinal dispersion
or simple molecular diffusion bound the fingering evolution seen in the experiments, but neither
fully capture both fine-scale and macroscopic measures. In both cases simulations predict sharper
fingers than the experiment. A weaker dispersion stabilisation seems necessary to capture the
experimental fingering at high viscosity ratio, which may also require anisotropic components.
3D models with varying dispersion formulations should be explored in future developments to capture
the full range of effects at high viscosity ratio and Peclet number.

Classical (deterministic) and single-enzyme (stochastic) description of the Michaelis-Menten
(MM) kinetics, assume fast equilibration between enzyme and complex, and identify detailed balance
as a sufficient condition for the hyperbolic substrate dependence of the MM equation (MME). Stochastic
MM kinetics based on the chemical master equation (CME), with no a priori assumption of fast equilibration,
however, unravels an observably long non-classical transient regime at mesoscopic enzyme concentrations.
The enzymatic velocity in the transient regime is non-hyperbolic for product turnovers below a
critical time, but asymptotically recovers the hyperbolic MME at long times. Here, we use this description
to introduce a new kinetic measure, the turnover number dependent fractional enzyme velocity.
This measure quantifies the degree of non-hyperbolicity in the non-classical transient regime
with respect to the hyperbolic MME. From this, we obtain a generalized rate parameter condition
for detailed balance in mesoscopic MM kinetics. This condition, while subsuming the fast equilibrium
approximation of the classical MM kinetics, provides a strict lower bound on the magnitude of the
catalytic rate parameter. Further, from the condition of stationarity of the generating function
solution of the CME, we quantify the duration of the non-classical regime. Our results show that
the violation of detailed balance condition in the transient regime is inextricably linked to the
non-hyperbolic substrate dependence of the enzymatic velocity. In the steady-state, when an effective
equilibrium between enzyme and complex is asymptotically established, the condition of detailed
balance emerges as a sufficient condition for the hyperbolic substrate dependence of the MME.

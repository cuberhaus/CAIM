We study the impact of applying stochastic forcing to the Ghil-Sellers energy balance climate model
in the form of a fluctuating solar irradiance. Through numerical simulations, we explore the noise-induced
transitions between the competing warm and snowball climate states. We consider multiplicative
stochastic forcing driven by Gaussian and $\alpha$-stable L\'evy - $\alpha\in(0,2)$ - noise laws,
examine the statistics of transition times, and estimate most probable transition paths. While
the Gaussian noise case has been carefully studied in a plethora of investigations on metastable
systems, much less is known about the L\'evy case, especially in the case of high- and infinite-dimensional
systems. In the weak noise limit, the expected residence time in each metastable state scales in
a fundamentally different way in the Gaussian vs. L\'evy noise case with respect to the intensity
of the noise. In the former case, the classical Kramers-like exponential law is recovered. In the
latter case, power laws are found, with the exponent equal to $-\alpha$, in apparent agreement with
rigorous results obtained for additive noise in a related - yet different - reaction-diffusion
equation as well as in simpler models. This can be better understood by treating the L\'evy noise
as a compound Poisson process. The transition paths are studied in a projection of the state space
and remarkable differences are observed between the two different types of noise. The snowball-to-warm
and the warm-to-snowball most probable transition path cross at the single unstable edge state
on the basin boundary. In the case of L\'evy noise, the most probable transition paths in the two directions
are wholly separated, as transitions apparently take place via the closest basin boundary region
to the outgoing attractor. This property can be better elucidated by considering singular perturbations
to the solar irradiance.

We present a Bayesian tomography framework operating with prior-knowledge-based parametrization
that is accelerated by surrogate models. Standard high-fidelity forward solvers solve wave equations
with natural spatial parametrizations based on fine discretization. Similar parametrizations,
typically involving tens of thousand of variables, are usually employed to parameterize the subsurface
in tomography applications. When the data do not allow to resolve details at such finely parameterized
scales, it is often beneficial to instead rely on a prior-knowledge-based parametrization defined
on a lower dimension domain (or manifold). Due to the increased identifiability in the reduced domain,
the concomitant inversion is better constrained and generally faster. We illustrate the potential
of a prior-knowledge-based approach by considering ground penetrating radar (GPR) travel-time
tomography in a crosshole configuration. An effective parametrization of the input (i.e., the
permittivity distributions) and compression in the output (i.e., the travel-time gathers) spaces
are achieved via data-driven principal component decomposition based on random realizations
of the prior Gaussian-process model with a truncation determined by the performances of the standard
solver on the full and reduced model domains. To accelerate the inversion process, we employ a high-fidelity
polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) surrogate model. We show that a few hundreds design data sets is
sufficient to provide reliable Markov chain Monte Carlo inversion. Appropriate uncertainty quantification
is achieved by reintroducing the truncated higher-order principle components in the original
model space after inversion on the manifold and by adapting a likelihood function that accounts
for the fact that the truncated higher-order components are not completely located in the null-space.

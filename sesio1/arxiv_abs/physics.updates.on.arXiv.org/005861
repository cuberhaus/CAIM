We present our approach to modeling over 20 years of the solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere system
using version 5 of the Grand Unified Magnetosphere-Ionosphere Coupling Simulation (GUMICS-5).
As input we use 16 s magnetic field and 1 min plasma measurements by the Advanced Composition Explorer
(ACE) satellite from 1998 to 2019. The modeled interval is divided into 28 h simulations, which include
4 h overlap. We use a maximum magnetospheric resolution of 0.5 Earth radii (R$_E$) up to about 15 R$_E$
from Earth and decreasing resolution further away. In the ionosphere we use a maximum resolution
of approximately 100 km poleward of +-58 magnetic latitude and decreasing resolution towards the
equator. With respect to the previous version GUMICS-4, we have parallelized the magnetosphere
of GUMICS-5 using the Message Passing Interface and have made several improvements which have e.g.
decreased its numerical diffusion. In total we have performed nearly 8000 simulations which have
produced over 10 000 000 ionospheric files and 2 000 000 magnetospheric files requiring over 100
TB ($10^{14}$ bytes) of disk space. We describe the challenges encountered when working with such
a large number of simulations and large data set in a shared supercomputer environment. Automating
most tasks of preparing, running and archiving simulations as well as post-processing the results
is essential. At this scale the available disk space becomes a larger bottleneck than the available
processing capacity, since ideally the simulations are stored forever but only have to be executed
once. We compare the simulation results to several empirical models, as well as geomagnetic indices
derived from ground magnetic field measurements, and show that GUMICS-5 reproduces many solar
cycle effects in the magnetosphere and ionosphere.

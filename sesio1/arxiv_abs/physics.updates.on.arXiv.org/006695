Inverse mass cascade is a key feature of the intermediate statistically steady state for self-gravitating
collisionless dark matter flow (SG-CFD). This paper focus on effects of mass cascade on halo energy,
momentum, dispersion, size, and density. Halo with fast mass accretion has an expanding core. Mass
cascade forms a new layer of mass that deforms the original halo and induces nonzero radial flow (outwards
in core and inwards in outer regions). The inward/outward flow leads to an extra length scale (scale
radius) that is not present in isothermal profile. Halo concentration c=3.5 can be derived for fast
growing halos. For cusp-core controversy, a double-power-law density is proposed as a result of
nonzero radial flow. The inner/outer density are controlled by halo deformation rate and halo growth,
respectively. The slower deformation at center, the steeper density. For fast growing halos, radial
flow at center is simply Hubble flow that leads to the existence of central core. Mass cascade leads
to nonzero halo surface energy/tension and radial flow that enhances dispersion in outer region.
An effective exponent of gravity $n_e$=-1.3 (not -1) is obtained due to halo surface energy. Halo
size follows a geometric Brownian motion and lognormal distribution. Brownian motion of particles
in evolving halos leads to Fokker-Planck equations for particle distribution that is dependent
on the radial and osmotic flow. Complete solutions of particle distribution are presented based
on a simple model of osmotic flow. The proposed model agrees with N-body simulation for various halo
group sizes. With reference pressure/density defined at center, equation of state can be established
for relative pressure/density. Pressure, density, and dispersion at halo center are presented.
The core size $x_c$ is obtained where Hubble flow is dominant. Simple closures are proposed for self-consistent
halo density.

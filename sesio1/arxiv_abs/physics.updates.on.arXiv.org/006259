The spin Hall effects of light represent a diverse class of polarization-dependent physical phenomena
involving the dynamics of electromagnetic wave packets. In a medium with an inhomogeneous refractive
index, wave packets can be effectively described by massless spinning particles following polarization-dependent
trajectories. Similarly, in curved spacetime the gravitational spin Hall effect of light is represented
by polarization-dependent deviations from null geodesics. In this paper, we analyze the equations
of motion describing the gravitational spin Hall effect of light. We show that these equations are
a special case of the Mathisson-Papapetrou equations for spinning objects in general relativity.
This allows us to use several known results for the Mathisson-Papapetrou equations, and apply them
to the study of electromagnetic wave packets. We derive conservation laws, we discuss the limits
of validity of the spin Hall equations, and we study how the energy centroids of wave packets, effectively
described as massless spinning particles, depend on the external choice of a timelike vector field,
representing a family of observers. In flat spacetime, the relativistic Hall effect and the Wigner(-Souriau)
translations are recovered, while our equations also provide a generalization of these effects
in arbitrary spacetimes. We construct a large class of wave packets that can be described by the spin
Hall equations, but also find its limits by giving examples of wave packets which are more general
and are not described by the spin Hall equations. Lastly, we examine the assumption that electromagnetic
wave packets are massless. While this is approximately true in many contexts, it is not exact. We
show that failing to carefully account for the limitations of the massless approximation results
in the appearance of unphysical centroids which are nowhere near the wave packet itself.

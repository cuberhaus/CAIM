To simulate the interaction of ocean waves with marine structures, coupling approaches between
a potential flow model and a viscous model are investigated. The first model is a fully nonlinear
potential flow (FNPF) model based on the Harmonic Polynomial Cell (HPC) method, which is highly
accurate and best suited for representing long distance wave propagation. The second model is a
CFD code, solving the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations within the \openfoam
toolkit, more suited to represent viscous and turbulent effects at local scale in the body vicinity.
Two one-way coupling strategies are developed and compared in two dimensions, considering fully
submerged and fixed structures. A domain decomposition (DD) strategy is first considered, introducing
a refined mesh in the body vicinity on which the RANS equations are solved. Boundary conditions and
interpolation operators from the FNPF results are developed in order to enforce values at its outer
boundary. The second coupling strategy considers a decomposition of variables (functional decomposition,
FD) on the local grid. As the FNPF simulation provides fields of variables satisfying the irrotational
Euler equations, complementary velocity and pressure components are introduced as the difference
between the total flow variables and the potential ones. Those complementary variables are solutions
of modified RANS equations. Comparisons are presented for nonlinear waves interacting with a horizontal
cylinder of rectangular cross-section. The loads exerted on the body computed from the four simulation
methods (standalone FNPF, standalone CFD, DD and FD coupling schemes) are compared with experimental
data. It is shown that both coupling approaches produce an accurate representation of the loads
and associated hydrodynamic coefficients over a large range of incident wave steepness and Keulegan-Carpenter
number.

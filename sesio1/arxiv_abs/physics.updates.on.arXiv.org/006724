Over recent decades, the value of conducting experiments at lower frequencies and in inhomogeneous
and/or time-variable fields has grown. For example, an interest in the nanoscale heterogeneities
of hydration dynamics demands increasingly sophisticated and automated measurements deploying
Overhauser Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (ODNP) at low field. The development of these methods
poses various challenges that drove us to develop a standardized alternative to the traditional
schema for acquiring and analyzing coherence pathway information employed by the overwhelming
majority of contemporary Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) research. Specifically, on well-tested,
stable NMR systems running well-tested pulse sequences in highly optimized, homogeneous magnetic
fields, traditional hardware and software quickly isolate a meaningful subset of data by averaging
and discarding between 3/4 and 127/128 of the digitized data. In contrast, spurred by recent advances
in the capabilities of open-source libraries, the domain colored coherence transfer (DCCT) schema
implemented here builds on the long-extant concept of Fourier transformation along the pulse phase
cycle domain to enable data visualization that more fully reflects the rich physics underlying
these NMR experiments. In addition to discussing the outline and implementation of the general
DCCT schema and associated plotting methods, this manuscript presents a collection of algorithms
that provide robust phasing, avoidance of baseline distortion, and the ability to realize relatively
weak signals amidst background noise through signal-averaged correlation alignment. The methods
for visualizing the raw data, together with the processing routines whose development they guide
should apply directly to or extend easily to other techniques facing similar challenges.

A large number of biological systems - from bacteria to sheep - can be described as ensembles of self-propelled
agents (active particles) with a complex internal dynamic that controls the agent's behavior:
resting, moving slow, moving fast, feeding, etc. In this study, we assume that such a complex internal
dynamic can be described by a Markov chain, which controls the moving direction, speed, and internal
state of the agent. We refer to this Markov chain as the Navigation Control System (NCS). Furthermore,
we model that agents sense the environment by considering that the transition rates of the NCS depend
on local (scalar) measurement of the environment such as e.g. chemical concentrations, light intensity,
or temperature. Here, we investigate under which conditions the (asymptotic) behavior of the agents
can be reduced to an effective convection-diffusion equation for the density of the agents, providing
effective expressions for the drift and diffusion terms. We apply the developed generic framework
to a series of specific examples to show that in order to obtain a drift term two conditions should
be fulfilled: i) the NCS transition rates should depend on the agent's position, and ii) transition
rates should be asymmetric. In addition, we indicate that the sign of the drift term - i.e. whether
agents develop a positive or negative chemotactic response - can be changed by modifying the asymmetry
of the NCS or by swapping the speed associated to the internal states. The developed theoretical
framework paves the way to model a large variety of biological systems and provides a solid proof
that chemotactic responses can be developed, counterintuitively, by agents that cannot measure
gradients and lack memory as to store past measurements of the environment.

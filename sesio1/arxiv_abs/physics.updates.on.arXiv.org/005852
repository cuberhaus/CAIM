We employ Reactive Dynamical Density Functional Theory (R-DDFT) and Reactive Brownian Dynamics
(R-BD) simulations to investigate the dynamics of a suspension of active soft Gaussian colloids
with binary interaction switching, i.e., a one-component colloidal system in which every particle
stochastically switches at predefined rates between two interaction states with different mobility.
Using R-DDFT we extend a theory previously developed to access the dynamics of inhomogeneous liquids
to study the influence of the switching activity on the self and distinct part of the Van Hove function
in bulk solution, and determine the corresponding mean squared displacement of the switching particles.
Our results demonstrate that, even though the average diffusion coefficient is not affected by
the switching activity, it significantly modifies the non-equilibrium dynamics and diffusion
coefficients of the individual particles, leading to a crossover from short to long times, with
a regime for intermediate times showing anomalous diffusion. In addition, the self-part of the
van Hove function has a Gaussian form at short and long times, but becomes non-Gaussian at intermediates
ones, having a crossover between short and large displacements. The corresponding self-intermediate
scattering function shows the two-step relaxation patters typically observed in soft materials
with heterogeneous dynamics such as glasses and gels. We also introduce a phenomenological Continuous
Time Random Walk (CTRW) theory to understand the heterogeneous diffusion of this system. R-DDFT
results are in excellent agreement with R-BD simulations and the analytical predictions of CTRW
theory, thus confirming that R-DDFT constitutes a powerful method to investigate not only the structure
and phase behavior, but also the dynamical properties of non-equilibrium active switching colloidal
suspensions.

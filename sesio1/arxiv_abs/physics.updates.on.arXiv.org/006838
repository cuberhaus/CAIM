Human mobility networks can reveal insights into resilience phenomena, such as population response
to, impacts on, and recovery from crises. The majority of human mobility network resilience characterizations,
however, focus mainly on macroscopic network properties; little is known about variation in measured
resilience characteristics (i.e., the extent of impact and recovery duration) across macroscopic,
substructure (motif), and microscopic mobility scales. To address this gap, in this study, we examine
the human mobility network in eight parishes in Louisiana (USA) impacted by the 2021 Hurricane Ida.
We constructed human mobility networks using location-based data and examined three sets of measures:
(1) macroscopic measures, such as network density, giant component size, and modularity; (2) substructure
measures, such motif distribution; and (3) microscopic mobility measures, such as the radius of
gyration and average travel distance. To determine the extent of impact and duration of recovery,
for each measure, we established the baseline values and examined the fluctuation of measures during
the perturbation caused by Hurricane Ida. The results reveal the variation of impact extent and
recovery duration obtained from different sets of measures at different scales. Macroscopic measures,
such as giant components, tend to recover more quickly than substructure and microscopic measures.
In fact, microscopic measures tend to recover more slowly than measures in other scales. These findings
suggest that resilience characteristics in human mobility networks are scale-variant, and thus,
a single measure at a particular scale may not be representative of the perturbation impacts and
recovery duration in the network as a whole. These results spotlight the need to use measures at different
scales to properly characterize resilience in human mobility networks.

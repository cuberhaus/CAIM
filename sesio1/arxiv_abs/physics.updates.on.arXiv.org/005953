Over the past thirty years, researchers have highlighted the role played by a class of proteins or
polypeptides that forms pathogenic amyloid aggregates in vivo, including i) the amyloid Abeta
peptide, which is known to form senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease; ii) alpha-synuclein, responsible
for Lewy body formation in Parkinson's disease and iii) IAPP, which is the protein component of type
2 diabetes-associated islet amyloids. These proteins, known as intrinsically disordered proteins
(IDPs), are present as highly dynamic conformational ensembles. IDPs can partially (mis) fold
into (dys) functional conformations and accumulate as amyloid aggregates upon interaction with
other cytosolic partners such as proteins or lipid membranes. In addition, an increasing number
of reports link the toxicity of amyloid proteins to their harmful effects on membrane integrity.
Still, the molecular mechanism underlying the amyloidogenic proteins transfer from the aqueous
environment to the hydrocarbon core of the membrane is poorly understood. This review starts with
a historical overview of the toxicity models of amyloidogenic proteins to contextualize the more
recent lipid-chaperone hypothesis. Then, we report the early molecular-level events in the aggregation
and ion-channel pore formation of Abeta, IAPP, and alpha-synuclein interacting with model membranes,
emphasizing the complexity of these processes due to their different spatial-temporal resolutions.
Next, we underline the need for a combined experimental and computational approach, focusing on
the strengths and weaknesses of the most commonly used techniques. Finally, the last two chapters
highlight the crucial role of lipid-protein complexes as molecular switches among ion-channel-like
formation, detergent-like, and fibril formation mechanisms and their implication in fighting
amyloidogenic diseases.

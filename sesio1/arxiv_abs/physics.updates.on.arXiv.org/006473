Estimating the real dose distribution during proton therapy through experimental measurements
is key to optimizing treatment planning and ensuring treatment quality. Positron emission correlates
with dose distribution, but this correlation is non-linear and difficult to estimate in practical
situations. We propose a deep learning-based method that utilizes raw coincidence data from readouts
of palm-sized PET modules and predicts the positron activity and dose distributions bypassing
traditional reconstruction steps. An extensive simulation dataset was generated using the GATE/Geant4
10.4 toolkit and a human CT phantom with a compact in-beam PET imaging setup for realistic single-fraction
dose delivery. Conditional generative adversarial networks were trained to generate dose maps
conditioned to the coincidence distributions on the detector. The generated dose maps are used
to validate the range against simulated output. We evaluated the model performance through mean
relative error (MRE), absolute dose fraction difference, and shift in Bragg peak position, and
present it as a function of the detector threshold, the number of coincidences required, and other
conditions that optimize the predictive power of the model. The results show that the model can predict
the Bragg peak position and dose for mono-energetic irradiation between 50 MeV and 122 MeV with uncertainties
less than 1% and 2%, respectively, with $\mathrm{10^5}$ coincidences acquired for five minutes
post-irradiation. An important aspect of this simulation study is the use of compact detectors
applicable in a treatment scenario, which operate on very low counts and the demonstration of a method
for direct reconstruction. Through our analysis, we can continue to expand the scope of inverse
modeling to simulate realistic data by learning imaging and experimental physics in radiation
therapy from observations.

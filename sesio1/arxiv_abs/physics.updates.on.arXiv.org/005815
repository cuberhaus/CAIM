To spontaneously break their intrinsic symmetry and self-propel at the micron scale, isotropic
active colloidal particles and droplets exploit the non-linear convective transport of chemical
solutes emitted/consumed at their surface by the surface-driven fluid flows generated by these
solutes. Significant progress was recently made to understand the onset of self-propulsion and
non-linear dynamics. Yet, most models ignore a fundamental experimental feature, namely the spatial
confinement of the colloid, and its effect on propulsion. In this work, the self-propulsion of an
isotropic colloid inside a capillary tube is investigated numerically. A flexible computational
framework is proposed based on a finite-volume approach on adaptative octree-grids and embedded
boundary methods. This method is able to account for complex geometric confinement, the nonlinear
coupling of chemical transport and flow fields, and the precise resolution of the surface boundary
conditions, that drive the system's dynamics. Somewhat counter-intuitively, spatial confinement
promotes the colloid's spontaneous motion by reducing the minimum advection-to-diffusion ratio
or P\'clet number, Pe, required to self-propel; furthermore, self-propulsion velocities are
significantly modified as the colloid-to-capillary size ratio $\kappa$ is increased, reaching
a maximum at fixed Pe for an optimal confinement $0<\kappa<1$. These properties stem from a fundamental
change in the dominant chemical transport mechanism with respect to the unbounded problem : with
diffusion now restricted in most directions by the confining walls, the excess solute is predominantly
convected away downstream from the colloid, enhancing front-back concentration contrasts. These
results are confirmed quantitatively using conservation arguments and lubrication analysis
of the tightly-confined limit, $\kappa\rightarrow 1$.

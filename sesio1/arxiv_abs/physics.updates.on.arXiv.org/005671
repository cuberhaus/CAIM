Infrastructure systems, such as power, transportation, telecommunication, and water systems,
are composed of multiple components which are interconnected and interdependent to produce and
distribute essential goods and services. So, the robustness of infrastructure systems to resist
disturbances is crucial for the durable performance of modern societies. Multilayer networks
have been used to model the multiplicity and interrelation of infrastructure systems and percolation
theory is the most common approach to quantify the robustness of such networks. This survey systematically
reviews literature published between 2010 and 2021, on applying percolation theory to assess the
robustness of infrastructure systems modeled as multilayer networks. We discussed all network
properties applied to build infrastructure models. Among all properties, interdependency strength
and communities were the most common network property whilst very few studies considered realistic
attributes of infrastructure systems such as directed links and feedback conditions. The review
highlights that the properties produced approximately similar model outcomes, in terms of detecting
improvement or deterioration in the robustness of multilayer infrastructure networks, with few
exceptions. Most of the studies focused on highly simpliffied synthetic models rather than models
built by real datasets. Thus, this review suggests analyzing multiple properties in a single model
to assess whether they boost or weaken the impact of each other. In addition, the effect size of different
properties on the robustness of infrastructure systems should be quantiffied. It can support the
design and planning of robust infrastructure systems by arranging and prioritizing the most effective
properties.

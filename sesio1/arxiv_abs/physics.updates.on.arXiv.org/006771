FLASH radiation has been reported to efficiently suppress tumor growth while sparing normal tissue,
however, the mechanism of the differential tissue sparing effect is still not known. Oxygen has
long been known to profoundly impact radiobiological responses, and radiolytic oxygen depletion
has been considered to be a possible cause or contributor to the FLASH phenomenon. This work investigates
the impact of tissue pO2 profiles, oxygen depletion per unit dose (g), and the oxygen concentration
yielding half-maximal radiosensitization (k) in tumor and normal tissue. We developed a model
that considers the dependent relationship between oxygen depletion and change of radiosensitivity
during FLASH irradiation. Cell survival was calculated based on the LQ-L model and the radiosensitivity
related parameters were adjusted while delivering fractional doses of FLASH irradiation The model
reproduced published experimental data and was used to analyze the impact of parameter uncertainties
on the radiobiological responses. This study expands the oxygen depletion analysis of FLASH to
normal human tissue and tumor based on clinically determined aggregate and individual patient
pO2 profiles. The results show that the pO2 profile is the most essential factor that affects biological
response and analyses based on the median pO2 rather than the full pO2 profile can be unreliable and
misleading. Additionally, the presence of a small fraction of cells on the threshold of radiobiologic
hypoxia substantially alters biological response to FLASH irradiation. We found that an increment
in the k value is generally more protective of tumor than normal tissue due to a higher frequency of
lower pO2 values in tumors. Variation in the g value affects the dose at which oxygen depletion impacts
response, but does not alter the dose dependent response trends, if the g value is identical in both
tumor and normal tissue.

Accurate estimates of left ventricle elastances based on non-invasive measurements are required
for clinical decision-making during treatment of valvular diseases. The present study proposes
a parameter discovery approach based on a lumped parameter model of the cardiovascular system in
conjunction with optimization and non-invasive, clinical input measurements to approximate
important cardiac parameters, including left ventricle elastances. A subset of parameters of
a multi-compartment lumped parameter model was estimated using 1st order Adam gradient descent
and hybrid Adam and 2nd order quasi-Newton limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno
optimization routines. Forward-mode automatic differentiation was used to estimate the Jacobian
matrices and compared to the common finite differences approach. Synthetic data of healthy and
diseased hearts were generated as proxies for non-invasive clinical measurements and used to evaluate
the algorithm. Twelve parameters including left ventricle elastances were selected for optimization
based on 99% explained variation in mean left ventricle pressure and volume. The hybrid optimization
strategy yielded the best overall results compared to 1st order optimization with automatic differentiation
and finite difference approaches, with mean absolute percentage errors ranging from 6.67% to 14,14%.
Errors in left ventricle elastance estimates for simulated aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation
were smallest when including synthetic measurements for arterial pressure and valvular flow rate
at approximately 2% and degraded to roughly 5% when including volume trends as well. However, the
latter resulted in better tracking of the left ventricle pressure waveforms and may be considered
when the necessary equipment is available.

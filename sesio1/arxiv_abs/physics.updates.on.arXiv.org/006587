The Search for Hidden Particles (SHiP) Collaboration has proposed a general-purpose experimental
facility operating in beam-dump mode at the CERN SPS accelerator to search for light, feebly interacting
particles. The SHiP experiment incorporates two complementary detectors. The upstream detector
is designed for recoil signatures of light dark matter (LDM) scattering and for neutrino physics,
in particular with tau neutrinos. It consists of a spectrometer magnet housing a layered detector
system with high-density LDM/neutrino target plates, emulsion-film technology and electronic
high-precision tracking. The downstream detector system aims at measuring visible decays of feebly
interacting particles to both fully reconstructed final states and to partially reconstructed
final states with neutrinos, in a nearly background-free environment. The detector consists of
a 50\m long decay volume under vacuum followed by a spectrometer and particle identification system
with a rectangular acceptance of 5\,m in width and 10\,m in height. Using the high-intensity beam
of 400\gev protons, the experiment aims at profiting from the $4\times 10^{19}$ protons per year
that are currently unexploited at the SPS, over a period of 5--10 years. This allows probing dark
photons, dark scalars and pseudo-scalars, and heavy neutral leptons with GeV-scale masses at sensitivities
that largely exceed those of existing and projected experiments. The sensitivity to light dark
matter reaches well below the dark matter relic density limits in the range from a few \mevcc up to
100\,MeV-scale masses, and it will be possible to study tau neutrino interactions with unprecedented
statistics. This paper describes the SHiP experiment baseline setup and the detector systems,
together with performance results from prototypes in test beams, as it was prepared for the 2020
Update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics.

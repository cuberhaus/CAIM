Multi-photon microscopy has played a significant role in biological imaging since it allows to
observe living tissues with improved penetration depth and excellent sectioning effect. Multi-photon
microscopy relies on multi-photon absorption, enabling the use of different imaging modalities
that strongly depends on the properties of the sample structure, the selected fluorophore and the
excitation laser. However, versatile and tunable laser excitation for multi-photon absorption
is still a challenge, limited by e.g. the narrow bandwidth of typical laser gain medium or by the tunability
of wavelength conversion offered by optical parametric oscillators or amplifiers. As an alternative,
supercontinuum generation can provide broadband excitationspanning from the ultra-violet to
far infrared domains and integrating numerous fluorophore absorption peaks, in turn enabling
different imaging modalities or potential multiplexed spectroscopy. Here, we report on the use
of machine learning to optimize the spectro-temporal properties of supercontinuum generation
in order to selectively enhance multi-photon excitation signals compatible with a variety of fluorophores
(or modalities) for multi-photon microscopy. Specifically, we numerically explore how the use
of reconfigurable (femtosecond) pulse patterns can be readily exploited to control the nonlinear
propagation dynamics and associated spectral broadening occurring in a highly-nonlinear fiber.
In this framework, we show that the use of multiple pulses to seed optical fiber propagation can trigger
a variety of nonlinear interactions and complex propagation scenario. This approach, exploiting
the temporal dimension as an extended degree of freedom, is used to maximize typical multi-photon
excitations at selected wavelengths, here obtained in a versatile and reconfigurable manner suitable
for imaging applications.

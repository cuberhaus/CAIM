The development of high gradient accelerating structures is one of the leading activities of the
accelerator community. In the technological research of new construction methods for these devices,
high-power testing is a critical step for the verification of their viability. Recent experiments
showed that accelerating cavities made from hard copper alloys, can achieve better performance
as compared with soft copper ones. The results of experiments showed that welded, hard copper cavities
have shown breakdown rate of $10^{-3}$/pulse/meter at a gradient of about 150 MV/m, in the X-band,
a using a shaped pulse with a 150 ns flat part. We continue the design, construction, and higher power
experimental tests of three cells standing wave (SW) 11.424 GHz accelerating cavities fabricated
with hard CuAg alloy to study the RF breakdown physics. Our aim is to fabricate the accelerating structures
with innovative technologies easier to handle and cheaper; easier for surfaces inspection; easier
for data elaboration and validation of joining techniques. The choice of these new technological
approaches and design methods provides also the possibility of allocating the parasitic Higher
Order Mode dampers. This paper describes the design of an optimized cavity made with sectors which
provides a high longitudinal shunt impedance $R_{sh}$ of the operating mode. The cavity will be
fabricated by using the Tungsten Inert Gas process to realize a hard CuAg structure. Two three-cells
SW X-band accelerating cavities, to be operated in the $\pi$-mode and made out of hard CuAg alloy,
were already fabricated at INFN-LNF by means of clamping and welding by using the TIG approach. Finally,
we also report the RF characterization and low-power RF tests of a two-halves split hard CuAg structure
that will be consequently TIG welded and employed for high-gradient tests and for the study of the
RF breakdown physics.

Two-dimensional wedge-stabilized oblique detonations in stoichiometric and fuel-lean H2/O2/Ar
mixtures with water mists are studied with Eulerian-Lagrangian method. The effects of water droplet
mass flow rate on flow and chemical structures in the induction zone, as well as physical / chemical
roles of water vapor, are investigated. The results show that the oblique detonation wave (ODW)
can stand in a range of water mass flow rates for both stoichiometric and fuel-lean mixtures. With
increased droplet mass flow rate, the deflagration front in the induction zone is distorted and
becomes zigzagged, but the transition mode from oblique shock wave (OSW) to ODW does not change.
Moreover, the initiation and transition locations monotonically increase, and the OSW and ODW
angles decrease, due to droplet evaporation and water vapor dilution in the induction region. For
fuel-lean mixtures, the sensitivity of characteristic locations to the droplet loading variations
is mild, which signifies better intrinsic stability and resilience to the oncoming water droplets.
The chemical explosiveness of the gaseous mixture between the lead shock and reaction front is studied
with the chemical explosive method analysis. The smooth transition is caused by the highly enhanced
reactivity of the gas immediately behind the curved shock, intensified by the compression waves.
Nonetheless, the abrupt transition results from the intersection between the beforehand generated
detonation wave in the induction zone and OSW. Besides, the degree to which the gas chemical reactivity
in the induction zone for fuel-lean mixtures is reduced by evaporating droplets is generally lower
than that for stoichiometric gas. Also, physical and chemical effects of water vapor from liquid
droplets result in significant differences in ODW initiation and morphology.

Aims. This series of papers aims at building a new formalism specifically tailored to study the impact
of turbulence on the global modes of oscillation in solar-like stars. This first paper aims at deriving
a linear wave equation that directly and consistently contains the turbulence as an input to the
model, and therefore naturally contains the information on the coupling between the turbulence
and the modes, through the stochasticity of the equations. Methods. We use a Lagrangian stochastic
model of turbulence based on Probability Density Function methods to describe the evolution of
the properties of individual fluid particles through stochastic differential equations. We then
transcribe these stochastic differential equations from a Lagrangian frame to an Eulerian frame,
more adapted to the analysis of stellar oscillations. We combine this method with Smoothed Particle
Hydrodynamics, where all the mean fields appearing in the Lagrangian stochastic model are estimated
directly from the set of fluid particles themselves, through the use of a weighting kernel function
allowing to filter the particles present in any given vicinity. The resulting stochastic differential
equations on Eulerian variables are then linearised. Results. We obtain a stochastic, linear wave
equation governing the time evolution of the relevant wave variables, while at the same time containing
the effect of turbulence. The wave equation generalises the classical, unperturbed propagation
of acoustic waves in a stratified medium to a form that, by construction, accounts for the impact
of turbulence on the mode in a consistent way. The effect of turbulence consists in a non-homogeneous
forcing term, responsible for the stochastic driving of the mode, and a stochastic perturbation
to the homogeneous part of the wave equation, responsible for both the damping of the mode and the
modal surface effects.

Understanding the formation and long-timescale evolution of atmospheric plasmas produced by
ultrashort, long wavelength IR (LWIR) pulses is an important but partially understood problem.
Of particular interest are plasmas produced in air with a peak laser intensity $\sim$10$^{12}$
W/cm$^2$, the so-called clamping intensity observed in LWIR atmospheric guiding experiments
where tunneling and multi-photon ionization operative at near-IR or shorter wavelengths are inoperative.
We find that avalanche breakdown on the surface of aerosol (dust) particles can act to seed the breakdown
of air observed above the 200 GW/cm$^2$ threshold when a train of 3 ps 10.6 $\mu$m laser pulses separated
by 18 ps are used. The breakdown first appears at the best focus but propagates backwards towards
the focusing optic as the plasma density approaches critical density and makes forward propagation
impossible. The velocity of the backward propagating breakdown can be as high as 10$^9$ cm/s, an
order of magnitude greater than measured with ns pulse-produced breakdown and can be explained
rather well by the so-called breakdown wave mechanism. Transverse plasma expansion with a similar
velocity is assisted by UV photoionization and is observed as a secondary longitudinal breakdown
mechanism in roughly 10 percent of the shots. When a cm size, TW power beam is propagated, interception
of aerosol particles is guaranteed and several (40 cm$^{-3}$) breakdown sites appear, each initially
producing a near critical density plasma. On a 10 ns-1 $\mu$s timescale, shockwaves from each site
expand radially and coalesce to produce a large hot gas channel. The radial velocity of the expansion
agrees well with the prediction of the blast wave theory developed for ultrafast atmospheric detonations.

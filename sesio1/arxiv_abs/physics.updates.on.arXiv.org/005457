Catheter ablation is currently the only curative treatment for scar-related ventricular tachycardias
(VTs). However, not only are ablation procedures long, with relatively high risk, but success rates
are punitively low, with frequent VT recurrence. Personalized in-silico approaches have the opportunity
to address these limitations. However, state-of-the-art reaction diffusion (R-D) simulations
of VT induction and subsequent circuits used for in-silico ablation target identification require
long execution times, along with vast computational resources, which are incompatible with the
clinical workflow. Here, we present the Virtual Induction and Treatment of Arrhythmias (VITA),
a novel, rapid and fully automated computational approach that uses reaction-Eikonal methodology
to induce VT and identify subsequent ablation targets. The rationale for VITA is based on finding
isosurfaces associated with an activation wavefront that splits in the ventricles due to the presence
of an isolated isthmus of conduction within the scar; once identified, each isthmus may be assessed
for their vulnerability to sustain a reentrant circuit, and the corresponding exit site automatically
identified for potential ablation targeting. VITA was tested on a virtual cohort of 7 post-infarcted
porcine hearts and the results compared to R-D simulations. Using only a standard desktop machine,
VITA could detect all scar-related VTs, simulating activation time maps and ECGs (for clinical
comparison) as well as computing ablation targets in 48 minutes. The comparable VTs probed by the
R-D simulations took 68.5 hours on 256 cores of high-performance computing infrastructure. The
set of lesions computed by VITA was shown to render the ventricular model VT-free. VITA could be used
in near real-time as a complementary modality aiding in clinical decision-making in the treatment
of post-infarction VTs.

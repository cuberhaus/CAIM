Turbulent flows of viscoplastic fluids at high Reynolds numbers have been investigated recently
with direct numerical simulations (DNS) but experimental results have been limited. For this reason,
we carry out an experimental study of fully turbulent flows of a yield stress fluid in a rectangular
aspect ratio channel with a high-resolution laser doppler velocimetry (LDA) setup. We employ aqueous
Carbopol solutions, often considered to be a simple yield stress fluid. We formulate different
concentrations to address the effect of the rheology of the fluid on the turbulence statistics at
an approximately constant Reynolds number. Additionally, we also perform experiments with a single
Carbopol formulation at different Reynolds numbers to study its effect. The flow analysis is performed
via rheology measurements, turbulence statistics and power spectral densities of velocity fluctuations.
The addition of Carbopol to the flow increases turbulence anisotropy, with an enhancement of streamwise
velocity fluctuations and a decrease in wall normal velocity fluctuations in comparison to water
at the same mean velocity. This change is reflected on the power spectral densities of streamwise
velocity fluctuations, where we observe a large increase in energy of large scale turbulent structures.
Conversely, the energy of smaller scales is decreased in comparison to water, where the energy drops
with a steeper scale than the Newtonian power law of $k_x^{-5/3}$. As we increase the Reynolds number
with a Carbopol solution, the streamwise Reynolds stresses approach Newtonian values in the core,
which suggests diminishing effects of shear-thinning. The power spectral densities reveal that
the energy content at larger scales decreases slightly with the Reynolds number. However, the shear
thinning effects do not disappear even as the Reynolds number approaches 50000.

Purpose: Universal Pulses (UPs) are excitation pulses that reduce the flip angle inhomogeneity
in high field MRI systems without subject-specific optimization, originally developed for parallel
transmit (PTX) systems at 7T. We investigated the potential benefits of UPs for single channel (SC)
transmit systems at 3T, which are widely used for clinical and research imaging, and for which flip
angle inhomogeneity can still be problematic. Methods: SC-UPs were designed using a spiral nonselective
k-space trajectory for brain imaging at 3T using transmit field maps (B1+) and off-resonance maps
(B0) acquired on two different scanner types: a 'standard' single channel transmit system and a
system with a PTX body coil. The effect of training group size was investigated using data (200 subjects)
from the standard system. The PTX system was used to compare SC-UPs to PTX-UPs (15 subjects). In two
additional subjects, prospective imaging using SC-UP was studied. Results: Average flip angle
error fell from 9.5+/-0.5% for 'default' excitation to 3.0+/-0.6% using SC-UPs trained over 50
subjects. Performance of the UPs was found to steadily improve as training group size increased,
but stabilized after ~15 subjects. On the PTX-enabled system, SC-UPs again outperformed default
excitation in simulations (4.8+/-0.6% error versus 10.6+/-0.8% respectively) though greater
homogenization could be achieved with PTX-UPs (3.9+/-0.6%) and personalized pulses (SC-PP 3.6+/-1.0%,
PTX-PP 2.9+/-0.6%). MP-RAGE imaging using SC-UP resulted in greater separation between grey and
white matter signal intensities than default excitation. Conclusions: SC-UPs can improve excitation
homogeneity in standard 3T systems without further calibration and could be used instead of a default
excitation pulse for nonselective neuroimaging at 3T.

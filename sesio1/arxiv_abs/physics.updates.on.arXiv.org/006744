To accurately study chemical reactions in the condensed phase or within enzymes, both a quantum-mechanical
description and sufficient configurational sampling is required to reach converged estimates.
Here, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations play
an important role, providing QM accuracy for the region of interest at a decreased computational
cost. However, QM/MM simulations are still too expensive to study large systems on longer time scales.
Recently, machine learning (ML) models have been proposed to replace the QM description. The main
limitation of these models lies in the accurate description of long-range interactions present
in condensed-phase systems. To overcome this issue, a recent workflow has been introduced combining
a semi-empirical method (i.e. density functional tight binding (DFTB)) and a high-dimensional
neural network potential (HDNNP) in a $\Delta$-learning scheme. This approach has been shown to
be capable of correctly incorporating long-range interactions within a cutoff of 1.4 nm. One of
the promising alternative approaches to efficiently take long-range effects into account is the
development of graph convolutional neural networks (GCNN) for the prediction of the potential-energy
surface. In this work, we investigate the use of GCNN models -- with and without a $\Delta$-learning
scheme -- for (QM)ML/MM MD simulations. We show that the $\Delta$-learning approach using a GCNN
and DFTB and as baseline achieves competitive performance on our benchmarking set of solutes and
chemical reactions in water. The method is additionally validated by performing prospective (QM)ML/MM
MD simulations of retinoic acid in water and S-adenoslymethioniat interacting with cytosine in
water. The results indicate that the $\Delta$-learning GCNN model is a valuable alternative for
(QM)ML/MM MD simulations of condensed-phase systems.

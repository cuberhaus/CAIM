Quasigeostrophic flows are induced by spatial variations in interior potential vorticity and
boundary buoyancy. We begin by developing the geostrophic turbulence theory of boundary buoyancy
anomalies in a fluid with vanishing potential vorticity. We find that the vertical stratification
controls both the interaction range of boundary buoyancy anomalies and the dispersion of boundary-trapped
Rossby waves. Buoyancy anomalies generate longer range velocity fields and more dispersive Rossby
waves over decreasing stratification [$\mathrm{d}N(z)/\mathrm{d}{z} \leq 0$, where $N(z)$
is the buoyancy frequency] than over increasing stratification [$\mathrm{d}N(z)/\mathrm{d}{z}
\geq 0$]. Consequently, the surface kinetic energy spectrum is steeper over decreasing (mixed-layer
like) stratification than in the classical uniformly stratified model. We also find that the nonlinear
interplay of Rossby waves with the turbulence spontaneously reorganizes the flow into homogenized
zones of surface buoyancy separated by buoyancy discontinuities, with sharp eastward jets centered
at the discontinuities. Jet dynamics then depend on the vertical stratification. Over decreasing
stratification, we obtain straight jets perturbed by dispersive eastward propagating waves.
Over increasing stratification, we obtain meandering jets whose shape evolves in time due to westward
propagating weakly dispersive waves. Finally, we investigate normal modes in the presence of boundary-confined
restoring forces, with the ultimate aim of obtaining an energy-conserving modal truncation of
the quasigeostrophic equations. Such a modal truncation would generalize classical $N$-layer
models to account for non-isentropic boundaries. However, we find that the loss of a crucial symmetry
in the vertical coupling between the modes prevents modal truncations from conserving energy,
and so no such modal truncation is possible.

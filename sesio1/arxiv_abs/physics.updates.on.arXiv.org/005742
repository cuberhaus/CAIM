MIF approaches, such as the MagLIF experiment, use magnetic fields in dense plasma to suppress cross-field
thermal conduction, attempting to reduce heat losses and trap alpha particles to achieve ignition.
However, the magnetic field can introduce other transport effects, some of which are deleterious.
An understanding of these processes is thus crucial for accurate modelling of MIF. We generalise
past work exploiting self-similar solutions to describe transport processes in planar geometry
and compare the model to the radiation-magnetohydrodynamics code Chimera. We solve the 1D extended
MHD equations under pressure balance, making no assumptions about the ratio of magnetic and thermal
pressures in the plasma. The resulting ODE boundary value problem is solved using a shooting method,
combining an implicit ODE solver and a Newton-Raphson root finder. We show that the Nernst effect
dominates over resistive diffusion in high $\beta$ plasma, but its significance is reduced as the
$\beta$ decreases. On the other hand, we find that Ettingshausen and Ohmic heating effects are dominant
in low $\beta$ plasma, and can be observable in even order unity $\beta$ plasma, though in the presence
of a strong temperature gradient heat conduction remains dominant. We then present a test problem
for the Ohmic heating and Ettingshausen effects which will be useful to validate codes modelling
these effects. We also observe that the Ettingshausen effect plays a role in preventing temperature
separation when Ohmic heating is strong. Neglecting this term may lead to overestimates for the
electron temperature at a vacuum-plasma interface, such as at the edge of a z-pinch. The model developed
can be used to provide test problems with arbitrary boundary conditions for magnetohydrodynamics
codes, with the ability to freely switch on terms to compare their individual implementations.

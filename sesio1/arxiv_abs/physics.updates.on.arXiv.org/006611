The ALICE Inner Tracking System has been recently upgraded to a full silicon detector consisting
entirely of MAPS, arranged in seven concentric layers around the LHC beam pipe. Further ahead, during
the LHC Long Shutdown 3, the ALICE collaboration is planning to replace the three innermost layers
of this new ITS with a novel vertex detector. The proposed design features wafer-scale, ultra-thin,
truly cylindrical MAPS. The new sensors will be thinned down to 20-40~{\textmu}m, featuring a material
budget of less than 0.05\%~x/$\mathrm{X_{0}}$ per layer, unprecedented low, and will be arranged
concentrically around the beam pipe, as close as 18~mm from the interaction point. Anticipating
the first prototypes in the new 65~nm CMOS technology node, an active R\&D programme is underway
to test the response to bending of existing 50~{\textmu}m thick ALPIDE sensors. A number of such
chips were successfully bent, even below the targeted innermost radius, without signs of mechanical
damage, while retaining their full electrical functionality in laboratory tests. The curved detectors
were subsequently tested during particle beam campaigns, where their particle detection performance
was assessed. In this contribution, testbeam highlights from the data analysis of bent ALPIDE sensors,
will be presented. It was proved that the current ALPIDE produced in the 180~nm CMOS technology retains
its properties after bending. The results show an inefficiency that is generally below $10^{-4}$,
independent of the inclination and position of the impinging beam with respect to the sensor surface.
This encouraging outcome proves that the use of curved MAPS is an exciting possibility for future
silicon detector designs, as not only the sensor can survive the bending exercise mechanically,
but the enticing attributes that make it attractive for use in the inner tracking layers are comparable
to the flat state.

Inhibition of hydrogen explosion is crucial to realize its wide applications and fine water spray
is an ideal mitigant due to numerous advantages. In this work, interactions between a propagating
hydrogen/air detonation wave and circular water cloud are numerically studied. Eulerian-Lagrangian
method involving two-way gas-droplets coupling is applied, with a two-dimensional configuration.
Different droplet (diameter, concentration) and cloud (diameter) properties are considered.
Our results show that droplet size, concentration and cloud radius have significant effects on
peak pressure trajectory of the detonation wave. After interacting with cloud, the detonation
wave exhibits three propagation modes, including perturbed propagation, leeward re-detonation,
and detonation extinction. Leeward re-detonation is analyzed from unsteady evolutions of gas
and liquid droplet quantities. The refracted detonation wave inside the cloud is decoupled and
propagates more slowly than the one outside the cloud. The detonation re-initiation is from a local
hot spot, caused by shock focusing from upper and lower diffracted detonations. Disintegration
of water droplets proceeds when the detonation wave crosses the cloud and multiphase interfacial
instability is observed due to the difference in effective density of the two fluids. Furthermore,
detonation extinction is observed when we consider various water cloud size. It is featured by quickly
fading peak pressure trajectories when the detonation passes the cloud, and no local autoignition
occurs in the shock focusing area. Evolutions of thermochemical structures from the shocked area
in an extinction process are also studied. Moreover, parametric studies considering various droplet
concentrations and cloud radii are performed.

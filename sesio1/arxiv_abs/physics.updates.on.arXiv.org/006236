The aim of this work is to describe the technical characteristics of an AI-powered radiotherapy
workflow that enables full-process automation (All-in-One), evaluate its performance implemented
for on-couch initial treatment of rectal cancer, and provide insight into the behavior of full-workflow
automation in the specialty of radiotherapy. The All-in-One workflow was developed based on a CT-integrated
linear accelerator. It incorporates routine radiotherapy procedures from simulation, autosegmentation,
autoplanning, image guidance, beam delivery, and in vivo quality assurance (QA) into one scheme,
with critical decision points involved, while the patient is on the treatment couch during the whole
process. For the enrolled ten patients with rectal cancer, minor modifications of the autosegmented
target volumes were required, and the Dice similarity coefficient and 95% Hausdorff distance before
and after modifications were 0.892{\pm}0.061 and 18.2{\pm}13.0 mm, respectively. The autosegmented
normal tissues and automatic plans were clinically acceptable without any modifications or reoptimization.
The pretreatment IGRT corrections were within 2 mm in all directions, and the EPID-based in vivo
QA showed a {\gamma} passing rate better than 97{\%} (3{\%}/3 mm/10{\%} threshold). The duration
of the whole process was 23.2{\pm}3.5 minutes, depending mostly on the time required for manual
modification and plan evaluation. The All-in-One workflow enables full automation of the entire
radiotherapy process by seamlessly integrating multiple routine procedures. The one-stop solution
shortens the time scale it takes to ready the first treatment from days to minutes, significantly
improving the patient experience and the efficiency of the workflow, and shows potential to facilitate
the clinical application of online adaptive replanning.

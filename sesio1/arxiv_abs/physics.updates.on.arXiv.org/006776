Current models of the solar wind must approximate (or ignore) the small-scale dynamics within the
solar atmosphere, however these are likely important in shaping the emerging wave-turbulence
spectrum and ultimately heating/accelerating the coronal plasma. The Bifrost code produces realistic
simulations of the solar atmosphere that facilitate the analysis of spatial and temporal scales
which are currently at, or beyond, the limit of modern solar telescopes. For this study, the Bifrost
simulation is configured to represent the solar atmosphere in a coronal hole region, from which
the fast solar wind emerges. The simulation extends from the upper-convection zone (2.5 Mm below
the photosphere) to the low-corona (14.5 Mm above the photosphere), with a horizontal extent of
24 Mm x 24 Mm. The twisting of the coronal magnetic field by photospheric flows, efficiently injects
energy into the low-corona. Poynting fluxes of up to $2-4$ kWm$^{-2}$ are commonly observed inside
twisted magnetic structures with diameters in the low-corona of 1 - 5 Mm. Torsional Alfv\'en waves
are favourably transmitted along these structures, and will subsequently escape into the solar
wind. However, reflections of these waves from the upper boundary condition make it difficult to
unambiguously quantify the emerging Alfv\'en wave-energy flux. This study represents a first
step in quantifying the conditions at the base of the solar wind using Bifrost simulations. It is
shown that the coronal magnetic field is readily braided and twisted by photospheric flows. Temperature
and density contrasts form between regions with active stirring motions and those without. Stronger
whirlpool-like flows in the convection, concurrent with magnetic concentrations, launch torsional
Alfv\'en waves up through the magnetic funnel network, which are expected to enhance the turbulent
generation of magnetic switchbacks in the solar wind.

Generating large volumes of dense plasmas with femtosecond laser pulses is key to important applications
such as the development of extreme UV sources, of laser material processing and of fundamental research
such as the synthesis of warm dense matter. It is a high energy density state, still challenging to
study, encountered in the core of astrophysical objects such as planetary cores and brown dwarfs.
A new route to generate such warm dense matter is within the bulk of transparent solids because it
cannot expand into vacuum. Furthermore, its relaxation can attractively lead to the formation
of new material phases. However, it was commonly accepted that, except in extreme focusing conditions
with very limited applicability, ultrafast laser-generated plasmas inside solid dielectrics
are only underdense because of the wave-turning phenomenon. Here we show with experiments and first-principles
simulations, that a femtosecond conical interference, i.e., a "diffraction-free" Bessel beam,
overcomes this limitation in sapphire. A subwavelength plasma rod is created over tens of micrometers
to centimeters with only the mJ energy of tabletop femtosecond lasers. The generation of an over-dense
plasma is confirmed by the first time observation of second harmonic generation from a centrosymmetric
dielectric. While conventional models of laser energy deposition in transparent solids have relied
on collisional absorption, we demonstrate here that most of the absorption is due to collisionless
resonance absorption, which is characterized for the first time in the bulk of solid dielectrics.
The high plasma absorption yields an energy density of several MJ/kg. Our findings pave the way for
new strategies to develop tabletop high energy density physics, nonlinear optics with epsilon-near-zero
materials, strong THz field emission, synthesis of new material phases and laser material processing.

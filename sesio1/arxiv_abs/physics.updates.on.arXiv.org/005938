Integrated femtosecond pulse and frequency comb sources are critical components for a wide range
of applications. The leading approaches for on-chip pulse generation rely on mode locking inside
microresonator with either third-order nonlinearity or with semiconductor gain. These approaches,
however, are limited in noise performance, wavelength tunability and repetition rates. Alternatively,
sub-picosecond pulses can be synthesized without mode-locking, by modulating a continuous-wave
(CW) single-frequency laser using a cascade of electro-optic (EO) modulators. This method is particularly
attractive due to its simplicity, robustness, and frequency-agility but has been realized only
on a tabletop using multiple discrete EO modulators and requiring optical amplifiers (to overcome
large insertion losses), microwave amplifiers, and phase shifters. Here we demonstrate a chip-scale
femtosecond pulse source implemented on an integrated lithium niobate (LN) photonic platform18,
using cascaded low-loss electro-optic amplitude and phase modulators and chirped Bragg grating,
forming a time-lens system. The device is driven by a CW distributed feedback (DFB) chip laser and
controlled by a single CW microwave source without the need for any stabilization or locking. We
measure femtosecond pulse trains (520 fs duration) with a 30-GHz repetition rate, flat-top optical
spectra with a 10-dB optical bandwidth of 12.6 nm, individual comb-line powers above 0.1 milliwatt,
and pulse energies of 0.54 picojoule. Our results represent a tunable, robust and low-cost integrated
pulsed light source with CW-to-pulse conversion efficiencies an order of magnitude higher than
achieved with previous integrated sources. Our pulse generator can find applications from ultrafast
optical measurement to networks of distributed quantum computers.

Objective: The bidomain model and the finite element method are an established standard to mathematically
describe cardiac electrophysiology, but are both suboptimal choices for fast and large-scale
simulations due to high computational costs. We investigate to what extent simplified approaches
for propagation models (monodomain, reaction-eikonal and eikonal) and forward calculation (boundary
element and infinite volume conductor) deliver markedly accelerated, yet physiologically accurate
simulation results in atrial electrophysiology. Methods: We compared action potential durations,
local activation times (LATs), and electrocardiograms (ECGs) for sinus rhythm simulations on
healthy and fibrotically infiltrated atrial models. Results: All simplified model solutions
yielded LATs and P waves in accurate accordance with the bidomain results. Only for the eikonal model
with pre-computed action potential templates shifted in time to derive transmembrane voltages,
repolarization behavior notably deviated from the bidomain results. ECGs calculated with the
boundary element method were characterized by correlation coefficients >0.9 compared to the finite
element method. The infinite volume conductor method led to lower correlation coefficients caused
predominantly by systematic overestimations of P wave amplitudes in the precordial leads. Conclusion:
Our results demonstrate that the eikonal model yields accurate LATs and combined with the boundary
element method precise ECGs compared to markedly more expensive full bidomain simulations. However,
for an accurate representation of atrial repolarization dynamics, diffusion terms must be accounted
for in simplified models. Significance: Simulations of atrial LATs and ECGs can be notably accelerated
to clinically feasible time frames at high accuracy by resorting to the eikonal and boundary element
methods.

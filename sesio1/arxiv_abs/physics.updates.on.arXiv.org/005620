Purpose: To evaluate the clinical need for automated decision-support platforms for Adaptive
Radiotherapy Therapy (ART) of Head & Neck cancer (HNC) patients. Methods: We tested RTapp (SegAna),
a new decision-support software for ART, to investigate 22 HNC patients data retrospectively.
For each fraction, RTapp estimated the daily and cumulative doses received by targets and OARs from
daily 3D imaging in real-time. RTapp also included a prediction algorithm that analyzed dosimetric
parameters (DP) trends against dosimetric endpoints (DE) to trigger adaptation up to 4 fractions
ahead. Warning (V95<95%) and adaptation (V95<93%) DEs were set for PTVs. OAR adaptation DEs of +10%
(DE10) were set for all Dmax and Dmean DPs. Any DE violation at end of treatment (EOT) triggered a DP
trends review to determine the DE-crossing fraction Fx and evaluate the prediction model accuracy
(difference between calculated and predicted DP values with 95% confidence intervals). Results:
RTapp was able to address the needs of treatment adaptation. 15/22 studies (68%) violated PTV coverage
or parotids Dmean at EOT. 9 PTVs had V95<95% (mean coverage decrease of -7.7+/-3.3 %) including 4
flagged for adaptation at median Fx=11.5 (range: 6-18). 15 parotids were flagged for exceeding
Dmean constraints with median increase of +3.18 Gy (range: 0.18-6.31 Gy) at EOT, including 8 with
DP>DE10. The differences between predicted and calculated PTV V95 and parotids Dmean was up to 7.6%
(mean: -2.9+/-4.6 %) and 5 Gy (mean: 0.2+/-1.6 Gy), respectively. The most accurate predictions
were obtained closest to Fx. For parotids, Fx ranged between fractions 1 to 23, the lack of specific
trend demonstrated the need to verify treatment adaptation for every fraction. Conclusion: Integrated
in an ART clinical workflow, RTapp can predict whether specific treatment would require adaptation
up to 4 fractions ahead of time.

We present the development of a single-photon detector and the connected read-out electronics.
This `hybrid' detector is based on a vacuum tube, transmission photocathode, microchannel plate
and a pixelated CMOS read-out anode encapsulating the analog and digital-front end electronics.
This assembly will be capable of detecting up to $10^9$ photons per second with simultaneous measurement
of position and time. The pixelated read-out anode used is based on the Timepix4 ASIC ($65~\mathrm{nm}$
CMOS technology) designed in the framework of the Medipix4 collaboration. This ASIC is an array
of $512\times448$ pixels distributed on a $55~\mathrm{\mu m}$ square pitch, with a sensitive area
of $\sim 7~\mathrm{cm}^2$. It features $50$-$70~\mathrm{e^{-}}$ equivalent noise charge, a
maximum rate of $2.5~\mathrm{Ghits/s}$, and allows to time-stamp the leading-edge time and to
measure the Time-over-Threshold (ToT) for each pixel. The pixel-cluster position combined with
its ToT information will allow to reach $5$-$10~\mathrm{\mu m}$ position resolution. This information
can also be used to correct for the leading-edge time-walk achieving a timing resolution of the order
of $10~\mathrm{ps}$. The detector will be highly compact thanks to the encapsulated front-end
electronics allowing local data processing and digitization. An FPGA-based data acquisition
board, placed far from the detector, will receive the detector hits using $16$ electro-optical
links operated at $10.24~\mathrm{Gbps}$. The data acquisition board will decode the information
and store the relevant data in a server for offline analysis. These performance will allow significant
advances in particle physics, life sciences, quantum optics or other emerging fields where the
detection of single photons with excellent timing and position resolutions are simultaneously
required.

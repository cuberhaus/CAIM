Cohesive effects between fine-grained sediment particles greatly influence their effective
settling rate and erodibility. Many studies have observed a qualitative difference in settling
dynamics between clays in freshwater, where particles remain dispersed, and in saltwater, where
aggregates form and settle rapidly. The critical coagulation concentration (CCC) of salt that
separates the two regimes however remains under-investigated, even though knowledge of the CCC
is crucial to understanding aggregation in settings such as estuaries, where large salt concentration
gradients occur. Furthermore, no simple criterion exists to predict the CCC for clay suspensions.
In this study, systematic experiments are performed to determine the CCC, by measuring transmitted
light intensity through clay suspensions. To investigate the effect of ion valence, sodium chloride
(NaCl) and calcium chloride (CaCl$_2$) are used. For kaolin clay, the results show a CCC of 0.6mM
NaCl ($\approx 0.04$ppt NaCl $=$ 0.04 PSU), and of 0.04mM CaCl$_2$ ($\approx 0.004$ppt CaCl$_2$).
Because these salinities are lower than those commonly observed in nature, these findings indicate
that kaolin clay should flocculate in nearly all natural aquatic environments. Furthermore, due
to the fact that tap water often has salinities higher than this threshold, these results imply that
great care is needed in experiments, especially in large facilities where using distilled water
is not feasible. In addition, a simple criterion to estimate the CCC for a kaolin clay suspension
is derived. This criterion predicts that flocculation occurs at extremely low salt concentrations
and is approximately independent of clay concentration, in agreement with the experimental observations
and consistent with experimental evidence from the literature.

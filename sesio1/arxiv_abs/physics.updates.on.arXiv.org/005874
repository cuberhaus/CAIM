Atmospheric drag calculation error greatly reduce the low-earth orbit spacecraft trajectory
prediction fidelity. To solve the issue, the "correction - prediction" strategy is usually employed.
In the method, one parameter is fixed and other parameters are revised by inverting spacecraft orbit
data. However, based on a single spacecraft data, the strategy usually performs poorly as parameters
in drag force calculation are coupled with each other, which result in convoluted errors. A gravity
field recovery and atmospheric density detection satellite, Q-Sat, developed by xxxxx Lab at xxx
University, is launched on August 6th, 2020. The satellite is designed to be spherical for a constant
drag coefficient regardless of its attitude. An orbit prediction method for low-earth orbit spacecraft
with employment of Q-Sat data is proposed in present paper for decoupling atmospheric density and
drag coefficient identification. For the first step, by using a dynamic approach-based inversion,
several empirical atmospheric density models are revised based on Q-Sat orbit data. Depending
on the performs, one of the revised atmospheric density model would be selected for the next step
in which the same inversion is employed for drag coefficient identification for a low-earth orbit
operating spacecraft whose orbit needs to be predicted. Finally, orbit prediction is conducted
by extrapolation with the dynamic parameters in the previous steps. Tests are carried out with the
proposed method by using a GOCE satellite 15-day continuous orbit data. Compared with legacy "correction
- prediction" method in which only GOCE data is employed, the accuracy of the 24-hour orbit prediction
is improved by about 171m the highest for the proposed method. 14-day averaged 24-hour prediction
precision is elevated by approximately 70m.

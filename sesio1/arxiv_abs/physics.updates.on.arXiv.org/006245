Birds have a remarkable ability to perform complex maneuvers at post-stall angles of attack. The
passive deployment of self-actuating covert feathers in response to unsteady flow separation
while performing such maneuvers provides a passive flow control paradigm for these aerodynamic
capabilities. Most studies involving covert-feathers-inspired passive flow control have modeled
the feathers as a rigidly attached or a freely moving flap on a wing. A flap mounted via a torsional
spring enables a configuration more emblematic of the finite stiffness associated with the covert-feather
dynamics. The performance benefits and flow physics associated with this more general case remain
largely unexplored. In this work, we model covert feathers as a passively deployable, torsionally
hinged flap on the suction surface of a stationary airfoil. We numerically investigate this airfoil-flap
system at a low Reynolds number of $Re=1{,}000$ and angle of attack of $20^\circ$ by performing high-fidelity
nonlinear simulations using a projection-based immersed boundary method. A parametric study
performed by varying the stiffness of the spring, mass of the flap and location of the hinge yielded
lift improvements as high as 27% relative to the baseline flap-less case and revealed two dominant
flow behavioral regimes. A detailed analysis revealed that the stiffness-dependent mean flap
deflection and inertia-dependent amplitude and phase of flap oscillations altered the dominant
flow characteristics in both the regimes. Of special interest for performance benefits were the
flap parameters that enhanced the lift-conducive leading-edge vortex while weakening the trailing-edge
vortex and associated detrimental effect of upstream propagation of reverse flow. These parameters
also yielded a favorable temporal synchronization of flap oscillations with the vortex-shedding
process in both regimes.

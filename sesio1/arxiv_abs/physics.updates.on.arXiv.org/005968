The automatic diagnosis of heart diseases from the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is crucial in
clinical decision-making. However, the use of computer-based decision rules in clinical practice
is still deficient, mainly due to their complexity and a lack of medical interpretation. The objetive
of this research is to address these issues by providing valuable diagnostic rules that can be easily
implemented in clinical practice. In this research, efficient diagnostic rules friendly in clinical
practice are provided. In this paper, interesting parameters obtained from the ECG signals analysis
are presented and two simple rules for automatic diagnosis of Bundle Branch Blocks are defined using
new markers derived from the so-called FMMecg delineator. The main advantages of these markers
are the good statistical properties and their clear interpretation in clinically meaningful terms.
High sensitivity and specificity values have been obtained using the proposed rules with data from
more than 35000 patients from well known benchmarking databases. In particular, to identify Complete
Left Bundle Branch Blocks and differentiate this condition from subjects without heart diseases,
sensitivity and specificity values ranging from 93% to 99% and from 96% to 99%, respectively. The
new markers and the automatic diagnosis are easily available at https://fmmmodel.shinyapps.io/fmmEcg/,
an app specifically developed for any given ECG signal. The proposal is different from others in
the literature and it is compelling for three main reasons. On the one hand, the markers have a concise
electrophysiological interpretation. On the other hand, the diagnosis rules have a very high accuracy.
Finally, the markers can be provided by any device that registers the ECG signal and the automatic
diagnosis is made straightforwardly, in contrast to the black-box and deep learning algorithms.

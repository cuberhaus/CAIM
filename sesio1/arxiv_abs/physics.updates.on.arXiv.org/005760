Smart resilience is the beneficial result of the collision course of the fields of data science and
urban resilience to flooding. The objective of this study is to propose and demonstrate a smart flood
resilience framework that leverages heterogeneous community-scale big data and infrastructure
sensor data to enhance predictive risk monitoring and situational awareness. The smart flood resilience
framework focuses on four core capabilities that could be augmented by the use of heterogeneous
community-scale big data and analytics techniques: (1) predictive flood risk mapping; (2) automated
rapid impact assessment; (3) predictive infrastructure failure prediction and monitoring; and
(4) smart situational awareness capabilities. We demonstrate the components of these core capabilities
of the smart flood resilience framework in the context of the 2017 Hurricane Harvey in Harris County,
Texas. First, we demonstrate the use of flood sensors for the prediction of floodwater overflow
in channel networks and inundation of co-located road networks. Second, we discuss the use of social
media and machine learning techniques for assessing the impacts of floods on communities and sensing
emotion signals to examine societal impacts. Third, we illustrate the use of high-resolution traffic
data in network-theoretic models for nowcasting of flood propagation on road networks and the disrupted
access to critical facilities, such as hospitals. Fourth, we leverage location-based and credit
card transaction data in spatial analyses to proactively evaluate the recovery of communities
and the impacts of floods on businesses. These analyses show that the significance of core capabilities
of the smart flood resilience framework in helping emergency managers, city planners, public officials,
responders, and volunteers to better cope with the impacts of catastrophic flooding events.

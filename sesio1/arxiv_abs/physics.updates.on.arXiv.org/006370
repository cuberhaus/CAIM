Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, in-vitro setups, and experimental ex-vivo approaches
have been applied to numerous alveolar geometries over the past years. They aimed to study and examine
airflow patterns, particle transport, and particle-alveolar wall deposition fractions. These
studies are imperative to both pharmaceutical and toxicological studies, especially nowadays
with the escalation of the menacing COVID-19 virus. However, most of these studies ignored the surfactant
layer that covers the alveoli and the effect of the air-surfactant surface tension on flow dynamics
and air-alveolar surface mechanics. The present study employs a realistic human breathing profile
of 4.75 to emphasize the importance of the surfactant layer by numerically comparing airflow phenomena
between a surfactant-enriched and surfactant-deficient model. The acinar model exhibits physiologically
accurate alveolar and duct dimensions extending from lung generations 18 to 23. Proximal lung generations
experience dominant recirculating flow while farther generations in the distal alveolar region
exhibit dominant radial flows. In the surfactant-enriched model, surface tension values alternate
during inhalation and exhalation. In the surfactant-deficient model, only water coats the alveolar
walls. Results showed that surfactant deficiency in the alveoli adversely alters airflow behavior
and generates unsteady chaotic breathing through the production of vorticities, accompanied
by higher vorticity and velocity magnitudes. In addition, high air-water surface tension in the
surfactant-deficient case was found to induce higher shear stress values on the alveolar walls
than that of the surfactant-enriched case. Overall, it was concluded that the presence of the surfactant
improves respiratory mechanics and allows for smooth breathing and normal respiration.

Background: The development of public transit network can enhance the efficiency of the system
as well as raise interest to use the system. Feeder bus service fills the area that is far from the railway
system; therefore, designing a feeder network in a gap area causes the expansion of the main transit
network. Purpose: To present a modified potential demand model for designing a multi-circulation
feeder network. Materials and Methods: In this study, the potential demand is defined based on the
traffic demand of each section related to each link, the average walking distance of passengers
to specified links, the distance from the links to stations, and finally potential demand of accessing
each main station for each link. A labelling method is used to create continuous circular and separated
routes. After generating an initial solution using a constructive heuristic algorithm, a genetic
algorithm was operated to solve the problem. In the second algorithm, each route is considered a
gene, and each network is considered a chromosome. In fact, in this step, different routes from diverse
solutions are combined as a unique feeder network. Tehran District 10 was selected as the case study
and the model was tested on this area which is located near the central business districts. A machine
learning approach has been applied to estimate the missing values of the related database. Results:
By running the algorithm, four feeder routes were obtained with reasonable travel times and distances
of 4.8, 5.5, 5.8, and 8.1 km, starting and ending at the same railway station. Moreover, 98% of the
area was covered by resulted feeder network with a maximum access distance of 300m. Conclusion:
What stands out from this method is that the combination of the modified feeder route design model
and algorithms is feasible.

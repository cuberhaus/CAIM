The configuration of the interplanetary magnetic field and features of the related ambient solar
wind in the ecliptic and meridional plane are different. Therefore, one can expect that the orientation
of the flux-rope axis of a coronal mass ejection (CME) influences the propagation of the CME itself.
However, the determination of the CME orientation, especially from image data, remains a challenging
task to perform. This study aims to provide a reference to different CME orientation determination
methods in the near-Sun environment. Also, it aims to investigate the non-radial flow in the sheath
region of the interplanetary CME (ICME) in order to provide the first proxy to relate the ICME orientation
with its propagation. We investigated 22 isolated CME-ICME events in the period 2008-2015. We determined
the CME orientation in the near-Sun environment using the following: 1) a 3D reconstruction of the
CME with the graduated cylindrical shell (GCS) model applied to coronagraphic images provided
by the STEREO and SOHO missions and; 2) an ellipse fitting applied to single spacecraft data from
SOHO/LASCO C2 and C3 coronagraphs. In the near-Earth environment, we obtained the orientation
of the corresponding ICME using in situ plasma and field data and also investigated the non-radial
flow (NRF) in its sheath region. The ability of GCS and ellipse fitting to determine the CME orientation
is found to be limited to reliably distinguish only between the high or low inclination of the events.
Most of the CME-ICME pairs under investigation were found to be characterized by a low inclination.
For the majority of CME-ICME pairs, we obtain consistent estimations of the tilt from remote and
in situ data. The observed NRFs in the sheath region show a greater y direction to z direction flow
ratio for high-inclination events, indicating that the CME orientation could have an impact on
the CME propagation.

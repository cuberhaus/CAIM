For an immiscible oil drop immersed in a stably stratified ethanol-water mixture, a downwards solutal
Marangoni flow is generated on the surface of the drop, owing to the concentration gradient, and
the resulting propulsion competes against the downwards gravitational acceleration of the heavy
drop. In prior work of Li et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett., vol. 126, issue 12, 2021, 124502), we found that
for drops of low viscosity, an oscillatory instability of the Marangoni flow is triggered once the
Marangoni advection is too strong for diffusion to restore the stratified concentration field
around the drop. Here we experimentally explore the parameter space of the concentration gradient
and drop radius for large oil viscosities and find a different and new mechanism for triggering the
oscillatory instability in which diffusion is no longer the limiting factor. For such drops of higher
viscosities, the instability is triggered when the gravitational effect is too strong so that the
viscous stress cannot maintain a stable Marangoni flow. This leads to a critical drop radius above
which the equilibrium is always unstable. Subsequently, a unifying scaling theory that includes
both the mechanisms for low and for high viscosities of the oil drops is developed. The transition
between the two mechanisms is found to be controlled by two length scales: The drop radius $R$ and
the boundary layer thickness $\delta$ of the Marangoni flow around the drop. The instability is
dominated by diffusion for $\delta<R$ and by viscosity for $R<\delta$. The experimental results
for various drops of different viscosities can well be described with this unifying scaling theory.
Our theoretical description thus provides a unifying view of physicochemical hydrodynamic problems
in which the Marangoni stress is competing with a stable stratification.

Many countries have secured larger quantities of COVID-19 vaccines than their populace is willing
to take. This abundance and variety of vaccines created a historical moment to understand vaccine
hesitancy better. Never before were more types of vaccines available for an illness and the intensity
of vaccine-related public discourse is unprecedented. Yet, the heterogeneity of hesitancy by
vaccine types has been neglected so far, even though factual or believed vaccine characteristics
and patient attributes are known to influence acceptance. We address this problem by analysing
acceptance and assessment of five vaccine types using information collected with a nationally
representative survey at the end of the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Hungary, where a unique
portfolio of vaccines were available to the public in large quantities. Our special case enables
us to quantify revealed preferences across vaccine types since one could evaluate a vaccine unacceptable
and even could reject an assigned vaccine to wait for another type. We find that the source of information
that respondents trust characterizes their attitudes towards vaccine types differently and leads
to divergent vaccine hesitancy. Believers of conspiracy theories were significantly more likely
to evaluate the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) unacceptable while those who follow the advice
of politicians evaluate vector-based (AstraZeneca and Sputnik) or whole-virus vaccines (Sinopharm)
acceptable with higher likelihood. We illustrate that the rejection of non-desired and re-selection
of preferred vaccines fragments the population by the mRNA versus other type of vaccines while it
generally improves the assessment of the received vaccine. These results highlight that greater
variance of available vaccine types and individual free choice are desirable conditions that can
widen the acceptance of vaccines in societies.

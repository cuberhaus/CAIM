We consider the high-resolution seismic imaging method called full-waveform inversion (FWI).
FWI is a data fitting method aimed at inverting for subsurface mechanical parameters. Despite the
large adoption of FWI by the academic and industrial communities, and many successful results,
FWI still suffers from severe limitations. From a mathematical standpoint, FWI is a large scale
PDE-constrained optimization problem. The misfit function that is used, which measures the discrepancy
between observed seismic data and data calculated through the solution of a wave propagation problem,
is non-convex. After discretization, the size of the FWI problem requires the use of local optimization
solvers, which are prone to converge towards local minima. Thus the success of FWI strongly depends
on the choice of the initial model to ensure the convergence towards the global minimum of the misfit
function. This limitation has been the motivation for a large variety of strategies. Among the different
methods that have been investigated, the use of optimal transport (OT) distances-based misfit
functions has been recently promoted. The leading idea is to benefit from the inherent convexity
of OT distances with respect to dilation and translation to render the FWI problem more convex. However,
the application of OT distances in the framework of FWI is not straightforward, as seismic data is
signed, while OT has been developed for the comparison of probability measures. The purpose of this
study is to review two methods that were developed to overcome this difficulty. Both have been successfully
applied to field data in an industrial framework. Both make it possible to better exploit the seismic
data, alleviating the sensitivity to the initial model and to various conventional workflow steps,
and reducing the uncertainty attached to the subsurface mechanical parameters inversion.

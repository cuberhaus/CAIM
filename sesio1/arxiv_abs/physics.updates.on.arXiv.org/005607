Plasmonic metasurfaces based on the extraordinary optical transmission effect (EOT) can be designed
to efficiently transmit specific spectral bands from the visible to the far-infrared regimes,
offering numerous applications in im-portant technological fields such as compact multispectral
imaging, biological and chemical sensing, or color displays. However, due to their subwavelength
nature, EOT metasurfaces are nowadays fabricated with nano- and micro-lithographic techniques,
requiring many processing steps and carried out in expensive cleanroom environments. In this work,
we propose and experimentally demonstrate a novel, single-step process for the rapid fabrication
of high performance mid- and long-wave infrared EOT metasurfaces employing ultrafast direct laser
writing (DLW). Micro-hole arrays composing extraordinary transmission metasurfaces were fabricated
over areas of 4 mm2 in timescales of units of minutes, employing single pulse ablation of 40 nm thick
Au films on dielectric substrates mounted on a high-precision motorized stage. We show how by carefully
characterizing the influence of only three key experimental pa-rameters on the processed micro-morphologies
(namely laser pulse energy, scan velocity and beam shaping slit), we can have on-demand control
of the optical characteristics of the extraordinary transmission effect in terms of transmission
wavelength, quality factor and polarization sensitivity of the resonances. To illustrate this
concept, a set of EOT metasurfaces having different performances and operating in different spectral
regimes has been successfully designed, fabricated and tested. Comparison between transmittance
measurements and numerical simulations have revealed that all the fabricated devices behave as
expected, thus demonstrating the high performance, flexibility and reliability of the proposed
fabrication method.

The return of normalcy to the population's lifestyle is a critical recovery milestone in the aftermath
of disasters, and delayed lifestyle recovery could lead to significant well-being impacts. Lifestyle
recovery captures the collective effects of population activities and the restoration of infrastructure
and business services. This study uses a novel approach to leverage privacy-enhanced location
intelligence data to characterize distinctive lifestyle patterns and to unveil recovery trajectories
after a disaster in the context of 2017 Hurricane Harvey in Harris County, Texas. The analysis integrates
multiple data sources to record the number of visits from home census block groups (CBGs) to different
points of interest during the baseline period and disruptive period. First, primary clustering
using k-means characterized four distinct essential and non-essential lifestyle patterns. Then,
secondary clustering characterized the impact of the hurricane into three recovery trajectories
based on the severity of maximum disruption and duration of recovery. The results reveal multiple
recovery trajectories and durations within each lifestyle cluster, which imply differential
recovery rates among similar lifestyle and demographic groups. The findings offer a twofold theoretical
significance: (1) lifestyle recovery is a critical milestone that needs to be examined, quantified,
and monitored in the aftermath of disasters; (2) the spatial structures of cities formed by human
mobility and distribution of facilities and extends the spatial reach of flood impacts on population
lifestyles. The analysis and findings also provide novel data-driven insights for public official
and emergency managers to examine, measure, and monitor a critical milestone in community recovery
trajectory based on the return of lifestyles to normalcy.

Nonlinear photonics based on integrated circuits has enabled applications such as parametric
amplifiers, soliton frequency combs, supercontinua, and non-reciprocal devices. Ultralow optical
loss and the capability for dispersion engineering are essential, which necessitate the use of
multi-mode waveguides. Despite that rich interaction among different spatial waveguide eigenmodes
can give rise to novel nonlinear phenomena, spatial mode interaction is typically undesired as
it increases optical loss, perturbs local dispersion profile, and impedes soliton formation.
Adiabatic bends, such as Euler bends whose curvature varies linearly with their path length, have
been favoured to suppress spatial mode interaction. Adiabatic bends can essentially connect any
two waveguide segments with adiabatic mode conversion, thus efficiently avoid mode mixing due
to mode mismatch. However, previous works lack quantitative measurement data and analysis to fairly
evaluate the adiabaticity, and are not based on photonic integrated circuits with tight optical
confinement and optical losses of few dB/m. Here, we adapt, optimize, and implement Euler bends
to build compact racetrack microresonators based on ultralow-loss, multi-mode, silicon nitride
photonic integrated circuits. The racetrack microresonators feature a small footprint of only
0.21 mm^2 for 19.8 GHz FSR. We quantitatively investigate the suppression of spatial mode interaction
in the racetrack microresonators with Euler bends. We show that the optical loss rate (15.5 MHz)
is preserved, on par with the mode interaction strength (25 MHz). This results in an unperturbed
microresonator dispersion profile. We further demonstrate single soliton of 19.8 GHz repetition
rate. The optimized Euler bends and racetrack microresonators can be key building blocks for integrated
nonlinear photonic systems, programmable processors and photonic quantum computing.

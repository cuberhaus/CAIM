The level of landscape heterogeneity may affect the performance of remote sensing based land use
/ land cover classification. However, the relationship between mapping accuracy of built-up surfaces
and morphological characteristics of built-up areas has not been analyzed explicitly, and previous
studies typically rely on aggregated landscape metrics to quantify the morphology of built-up
areas, neglecting the fine-grained spatial variation and scale dependency of such metrics. Herein,
we aim to fill this gap by assessing the associations between focal landscape metrics, derived from
binary built-up surfaces, and focal data accuracy estimates. We test our approach for built-up
surfaces from the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) for Massachusetts (USA), by examining the
explanatory power of landscape metrics for predictive modeling of commission and omission errors
in the GHS-BUILT R2018A data product. We find that the Landscape Shape Index (LSI) exhibits the highest
levels of correlation to focal accuracy measures. These relationships are scale-dependent, and
increase with the level of spatial support. Our results are consistent across different regions
within the U.S., and we find that the Recall measure has the strongest relationship to measures of
built-up surface morphology across different temporal epochs and spatial resolutions. Regression
analysis results (R2>0.9) indicate that it is possible to estimate commission errors in the GHSL
in the absence of reference data, and that omission errors in the GHSL can be modeled without accessing
the data themselves. Lastly, we test the generalizability of our predictive accuracy models to
a different version of the GHSL (i.e., the GHS-BUILT-S2) covering a study area in North Carolina.
We find varying levels of model transferability that increases with the spatial support at which
landscape metrics and accuracy estimates are calculated.

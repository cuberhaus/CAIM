In addition to reducing anthropogenic emissions of CO$_2$, it is increasingly clear we also need
to remove CO$_2$ from the atmosphere in order to avoid some of the worst case scenarios for climate
change. Geologic sequestration of CO$_2$ is among the most attractive approaches because of the
large global capacity and long-time scales for storage. One mechanism of geologic storage is through
carbon mineralization. Some mafic and ultramafic rocks contain minerals that will react with CO$_2$
in a carbonation reaction and convert it to carbonated minerals. This is effectively a permanent
CO$_2$ storage mechanism. The geologic question we are faced with is then to locate, delineate and
estimate the volume of potentially reactive rocks. Using a synthetic model that emulates a prospective
site for carbon mineralization in British Columbia, we simulate and invert gravity and magnetic
data to delineate reactive rocks. We begin by inverting each data set independently and introduce
a proxy experiment to contend with the challenging problem of choosing an appropriate physical-property
threshold to estimate volumes from the recovered model. We use this proxy experiment to estimate
thresholds for standard, $\ell_2$ inversion of the gravity and magnetics, as well as for inversions
which use sparse and compact norms. A Petrophysically and Geologically Guided Inversion (PGI)
framework is used to construct quasi-geologic models from which volumes can be estimated directly.
We apply the PGI framework to the magnetics and gravity data independently. The framework is also
used to jointly invert these data and produce a model that is consistent with both data sets. Cumulative
volume estimates with depth are informative and can help decide whether in situ or ex situ sequestration
might be appropriate. Using each of the inverted models, we estimate cumulative volume of reactive
rock as a function of depth.

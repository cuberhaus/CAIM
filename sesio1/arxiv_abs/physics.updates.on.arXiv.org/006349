I present for your appraisal three independent cases of the manuscript referee process conducted
by a venerable peer-reviewed scientific journal. Each case involves a little pig, who submitted
for consideration a theoretical plan for a house to be constructed presently, in a faraway land.
An anonymous big bad wolf was assigned by the journal to assess the merit of these manuscripts. The
pigs proposed three distinct construction frameworks, which varied in physical and mathematical
sophistication. The first little pig submitted a model of straw, based on the numerical method of
toe-counting. His design included odd features, such as spilled millet and cloven-hoofprints
on the window sill -- possibly a ploy to distract the wolf from the manuscript's facile mathematical
foundation. The second little pig used a more advanced approach, employing Newton's classical
laws of motion, to propose a house of sticks. This pig included in her manuscript copious citations
by a specific wolf, possibly aiming to ensure acceptance by flattering the wolf whom she anticipated
would be the referee. The third little pig described an ostentatious house of bricks based on an elaborate
dynamical systems and stability analysis, possibly scheming to dazzle and impress. The big bad
wolf did not appear moved by any of the pigs' tactics. His recommendations were, for straw: the minor
revision of water-proofing; for sticks: the major revision of fire-proofing, given concerns surrounding
climate change; for bricks: unequivocal rejection, accompanied by multiple derogatory comments
regarding "high-and-mighty theorists." I describe each case in detail, and suggest that the wolf's
reports might be driven as much by self interest as the manuscripts themselves -- namely, that at
the time the wolf wrote the reviews, he was rather hungry. Finally, I examine morals learned, if any.

Molecular simulation technologies have afforded researchers a unique look into the nanoscale
interactions driving physical processes. However, a limitation for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
is that they must be performed on finite-sized systems in order to map onto computational resources.
To minimize artifacts arising from finite-sized simulation systems, it is common practice for
MD simulations to be performed with periodic boundary conditions (PBC). However, in order to calculate
specific physical properties, such as mean square displacements to calculate diffusion coefficients,
continuous particle trajectories where the atomic movements are continuous and do not jump between
cell faces are required. In these cases, modifying atomic coordinates through unwrapping schemes
are an essential post-processing tool to remove these jumps. Here, two established trajectory
unwrapping schemes are applied to 1us wrapped trajectories for a small water box. The existing schemes
can result in spurious diffusion coefficients, long bonds within unwrapped molecules, and inconsistent
atomic coordinates when coordinates are rewrapped after unwrapping. We determine that prior unwrapping
schemes do not account for changing periodic box dimensions, and introduce an additional correction
term to the existing displacement unwrapping scheme by von Bulow et al. to correct for these artifacts.
We also demonstrate that the resulting algorithm is a hybrid between the existing heuristic and
displacement unwrapping schemes. After treatment with this new unwrapping scheme, molecular
geometries are correct even after long simulations. In anticipation for longer molecular dynamics
trajectories, we develop implementations for this new scheme in multiple PBC handling tools.

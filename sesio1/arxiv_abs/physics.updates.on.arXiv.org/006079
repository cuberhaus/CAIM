The continuous development of new multiphase alloys with improved mechanical properties requires
quantitative microstructure-resolved observation of the nanoscale deformation mechanisms
at, e.g., multiphase interfaces. This calls for a combinatory approach beyond advanced testing
methods such as microscale strain mapping on bulk material and micrometer sized deformation tests
of single grains. We propose a nanomechanical testing framework that has been carefully designed
to integrate several state-of-the-art testing and characterization methods: (i) well-defined
nano-tensile testing of carefully selected and isolated multiphase specimens, (ii) front&rear-sided
SEM-EBSD microstructural characterization combined with front&rear-sided in-situ SEM-DIC
testing at very high resolution enabled by a recently developed InSn nano-DIC speckle pattern,
(iii) optimized DIC strain mapping aided by application of SEM scanning artefact correction and
DIC deconvolution for improved spatial resolution, (iv) a novel microstructure-to-strain alignment
framework to deliver front&rear-sided, nanoscale, microstructure-resolved strain fields,
and (v) direct comparison of microstructure, strain and SEM-BSE damage maps in the deformed configuration.
Demonstration on a micrometer-sized dual-phase steel specimen, containing an incompatible ferrite-martensite
interface, shows how the nanoscale deformation mechanisms can be unraveled. Discrete lath-boundary-aligned
martensite strain localizations transit over the interface into diffuse ferrite plasticity,
revealed by the nanoscale front&rear-sided microstructure-to-strain alignment and optimization
of DIC correlations. The proposed framework yields front&rear-sided aligned microstructure
and strain fields providing 3D interpretation of the deformation and opening new opportunities
for unprecedented validation of advanced multiphase simulations.

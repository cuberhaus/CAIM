The network analysis of the structure of social relationships in one of the most popular in Russian
novels of the Soviet era by M.A.Bulgakov \emph{The Master and Margarita} was carried out. The structure
of the novel is complex, i.e., there is the novel within the novel. In our study, only relations between
explicitly present and acting characters were taken into account; the mentioned characters as
well as expected connections between characters were not taken into account. Based on the character
interaction matrix, a graph was constructed, the vertices of which are the characters of the novel,
while the edges correspond to connection between them. In our study, only the explicit interaction
of the characters on the stage was considered. The largest connected component of the graph consists
of 153 characters. The assortativity coefficient of the network under consideration is negative,
which indicates artificiality of the network. The structure of communities in the network was analyzed
using the Girvan -- Newman algorithm. In addition to the obvious large communities -- the characters
from the Gospel part of the novel, the characters of the Moscow part of the novel, the characters of
the other world -- the algorithm also revealed a more subtle structure in the Moscow part of the novel:
communities of writers, a hospital, and a theater. Using the analysis of centralities, a group of
main characters has been detected. It turned out unexpectedly that -- although the main character
himself calls the novel within the novel \emph{The novel about Pilate} -- the central character
of the Gospel part of the novel is Aphranius, rather than Pontius Pilate. In the course of the study,
we encountered a number of problems, the main is the difficulty of automating the study of social
connections in novels.

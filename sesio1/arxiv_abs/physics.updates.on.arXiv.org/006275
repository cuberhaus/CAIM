In this paper, we carry out a theoretical investigation on the propagation of spatio-temporal solitons
(light bullets) in the nonlinear metamaterial waveguides. Our theoretical study is based on the
formulation of Lagrangian variational analysis with a suitable ansatz followed by a split-step
Fourier method in confirming the outcomes former numerically. A particular emphasis is given to
obtain the conditions on the system parameters for stable dynamics in negative as well as positive
index regimes of metamaterial waveguides. Similar to the conventional medium, the three-dimensional
(3D) light bullets are highly unstable in metamaterials with the Kerr type nonlinearity alone.
However, in the negative index regime of metamaterials, stable propagation of light bullets may
occur in the normal dispersion regime balancing with defocusing cubic nonlinearity and focusing
quintic nonlinearity. As in the conventional case, the stable dynamics is also observed in the case
of anomalous dispersion with focusing cubic nonlinearity and defocusing quintic nonlinearity
in the positive index regime. To test the solitonic nature of the 3D light bullets in the metamaterials,
we also numerically investigate the collision dynamics of two light bullets. The study shows that
the spatio-temporal soliton propagates without any change except perhaps some phase shift after
a collision with another spatio-temporal soliton in competing cubic and quintic nonlinear metamaterials.
The improper balancing between the linear and nonlinear effects results to form the bullet molecules
in a distorted form with a large amount of energy after interaction and in the long run, oscillations
of the light bullets grow and the bullets become filaments. We have observed the same collision dynamics
in both the negative and positive refractive index regimes of the metamaterial.

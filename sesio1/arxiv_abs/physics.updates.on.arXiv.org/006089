Urban morphological measures applied at a high-resolution of spatial analysis can yield a wealth
of data describing characteristics of the urban environment in a substantial degree of detail;
however, such forms of high-dimensional numeric datasets are not immediately relatable to broader
constructs rooted in conventional conceptions of urbanism. Data science and machine learning
(ML) methods provide an opportunity to explore such forms of complex datasets by applying unsupervised
ML methods to reduce the dimensionality of the data while recovering latent themes and characteristic
patterns which may resonate with urbanist discourse more generally. Dimensionality reduction
and clustering methods, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Variational Autoencoders,
and an Autoencoder based Gaussian Mixture Model, are discussed and demonstrated for purposes of
`untangling' urban datasets, revealing themes bridging quantitative and qualitative descriptions
of urbanism. The methods are applied to a dataset for Greater London consisting of network centralities,
land-use accessibilities, mixed-use measures, and density measures. The measures are computed
at pedestrian walking tolerances at a $20m$ network resolution utilising a local windowing-methodology
with distances computed directly over the network and with aggregations performed dynamically
and with respect to the direction of approach, thus preserving the relationships between the variables
and retaining contextual precision. Whereas the demonstrated methods hold tremendous potential,
their power is difficult to convey or fully exploit using conventional lower-dimensional visualisation
methods, thus underscoring a need for subsequent research into how such methods may be coupled to
interactive visualisation tools to further elucidate the richness of the data and its potential
implications.

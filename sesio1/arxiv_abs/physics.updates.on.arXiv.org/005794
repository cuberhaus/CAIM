We have previously observed an irregular spatial distribution of photon transmission through
a photochromic crystal photoisomerized by a local optical near-field excitation, manifesting
complex branching processes via the interplay of deformation of the material and near-field photon
transfer therein. Furthermore, by combining such naturally constructed complex photon transmission
with a simple photon detection protocol, Schubert polynomials, the foundation of versatile permutation
operations in mathematics, have been generated. In this study, we demonstrate an order recognition
algorithm inspired by Schubert calculus using optical near-field statistics via nanometre-scale
photochromism. More specifically, by utilizing Schubert polynomials generated via optical near-field
patterns, we show that the order of slot machines with initially unknown reward probability is successfully
recognized. We emphasize that, unlike conventional algorithms in the literature, the proposed
principle does not estimate the reward probabilities. Instead, it exploits the inversion relations
contained in the Schubert polynomials. To quantitatively evaluate the impact of the Schubert polynomials
generated from an optical near-field pattern, order recognition performances are compared with
uniformly distributed and spatially strongly skewed probability distributions, where the optical
near-field pattern outperforms the others. We found that the number of singularities contained
in Schubert polynomials and that of the given problem or considered environment exhibits a clear
correspondence, indicating that superior order recognition performances may be attained if the
singularity of the given problem is presupposed. This study paves a new way toward nanophotonic
intelligent devices and systems by the interplay of complex natural processes and mathematical
insights gained by Schubert calculus.

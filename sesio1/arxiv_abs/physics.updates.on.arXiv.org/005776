I take non-locality to be the Michaelson Morley experiment of the 21st Century, assume its universal
validity, and try to derive its consequences. Spacetime, with its locality, cannot be fundamental,
but emergent from entangled coherent quantum variables and their behaviors. Two consequences:
i. If we start with non-locality, we need not explain non-locality. We must explain an emergence
of locality and spacetime. ii. There can be no emergence of spacetime without matter. This contradicts
General Relativity, which is local, formulated without matter, and without an emergence of spacetime.
Quantum gravity cannot be a minor alteration of General Relativity. This will lead to: Matter not
only deforms spacetime, but creates spacetime. This quantum creation of spacetime consists in:
i. Fully non-local entangled coherent quantum variables. ii. The onset of locality via decoherence.
iii. A metric in Hilbert Space among entangled quantum variables. iv. Mapping from metric distances
in Hilbert Space to metric distances in classical spacetime by episodic actualization events.
v. Discrete spacetime is the relations among these discrete actualization events. vi. "Now" is
the shared moment of actualization of one among the entangled variables. vii. The discrete, successive,
episodic, irreversible actualization events constitute a quantum arrow of time. viii. The arrow
of time history of these events is recorded in the very structure of the spacetime constructed. ix.
Actual Time is a succession of two or more actual events. Relation to Causal Set Theory, faithful
Lorentzian manifolds and light cones are discussed. The theory inevitably yields a UV cut off. The
cut off is a phase transition between continuous spacetime before the transition and discontinuous
spacetime beyond the phase transition. This may predict the knee and ankle of the gamma ray spectrum.
Testing via the Casimir effect is proposed.

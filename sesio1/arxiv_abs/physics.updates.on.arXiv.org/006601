There is a growing interest in measuring the cell wall mechanical property at different locations
in single walled cells. We present an inference scheme that maps relative surface elastic modulus
distributions along the cell wall based on tracking the location of material marker points along
the turgid and relaxed cell wall outline. A primary scheme provides a step-function inference of
surface elastic moduli by computing the tensions and elastic stretches between material marker
points. We perform stability analysis for the primary scheme against perturbations on the marker-point
locations, which may occur due to image acquisition and processing from experiments. The perturbation
analysis shows that the primary scheme is more stable to noise when the spacing between the marker
points is coarser, and has been confirmed by the numerical experiments where we apply the primary
scheme to synthetic cell outlines from simulations of hyper-elastic membrane deformation with
random noise on the marker-point locations. To improve the spatial resolution of elastic modulus
distribution of the primary scheme with noise, we propose two optimization schemes that convert
the step-function inferences of elastic moduli into smooth-curve inferences. The first scheme
infers a canonical elastic modulus distribution based on marker-point locations from multiple
cell samples of the same cell type. The second scheme is a simplified cost-effective version that
infers the elastic moduli based on marker-point locations from a single cell. The numerical experiments
show that the first scheme significantly improves the inference precision for the underlying canonical
elastic modulus distributions and can even capture some degree of nonlinearity when the underlying
elastic modulus gradients are nonlinear. The second cost-effective scheme can predict the trend
of the elastic modulus gradients consistently.

We study the voter model dynamics in the presence of confidence and bias. We assume two types of voters.
Unbiased voters whose confidence is indifferent to the state of the voter and biased voters whose
confidence is biased towards a common fixed preferred state. We study the problem analytically
on the complete graph using mean field theory and on an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random network topology
using the pair approximation, where we assume that the network of interactions topology is independent
of the type of voters. We find that for the case of a random initial setup, and for sufficiently large
number of voters $N$, the time to consensus increases proportionally to $\log(N)/\gamma v$, with
$\gamma$ the fraction of biased voters and $v$ the parameter quantifying the bias of the voters ($v=0$
no bias). We verify our analytical results through numerical simulations. We study this model on
a biased-dependent topology of the network of interactions and examine two distinct, global average-degree
preserving strategies (model I and model II) to obtain such biased-dependent random topologies
starting from the biased-independent random topology case as the initial setup. Keeping all other
parameters constant, in model I, $\mu_{BU}$, the average number of links among biased (B) and unbiased
(U) voters is varied at the expense of $\mu_{UU}$ and $\mu_{BB}$, i.e. the average number of links
among only unbiased and biased voters respectively. In model II, $\mu_{BU}$ is kept constant, while
$\mu_{BB}$ is varied at the expense of $\mu_{UU}$. We find that if the agents follow the strategy
described by model II, they can achieve a significant reduction in the time to reach consensus as
well as an increment in the probability to reach consensus to the preferred state.

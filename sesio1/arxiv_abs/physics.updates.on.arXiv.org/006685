Inverse mass cascade is a key feature of statistically steady state for self-gravitating collisionless
dark matter flow (SG-CFD). Continuous mass transfer from small to large mass scales (inverse) is
formulated. Direct effect of mass cascade on halo mass function is presented. Mass cascade is local,
two-way, and asymmetric in mass space. Halos inherit/pass their mass from/to halos of similar size.
Two regimes are identified: a propagation range with scale-independent rate of mass transfer and
a deposition range with cascaded mass consumed to grow halos. Dimensional analysis leads to a power-law
mass function in propagation range with a geometry exponent ${\lambda}$. A fundamental merging
frequency $f_0{\sim}m_p^{\lambda-1}a^{-1}$ is identified, where $a$ is scale factor. Particle
mass $m_p$ can be determined if that frequency is known. Rate of mass transfer ${\epsilon}_m{\sim}a^{-1}$
is independent of halo mass, a key feature of propagation range. Typical halos grow as $m_h{\sim}a^{3/2}$
and halo lifespan scales as ${\sim}m_h^{-\lambda}$. Chain reaction of mass cascade provides non-equilibrium
dark matter flow a mechanism to continuously release energy and maximize entropy. Continuous injection
of mass ("free radicals") at the smallest scale is required to sustain the everlasting inverse mass
cascade such that total halo mass $M_h$ increases as $a^{1/2}$. These "radicals" might be directly
generated at the smallest Planck scale or by a direct cascade from large to small scales. Entire mass
cascade can be formulated by random walk in mass space, where halos migrate with an exponential distribution
of waiting time. This results in a heterogeneous diffusion model, where Press-Schechter mass function
can be fully derived without relying on any specific collapse models. A double-$\lambda$ mass function
is proposed with different $\lambda$ for two ranges and agrees with N-body simulations.

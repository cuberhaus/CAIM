Under compressive stress, rock ``damage'' in the form of tensile microcracks is coupled to internal
slip on microscopic interfaces, such as preexisting cracks and grain boundaries. In order to characterise
the contribution of slip to the overall damage process, we conduct triaxial cyclic loading experiments
on Westerly granite, and monitor volumetric strain and elastic wave velocity and anisotropy. Cyclic
loading tests show large hysteresis in axial stress-strain behaviour that can be explained entirely
by slip. Elastic wave velocity variations are observed only past a yield point, and show hysteresis
with incomplete reversibility upon unloading. Irrecoverable volumetric strain and elastic wave
velocity drop and anisotropy increase with increasing maximum stress, are amplified during hydrostatic
decompression, and decrease logarithmically with time during hydrostatic hold periods after
deformation cycles. The mechanical data and change in elastic properties are used to determine
the proportion of mechanical work required to generate tensile cracks, which increases as the rock
approaches failure but remains small, up to around 10\% of the net dissipated work per cycle. The
pre-rupture deformation behaviour of rocks is qualitatively compatible with the mechanics of
wing cracks. While tensile cracks are the source of large changes in rock physical properties, they
are not systematically associated with significant energy dissipation and their aperture and
growth is primarily controlled by internal friction, which exerts a dominant control on rock rheology
in the brittle regime. Time-dependent friction along preexisting shear interfaces explains how
tensile cracks can close under static conditions and produce recovery of elastic wave velocities
over time.

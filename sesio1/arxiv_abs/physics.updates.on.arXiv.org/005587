We investigate disynaptic effect of the hilar cells on pattern separation in a spiking neural network
of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). The principal granule cells (GCs) in the DG perform pattern
separation, transforming similar input patterns into less-similar output patterns. The hilus
consists of excitatory mossy cells (MCs) and inhibitory HIPP (hilar perforant path-associated)
cells. Here, we consider the disynaptic effects of the MCs and the HIPP cells on the GCs, mediated
by the inhibitory basket cells (BCs); MC $\rightarrow$ BC $\rightarrow$ GC and HIPP $\rightarrow$
BC $\rightarrow$ GC. By changing synaptic strength $K^{\rm (BC, X)}$ ( X = MC or HIPP) from the default
value ${K^{\rm (BC, X)}}^*$, we study the change in the pattern separation degree ${\cal S}_d$.
When decreasing $K^{\rm (BC, MC)}$ or independently increasing $K^{\rm (BC, HIPP)}$ from their
default values, ${\cal S}_d$ is found to decrease (i.e., pattern separation is reduced). On the
other hand, as $K^{\rm (BC, MC)}$ is increased or independently $K^{\rm (BC, HIPP)}$ is decreased
from their default values, pattern separation becomes enhanced (i.e., ${\cal S}_d$ increases).
In this way, the disynaptic effects of the MCs and the HIPP cells on the pattern separation are opposite
ones. Thus, when simultaneously varying both $K^{\rm (BC, MC)}$ and $K^{\rm (BC, HIPP)}$, as a result
of balance between the two competing disynaptic effects of the MCs and the HIPP cells, ${\cal S}_d$
forms a bell-shaped curve with an optimal maximum at their default values. Moreover, the population
and individual behaviors of the sparsely synchronized rhythm of the GCs are found to be strongly
correlated with the pattern separation degree ${\cal S}_d$. Consequently, the larger the synchronization
and the random phase-locking degrees of the sparsely synchronized rhythm is, the more the pattern
separation becomes enhanced.

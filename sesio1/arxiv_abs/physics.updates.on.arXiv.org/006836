Flagellar motility is critical to natural and many forms of assisted reproduction. The rhythmic
beating and wave propagation by the flagellum propels sperm through fluid and enables modulation
between penetrative progressive motion, activated side-to-side yaw and hyperactivated movement
associated with detachment from epithelial binding. These changes occur in response to the properties
of the surrounding fluid environment, biochemical activation state, and physiological ligands,
however a parsimonious mechanistic explanation of flagellar beat generation that can explain
motility modulation is lacking. In this paper we present the Axonemal Regulation of Curvature,
Hysteretic model (ARCH), a curvature control-type model based on switching of active moment by
local curvature, embedded within a geometrically nonlinear elastic model of the flagellum exhibiting
planar flagellar beats, together with nonlocal viscous fluid dynamics. The biophysical system
is parameterised completely by four dimensionless parameter groupings. The effect of parameter
variation is explored through computational simulation, revealing beat patterns that are qualitatively
representative of penetrative (straight progressive), activated (highly yawing) and hyperactivated
(non-progressive) modes. Analysis of the flagellar limit cycles and associated swimming velocity
reveals a cusp catastrophe between progressive and non-progressive modes, and hysteresis in the
response to changes in critical curvature parameter. Quantitative comparison to experimental
data on human sperm exhibiting typical penetrative, activated and hyperactivated beats shows
a good fit to the time-average absolute curvature profile along the flagellum, providing evidence
that the model is capable of providing a framework for quantitative interpretation of imaging data.

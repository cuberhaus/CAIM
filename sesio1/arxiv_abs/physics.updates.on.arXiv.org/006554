A crucial step in the history of General Relativity was Einstein's adoption of the principle of general
covariance which demands a coordinate independent formulation for our spacetime theories. General
covariance helps us to disentangle a theory's substantive content from its merely representational
artifacts. It is an indispensable tool for a modern understanding of spacetime theories. Motivated
by quantum gravity, one may wish to extend these notions to quantum spacetime theories (whatever
those are). Relatedly, one might want to extend these notions to discrete spacetime theories (i.e.,
lattice theories). This paper delivers such an extension with surprising consequences, extending
Part 1 (arXiv:2204.02276) to a Lorentzian setting. This discrete analog of general covariance
reveals that lattice structure is rather less like a fixed background structure and rather more
like a coordinate system, i.e., merely a representational artifact. This discrete analog is built
upon a rich analogy between the lattice structures appearing in our discrete spacetime theories
and the coordinate systems appearing in our continuum spacetime theories. I argue that properly
understood there are no such things as lattice-fundamental theories, rather there are only lattice-representable
theories. It is well-noted by the causal set theory community that no theory on a fixed spacetime
lattice is Lorentz invariant, however as I will discuss this is ultimately a problem of representational
capacity, not of physics. There is no need for the symmetries of our representational tools to latch
onto the symmetries of the thing being represented. Nothing prevents us from using Cartesian coordinates
to describe rotationally invariant states/dynamics. As this paper shows, the same is true of lattices
in a Lorentzian setting: nothing prevents us from defining a perfectly Lorentzian lattice(-representable)
theory.

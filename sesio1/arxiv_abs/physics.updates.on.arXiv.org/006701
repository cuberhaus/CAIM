Meteorite matrices from primitive chondrites are an interplay of ingredients at the sub-micron
scale, which requires analytical techniques with the nanometer spatial resolution to decipher
the composition of individual components in their petrographic context. Infrared spectroscopy
is an effective method that enables to probe of vibrations at the molecule-atomic scale of organic
and inorganic compounds but is often limited to a few micrometers in spatial resolution. To efficiently
distinguish spectral signatures of the different constituents, we apply here nano-IR spectroscopy
(AFM-IR), based on the combination of infrared and atomic force microscopy, having a spatial resolution
beyond the diffraction limits. Our study aims to characterize two chosen meteorite samples to investigate
primitive material in terms of bulk chemistry (the CI chondrite Orgueil) and organic composition
(the CR chondrite EET 92042). We confirm that this technique allows unmixing the IR signatures of
organics and minerals to assess the variability of organic structure within these samples. We report
an investigation of the impact of the widely used chemical HF/HCl (Hydrogen Fluoride/Hydrochloric)
extraction on the nature of refractory organics (Insoluble Organic Matter, IOM) and provide insights
on the mineralogy of meteorites matrices from these two samples by comparing to reference (extra)terrestrial
materials. These findings are discussed with a perspective toward understanding the impact of
post-accretional aqueous alteration and thermal metamorphism on the composition of chondrites.
Last, we highlight that the heterogeneity of organic matter within meteoritic materials extends
down to the nanoscale, and by comparison with IOMs, oxygenated chemical groups are not affected
by acid extractions.

We investigate the effect of shape and orientation for a horizontally oscillating intruder on its
vertical dynamics in a granular medium via Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations. Five distinct
intruder shapes were considered in this study: a disk (OS1), a square (OS2), two rectangles with
aspect ratio > 1 (OS3) and < 1 (OS4) respectively, and an equilateral triangle (OS5). The vertical
velocity of the oscillating object was observed to be a function of amplitude and frequency (f) (inverse
of time period (T)) of oscillation, and the shape of the object. The dynamics of the motion are modelled
with the help of a cavity based model which can empirically produce the regimes observed by incorporating
the free fall of the particles filling the cavity.The cavity based model assumes that there is a point
on the surface of each oscillating object unique to its shape that any grain crossing it will irreversibly
reach the bottom of the cavity. This leads to the creation of bed of particles at the bottom of the cavity
which increases intruder's elevation as it oscillates, leading to its vertical rise in the granular
medium. When an intruder oscillates much faster than the falling rate of the grains, the intruder
cannot rise up and thus sinks due to energy provided by the oscillation to the bottom layer. On the
contrary, if the intruder oscillates too slow, the cavity gets completely filled much before it
returns. The maximum rise rate is thus observed at the oscillation time period where the cavity filling
time is equal to the half time period of oscillation. In addition, we observed a minimum amplitude
(Amin) below which the vertical position of the IO remains unaltered for various T. We have also presented
the time-averaged pressure P, velocity V, and area fraction {\phi} fields around the intruder shapes.

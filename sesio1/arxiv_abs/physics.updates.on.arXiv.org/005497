Traffic congestion in big cities has been proven to be a difficult problem with suboptimal effects
in terms of driver delay and frustration, cost, and impact on the environment. In principle, many
transportation networks lack a unified framework, which will coordinate the traffic in such a manner,
in order to suppress congestion and at the same time improve the travel time of the users situated
in it. The rapid advancements in information, communication, and computation technologies have
given rise to more elaborate modeling frameworks, aiming to act as the coordination unit necessary
to counter the issue of congestion in real-time conditions. Such actions might have an adverse effect
on the efficiency of the network, prospectively leading to greater waiting time intervals for each
individual driver. We propose a macroscopic model equipped with an underlying reservation feature,
known as Route Reservation Architecture (RRA). Vehicles enter the network (mainstream-wise or
from the on-ramps) as long as this inflow does not incur a density that exceeds the network's critical
density. Those vehicles prospectively exceeding the critical density are stored as queues at the
origin of the motorway stretch and within the on-ramps. Once there is sufficient space, for those
vehicles to be accommodated by the respective cell of the network, they are discharged from their
queueing instance at their respective origin, moving towards their assigned path freely. In previous
works, this architecture has been only applied in microscopic simulations in the context of urban
networks without the influence of source terms (on-ramps). When the critical density of the stretch
is reached, the reservations are activated, instigating a waiting interval to the vehicles stored
at queues, allowing vehicles only to enter the network at a later time instant, such that the critical
density is not crossed.

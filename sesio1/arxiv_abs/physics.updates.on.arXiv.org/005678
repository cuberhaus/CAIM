Reverse osmosis (RO) and electrodialysis (ED) are the two most important membrane technologies
for water desalination and treatment. Their desalination and transport mechanisms are very different,
but on closer look also have many similarities. In this tutorial review we describe state-of-the-art
theory for both processes focusing on simple examples that are helpful for the non-specialist and
for classroom teaching. We describe relevant theory for ion and water transport and the coupling
with theory for chemical and mechanical equilibrium on membrane/solution interfaces. For RO of
neutral solutes, we explain the solution-friction (SF) model which is closely related to the classical
sieving or pore flow model. The SF model includes advection, diffusion, and solute partitioning,
and leads to simple relationships for the coupled fluxes of water and solutes (and thus for solute
retention as well), also when a diffusion boundary layer is included in the model. Subsequently
this theory is extended to describe RO for symmetric salt solutions with charged membranes. For
the desalination of salt solutions, both for RO and ED we present two-dimensional module-scale
calculations which lead to a characteristic curve that determines optimum operational conditions
based on a simple cost calculation that offsets energy and material costs. We discuss the two-fluid
model that comprehensively describes ion and water flow both in RO and ED, and we explain how this
theory also accurately describes osmosis experiments where water and ions run in opposite directions
through a membrane. Finally, we present results of optimization studies of the combination of multiple
modules for ED, and we evaluate the relevance of concentration polarization by using a 3D model for
cross-current flow in an ED module.

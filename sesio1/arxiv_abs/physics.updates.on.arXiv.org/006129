The primary target of this paper is to present novel compounds in view of their possible use as oxidizers
in propulsion applications using molecular modeling calculations and supersonic flow simulations.
Carbon-based heterocyclic compounds tend to have strained molecular structures leading to high
heats of formation and energetic behavior. In the present work, molecular modeling calculations
for molecules of 37 such potential propellant oxidizers are presented. Density functional theory
(B3LYP) was employed for the geometry optimization of the proposed molecular structures using
the 6-311++G(d,p) basis set. Heats of formation of the compounds were calculated using the molecular
modeling results. Appropriate propellant compositions were considered with the proposed compounds
as oxidizer components and Ideal specific impulse (Ivac,ideal*) was calculated for each composition
assuming isentropic flow, computed using the NASA CEA software package. To predict the actual delivered
specific impulse (Ivac,act*), supersonic nozzle flow simulations of equilibrium product gases
of each propellant composition have been carried out using OpenFOAM. The standard k-epsilon turbulence
model for compressible flows including rapid distortion theory (RDT) based compression term,
has been employed. As the problem is inherently transient in nature, local time stepping (LTS) methodology
has been further implemented to reach a steady-state solution. These simulations accounted for
divergence losses, turbulence losses and boundary layer losses and gave a more realistic estimation
of the specific impulse. It was observed that the Ivac,act* for all propellant compositions lie
between 88% to 91% of the corresponding ideal value. The newly proposed oxidizers showed considerable
improvement in propulsion performance as compared to ammonium perchlorate.

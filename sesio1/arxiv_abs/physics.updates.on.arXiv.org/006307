Considering the non-hydrostatic mass flow model (Pudasaini, 2022), here, we derive a novel dispersive
wave equation for landslide. The new dispersive wave for landslide recovers the classical dispersive
water waves as a special case. We show that the frequency dispersion relation for landslide is inherently
different than the classical frequency dispersion for water waves. The wave frequency with dispersion
increases non-linearly as a function of the wave number. For dispersive landslide, the wave frequency
without dispersion appears to heavily overestimate the dispersive wave frequency for higher wave
number. Due to the dispersion term emerging from the non-hydrostatic contribution for landslide,
the phase velocity becomes a function of the wave number. This gives rise to the group velocity that
is significantly different from the phase velocity, characterizing the dispersive mass flow.
The dispersive phase velocity and group velocity decrease non-linearly with the wave number. Yet,
the group velocity is substantially lower than the phase velocity. We analytically derive a dispersion
number as the ratio between the phase velocity and the group velocity, which measures the deviation
of the group velocity from the phase velocity, provides a dynamic scaling between them and summarizes
the overall effect of dispersion in the mass flow. The dispersion number for landslide increases
rapidly with the wave number, which is in contrast to the dispersion in water waves. With the definition
of the effective dispersive lateral stress, we prove the existence of an anti-restoring force in
landslide. We reveal the fact that due to the anti-restoring force, landslides are more dispersive
than the piano strings. So, the wave dispersion in landslide is fundamentally different than the
wave dispersion in the piano string. Our model constitutes a foundation for the wave phenomenon
in dispersive mass flows.

Network information mining is the study of the network topology, which answers a large number of
application-based questions towards the structural evolution and the function of a real system.
For example, the questions can be related to how the real system evolves or how individuals interact
with each other in social networks. Although the evolution of the real system may seem to be found
regularly, capturing patterns on the whole process of the evolution is not trivial. Link prediction
is one of the most important technologies in network information mining, which can help us understand
the real system's evolution law. Link prediction aims to uncover missing links or quantify the likelihood
of the emergence of nonexistent links from known network structures. Currently, widely existing
methods of link prediction almost focus on short-path networks that usually have a myriad of close
triangular structures. However, these algorithms on highly sparse or long-path networks have
poor performance. Here, we propose a new index that is associated with the principles of Structural
Equivalence and Shortest Path Length ($SESPL$) to estimate the likelihood of link existence in
long-path networks. Through 548 real networks test, we find that $SESPL$ is more effective and efficient
than other similarity-based predictors in long-path networks. We also exploit the performance
of $SESPL$ predictor and embedding-based approaches via machine learning techniques, and the
performance of $SESPL$ can achieve a gain of 44.09\% over $GraphWave$ and 7.93\% over $Node2vec$.
Finally, according to the matrix of Maximal Information Coefficient ($MIC$) between all the similarity-based
predictors, $SESPL$ is a new independent feature to the space of traditional similarity features.

Electron-beam plasma interaction has long been a topic of great interest. The validities of Quasi-Linear
(QL) theory and Weak Turbulence (WT) theory are limited by the requirement of sufficiently dense
mode spectrum and small wave amplitude. In this paper, by performing a large number of high resolution
two-dimensional (2D) particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations and using analytical theories, we extensively
studied the collective processes of a mono-energetic electron beam emitted from a thermionic cathode
propagating through a cold plasma. We show that initial two-stream instability between the beam
and background cold electrons is saturated by wave trapping rather than QL theory. Further evolution
occurs due to strong wave-wave nonlinear processes. We show that the beam-plasma interaction can
be classified into four different physical regimes in the parameter space for the plasma and beam
parameters. The differences between the different regimes are analyzed in detail. For the first
time, we identified a new regime in strong Langmuir turbulence featured by what we call Electron
Modulational Instability (EMI) that creates a local Langmuir wave packet faster than ion frequency
({\omega}_pi) and ions initially do not respond to EMI in the initial growing stage. On a longer timescale,
the action of the ponderomotive force produces very strong ion density perturbations so that the
beam-plasma wave interaction stops being resonant. Consequently, in this EMI regime beam-plasma
interaction is a periodic burst (intermittent) process. The beams are strongly scattered, and
the Langmuir wave spectrum is significantly broadened, which gives rise to the strong heating of
bulk electrons. Some interesting phenomena in the strong turbulent regime are also discussed

The bright regions in the solar chromosphere and temperature minimum have a good spatial correspondence
with regions of intense photospheric magnetic field. Their observation started more than a hundred
years ago with the invention of the spectroheliograph. While the historical spectroheliograms
are essential for studying the long-term variability of the Sun, the modern satellite-borne observations
can help us reveal the nature of chromospheric brightenings in previously unattainable detail.
Our aim is to improve the understanding of the relation between magnetic fields and radiative structures
by studying modern seeing-free observations of far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation around 1600 \r{A}
and photospheric magnetic fields. We used Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) observations
of photospheric magnetic fields and Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) observations of FUV contrast
around 1600 \r{A}. We developed a robust method to find contrast thresholds defining bright and
dark AIA 1600 \r{A} pixels, and we combine them to bright and dark clusters. We investigate the relation
of magnetic fields and AIA 1600 \r{A} radiation in bright and dark clusters. We find that the percentage
of bright pixels entirely explains the observed variability of 1600 \r{A} emission. We developed
a multilinear regression model based on the percentages of bright and dark pixels, which can reliably
predict the magnitude of the disk-averaged unsigned magnetic field. We find that bright and dark
clusters closely correspond respectively to the populations of moderate (B > 55 G) and strong (B
> 1365 G) magnetic field HMI clusters. The largest bright clusters have a constant mean unsigned
magnetic field, as found previously for Ca II K plages. However, the magnetic field strength of bright
clusters is 254.7$\pm$0.1 G, which is roughly 100 G larger than found earlier for Ca II K plages.

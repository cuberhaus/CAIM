Plasma wakefield acceleration shows a great potential for applications in future light sources
and linear electron-positron colliders, in which trailing beams are required to be optimally loaded
to maintain a low energy spread while extracting energy efficiently from the wake during the acceleration.
Due to the highly nonlinear nature of this effect, it is at present not possible to analytically determine
the beam parameters needed in a two-bunch plasma wakefield accelerator with the optimal beam-loading.
Therefore in this paper, by using the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm for the parameter
scanning with the code QuickPIC and the polynomial regression together with k-fold cross-validation
method, we obtain two fitting formulas for calculating the tri-Gaussian electron beams' parameters
when minimizing the energy spread based on the beam loading effect in a nonlinear plasma wakefield
accelerator. One formula allows the optimization of the normalized charge per unit length of a trailing
beam to achieve the minimal energy spread, i.e. the optimal beam-loading. The other one directly
gives the transformer ratio when the trailing beam achieves the optimal beam-loading. A simple
scaling law for beams' charges is obtained from the fitting formula, which indicates that for a certain
plasma and the beams' length and separation, optimal beam loading is always obtained for a given
charge ratio of the two beams. When the plasma density changes, the fitting formula for optimal beam-loading
shows that when the drive beam has a fixed charge and beams' length and separation are fixed, there
are two optimal plasma densities for the maximum trailing beam's charge and the maximum acceleration
efficiency respectively. These two fitting formulas will significantly enhance the efficiency
for designing and optimizing a two-bunch plasma wakefield acceleration stage.

Investigating the potential benefits of the use of magnetic fields in Inertial Confinement Fusion
(ICF) experiments has given rise to new experimental platforms like the Magnetized Liner Inertial
Fusion (MagLIF) approach at the Z-machine (Sandia National Laboratories), or its laser-driven
equivalent at OMEGA (Laboratory for Laser Energetics). Implementing these platforms at MJ-scale
laser facilities, such as the Laser MegaJoule (LMJ) or the National Ignition Facility (NIF), is
crucial to reaching self-sustained nuclear fusion and enlarges the level of magnetization that
can be achieved through a higher compression. In this paper, we present a complete design of an experimental
platform for magnetized implosions using cylindrical targets at LMJ. A seed magnetic field is generated
along the axis of the cylinder using laser-driven coil targets, minimizing debris and increasing
diagnostic access compared with pulsed power field generators. We present a comprehensive simulation
study of the initial B-field generated with these coil targets, as well as 2-dimensional extended
magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) simulations showing that a 5T initial B-field is compressed up to
25kT during the implosion. Under these circumstances, the electrons become magnetized, which
severely modifies the plasma conditions at stagnation. In particular, in the hot spot the electron
temperature is increased (from 1keV to 5keV) while the density is reduced (from 40gcc to 7gcc). We
discuss how these changes can be diagnosed using X-ray imaging and spectroscopy, and particle diagnostics.
We propose the simultaneous use of two dopants in the fuel (Ar and Kr) to act as spectroscopic tracers.
We show that this introduces an effective spatial resolution in the plasma which permits an unambiguous
observation of the B-field effects. Additionally, we present a plan for future experiments of this
kind at LMJ.

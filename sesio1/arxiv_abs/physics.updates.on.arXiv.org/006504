We present a comprehensive analysis of the three-dimensional magnetic flux rope structure generated
during the Lynch et al. (2019) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of a global-scale, 360 degree-wide
streamer blowout coronal mass ejection (CME) eruption. We create both fixed and moving synthetic
spacecraft to generate time series of the MHD variables through different regions of the flux rope
CME. Our moving spacecraft trajectories are derived from the spatial coordinates of Parker Solar
Probe's past encounters 7 and 9 and future encounter 23. Each synthetic time series through the simulation
flux rope ejecta is fit with three different in-situ flux rope models commonly used to characterize
the large-scale, coherent magnetic field rotations observed in a significant fraction of interplanetary
CMEs (ICMEs). We present each of the in-situ flux rope model fits to the simulation data and discuss
the similarities and differences between the model fits and the MHD simulation's flux rope spatial
orientations, field strengths and rotations, expansion profiles, and magnetic flux content.
We compare in-situ model properties to those calculated with the MHD data for both classic bipolar
and unipolar ICME flux rope configurations as well as more problematic profiles such as those with
a significant radial component to the flux rope axis orientation or profiles obtained with large
impact parameters. We find general agreement among the in-situ flux rope fitting results for the
classic profiles and much more variation among results for the problematic profiles. We also examine
the force-free assumption for a subset of the flux rope models and quantify properties of the Lorentz
force within MHD ejecta intervals. We conclude that the in-situ flux rope models are generally a
decent approximation to the field structure, but all the caveats associated with in-situ flux rope
models will still apply...

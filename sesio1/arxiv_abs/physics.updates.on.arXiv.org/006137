N-body simulation is an invaluable tool to understand cosmic velocity field. However, simulation
samples velocity only at particle locations that leads to information loss when projecting velocity
fields onto structured grid. Here we extract two-point statistics without field projection. These
statistics, i.e. correlation/structure/dispersion functions in real space and spectrum functions
in Fourier space, are modeled on both small and large scales. Kinematic relations between statistical
measures are fully developed for incompressible, constant divergence, and irrotational flow.
The nature of flow can be identified by these relations. Much more complex than incompressible flow,
peculiar velocity of dark matter flow is of constant divergence on small scale and irrotational
on large scale. Incompressible and constant divergence flow share same kinematic relations for
even order correlations. The limiting correlation of velocity $\rho_L=1/2$ on the smallest scale
($r=0$) is a unique feature of collisionless flow ($\rho_L=1$ for incompressible flow). Assuming
gravity is the only interaction and no radiation produced, this feature leads to an increase in particle
mass converted from kinetic energy upon "annihilation". On large scale, transverse velocity correlation
has an exponential form with a comoving scale $r_2$=21.3Mpc/h that maybe related to the size of sound
horizon. All other correlation/structure/dispersion/spectrum functions for velocity/density/potential
are derived analytically from kinematic relations for irrotational flow. On small scale, longitudinal
structure function follows one-fourth law of $S^l_2\propto r^{1/4}$. All other statistical measures
are obtained from kinematic relations for constant divergence flow. Vorticity is negatively correlated
for $r$ between 1 and 7Mpc/h. Divergence is negatively correlated for $r$>30Mpc/h that leads to
negative density correlation.

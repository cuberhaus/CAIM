The Frozen Density Embedding scheme represents an embedding method in which environmental effects
onto a given subsystem are included by representing the other subsystems making up the surroundings
quantum mechanically, by means of their electron densities. In the present paper, we extend the
full 4-component relativistic Dirac-Kohn-Sham method, as implemented in the BERTHA code, to include
environmental and confinement effects with the FDE scheme. This implementation has been enormously
facilitated by BERTHA's python API (PyBERTHA), which provides a flexible framework of development
by using all Python advantages in terms of code re-usability, portability while facilitating the
interoperability with other FDE implementations available through the PyADF framework. The computational
performance has been evaluated on a series of gold clusters (Au$_n$, with n=2,4,8) embedded into
an increasing number of water molecules (5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 water molecules). We found that the procedure
scales approximately linearly both with the size of the frozen surrounding environment (in line
with the underpinnings of the FDE approach) and with the size of the active system (in line with the
use of density fitting). Finally, we applied the code to a series of Heavy (Rn) and Super-Heavy elements
(Cn, Fl, Og) embedded in a C_60 cage to explore the confinement effect induced by C_60 on their electronic
structure. We compare the results from our simulations with more approximate models employed in
the atomic physics literature, in which confinement is represented by a radial potential slightly
affected by the nature of the central atom. Our results indicate that the specific interactions
described by FDE are able to improve upon the cruder approximations currently employed, and thus
provide a basis from which to generate more realistic radial potentials for confined atoms.

High spatial resolution PM2.5 data products covering a long time period are urgently needed to support
population exposure assessment and refined air quality management. In this study, we provided
complete-coverage PM2.5 predictions with a 1-km spatial resolution from 2000 to the present under
the Tracking Air Pollution in China (TAP) framework. To support model fitting at a high spatial resolution,
we collected PM2.5 measurements from both national and local monitoring stations that better described
the PM2.5 distributions at the local scale. To correctly reflect the temporal variations in land
cover characteristics that significantly affected the local variations in PM2.5 levels, we constructed
continuous annual geoinformation datasets, including the annual road distribution maps and ensemble
gridded population distribution maps in China from 2000 to 2021. We also examined various model
structures and predictor combinations to balance the computational cost and model performance.
The final model fused 0.1-degree TAP PM2.5 predictions, multi-angle implementation of atmospheric
correction (MAIAC) aerosol optical depth retrievals and land use parameters with a random forest
model. The land use parameters correctly reflected the infrastructure development and population
migration in China. Our annual model had an out-of-bag R2 ranging between 0.80 and 0.84, and our hindcast
model had a by-year cross-validation R2 of 0.76. The high-resolution daily and annual pollution
maps successfully revealed the local-scale spatial variations in PM2.5 distributions that could
not be characterized by the previous 0.1-degree resolution PM2.5 data. This open-access 1-km resolution
PM2.5 data product with complete coverage could benefit environmental studies and policy-making.

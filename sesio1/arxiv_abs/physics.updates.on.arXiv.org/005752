Prediction of the blood flow characteristics is of utmost importance for understanding the behavior
of the blood arterial network, especially in the presence of vascular diseases such as stenosis.
Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has provided a powerful and efficient tool to determine these
characteristics including the pressure and velocity fields within the network. Despite numerous
studies in the field, the extremely high computational cost of CFD has led the researchers to develop
new platforms including Machine Learning approaches that instead provide faster analyses at a
much lower cost. In this study, we put forth a Deep Neural Network framework to predict flow behavior
in a coronary arterial network with different properties in the presence of any abnormality like
stenosis. To this end, an artificial neural network (ANN) model is trained using synthetic data
so that it can predict the pressure and velocity within the arterial network. The data required to
train the neural network were obtained from the CFD analysis of several geometries of arteries with
specific features in ABAQUS software. Blood pressure drop caused by stenosis, which is one of the
most important factors in the diagnosis of heart diseases, can be predicted using our proposed model
knowing the geometrical and flow boundary conditions of any section of the coronary arteries. The
efficiency of the model was verified using three real geometries of LAD's vessels. The proposed
approach precisely predicts the hemodynamic behavior of the blood flow. The average accuracy of
the pressure prediction was 98.7% and the average velocity magnitude accuracy was 93.2%. According
to the results of testing the model on three patient-specific geometries, model can be considered
as an alternative to finite element methods as well as other hard-to-implement and time-consuming
numerical simulations.

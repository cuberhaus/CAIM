Purpose: To introduce a widely applicable workflow for pulmonary lobe segmentation of MR images
using a recurrent neural network (RNN) trained with chest computed tomography (CT) datasets. The
feasibility is demonstrated for 2D coronal ultra-fast balanced steady-state free precession
(ufSSFP) MRI. Methods: Lung lobes of 250 publicly accessible CT datasets of adults were segmented
with an open-source CT-specific algorithm. To match 2D ufSSFP MRI data of pediatric patients, both
CT data and segmentations were translated into pseudo-MR images, masked to suppress anatomy outside
the lung. Network-1 was trained with pseudo-MR images and lobe segmentations, and applied to 1000
masked ufSSFP images to predict lobe segmentations. These outputs were directly used as targets
to train Network-2 and Network-3 with non-masked ufSSFP data as inputs, and an additional whole-lung
mask as input for Network-2. Network predictions were compared to reference manual lobe segmentations
of ufSSFP data in twenty pediatric cystic fibrosis patients. Manual lobe segmentations were performed
by splitting available whole-lung segmentations into lobes. Results: Network-1 was able to segment
the lobes of ufSSFP images, and Network-2 and Network-3 further increased segmentation accuracy
and robustness. The average all-lobe Dice similarity coefficients were 95.0$\pm$2.3 (mean$\pm$pooled
SD [%]), 96.4$\pm$1.2, 93.0$\pm$1.8, and the average median Hausdorff distances were 6.1$\pm$0.9
(mean$\pm$SD [mm]), 5.3$\pm$1.1, 7.1$\pm$1.3, for Network-1, Network-2, and Network-3, respectively.
Conclusions: RNN lung lobe segmentation of 2D ufSSFP imaging is feasible, in good agreement with
manual segmentations. The proposed workflow might provide rapid access to automated lobe segmentations
for various lung MRI examinations and quantitative analyses.

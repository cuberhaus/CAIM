We describe a new method for pulsed spin order transfer (SOT) of parahydrogen induced polarization
(PHIP) that enables close to 100 % polarization in incompletely 2H-labeled molecules by exciting
only the desired protons in a frequency-selective manner. While a selective pulse (SP) on 1H at the
beginning of pulsed SOT had been considered before, using SPs during the SOT suppresses undesired
indirect spin-spin interactions. As a result, we achieved a more robust SOT for the SP variants of
the phINEPT+ sequence that we refer to as phSPINEPT+. Thereby, for the first time, we report a sequence
that is effective for all weakly coupled spin systems. Our simulations show that the method converts
close to 100 % of the parahydrogen-derived spin order into 13C hyperpolarization in weakly coupled
three-spin systems and partially or fully 2H-labeled molecules if relaxation is neglected. Experimentally
we demonstrate high hyperpolarization of 13C with 15.8 % for 1-13C-hydroxyethyl propionate-d3
and 12.6 % for 1-13C-ethyl acetate-d6, which corresponds to ~47 % and ~38 % if the enrichment of parahydrogen
had been 100 %. Even in non-2H-labeled molecules, a remarkable 13C polarization is achieved, e.g.
up to 20 % were simulated for 100 % pH2, and 1.25 % were obtained experimentally for 1-13C-ethyl pyruvate
and 50 % pH2, which can be further improved by faster hydrogenation. As a result, full deuterium labeling
may no longer be required e.g., when new PHIP agents are investigated, the synthesis of fully deuterated
molecules is too complex, or when a kinetic isotope effect regarding the metabolic conversion rate
of an agent is to be avoided. Using SPs during SOT seems very promising and may be extended to other
sequences in the context of PHIP and be-yond to make them less prone to experimental imperfections
or real molecular environments.

Musculoskeletal models have the potential to improve diagnosis and optimize clinical treatment
by predicting accurate outcomes on an individual basis. However, the subject-specific modeling
of spinal alignment is often strongly simplified or is based on radiographic assessments, exposing
subjects to unnecessary radiation. We therefore developed a novel skin marker-based approach
for modeling subject-specific spinal alignment and evaluated its feasibility by comparing the
predicted with the actual intervertebral joint (IVJ) locations/orientations (ground truth)
using lateral-view radiographic images. Moreover, the predictive performance of the subject-specific
models was evaluated by comparing the predicted L1/L2 spinal loads during various functional activities
with in vivo measured data obtained from the OrthoLoad database. IVJ locations/orientations were
predicted closer to ground truth as opposed to standard model scaling, with average location prediction
errors of 0.99+/-0.68 cm on the frontal and 1.21+/-0.97 cm on the transverse axis as well as an average
orientation prediction error of 4.74{\deg}+/-2.80{\deg}. Simulated spinal loads showed similar
curve patterns but considerably larger values as compared to in vivo measured data. Differences
in spinal loads between generic and subject-specific models become only apparent on an individual
subject level. These results underline the feasibility of the proposed method and associated workflow
for inter- and intra-subject investigations using musculoskeletal simulations. When implemented
into standard model scaling workflows, it is expected to improve the accuracy of muscle activity
and joint loading simulations, which is crucial for investigations of treatment effects or pathology-dependent
deviations.

We investigate the exchange effect between the final atom's bound electrons and those emitted in
the allowed $\beta$-decay of the initial nucleus. The electron wave functions are obtained with
the Dirac-Hartree-Fock-Slater self-consistent method, and we ensure the orthogonality between
the continuum and bound electron states, in the potential of the final atom, by modifying the last
iteration of the self-consistent method. Non-orthogonal continuum and bound states of the final
atom lead to undesired errors in the overlaps between the initial atom's bound states and the final
atom's continuum states which translates into a downturn in the total exchange correction. After
imposing the orthogonality, we found considerable differences in magnitude and energy dependence
compared to previous investigations. We argue that our findings can solve the mismatch between
the previous predictions and experimental measurements in the low-energy region. First, we calculate
the exchange effect for the low energy $\beta$ transitions in $^{14}$C, $^{45}$Ca, $^{63}$Ni,
and $^{241}$Pu, which were recently investigated in the literature. Next, we compute the total
exchange correction for a large number of $\beta$ emitters, with $Z$ from $1$ to $102$. Except for
the low-energy region, the total exchange correction progressively increases with the nuclear
charge. We found that for ultra-low energy, i.e., $5$ eV, the $Z$ dependence of total exchange effect
is affected by $s_{1/2}$ and $p_{1/2}$ orbitals closure. We also show that the contributions coming
from orbitals higher than $2s_{1/2}$ orbital are essential for a correct calculation of the total
effect, especially for low energies. Finally, we provide an analytical expression of the total
exchange correction for each atomic number for easy implementation in experimental investigations.

Ignition of iron particles in an oxidizing environment marks the onset of a self-sustained combustion.
The objective of the current study is to quantitatively examine the ignition characteristics of
fine iron particles governed by the kinetics of solid-phase iron oxidation. The oxidation rates
are inversely proportional to the thickness of the oxide layer and calibrated using the experimentally
measured growth of iron-oxide layers over time. Steady-state and unsteady analysis have been performed
to probe the dependence of the critical gas temperature required to trigger a thermal runaway (namely,
the ignition temperature $T_\mathrm{ign}$) on particle size, initial thickness of oxide layer,
inert gas species, radiative heat loss, and the collective heating effect in a suspension of particles.
Both analyses indicate that $T_\mathrm{ign}$ depends on $\delta_0$, i.e., the ratio between the
initial oxide layer thickness and particle size, regardless of the absolute size of the particle.
The unsteady analysis predicts that, for $\delta_0 \lesssim 0.003$, $T_\mathrm{ign}$ becomes
independent of $\delta_0$. Under standard conditions in air, $T_\mathrm{ign}$ is approximately
1080 K for any particle size greater than 5 microns. Radiative heat loss has a minor effect on $T_\mathrm{ign}$.
The collective effect of a suspension of iron particles in reducing $T_\mathrm{ign}$ is demonstrated.
The transition behavior between kinetic-controlled and external-diffusion-controlled combustion
regimes of an ignited iron particle is systematically examined. The influences of initial oxide-layer
thickness and particle temperature on the ignition delay time, $\tau_\mathrm{ign}$, of iron particles
are parametrically probed. A $d^2$-law scaling between $\tau_\mathrm{ign}$ and particle size
is identified.

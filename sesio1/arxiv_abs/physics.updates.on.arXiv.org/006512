Muon Scattering Tomography (MST) has been shown to be a powerful technique for the non-invasive
imaging of high-shielded objects. We present here the application of the MST technique to investigate
two types of nuclear waste packages, a small-steel drum and a large nuclear waste cask, namely, a
CASTOR V/52. We have developed a quantitative method using the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) to
evaluate the performance of an MST detector system in differentiating between high-, medium-,
and low-Z materials inside nuclear waste packages with different shielding types. The density
maps of the investigated volume are reconstructed with three different algorithms: Point of Closest
Approach (PoCA), Binned Clustering (BC) and Angle Statistics Reconstruction (ASR). This study
reveals that our MST detector system is able to differentiate between a (10 $\times$ 10 $\times$
10 cm$^3$) copper cube, embedded within a concrete matrix inside the small-steel drum, and regions
of background signal in four days of muon exposure time with a CNR value of 3.9$\pm$0.2 when using
the ASR method. During our investigation of the highly-shielded cask, the reconstructed images
of the cask contents by the ASR algorithm indicated the ability of our system to detect irregular
baskets, such as empty baskets, with a CNR value of 5.0$\pm$0.3 after 30 days of muon exposure. These
studies were done using a Monte Carlo simulation tuned to the performance of an RPC based muon tomography
system built by the University of Bristol, which had a reported position resolution of 350 micron.
Here we also report the dependence of the performance on the position resolution. We argue that using
multi-layers of RPC with 700 microns and DC with 4 mm position resolutions is applicable to generate
tomographic images with good quality.

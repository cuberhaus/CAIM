Gas has been detected in many exoplanetary systems ($>$10 Myr), thought to be released in the destruction
of volatile-rich planetesimals orbiting in exo-Kuiper belts. In this letter, we aim to explore
whether gas is also expected in the Kuiper belt (KB) in our Solar System. To quantify the gas release
in our Solar System, we use models for gas release that have been applied to extrasolar planetary
systems, as well as a physical model that accounts for gas released due to the progressive internal
warming of large planetesimals. We find that only bodies larger than about 4 km can still contain
CO ice after 4.6 Gyr of evolution. This finding may provide a clue as to why Jupiter-family comets,
thought to originate in the Kuiper belt, are deficient in CO compared to Oort-clouds comets. We predict
that gas is still produced in the KB right now at a rate of $2 \times 10^{-8}$ M$_\oplus$/Myr for CO
and orders of magnitude more when the Sun was younger. Once released, the gas is quickly pushed out
by the Solar wind. Therefore, we predict a gas wind in our Solar System starting at the KB location
and extending far beyond with regards to the heliosphere with a current total CO mass of $\sim 2 \times
10^{-12}$ M$_\oplus$. We also predict the existence of a slightly more massive atomic gas wind made
of carbon and oxygen (neutral and ionized) with a mass of $\sim 10^{-11}$ M$_\oplus$. We predict
that gas is currently present in our Solar System beyond the Kuiper belt and that although it cannot
be detected with current instrumentation, it could be observed in the future with an in situ mission
using an instrument similar to Alice on New Horizons with larger detectors. Our model of gas release
due to slow heating may also work for exoplanetary systems and provide the first real physical mechanism
for the gas observations.

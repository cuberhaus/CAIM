This study aims to identify the properties, advantages, and drawbacks of some common (and some less
common) sub-grid scale (SGS) models for large eddy simulation of low Mach compressible flows using
high order spectral elements. The models investigated are the classical constant coefficient
Smagorinsky-Lilly, the model by Vreman and two variants of a dynamic SGS (DSGS) model designed to
stabilize finite and spectral elements for transport dominated problems. In particular, we compare
one variant of DSGS that is based on a time-dependent residual version (R-DSGS) in contrast to a time-independent
residual based scheme (T-DSGS). The SGS models are compared against the reference model by Smagorinsky
and Lilly for their ability to: (i) stabilize the numerical solution, (ii) minimize undershoots
and overshoots, (iii) capture/preserve discontinuities, and (iv) transfer energy across different
length scales. These abilities are investigated on problems for: (1) passively advected tracers,
(2) coupled, nonlinear system of equations exhibiting discontinuities, (3) gravity-driven flows
in a stratified atmosphere, and (4) homogenous, isotropic turbulence. All models were able to preserve
sharp discontinuities. Vreman and the R-DSGS models also reduce the undershoots and overshoots
in the solution of linear and non-linear advection with sharp gradients. Our analysis shows that
the R-DSGS and T-DSGS models are more robust than Vreman and Smagorinsky-Lilly for numerical stabilization
of high-order spectral methods. The Smagorinsky and Vreman models are better able to resolve the
finer flow structures in shear flows, while the nodal R-DSGS model shows better energy conservation.
Overall, the nodal implementation of R-DSGS (in contrast to its element-based counterpart) is
shown to outperform the other SGS models in most metrics listed above, and on par with respect to the
remaining ones.

Many physical, chemical and biological processes rely on intrinsic oscillations to employ resonance
responses to external stimuli of certain frequency. Such resonance phenomena in biological systems
are typically explained by one of two mechanisms: either a classical linear resonance of harmonic
oscillator, or entrainment and phase locking of nonlinear limit cycle oscillators subjected to
periodic forcing. Here, we discover a nonlinear mechanism, which does not require intrinsic oscillations.
Instead, the resonant frequency dependence arises from coupling between an excitable and a monostable
region of the medium. This composite system is endowed with emergent bistability between a stable
steady state and stable spatiotemporal oscillations. The resonant transition from stable state
to oscillatory state is induced by waves of particular frequency travelling through the medium.
This transition to the spatiotemporal oscillatory state requires accumulation of multiple waves,
resulting in the exclusion of lower frequencies. The cutting off of high frequencies is realized
by damping of wave amplitude in the monostable zone and then by activating amplitude sensitive dynamics
in the monostable units. We demonstrate this new resonance mechanism in a simplistic reaction-diffusion
model. Also, we reveal this collective resonance mechanism in in-vitro experiments and detailed
biophysical simulations representing a major type of arrhythmia. We further demonstrate, both
experimentally and theoretically, that the ongoing spatiotemporal oscillations, such as ectopic
activity in cardiac tissue, can be stopped by travelling waves of high frequency. Overall, we claim
the universality of this resonance mechanism in a broad class of nonlinear biophysical systems.
Specifically, we hypothesize that such phenomena could be found in neuronal systems as an alternative
to traditional resonant processes.

Non-equilibrium thermodynamics has long been an area of substantial interest to ecologists because
most fundamental biological processes, such as protein synthesis and respiration, are inherently
energy-consuming. Microbial communities are a natural system to decipher this mechanistic basis
because their interactions in the form of substrate consumption, metabolite production, and cross-feeding
can be described explicitly in thermodynamic terms. Previous work has considered how thermodynamic
constraints impact competition between pairs of species, but restrained from analysing how this
manifests in complex dynamical systems. To address this gap, we develop a thermodynamic microbial
community model with fully reversible reaction kinetics, which allows direct consideration of
free-energy dissipation. This also allows species to interact via products rather than just substrates,
increasing the dynamical complexity, and allowing a more nuanced classification of interaction
types to emerge. Using this model, we find that community diversity increases with substrate lability,
because greater free-energy availability allows for faster generation of niches. Thus, more niches
are generated in the time frame of community establishment, leading to higher final species diversity.
We also find that allowing species to make use of near-to-equilibrium reactions increases diversity
in a low free-energy regime. In such a regime, two new thermodynamic interaction types that we identify
here reach comparable strengths to the conventional (competition and facilitation) types, emphasising
the key role that thermodynamics plays in community dynamics. Our results suggest that accounting
for realistic thermodynamic constraints is vital for understanding the dynamics of real-world
microbial communities.

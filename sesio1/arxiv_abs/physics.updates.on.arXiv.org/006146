Confined electromagnetic modes strongly couple to collective excitations in ensembles of quantum
emitters, producing light-matter hybrid states known as polaritons. Under such conditions, the
discrete multilevel spectrum of molecular systems offers an appealing playground for exploring
multiphoton processes. This work contrasts predictions from the Tavis-Cummings (TC) model, in
which the material is a collection of two-level systems, with the implications of considering additional
energy levels with harmonic and anharmonic structures. We discuss the exact eigenspectrum, up
to the second excitation manifold, of an arbitrary number $N$ of oscillators collectively coupled
to a single cavity mode in the rotating-wave approximation. Elaborating on our group-theoretic
approach [New J. Phys. 23, 063081 (2021)], we simplify the brute-force diagonalization of a gigantic
$N^2\times N^2$ Hamiltonian (where $N=10^6-10^{10}$, as experiments suggest) to the diagonalization
of, at most, $4\times4$ matrices. We thoroughly discuss the eigenstates and the consequences of
weak and strong anharmonicities. Furthermore, we find resonant conditions between bipolaritons
and anharmonic transitions where two-photon absorption can be enhanced. Finally, we conclude
that energy shifts in the polaritonic states induced by anharmonicities become negligible for
large $N$. Thus, calculations with a single or few emitters qualitatively fail to represent the
nonlinear optical response of the collective strong coupling regime. Our work highlights the rich
physics of multilevel anharmonic systems coupled to cavities absent in standard models of quantum
optics. We also provide concise tabulated expressions for eigenfrequencies and transition amplitudes,
which should serve as a reference for future spectroscopic studies of molecular polaritons.

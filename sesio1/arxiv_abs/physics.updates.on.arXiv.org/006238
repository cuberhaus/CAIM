The scaling of electromagnetic apertures is a long-standing question that has been investigated
for at least six decades but has still not been resolved [1-5]. The size of single aperture cavities,
bounded by the existence of higher-order transverse modes, fundamentally limits the power emitted
by single-mode lasers or the brightness of quantum light sources. The free-spectral range of existing
electromagnetic apertures goes to zero when the size of the aperture increases, and the demonstration
of scale-invariant apertures or lasers has remained elusive. Here, we report open-Dirac electromagnetic
apertures that exploit a subtle cavity-mode-dependent scaling of losses in reciprocal space.
For cavities with a quadratic dispersion, the complex frequencies of modes converge towards each
other with the size of cavities, making cavities invariably multimode. Surprisingly, for a class
of cavities with linear dispersion, we discover that, while the convergence of the real parts of
cavity modes towards each other is delayed (it still quickly goes to zero), the normalized complex
free-spectral range converge towards a constant governed by the loss rate of distinct Bloch bands.
We show that this unconventional scaling of the complex frequency of cavity modes in open-Dirac
electromagnetic apertures guarantees single-mode operation of large cavities. We experimentally
demonstrate that single-mode lasing of such cavities is maintained when the cavity is scale up in
size. We name such sources Berkeley Surface Emitting Lasers (BerkSELs). We further show that the
far-field emitted by the proposed single-mode BerkSELs corresponds to a topological singularity
of charge two, in full agreement with our theory. Open-Dirac apertures open new avenues for light-matter
interaction and basic science in open-wave systems with applications in classical and quantum
communications, sensing, and imaging.

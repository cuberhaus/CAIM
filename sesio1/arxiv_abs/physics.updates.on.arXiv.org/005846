The solar corona routinely exhibits explosive activity, in particular coronal mass ejections
and their accompanying eruptive flares, that have global-scale consequences. These events and
their smaller counterparts, coronal jets, originate in narrow, sinuous filament channels. The
key processes that form and evolve the channels operate on still smaller spatial scales and much
longer time scales, culminating in a vast separation of characteristic lengths and times that govern
these explosive phenomena. In this article, we describe implementation and tests of an efficient
subgrid-scale model for generating eruptive structures in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) coronal
simulations. STITCH -- STatistical InjecTion of Condensed Helicity -- is a physics-based, reduced
representation of helicity condensation: a process wherein small-scale vortical surface convection
forms ubiquitous current sheets, and pervasive reconnection across the sheets mediates an inverse
cascade of magnetic helicity and free energy, thereby forming the filament channels. STITCH abstracts
these complex processes into a single new term, in the MHD Ohm's law and induction equation, which
directly injects tangential magnetic flux into the low corona. We show that this approach is in very
good agreement with a full helicity-condensation calculation that treats all of the dynamics explicitly,
while enabling substantial reductions in temporal duration especially, but also in spatial resolution.
In addition, we illustrate the flexibility of STITCH at forming localized filament channels and
at energizing complex surface flux distributions that have sinuous boundaries. STITCH is simple
to implement and computationally efficient, making it a powerful new technique for event-based,
data-driven modeling of solar eruptions.

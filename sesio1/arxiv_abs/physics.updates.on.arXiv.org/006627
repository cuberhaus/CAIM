Ambient exposure to fine particulate matters of diameters smaller than 2.5{\mu}m (PM2.5) has been
identified as one critical cause for respiratory disease. Disparities in exposure to PM2.5 among
income groups at individual residences are known to exist and are easy to calculate. Existing approaches
for exposure assessment, however, do not capture the exposure implied by the dynamic mobility of
city dwellers that accounts for a large proportion of the exposure outside homes. To overcome the
challenge of gauging the exposure to PM2.5 for city dwellers, we analyzed billions of anonymized
and privacy-enhanced location-based data generated by mobile phone users in Harris County, Texas,
to characterize the mobility patterns of the populations and associated exposure. We introduce
the metric for exposure extent based on the time people spent at places with the air pollutant and
examine the disparities in mobility-based exposure across income groups. Our results show that
PM2.5 emissions disproportionately expose low-income populations due to their mobility activities.
People with higher-than-average income are exposed to lower levels of PM2.5 emissions. These disparities
in mobility-based exposure are the result of frequent visits of low-income people to the industrial
sectors of urban areas with high PM2.5 emissions, and the larger mobility scale of these people for
life needs. The results inform about environmental justice and public health strategies, not only
to reduce the overall PM2.5 exposure but also to mitigate the disproportional impacts on low-income
populations. The findings also suggest that an integration of extensive fine-scale population
mobility and pollution emissions data can unveil new insights into inequality in air pollution
exposures at the urban scale.

Coarse-graining offers a means to extend the achievable time and length scales of molecular dynamics
simulations beyond what is practically possible in the atomistic regime. Sampling molecular configurations
of interest can be done efficiently using coarse-grained simulations, from which meaningful physicochemical
information can be inferred if the corresponding all-atom configurations are reconstructed.
However, this procedure of backmapping to reintroduce the lost atomistic detail into coarse-grain
structures has proven a challenging task due to the many feasible atomistic configurations that
can be associated with one coarse-grain structure. Existing backmapping methods are strictly
frame-based, relying on either heuristics to replace coarse-grain particles with atomic fragments
and subsequent relaxation, or parameterized models to propose atomic coordinates separately
and independently for each coarse-grain structure. These approaches neglect information from
previous trajectory frames that is critical to ensuring temporal coherence of the backmapped trajectory,
while also offering information potentially helpful to produce higher-fidelity atomic reconstructions.
In this work we present a deep learning-enabled data-driven approach for temporally coherent backmapping
that explicitly incorporates information from preceding trajectory structures. Our method trains
a conditional variational autoencoder to non-deterministically reconstruct atomistic detail
conditioned on both the target coarse-grain configuration and the previously reconstructed atomistic
configuration. We demonstrate our backmapping approach on two exemplar biomolecular systems:
alanine dipeptide and the miniprotein chignolin. We show that our backmapped trajectories accurately
recover the structural, thermodynamic, and kinetic properties of the atomistic trajectory data.

Automated image processing algorithms can improve the quality, efficiency, and consistency of
classifying the morphology of heterogeneous carbonate rock and can deal with a massive amount of
data and images seamlessly. Geoscientists face difficulties in setting the direction of the optimum
method for determining petrophysical properties from rock images, Micro-Computed Tomography
(uCT), or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Most of the successful work is from the homogeneous
rocks focusing on 2D images with less focus on 3D and requiring numerical simulation. Currently,
image analysis methods converge to three approaches: image processing, artificial intelligence,
and combined image processing with artificial intelligence. In this work, we propose two methods
to determine the porosity from 3D uCT and MRI images: an image processing method with Image Resolution
Optimized Gaussian Algorithm (IROGA); advanced image recognition method enabled by Machine Learning
Difference of Gaussian Random Forest (MLDGRF). We have built reference 3D micro models and collected
images for calibration of IROGA and MLDGRF methods. To evaluate the predictive capability of these
calibrated approaches, we ran them on 3D uCT and MRI images of natural heterogeneous carbonate rock.
We measured the porosity and lithology of the carbonate rock using three and two industry-standard
ways, respectively, as reference values. Notably, IROGA and MLDGRF have produced porosity results
with an accuracy of 96.2% and 97.1% on the training set and 91.7% and 94.4% on blind test validation,
respectively, in comparison with the three experimental measurements. We measured limestone
and pyrite reference values using two methods, X-ray powder diffraction, and grain density measurements.
MLDGRF has produced lithology (limestone and Pyrite) volumes with 97.7% accuracy.

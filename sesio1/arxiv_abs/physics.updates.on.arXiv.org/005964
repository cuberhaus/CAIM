Proton computed tomography (CT) is similar to x-ray CT but relies on protons rather than photons
to form an image. In its most common operation mode, the measured quantity is the amount of energy
that a proton has lost while traversing the imaged object from which a relative stopping power map
can be obtained via tomographic reconstruction. To this end, a calorimeter which measures the energy
deposited by protons downstream of the scanned object has been studied or implemented as energy
detector in several proton CT prototypes. An alternative method is to measure the proton's residual
velocity and thus its kinetic energy via the time of flight (TOF) between at least two sensor planes.
In this work, we study the precision, i.e. image noise, which can be expected from TOF proton CT systems.
We rely on physics models on the one hand and statistical models of the relevant uncertainties on
the other to derive closed form expressions for the noise in projection images. The TOF measurement
error scales with the distance between the TOF sensor planes and is reported as velocity error in
ps/m. We use variance reconstruction to obtain noise maps of a water cylinder phantom given the scanner
characteristics and additionally reconstruct noise maps for a calorimeter-based proton CT system
as reference. We find that TOF proton CT with 30 ps/m velocity error reaches similar image noise as
a calorimeter-based proton CT system with 1% energy error (1 sigma error). A TOF proton CT system
with a 50 ps/m velocity error produces slightly less noise than a 2% calorimeter system. Noise in
a reconstructed TOF proton CT image is spatially inhomogeneous with a marked increase towards the
object periphery. This systematic study of image noise in TOF proton CT can serve as a guide for future
developments of this alternative solution for estimating the residual energy of protons after
the scanned object.

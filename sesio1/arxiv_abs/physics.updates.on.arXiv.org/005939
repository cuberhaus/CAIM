Laser stabilization sits at the heart of many precision scientific experiments and applications,
including quantum information science, metrology and atomic timekeeping. These systems narrow
the laser linewidth and stabilize the carrier by use of Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) locking to a table-scale,
ultra-high quality factor (Q), vacuum spaced Fabry-Perot reference cavity. Integrating these
cavities, to bring characteristics of PDH stabilization to the chip-scale, is critical to reduce
their size, cost, and weight, and enable a wide range of portable and system-on-chip applications.
We report a significant advance in integrated laser linewidth narrowing, stabilization and noise
reduction, by use of a photonic integrated 4.0-meter-long coil resonator to stabilize a semiconductor
laser. We achieve a 36 Hz 1/{\pi}-integral linewidth, an Allan deviation (ADEV) of 1.8x10^{-13}
at 10 ms measurement time, and a 2.3 kHz/sec drift, to the best of our knowledge the lowest integral
linewidth and highest stability demonstrated for an integrated reference cavity. Two coil designs,
stabilizing lasers operating at 1550 nm and 1319 nm are demonstrated. The resonator is bus coupled
to a 4.0-meter-long coil, with a 49 MHz free spectral range (FSR), a mode volume of 1.0x10^{10} {\mu}m^3
and a 142 million intrinsic Q, fabricated in a CMOS compatible, ultra-low loss silicon nitride waveguide
platform. Our measurements and simulations show that the thermorefractive noise floor for this
particular cavity is reached for frequencies down to 20 Hz in an ambient environment with simple
passive vibration isolation and without vacuum or thermal isolation. The TRN limited performance
is estimated to be an 8 Hz 1/{\pi} integral linewidth and ADEV of 5x10^{-14} at 10 ms, opening a stability
regime that heretofore has only been available in fundamentally un-integrated systems.

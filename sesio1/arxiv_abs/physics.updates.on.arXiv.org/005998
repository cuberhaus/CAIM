Free floating Test Masses (TM) of inertial reference instruments accumulate charge mainly through
the triboelectric effect during separation from their housings and, if in the space environment,
from cosmic radiation. These charges will degrade the accuracy of high sensitivity accelerometers
and drag-free sensors. We demonstrate in ground testing two passive bipolar charge management
systems using photoelectrons emitted from Au coated surfaces under illumination by UV-LEDs of
255 nm, 275 nm, and 295 nm central wavelength. The first method uses fast photoelectrons, generated
by two 255 nm UV-LEDs with adjustable-intensity (through fine-tuning of their excitation currents)
and illuminating the TM and its housing respectively. A second technique uses slow photoelectrons
generated by one UV LED, of either 275 nm or 295 nm, located on the TM housing. Fast and slow electrons
are defined as having kinetic energies after photoemission above and below the maximum allowable
potential above ground, VTMmax, required for normal operation of the TM. In their optimized configurations
and following a 10 to 30 sec exposure to UV with initial TM potentials of between -3 V and 3 V, both control
systems converge to a TM potential of about 10 mV with a drift of about 2 mV/day. For reference, VTMmax
is about 100mV for the LISA and LISA pathfinder sensors. Insight into the slow photoelectrons charge
control method is provided by our simple gaussian model of the distribution of the photoemission
sites of Au films: 4.6 eV center, 0.2 eV standard deviation, and 4.30 eV and 4.90 eV cutoffs. The lowest
energy photoemission is obtained with the 295 nm LED at about 4.35 eV or 285 nm; equivalent to 2.5 times
the standard deviation from its center wavelength and at 4% of its maximum intensity.

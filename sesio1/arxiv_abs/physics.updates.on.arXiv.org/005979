The combined vertexing and tracking performance of the innermost part of the FCC-ee experiments
must deliver outstanding precision for measurement of the track momentum together with an impact
parameter resolution exceeding by at least a factor five that typically achieved at LHC experiments.
Furthermore, precision measurements require stability and fiducial accuracy at a level which
is unprecedented in collider experiments. For the innermost vertex layers these goals translate
into a target hit resolution of approximately 3 $\mu$m together with a material budget of around
0.2\% of a radiation length per layer. Typically this performance might be provided by silicon-based
tracking, together with a careful choice of a low-mass cooling technology, and a stable, low mass
mechanical structure capable of providing measurements with a low enough systematic error to match
the tremendous statistics expected, particularly for the run around the Z resonance. At FCC-ee,
the magnetic field will be limited to approximately 2\,T, in order to contain the vertical emittance
at the Z pole, and a tracking volume up to relative large radius is needed. The technological solution
could be silicon or gaseous based tracking, in both cases with the focus on optimising the material
budget, and particle identification capability would be an advantage. Depending on the global
design, an additional silicon tracking layer could be added at the outer radius of the tracker to
provide a final precise point contributing to the momentum or possibly time of flight measurement.
Current developments in monolithic and hybrid silicon technology, as well as advanced gaseous
tracking developments provide an encouraging road map towards the FCC-ee detector. The current
state of the art and potential extensions will be discussed.

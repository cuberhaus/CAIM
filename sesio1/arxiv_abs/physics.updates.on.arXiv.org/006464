Photons excited into ground state modes at finite temperature display partitioning among photon
phases, lifetimes and distances travelled since creation. These distributions set the distance
from an interface a created photon has some chance of emission. Excited photons at each frequency
have a phase velocity set by each mode propagation index which determines mode density and internal
energy contribution. All photons emitted after striking an interface obliquely are refracted.
Their exit intensities are then irreversible except when weak internal attenuation occurs. At
low temperature attenuation index is small so reversibility is approximate. As temperature rises
refraction direction varies. Total emission remains reversible after transitioning through
a non equilibrium state with no other heat inputs. In equilibrium the densities of excitations that
create and annihilate photons are in balance with photon densities while emissivity depends on
both indices and internal incident direction. Modelled exit intensities from pure water and crystalline
silica contain strong resonant intensities and match data accurately. Intrinsic resonances formed
within liquids and compounds are due to photon modes hybridising with localized excitations, including
molecular oscillations and the anharmonic component of lattice distortions. They explain the
many resonant spectral intensities seen in remote sensing. Each hybrid oscillator is a photonic
virtual bound state whose energy fluctuates between levels separated by mode energy. Refraction
induces solid angle changes and often anomalous refraction while thermal recycling of internally
reflected photons modifies intensities and internal energy. Enhanced internal heat flux from
phonon drag by photon density gradients under an external temperature gradient is also predicted.

Hyperspectral feature spaces are useful for many remote sensing applications ranging from spectral
mixture modeling to discrete thematic classification. In such cases, characterization of the
feature space dimensionality, geometry and topology can provide guidance for effective model
design. The objective of this study is to compare and contrast two approaches for identifying feature
space basis vectors via dimensionality reduction. These approaches can be combined to render a
joint characterization that reveals spectral properties not apparent using either approach alone.
We use a diverse collection of AVIRIS-NG reflectance spectra of the snow-firn-ice continuum to
illustrate the utility of joint characterization and identify physical properties inferred from
the spectra. Spectral feature spaces combining principal components (PCs) and t-distributed
Stochastic Neighbor Embeddings (t-SNEs) provide physically interpretable dimensions representing
the global (PC) structure of cryospheric reflectance properties and local (t-SNE) manifold structures
revealing clustering not resolved in the global continuum. Joint characterization reveals distinct
continua for snow-firn gradients on different parts of the Greenland Ice Sheet and multiple clusters
of ice reflectance properties common to both glacier and sea ice in different locations. Clustering
revealed in t-SNE feature spaces, and extended to the joint characterization, distinguishes differences
in spectral curvature specific to location within the snow accumulation zone, and BRDF effects
related to view geometry. The ability of PC+t-SNE joint characterization to produce a physically
interpretable spectral feature spaces revealing global topology while preserving local manifold
structures suggests that this characterization might be extended to the much higher dimensional
hyperspectral feature space of all terrestrial land cover.

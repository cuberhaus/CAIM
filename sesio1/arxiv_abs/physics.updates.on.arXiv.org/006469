Bone pain typically occurs immediately following skeletal damage with mechanical distortion
or rupture of nociceptive fibres. The pain mechanism is also associated with chronic pain conditions
where the healing process is impaired. Any load impacting on the area of the fractured bone will increase
the intraosseous pressure, consequently stimulating the nociceptive response, necessitating
rapid clinical intervention to relieve pain associated with the bone damage and appropriate mitigation
of any processes involved with the loss of bone mass, muscle, mobility and, to prevent death. The
following review has examined the mechanisms of pain associated with trauma or cancer-related
skeletal damage focusing on new approaches for the development of innovative therapeutic interventions.
In particular, the current review highlights tissue engineering approaches that offer considerable
promise in the application of functional biomimetic fabrication of bone and nerve tissues, resembling
the pathological micro-environment. The strategic combination of bone and nerve tissue engineered
models provides significant potential to develop a new class of in vitro platforms, capable of replacing
in vivo models and testing the safety and efficacy of novel drug treatments aimed at the resolution
of bone-associated pain. To date, the field of bone pain research has centred on animal models, with
accompanying disparity within models often noted and a paucity of data correlating to the human
physiological response. This review explores the evident gap in pain drug development research
and suggests a step change in approach to harness tissue engineering technologies to recapitulate
the complex pathophysiological environment of the damaged bone tissue enabling evaluation of
the associated pain-mimicking mechanism with, ultimately, significant therapeutic potential
therein for improved patient quality of life.

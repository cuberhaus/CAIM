Computational models of the human head are promising tools for estimating the impact-induced response
of brain, and thus play an important role in the prediction of traumatic brain injury. Modern biofidelic
head model simulations are associated with very high computational cost, and high-dimensional
inputs and outputs, which limits the applicability of traditional uncertainty quantification
(UQ) methods on these systems. In this study, a two-stage, data-driven manifold learning-based
framework is proposed for UQ of computational head models. This framework is demonstrated on a 2D
subject-specific head model, where the goal is to quantify uncertainty in the simulated strain
fields (i.e., output), given variability in the material properties of different brain substructures
(i.e., input). In the first stage, a data-driven method based on multi-dimensional Gaussian kernel-density
estimation and diffusion maps is used to generate realizations of the input random vector directly
from the available data. Computational simulations of a small number of realizations provide input-output
pairs for training data-driven surrogate models in the second stage. The surrogate models employ
nonlinear dimensionality reduction using Grassmannian diffusion maps, Gaussian process regression
to create a low-cost mapping between the input random vector and the reduced solution space, and
geometric harmonics models for mapping between the reduced space and the Grassmann manifold. It
is demonstrated that the surrogate models provide highly accurate approximations of the computational
model while significantly reducing the computational cost. Monte Carlo simulations of the surrogate
models are used for uncertainty propagation. UQ of strain fields highlight significant spatial
variation in model uncertainty, and reveal key differences in uncertainty among commonly used
strain-based brain injury predictor variables.

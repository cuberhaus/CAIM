Rapid progress in the precision and accuracy of optical atomic clocks over the last decade has advanced
the frontiers of timekeeping, metrology, and quantum science. However, the stabilities of most
optical clocks remain limited by the local oscillator rather than the atoms themselves, leaving
room for further progress. Here we implement a "multiplexed" one-dimensional optical lattice
clock, in which spatially-resolved, movable ensembles of ultra-cold strontium atoms are trapped
in the same optical lattice, interrogated simultaneously by a shared clock laser, and read-out
in parallel. By performing synchronized Ramsey interrogations of ensemble pairs we observe atom-atom
coherence times up to 26 seconds, a 270-fold improvement over the atom-laser coherence time, demonstrate
a relative stability of $9.7(4)\times10^{-18}/\sqrt{\tau}$ (where $\tau$ is the averaging time
in seconds), and reach a fractional uncertainty of $8.9(3)\times 10^{-20}$ after 3.3 hours of averaging.
These results demonstrate that applications requiring ultra-high-precision comparisons between
optical atomic clocks need not be limited by the stability of the local oscillator. With multiple
ensemble pairs, we realize a miniaturized clock network consisting of 6 atom ensembles, resulting
in 15 unique pairwise clock comparisons with relative stabilities below $3\times10^{-17}/\sqrt{\tau}$.
Finally, we demonstrate the capability to simultaneously load spatially-resolved, heterogeneous
ensemble pairs of all four stable isotopes of strontium in a lattice. The unique capabilities offered
by this platform pave the way for future studies of precision isotope shift measurements, spatially
resolved characterization of limiting clock systematics, development of clock-based gravitational
wave and dark matter detectors, and novel tests of relativity including measurements of the gravitational
redshift at sub-centimeter scales.

We present the statistical method dedicated to study the interaction between a chosen protein and
another molecule (e.g. both being components of lubricin found in synovial fluid) in a water environment.
The research is performed on the example of univariate time series of chosen feature of the dynamics
of mucin, which interact with chondroitin sulfate (4 and 6) in four different saline solutions.
Our statistical approach is based on the use recurrence methods to analyse chosen features of molecular
dynamics. Such recurrence methods are usually applied to reconstruct the evolution of a molecular
system in its reduced phase space, where the most important variables in the process are taken into
account. In details, the analysed time-series is spitted onto sub-series of records that are expected
to carry the meaningful information about the system of molecules. Elements of sub-series are splinted
by the constant delay-time lag (that is the parameter determined by statistical testing in our case)
and the length of sub-series is the embedded dimension parameter (using Cao method). To analyse
the robustness of the sub-series determination we use recurrent plots approach combined with the
Shannon entropy approach. We hypothesise that the robustness of the sub-series determines some
specifics of dynamics of the system of molecules. We analyse rather highly noised feature to demonstrate
that the analysis such kind of feature leads to recurrence plots that graphically look similar.
From the recurrence plots, the Shannon entropy has been be computed. We have however demonstrated,
for analysed features, that the Shannon entropy value is highly dependent on the delay time value.
Hence the elaboration of more precise method of the recurrence plot analysis is required. For this
reason, we suggest the random walk method that can be applied to analyse the recurrence plots automatically.

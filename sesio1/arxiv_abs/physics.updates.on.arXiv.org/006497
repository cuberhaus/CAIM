The optimization of the electrodes manufacturing process constitutes one of the most critical
steps to ensure high-quality Lithium-Ion Battery (LIB) cells, in particular for automotive applications.
Because LIB electrode manufacturing is a complex process involving multiple steps and interdependent
parameters, we have shown in our previous works that 3D-resolved physics-based models constitute
very useful tools to provide insights about the impact of the manufacturing process parameters
on the textural and performance properties of the electrodes. However, their high-throughput
application for electrode properties optimization and inverse design of manufacturing parameters
is limited due to the high computational cost associated with this kind of model. In this work, we
tackle this issue by proposing an innovative approach, supported by a deterministic machine learning
(ML)-assisted pipeline for multi-objective optimization of LIB electrode properties and inverse
design of its manufacturing process. Firstly, the pipeline generates a synthetic dataset from
physics-based simulations with low discrepancy sequences, that allow to sufficiently represent
the manufacturing parameters space. Secondly, the generated dataset is used to train deterministic
ML models for the implementation of a fast multi-objective optimization, to identify an optimal
electrode and the manufacturing parameters to adopt in order to fabricate it. Lastly, this electrode
was successfully fabricated experimentally, proving that our modeling pipeline prediction is
physical-relevant. Here, we demonstrate our pipeline for the simultaneous minimization of the
electrode tortuosity factor and maximization of the effective electronic conductivity, the active
surface area, and the density, all being parameters that affect the Li$^+$ (de-)intercalation
kinetics, ionic, and electronic transport properties of the electrode.

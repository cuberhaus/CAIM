Superconducting RF is a key technology for future particle accelerators, now relying on advanced
surfaces beyond bulk Nb for a leap in performance and efficiency. The SRF thin film strategy aims
at transforming the current SRF technology by using highly functional materials, addressing all
the necessary functions. The community is deploying efforts in three research thrusts to develop
next-generation thin-film based cavities. Nb on Cu cavities are developed to perform as good as
or better than bulk Nb at reduced cost and with better thermal stability. Recent results showing
improved accelerating field and dramatically reduced Q slope show their potential for many applications.
The second research thrust is to develop cavities coated with materials that can operate at higher
temperatures or sustain higher fields. Proof of principle has been established for the merit of
Nb3Sn for SRF application. Research is now needed to further exploit the material and reach its full
potential with novel deposition techniques. The third line of research is to push SRF performance
beyond the capabilities of the superconductors alone with multilayered coatings. In parallel,
developments are needed to provide quality substrates, cooling schemes and cryomodule design
tailored to thin film cavities. Recent results in these three research thrusts suggest that SRF
thin film technologies are at the eve of a technological revolution. For them to mature, active community
support and sustained funding are needed to address fundamental developments supporting material
deposition techniques, surface and RF research, technical challenges associated with scaling
and industrialization. With dedicated and sustained investment, next-generation thin-film
based cavities will become a reality with high performance and efficiency, facilitating energy
sustainable science while enabling higher luminosity, and higher energy.

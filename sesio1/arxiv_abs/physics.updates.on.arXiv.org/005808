Surface-wave (SW) sustained plasmas belong to the category of gaseous discharges provided by the
electric field component of an electromagnetic (EM) wave. Tubular plasmas of this kind can be achieved
over an unrivalled wide range of operating conditions, namely gas nature and pressure, EM field
frequency and (dielectric) discharge tube characteristics. Modeling of SW produced plasmas has
mainly rest till now on assuming an intrinsic connection between the wave and the generated plasma
column: it implies that the SW travels along the plasma column as its propagating medium, which in
return influences the SW properties. In contrast, the current paper advocates that there is no coaction
of the plasma column on the characteristics of the surface wave that sustains it. This argument initially
arouse from the, amply-documented, experimental results showing that the axial distribution
of electron density along SWDs is linear (constant slope) till the very end of the plasma column,
as promoted by highly reliable least squares regressions on the experimental values of axial electron
density. A linear axial profile of electron density opposes any influence on SW properties of the
plasma column since its inhomogeneity may vary axially in different ways according to operating
conditions. The basic physical argument behind the axial linearity of electron density lies in
the discharge stability criterion requiring that the electron density decreases monotonously
as the propagating SW loses power. Accordingly, it fully sets how the SW axial power flow is delivered
to the discharge gas, determining the number of electrons generated in any given axial segment of
the plasma column. A paradigm shift is thus proposed, promoting that the features of the plasma column
are fully and independently determined by the SW power flow alone.

Radiation therapy treatment planning can be viewed as an iterative hyperparameter tuning process
to balance conflicting clinical goals. In this work, we investigated the performance of modern
Bayesian Optimization (BO) methods on automated treatment planning problems in high-dimensional
settings. 20 locally advanced rectal cancer patients treated with intensity-modulated radiation
therapy (IMRT) were retrospectively selected as test cases. We implemented an automated treatment
planning framework that adjusts dose objectives and weights simultaneously, and tested the performance
of two BO methods on the treatment planning task: one standard BO method (GPEI) and one BO method dedicated
to high-dimensional problems (SAAS-BO). A random tuning method was also included as the baseline.
We compared and analyzed the three automated methods' plan quality and planning efficiency and
the different search patterns of the two BO methods. For the target structures, the SAAS-BO plans
achieved comparable hot spot control ($p=0.43$) and homogeneity ($p=0.96$) with the clinical
plans, significantly better than the GPEI and random plans ($p<0.05$). Both SAAS-BO and GPEI plans
significantly outperformed the clinical plans in conformity and dose spillage ($p<0.05$). Compared
with clinical plans, the treatment plans generated by the three automated methods all made reductions
in evaluated dosimetric indices for the femoral head and the bladder. The analysis of the underlying
predictive models has shown that both BO procedures have identified similar important planning
parameters. This work implemented a BO-based hyperparameter tuning framework for automated treatment
planning. Both tested BO methods were able to produce high-quality treatment plans and the model
analysis also confirmed the intrinsic low dimensionality of the tested treatment planning problems.

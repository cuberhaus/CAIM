This paper examines the Standard Model under the strong-electroweak gauge group $SU_C(3)\times
U_{EW}(2)$ subject to the Lie algebra condition $\mathfrak{u}_{EW}(2)\not\cong \mathfrak{su}_{I}(2)\oplus
\mathfrak{u}_{Y}(1)$. Physically, the condition ensures that all electroweak gauge bosons interact
with each other prior to symmetry breaking -- as one might expect from $U(2)$ invariance. This represents
a crucial shift in the identification of physical gauge bosons: Unlike the Standard Model which
posits a change of Lie algebra basis induced by spontaneous symmetry breaking, here the basis is
unaltered and $A,\,Z^0,\,W^\pm$ represent the physical bosons both before and after spontaneous
symmetry breaking. Our choice of $\mathfrak{u}_{EW}(2)$ basis requires some modification of
the matter field representation of the Standard Model. Careful attention to the product group structure
calls for strong-electroweak degrees of freedom in the $(\mathbf{3},\mathbf{2})$ and the $(\mathbf{3},\bar{\mathbf{2}})$
of $SU_C(3)\times U_{EW}(2)$ that possess integer electric charge just like leptons. These degrees
of freedom play the role of quarks, and they lead to a modified Lagrangian that nevertheless reproduces
transition rates and cross sections equivalent to the Standard Model. The close resemblance between
quark and lepton electroweak doublets in this picture suggests a mechanism for a speculative phase
transition between quarks and leptons that stems from the product structure of the gauge group.
Our hypothesis is that the strong and electroweak bosons see each other as a source of decoherence.
In effect, leptons get identified with the $SU_C(3)$-trace of quark representations. This mechanism
allows for possible extensions of the Standard Model that don't require large inclusive multiplets
of matter fields.

The international community aims to limit global warming to 1.5{\deg}C, but little progress has
been made towards a global, cost-efficient, and fair climate mitigation plan to deploy carbon dioxide
removal (CDR) at the Paris Agreement's scale. Here, we investigate how different CDR options - AR,
BECCS, and DACCS - might be deployed to meet the Paris Agreement's CDR objectives. We find that international
cooperation in climate mitigation policy is key for deploying the most cost-efficient CDR pathway
- comprised of BECCS, mainly (74%), and AR (26%) -, allowing to take the most advantage of regional
bio-geophysical resources and socio-economic factors, and time variations, and therefore minimising
costs. Importantly, with international cooperation, the spatio-temporal evolution of the CDR
pathway differs greatly from the socio-economically fair regional allocation of the Paris Agreement's
CDR objectives. With limited, or no international cooperation, we find that the likelihood of delivering
these CDR objectives decreases, as deploying CDR pathways becomes significantly more challenging
and costly - particularly when leading to the deployment of DACCS. Moreover, we show that developing
international cooperation policy instruments - such as an international market for negative emissions
trading - can deliver, simultaneously, cost-efficient and equitable CDR at the Paris Agreement's
scale, by incentivising participating nations to meet their share of the Paris Agreement's CDR
objectives, whilst making up for the uneven distribution of CDR potentials across the world. Crucially,
we conclude that international cooperation is imperative, as soon as possible, to preserve the
feasibility and sustainability of future CDR pathways, and ensure that future generations do not
bear the burden, increasingly costlier, of climate mitigation inaction.

The time series of northern hemisphere (NHSI) and southern hemisphere (SHSI) sea-ice extent are
submitted to singular spectral analysis (SSA). The components are analyzed with Laplace's formulation
of the Liouville-Euler system. As already shown in a previous work, the trends observed in the time
series are quasi linear, decreasing for NHSI and increasing for SHSI. The amplitude of annual variations
in the Antarctic is double that in the Arctic, they are in phase opposition, modulated. The semi-annual
components are in quadrature. The first 3 components of both NHSI and SHSI at 1, 1/2 and 1/3 yr account
for more than 95% of the signal variance. We complement previous analyses of variations in pole position
(PM = m1, m2) and length of day (lod). Whereas SSA of lod is dominated by the same first 3 components
as sea-ice, SSA of PM contains only the 1 yr and the Chandler components. The 1 yr component of NHSI
is in phase with that of lod and in phase opposition with m1. The reverse holds for the 1 yr component
of SHSI. We note that the semi-annual component appears in lod not in m1. The annual and semi-annual
components of NHSI and SHSI are much larger than the trends observed since 1978, that leads us to test
whether a first order geophysical or astronomical forcing should not be preferred to the mechanisms
generally suggested as a forcing factor of the trends. The lack of modulation of the largest forced
component suggests an alternate mechanism. In Laplace's paradigm, the torques exerted by the Moon,
Sun and planets play the leading role as the source of forcing of many geophysical phenomena. These
forces lead to changes in the inclination of the Earth's rotation axis, setting Earth masses in motion
and resulting in thermal dissipation. It is variations in inclination of the rotation axis that
lead to the large annual components of melting and re-freezing of sea-ice.

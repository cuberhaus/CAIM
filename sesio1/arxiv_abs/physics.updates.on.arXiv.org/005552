Many physicists have thought that absolute time became otiose with the introduction of Special
Relativity. William Lane Craig disagrees and argues that although relativity is empirically adequate
within a domain of application, relativity should be supplanted by a Neo-Lorentzian alternative
that allows for absolute time. Meanwhile, Craig and co-author Sinclair have argued that physical
cosmology supports the conclusion that physical reality began to exist at a finite time in the past.
However, on their view, the beginning of physical reality requires the objective passage of absolute
time, so that the beginning of physical reality stands or falls with Craig's Neo-Lorentzian metaphysics.
I raise doubts about whether, given Craig's NeoLorentzian metaphysics, physical cosmology could
adequately support a beginning of physical reality within the finite past. Craig and Sinclair's
conception of the beginning of the universe requires a past boundary to the universe. A past boundary
to the universe cannot be directly observed and so must be inferred from the observed matter-energy
distribution in conjunction with auxilary hypotheses drawn from a substantive physical theory.
Craig's brand of Neo Lorentzianism has not been sufficiently well specified so as to infer either
that there is a past boundary or that the boundary is located in the finite past. Thus, Neo Lorentzianism
implicitly introduces a form of skepticism that removes the ability that we might have otherwise
had to infer a beginning of the universe. Furthermore, in analyzing traditional big bang models,
I develop criteria that Neo-Lorentzians should deploy in thinking about the direction and duration
of time in cosmological models generally. For my last task, I apply the same criteria to bounce cosmologies
and show that Craig and Sinclair have been wrong to interpret bounce cosmologies as including a beginning
of physical reality.

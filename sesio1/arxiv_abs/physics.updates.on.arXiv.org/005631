Watershed models such as the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) consist of high-dimensional
physical and empirical parameters. These parameters need to be accurately calibrated for models
to produce reliable predictions for streamflow, evapotranspiration, snow water equivalent,
and nutrient loading. Existing parameter estimation methods are time-consuming, inefficient,
and computationally intensive, with reduced accuracy when estimating high-dimensional parameters.
In this paper, we present a fast, accurate, and reliable methodology to calibrate the SWAT model
(i.e., 21 parameters) using deep learning (DL). We develop DL-enabled inverse models based on convolutional
neural networks to ingest streamflow data and estimate the SWAT model parameters. Hyperparameter
tuning is performed to identify the optimal neural network architecture and the nine next best candidates.
We use ensemble SWAT simulations to train, validate, and test the above DL models. We estimated the
actual parameters of the SWAT model using observational data. We test and validate the proposed
DL methodology on the American River Watershed, located in the Pacific Northwest-based Yakima
River basin. Our results show that the DL models-based calibration is better than traditional parameter
estimation methods, such as generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE). The behavioral
parameter sets estimated by DL have narrower ranges than GLUE and produce values within the sampling
range even under high relative observational errors. This narrow range of parameters shows the
reliability of the proposed workflow to estimate sensitive parameters accurately even under noise.
Due to its fast and reasonably accurate estimations of process parameters, the proposed DL workflow
is attractive for calibrating integrated hydrologic models for large spatial-scale applications.

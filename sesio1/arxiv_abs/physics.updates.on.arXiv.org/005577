A permanent magnet array (PMA) is a preferred source of magnetic field for body-part-dedicated
low-field (<0.5 T) portable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) because it has a small footprint,
no power consumption, and no need for a cooling system. The current popular PMA is limited by the transversal
field below 100 mT, where advanced technologies developed for the long-bore MRI systems (e.g.,
multi-channel techniques) cannot be applied. In this paper, a sparse high-performance PMA is proposed
based on inward-outward ring pairs and using magnet blocks that can be bought off the shelf, targeting
on portable head imaging. Through a fast genetic algorithm (GA)-based optimization, the proposed
PMA has a longitudinal magnetic field with an average field strength of 111.40 mT and a monotonic
field pattern with inhomogeneity of 10.57 mT (an RF bandwidth of <10%) within a Field of View (FoV)
of 20 cm in diameter and 4.5 cm in length. The resulting field was validated using analytic calculations
and numerical simulations. The encoding capability of the designed PMA was examined by checking
the quality of the simulated reconstructed images. The proposed field outperforms a linear pattern
for encoding. The PMA is 57.91 cm wide, 38 cm long, has a 5-gauss range of 87x87x104 cm^3, allowing
an operation in a small space. It weights 126.08kg, comprising of a stationary main array that supplies
a strong homogeneous field, and a light rotatable sub-gradient-array (5.12kg) that supplies a
monotonic field for signal encoding. It has a magnetic field generation efficiency of 0.88mT/kg,
the highest among sparse PMAs that offer a monotonic field pattern. The force experienced by each
magnet was calculated to validate the feasibility of physical implementation. The proposed PMA
can be a promising alternative to supply the main and gradient fields combined for dedicated portable
MRI.

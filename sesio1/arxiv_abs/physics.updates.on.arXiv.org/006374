A crucial step in the history of General Relativity was Einstein's adoption of the principle of general
covariance which demands a coordinate independent formulation for our spacetime theories. General
covariance helps us to disentangle a theory's substantive content from its merely representational
artifacts. It is an indispensable tool for a modern understanding of spacetime theories. Motivated
by quantum gravity, one may wish to extend these notions to quantum spacetime theories (whatever
those are). Relatedly, one might want to extend these notions to discrete spacetime theories (i.e.,
lattice theories). This paper delivers such an extension with surprising consequences. One's
first intuition regarding discrete spacetime theories may be that they introduce a great deal of
fixed background structure (i.e., a lattice) and thereby limit our theory's possible symmetries
down to those which preserve this fixed structure (i.e., discrete symmetries). However, as I will
discuss, these intuitions are doubly wrong and overhasty. Discrete spacetime theories can and
do have continuous translation and rotation symmetries. Moreover, the exact same theory can be
given a wide variety of lattice structures and can even be described with no lattice at all. As my discrete
analog of general covariance will reveal: lattice structure is rather less like a fixed background
structure or part of an underlying manifold and rather more like a coordinate system, i.e., merely
a representational artifact. Thus, the world cannot be "fundamentally set on a square lattice"
(or any other lattice) any more than it could be "fundamentally set in a certain coordinate system".
Like coordinate systems, lattice structures are just not the sort of thing that can be fundamental;
they are both thoroughly representational. Spacetime cannot be discrete (even when it might be
representable as such).

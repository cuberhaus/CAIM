Dose painting of hypoxic tumour sub-volumes using positron-emission tomography (PET) has been
shown to improve tumour control in silico in several sites. Pancreatic cancer presents a more stringent
challenge, given its proximity to critical organs-at-risk (OARs) and anatomic motion. A radiobiological
model was developed to estimate clonogen survival fraction (SF), using 18F-fluoroazomycin arabinoside
PET (FAZA PET) images from ten patients with pancreatic cancer to quantify oxygen enhancement effects.
For each patient, four simulated five-fraction stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) plans were
generated: 1) a standard SBRT plan aiming to cover the planning target volume with 40 Gy, 2) dose painting
plans delivering escalated doses to FAZA-avid hypoxic sub-volumes, 3) dose painting plans with
simulated spacer separating the duodenum and pancreatic head, and 4), plans with integrated boosts
to geometric contractions of the tumour (GTV). All plans saturated at least one OAR dose limit. SF
was calculated for each plan and sensitivity of SF to simulated hypoxia quantification errors was
evaluated. Dose painting resulted in a 55% reduction in SF as compared to standard SBRT; 78% with
spacer. Integrated boosts to hypoxia-blind geometric contractions resulted in a 41% reduction
in SF. The reduction in SF for dose-painting plans persisted for all hypoxia quantification parameters
studied, including registration and rigid motion errors that resulted in shifts and rotations
of the GTV and hypoxic sub-volumes by as much as 1 cm and 10 degrees. Although proximity to OARs ultimately
limited dose escalation, with estimated SFs (~10^-5) well above levels required to completely
ablate a ~10 cm^3 tumour, dose painting robustly reduced clonogen survival when accounting for
expected treatment and imaging uncertainties and thus, may improve local response and associated
morbidity.

In recent publications, the construction of explicit symplectic integrators for Schwarzschild
and Kerr type spacetimes is based on splitting and composition methods for numerical integrations
of Hamiltonians or time-transformed Hamiltonians associated with these spacetimes. Such splittings
are not unique but have various choices. A Hamiltonian describing the motion of charged particles
around the Schwarzschild black hole with an external magnetic field can be separated into three,
four and five explicitly integrable parts. It is shown through numerical tests of regular and chaotic
orbits that the three-part splitting method is the best one of the three Hamiltonian splitting methods
in accuracy. In the three-part splitting, optimized fourth-order partitioned Runge-Kutta and
Runge-Kutta-Nystr\"{o}m explicit symplectic integrators exhibit the best accuracies. In fact,
they are several orders of magnitude better than the fourth-order Yoshida algorithms for appropriate
time steps. The former algorithms need small additional computational cost compared with the latter
ones. Optimized sixth-order partitioned Runge-Kutta and Runge-Kutta-Nystr\"{o}m explicit
symplectic integrators have no dramatic advantages over the optimized fourth-order ones in accuracies
during long-term integrations due to roundoff errors. The idea finding the integrators with the
best performance is also suitable for Hamiltonians or time-transformed Hamiltonians of other
curved spacetimes including the Kerr type spacetimes. When the numbers of explicitly integrable
splitting sub-Hamiltonians are as small as possible, such splitting Hamiltonian methods would
bring better accuracies. In this case, the optimized fourth-order partitioned Runge-Kutta and
Runge-Kutta-Nystr\"{o}m methods are worth recommending.

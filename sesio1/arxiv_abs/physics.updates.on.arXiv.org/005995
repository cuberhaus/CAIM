A critical step in the analysis of N-dimensional data from many different types of experiments is
the identification of shapes as defined by a relevant theory. Examples include multi-dimensional
molecular spectra, in which one must identify peaks consistent with electromagnetic resonance;
optical microscopy images, in which one must locate point emitters governed by diffraction; and
electrostatic potential maps, in which one must find perturbations corresponding to electron
scattering. While identifying such features involves determining if the overall shape of the data
is consistent with the shape defined by the theory, it is generally unclear how to quantitatively
make such a determination. In practice, many analysis methods use subjective, heuristic approaches,
which complicate the validation of any ensuing results results - especially as the amount and dimensionality
of the data increase. Here, we present a probabilistic solution to this problem by demonstrating
how to calculate the shape of arrayed experimental data. In this approach, Bayes' rule is used to
calculate the probability that the data is organized according to any one of several model shapes
defined by appropriate theories or other experiments (i.e., templates). We discuss how this ability
to probabilistically calculate shapes may be used to: (i) quantitatively compare how well different
theories describe a dataset, (ii) detect changes in experimental data, and (iii) identify and localize
features within experimental data in a generalizable and objective manner using a shape searching
method we call Bayesian Inference-based Template Search (BITS). Altogether, this framework can
be employed for a wide range of experimental techniques across the physical and life sciences, and
represents an entirely new approach by which many forms of experimental data may be evaluated and
analyzed.

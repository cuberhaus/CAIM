In this work, a methodology is proposed for formulating general dynamical equations in mechanics
under the umbrella of the principle of energy conservation. It is shown that Lagrange's equation,
Hamilton's canonical equations, and Hamilton-Jacobi's equation are all formulated based on the
principle of energy conservation with a simple energy conservation equation, i.e., the rate of
kinetic and potential energy with time is equal to the rate of work with time done by external forces;
while D'Alembert's principle is a special case of the law of the conservation of energy, with either
the virtual displacements ('frozen' time) or the virtual displacement ('frozen' generalized
coordinates). It is argued that all of the formulations for characterizing the dynamical behaviors
of a system can be derived from the principle of energy conservation, and the principle of energy
conservation is an underlying guide for constructing mechanics in a broad sense. The proposed methodology
provides an efficient way to tackle the dynamical problems in general mechanics, including dissipation
continuum systems, especially for those with multi-physical field interactions and couplings.
It is pointed out that, on the contrary to the classical analytical mechanics, especially to existing
Hamiltonian mechanics, the physics essences of Hamilton's variational principle, Lagrange's
equation, and the Newtonian second law of motion, including their derivatives such as momentum
and angular momentum conservations, are the consequences of the law of conservation of energy.
In addition, our proposed methodology is easier to understand with clear physical meanings and
can be used for explaining the existing mechanical principles or theorems. Finally, as an application
example, the methodology is applied in fluid mechanics to derive Cauchy's first law of motion.

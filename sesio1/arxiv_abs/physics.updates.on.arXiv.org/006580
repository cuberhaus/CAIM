We show that the Fukagata et al. (2002)'s identity for free-stream boundary layers simplifies to
the von Karman momentum integral equation relating the skin-friction coefficient and the momentum
thickness when the upper bound in the integrals used to obtain the identity is taken to be asymptotically
large. If a finite upper bound is used, the terms of the identity depend spuriously on the bound itself.
Differently from channel and pipe flows, the impact of the Reynolds stresses on the wall-shear stress
cannot be quantified in the case of free-stream boundary layers because the Reynolds stresses disappear
from the identity. The infinite number of alternative identities obtained by performing additional
integrations on the streamwise momentum equation also all simplify to the von Karman equation.
Analogous identities are found for channel flows, where the relative influence of the physical
terms on the wall-shear stress depends on the number of successive integrations, demonstrating
that the laminar and turbulent contributions to the skin-friction coefficient is only distinguished
in the original identity discovered by Fukagata et al. (2002). In the limit of large number of integrations,
these identities degenerate to the definition of skin-friction coefficient and a novel two-fold
integration identity is found for channel and pipe flows. In addition, we decompose the skin-friction
coefficient as the sum of the change of integral thicknesses with the streamwise direction, following
the study of Renard & Deck (2016). We utilize an energy thickness and an inertia thickness, which
is composed of a thickness related to the mean-flow wall-normal convection and a thickness linked
to the streamwise inhomogeneity of the mean streamwise velocity. The contributions of the different
terms of the streamwise momentum equation on the friction drag is thus quantified by these integral
thicknesses.

The brain's structural connectome supports signal propagation between neuronal elements, shaping
diverse coactivation patterns that can be captured as functional connectivity. While the link
between structure and function remains an ongoing challenge, the prevailing hypothesis is that
the structure-function relationship may itself be gradually decoupled along a macroscale functional
gradient spanning unimodal to transmodal regions. However, this hypothesis is strongly constrained
by the underlying models which may neglect requisite signaling mechanisms. Here, we transform
the structural connectome into a set of orthogonal eigenmodes governing frequency-specific diffusion
patterns and show that regional structure-function relationships vary markedly under different
signaling mechanisms. Specifically, low-frequency eigenmodes, which are considered sufficient
to capture the essence of the functional network, contribute little to functional connectivity
reconstruction in transmodal regions, resulting in structure-function decoupling along the
unimodal-transmodal gradient. In contrast, high-frequency eigenmodes, which are usually on
the periphery of attention due to their association with noisy and random dynamical patterns, contribute
significantly to functional connectivity prediction in transmodal regions, inducing gradually
convergent structure-function relationships from unimodal to transmodal regions. Although
the information in high-frequency eigenmodes is weak and scattered, it effectively enhances the
structure-function correspondence by 35% in unimodal regions and 56% in transmodal regions. Altogether,
our findings suggest that the structure-function divergence in transmodal areas may not be an intrinsic
property of brain organization, but can be narrowed through multiplexed and regionally specialized
signaling mechanisms.

The laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) of aluminium alloys is associated with numerous challenges when
compared to other commonly used alloys due to their higher reflectivity and thermal conductivity.
In this work, processing diagrams, temperature prediction models, X-ray computed tomography,
and metallography are used for establishing criteria in process parameter optimization of high
reflectivity aluminium alloys based on AlSi$_{10}$Mg response in using 57 different process parameter
combinations -- 21 using a focused Gaussian laser beam and 36 using divergent beams. For LPBF systems
with focused beam diameters $<$100 \textmu m, divergent beams obtained by defocusing to a position
above the LPBF build plate primarily lead to conduction mode melt pools, while a focused beam leads
to transition and keyhole mode melt pools. Conduction mode melting helps in avoiding keyhole mode
defects, resulting in parts with densities >99.98\%, with effectively no porous defects in the
subsurface regions. Additionally, an analytical model guided selection of laser power and velocity
settings for a focused beam help in stabilizing melt pool and spatter dynamics in the transition
melting mode thereby enabling a potential to obtain density values close to conduction mode densities
($\sim$99.98\%). A dimensionless keyhole number (Ke) was derived in this work to identify distinct
regions of conduction (Ke of 0-12), transition (Ke of 12-20), and keyhole (Ke $>$ 20) mode melting
during LPBF of AlSi$_{10}$Mg. A melt pool aspect ratio (ratio of melt pool depth to width) of $\sim$0.4
is observed to be the threshold between conduction and transition/keyhole mode melt pools for AlSi$_{10}$Mg,
different from the conventionally assumed 0.5. Lastly, inferred laser absorptivity values (from
melt pool measurements) of transition/keyhole mode melt pools are observed to >40\% higher when
compared to conduction mode melt pools

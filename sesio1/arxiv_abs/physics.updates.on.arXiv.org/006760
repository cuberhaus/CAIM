Relationship between mesoscopic structure of the nervous system and functions of individual neurons
is one of the major challenges of contemporary neuroscience. Formation of structurally connected
modules of neurons is believed to facilitate the conversion from single cells firing to large-scale
behaviour of an organism, highlighting importance of their accurate profiling in the data. While
connectomes are typically characterized by significant sparsity of neuronal connections, recent
advances in the network theory and machine learning have revealed fundamental limitations of traditionally
used community detection approaches in cases when the network is sparse. Here we study the optimal
community structure in the structural connectome of \textit{C.elegans}, for which we exploit
a non-conventional approach that is based on non-backtracking random walks allowing us to circumvent
the curse of sparsity. In full agreement with the previous asymptotic results, we demonstrate that
non-backtracking walks resolve the true cluster profile on stochastic block model (SBM) networks
of similar size and density better than spectral methods related to Markovian random walks. Based
on the cluster detectability threshold we determine the optimal number of modules (seven) in the
connectome of \textit{C.elegans}, which, surprisingly, provides the best agreement with partitioning
into anatomic regions (so-called ganglia). The found communities have strong interpretability
in terms of their functional role, which has allowed us to dissect three groups of structural clusters
in worm: brain, movement controller and information flow connector. Thus, our work provides a robust
network-based framework to reveal structural modules in sparse connectome data, which might be
further used to unravel fundamental relationship between mesoscopic organisation of the neurons
and organism behavior.

Evolution of the nonequilibrium thermodynamic entities corresponding to dynamics of the Hopf
instabilities and traveling waves at a nonequilibrium steady state of a spatially extended glycolysis
model is assessed here by implementing an analytically tractable scheme incorporating a complex
Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGLE). In the presence of self and cross diffusion, a more general amplitude
equation exploiting the multiscale Krylov-Bogoliubov averaging method serves as an essential
tool to reveal the various dynamical instability criteria, especially Benjamin-Feir (BF) instability,
to estimate the corresponding nonlinear dispersion relation of the traveling wave pattern. The
critical control parameter, wave-number selection criteria, and magnitude of the complex amplitude
for traveling waves are modified by self- and cross-diffusion coefficients within the oscillatory
regime, and their variabilities are exhibited against the amplitude equation. Unlike the traveling
waves, a low-amplitude broad region appears for the Hopf instability in the concentration dynamics
as the system phase passes through minima during its variation with the control parameter. The total
entropy production rate of the uniform Hopf oscillation and glycolysis wave not only qualitatively
reflects the global dynamics of concentrations of intermediate species but almost quantitatively.
Despite the crucial role of diffusion in generating and shaping the traveling waves, the diffusive
part of the entropy production rate has a negligible contribution to the system's total entropy
production rate. The Hopf instability shows a more complex and colossal change in the energy profile
of the open nonlinear system than in the traveling waves. A detailed analysis of BF instability shows
a contrary nature of the semigrand Gibbs free energy with discrete and continuous wave numbers for
the traveling wave.

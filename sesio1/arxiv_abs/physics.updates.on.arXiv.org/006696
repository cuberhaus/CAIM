The silicon nitride integration platform has been successful at realizing extremely low waveguide
losses across the visible to infrared and components including high performance lasers, filters,
resonators, stabilization cavities, and optical frequency combs. Yet, progress towards implementing
low loss, low power modulators in the silicon nitride platform, while maintaining the planar, wafer-scale
process compatibility has been limited. Here we report a significant advance in integration of
a piezo-electric (PZT) actuated micro-ring modulation in a fully-planar, wafer-scale silicon
nitride platform, that maintains low optical loss (0.03 dB/cm in a 625 um resonator) at 1550 nm, with
an order of magnitude increase in bandwidth (DC to 20 MHz 3-dB) and order of magnitude lower power
consumption of 20 nW improvement over prior PZT modulators. The modulator provides a >14 dB ER and
7.1 million Q over the entire 4 GHz tuning range, a tuning efficiency of 200 MHz/V, and delivers the
linearity required for control applications with 65.1 dBHz2/3 and 73.8 dBHz2/3 IMD3 SFDR at 1 MHz
and 10 MHz respectively. We demonstrate two control applications, laser stabilization in a PDH
lock loop, reducing laser frequency noise by 40 dB, and as a laser carrier tracking filter. This PZT
modulator design can be extended to the visible in the ultra-low loss silicon nitride platform with
minor waveguide design changes. This integration of PZT modulation in the ultra-low loss silicon
nitride waveguide platform enables modulator control functions in a wide range of visible to IR
applications such as atomic and molecular transition locking for cooling, controllable optical
frequency combs, low-power external cavity tunable lasers, atomic clocks, and tunable ultra-low
linewidth lasers and ultra-low phase noise microwave synthesizers.

The $\mathbb{C}^{\wedge 18}$ analogue model contains counterparts to the full particle spectrum
and interactions of the Standard Model, and has only three tunable parameters. As the structure
of this model is highly constrained, predictive relationships between its counterparts to the
constants of the Standard Model may be obtained. In Parts IV-VI, the model values for the masses of
the tau, the $W$ and $Z$ bosons, and a Higgs-like scalar boson are calculated as functions of $\alpha$,
$m_e$, and $m_\mu$. They are shown to be $1.776866734(44)$ GeV/$c^2$, $80.3785(22)$ GeV/$c^2$,
$91.1876(35)$ GeV/$c^2$, and $125.2500(49)$ GeV/$c^2$ respectively, with no free fitting parameters.
All are within $0.1\,\sigma$ or better of the corresponding observed values of $1.77686(12)$ GeV/$c^2$,
$80.379(12)$ GeV/$c^2$, $91.1876(21)$ GeV/$c^2$, and $125.25(17)$ GeV/$c^2$. In Part VII the
final ungauged freedom of the $\mathbb{C}^{\wedge 18}$ model is used to eliminate the right-handed
weak interaction, while simultaneously introducing space--time curvature, and a gravitational
interaction which emulates general relativity in experimentally observed regimes. The model
is then predictive of the value of Newton's constant, yielding $G_N=6.67432(230)\times 10^{-11}~\mathrm{m}^3\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\mathrm{s}^{-2}$.
Although the error bars on this calculated value are quite large, the central value is in agreement
with the observed value of $G_N=6.67430(15)\times 10^{-11}~\mathrm{m}^3\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\mathrm{s}^{-2}$
to a precision of $0.12\,\sigma_\mathrm{exp}$. This consistency with experiment suggests the
existence of a unifying relationship between lepton generations and the electroweak mass scale.
In the Classical Analogue to the Standard Model this arises from an underlying construction from
coloured preons. The low-energy residual of the preon binding interactions corresponds to the
strong nuclear force.

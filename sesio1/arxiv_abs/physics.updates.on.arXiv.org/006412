We present two novel Volume-of-Solid (VoS) formulations for micro-continuum simulation of mineral
dissolution at the pore-scale. The traditional VoS formulation (VoS-psi) uses a diffuse interface
localization function psi to ensure stability and limit diffusion of the reactive surface. The
main limitation of this formulation is that accuracy is strongly dependent on the choice of the localization
function. Our first novel improved formulation (iVoS) uses the divergence of a reactive flux to
localize the reaction at the fluid-solid interface, so no localization function is required. Our
second novel formulation (VoS-psi') uses a localization function with a parameter that is fitted
to ensure that the reactive surface area is conserved globally. Both novel methods are validated
by comparison with experiments, numerical simulations using an interface tracking method based
on the Arbitrary Eulerian Lagrangian (ALE) framework, and numerical simulations using the VoS-psi.
All numerical methods are implemented in GeoChemFoam, our reactive transport toolbox and three
benchmark test cases in both synthetic and real pore geometries are considered: (1) dissolution
of a calcite post by acid injection in a microchannel and experimental comparison, (2) dissolution
in a 2D polydisperse disc micromodel at different dissolution regimes and (3) dissolution in a Ketton
carbonate rock sample and comparison to \textit{in-situ} micro-CT experiments. We find that the
iVoS results match accurately experimental results and simulation results obtained with the ALE
method, while the VoS-psi method leads to inaccuracies that are mostly corrected by the VoS-psi'
formulation. In addition, the VoS methods are significantly faster than the ALE method, with a speed-up
factor of between 2 and 12.

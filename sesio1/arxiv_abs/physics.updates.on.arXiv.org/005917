Dense and efficient circuits with component sizes approaching the physical limit is the hallmark
of high performance integration. However, current fabrication technology is mostly constraint
to 2D lithography, and thermal energy dissipation induced by switching electronic signal lines
presents a fundamental challenge for truly 3D electronic integration. Photonics reduces this
problem, and direct laser writing of a photoresin is a promising high-resolution tool for 3D photonic
integration. Here, we combine one and two-photon polymerization (TPP) for waveguide integration
for the first time, dramatically accelerating the fabrication process and increasing optical
confinement. 3D additive printing is based on femtosecond TPP, while blanket irradiation with
a UV lamp induces one-photon polymerization (OPP) throughout the entire 3D chip. We locally and
dynamically adjust writing conditions to implement (3+1)D \emph{flash}-TPP: waveguide cores
are printed with a small distance between neighboring writing voxels to ensure smooth interfaces,
mechanical support structures are printed at maximal distance between the voxels to speed up the
process. Finally, the entire chip's \emph{passive} volume not part of waveguide cores or mechanical
support is polymerized in a single instance by UV blanket irradiation. This decouples fabrication
time from the passive volume's size. We succeed in printing vertical single-mode waveguides of
6~mm length that reach up to NA = 0.16. Noteworthy, we achieve exceptionally low -0.26 dB injection
and very low propagation losses of -1.36 dB/mm, which is within one order of magnitude of standard
integrated silicon photonics. Finally, the optical performance of our waveguides does not deteriorate
during 120 days within our measurement uncertainty.

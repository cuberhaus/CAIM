Purpose: Several inverse planning algorithms have been developed for Gamma Knife (GK) radiosurgery
to determine a large number of plan parameters via solving an optimization problem, which typically
consists of multiple objectives. The priorities among these objectives need to be repetitively
adjusted to achieve a clinically good plan for each patient. This study aimed to achieve automatic
and intelligent priority-tuning, by developing a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based method
to model the tuning behaviors of human planners. Methods: We built a priority-tuning policy network
using deep convolutional neural networks. Its input was a vector composed of the plan metrics that
were used in our institution for GK plan evaluation. The network can determine which tuning action
to take, based on the observed quality of the intermediate plan. We trained the network using an end-to-end
DRL framework to approximate the optimal action-value function. A scoring function was designed
to measure the plan quality. Results: Vestibular schwannoma was chosen as the test bed in this study.
The number of training, validation and testing cases were 5, 5, and 16, respectively. For these three
datasets, the average plan scores with initial priorities were 3.63 $\pm$ 1.34, 3.83 $\pm$ 0.86
and 4.20 $\pm$ 0.78, respectively, while can be improved to 5.28 $\pm$ 0.23, 4.97 $\pm$ 0.44 and 5.22
$\pm$ 0.26 through manual priority tuning by human expert planners. Our network achieved competitive
results with 5.42 $\pm$ 0.11, 5.10 $\pm$ 0. 42, 5.28 $\pm$ 0.20, respectively. Conclusions: Our
network can generate GK plans of comparable or slightly higher quality comparing with the plans
generated by human planners via manual priority tuning. The network can potentially be incorporated
into the clinical workflow to improve GK planning efficiency.

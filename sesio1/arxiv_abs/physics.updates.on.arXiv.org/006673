The use of drugs or radiation to attack cancerous cells often leaves the treatment material within
the body where it could affect healthy cells or damages healthy tissue; as is the case with traditional
invasive surgery. An alternative approach is the creation of a nano machine that is directed to its
target (the cancerous tissue), then activated to engage cancerous cells and "surgically" induce
controlled apoptosis. A magneto-mechanical device composed of nanomagnets that potentially
meets this objective is thus predicated. The magnetic particles must be bio-functionalised for
"in-body" use where their uniqueness allows precise tracking and manipulation. In order to bio-functionalize
magnetic particles they have to be embedded in a biocompatible coating or shell. Even enclosed within
a biological entity the application of magnetic field gradients result in significant forces acting
upon the magnetic particles. As such, single domain, ferromagnetic particles can be used inside
the body for a number of applications. The lack of naturally occurring ferromagnetic particles
inside the human body allows the bio-functionalized particles to be detectable, without the interference
of noise from the host environment. Therefore, it is of paramount importance, for medical applications,
to understand exactly how the magnetic particles will respond to a magnetic field gradient. Accordingly,
the magnetic response of a system of four interacting magnetic particles is examined and it is shown
that such a system can be optimised for targeting cancer cells and performing nano-surgical operations.
The range of magnetic field required for such nano-medical applications is specified and the connection
of these applications to different phase transitions arising in the magnetic field is described.

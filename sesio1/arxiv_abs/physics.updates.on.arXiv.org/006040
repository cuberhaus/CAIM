Graphite-moderated nuclear reactors have already produced more than 250000 tons of irradiated
nuclear graphite, or i-graphite, world-wide. The sustainability of this technology relies on
the end-of-life management of its moderator, which is activated into a long-lived nuclear waste,
by neutron fluxes, during operating time. In particular, C14 is created. Nuclear transmutation,
enabled by laser-driven particle acceleration, has been envisioned as a potential novel treatment
scheme for long-lived nuclear waste. By triggering controlled nuclear reactions with energetic
particles, long-lived radionuclides could be transformed into stable isotopes. Such a system
could treat the C14 nuclei trapped within the i-graphite matrix, which is difficult to isolate by
other means. This work performs a quantitative preliminary study of this transmutation scheme,
in order to assess its feasibility at an industrial scale. The method used can be transposed to assess
any transmutation scheme using a beam of particles directly sent on the material to be treated. First,
a nuclear interaction channel which transmutes C14 nuclei without creating new long-lived radionuclides
is identified. It consists in the choice of a type of particle, among which protons, gamma photons
and neutrons can all be accelerated by laser-matter interaction; and it is completed by the adequate
energy at which this particle must be sent on i-graphite. To that end, the nuclear cross-sections
of C12, C13 and C14 are reviewed, neglecting other impurities in i-graphite. Then, based on the interaction
channel identification, the energy cost of this scheme is estimated. Protons between 1 and 5 MeV
make it possible to transmute C14 without creating any new long-lived activity. However, our result
show that, even in this favorable reaction channel, the transmutation energy cost is too high for
an i-graphite transmutation scheme to be feasible.

Switchbacks -- rapid, large deflections of the solar wind's magnetic field -- have generated significant
interest as possible signatures of the key mechanisms that heat the corona and accelerate the solar
wind. In this context, an important task for theories of switchback formation and evolution is to
understand their observable distinguishing features, allowing them to be assessed in detail using
spacecraft data. Here, we work towards this goal by studying the influence of the Parker spiral on
the evolution of Alfv\'enic switchbacks in an expanding plasma. Using simple analytic arguments
based on the physics of one-dimensional spherically polarized (constant-field-magnitude) Alfv\'en
waves, we find that, by controlling the wave's obliquity, a Parker spiral strongly impacts switchback
properties. Surprisingly, the Parker spiral can significantly enhance switchback formation,
despite normalized wave amplitudes growing more slowly in its presence. In addition, switchbacks
become strongly asymmetric: large switchbacks preferentially involve magnetic-field rotation
in the plane of the Parker spiral (tangential deflections) rather than perpendicular (normal)
rotations, and such deflections are strongly "tangentially skewed," meaning switchbacks always
involve field rotations in the same direction (towards the positive-radial direction for an outwards
mean field). In a companion paper, we show that these properties also occur in turbulent 3-D fields
with switchbacks, with various caveats. These results demonstrate that substantial care is needed
in assuming that specific features of switchbacks can be used to infer properties of the low corona;
asymmetries and nontrivial correlations can develop as switchbacks propagate due to the interplay
between expansion and spherically polarized, divergence-free magnetic fields.

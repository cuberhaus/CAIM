Complete time of flight (TOF) sinograms of state-of-the-art TOF PET scanners have a large memory
footprint. Currently, they contain ~4e9 data bins which amount to ~17GB in 32bit floating point
precision. Using iterative algorithms to reconstruct such enormous TOF sinograms becomes increasingly
challenging due to the memory requirements and the computation time needed to evaluate the forward
model for every data bin. This is especially true for more advanced optimization algorithms such
as the SPDHG algorithm which allows for the use of non-smooth priors using subsets with guaranteed
convergence. SPDHG requires the storage of additional sinograms in memory, which severely limits
its application to data sets from state-of-the-art TOF PET systems. Motivated by the generally
sparse nature of the TOF sinograms, we propose and analyze a new listmode (LM) extension of the SPDHG
algorithm for reconstruction of sparse data following a Poisson distribution. The new algorithm
is evaluated based on 2D and 3D simulations, and a real dataset acquired on a recent TOF PET/CT system.
The performance of the newly proposed LM SPDHG algorithm is compared against the conventional sinogram
SPDHG and the listmode EM-TV algorithm. We show that the speed of convergence of LM-SPDHG is equivalent
the original SPDHG using binned data. However, we find that for a TOF PET system with 400ps TOF resolution,
LM-SPDHG reduces the required memory from ~56GB to 0.7GB for a short dynamic frame with 1e7 counts
and to 12.4GB for a long static acquisition with 5e8 counts. In contrast to SPDHG, the reduced memory
requirements of LM-SPDHG enable a pure GPU implementation on state-of-the-art GPUs which will
substantially accelerate reconstruction times. This in turn will allow the application of LM-SPDHG
in routine clinical practice where short reconstruction times are crucial.

Considering evolution of rotation sensing and timing applications realized in Micro-electro-mechanical
systems (MEMS), flexural mode resonant shapes are outperformed by bulk acoustic wave (BAW) counterparts
by achieving higher frequencies with both electrostatic and piezoelectric transduction. Within
the 1-30 MHz range, which hosts BAW gyroscopes and timing references, piezoelectric and electrostatic
MEMS have similar transduction efficiency. Although, when designed intelligently, electrostatic
transduction allows self-alignment between electrodes and the resonator for various BAW modes,
misalignment is inevitable regarding piezoelectric transduction of BAW modes that require electrode
patterning. In this paper transverse piezoelectric actuation of [011] oriented single crystal
lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate (PMN-PT) thin film disks is shown to excite the tangential
mode and family of elliptical compound resonant modes, utilizing a self-aligned and unpatterned
electrode that spans the entire disk surface. The resonant mode coupling is achieved employing
a unique property of [011] PMN-PT, where the in-plane piezoelectric coefficients have opposite
sign. Fabricating 1-port disk transducers, RF reflection measurements are performed that demonstrate
the compound mode family shapes in 1-30 MHz range. Independent verification of mode transduction
is achieved using in-plane displacement measurements with Polytec's Laser Doppler Vibrometer
(LDV). While tangential mode achieves 40$^o$/sec dithering rate at 335 kHz resonant frequency,
the n=2 wine-glass mode achieves 11.46 nm tip displacement at 8.42 MHz resonant frequency on a radius
of 60 $\mu $m disk resonator in air. A single electrode resonator that can excite both tangential
and wine-glass modes with such metrics lays the foundation for a BAW MEMS gyroscope with a built-in
primary calibration stage.

Spectroscopic x-ray detectors (SXDs) are poised to play a substantial role in the next generation
of medical x-ray imaging. Evaluating their performance in terms of the detective quantum efficiency
(DQE) requires normalization of the frequency-dependent signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by that
of an ideal SXD. We provide mathematical expressions of the SNR of ideal SXDs for quantification
and detection tasks and tabulate their numeric values for standardized tasks. We propose using
standardized RQA-series x-ray spectra. We define ideal SXDs as those that (1) have an infinite number
of infinitesimal energy bins, (2) do not distort the incident distribution of x-ray photons in the
spatial or energy domains, and (3) do not decrease the frequency-dependent SNR of the incident distribution
of x-ray quanta. We derive analytic expressions for the noise power spectrum (NPS) of such ideal
detectors for detection and quantification tasks. We tabulate the NPS of ideal SXDs for RQA x-ray
spectra for detection and quantification of aluminum, PMMA, iodine, and gadolinium basis materials.
Our analysis shows that a single matrix determines the noise power of ideal SXDs in detection and
quantification tasks, including basis material decomposition and line-integral estimation
for pseudo-mono-energetic imaging. This NPS matrix is determined by the x-ray spectrum incident
on the detector and the mass-attenuation coefficients of the set of basis materials. Combining
existing tabulated values of the mass-attenuation coefficients of basis materials with standardized
RQA x-ray spectra enabled tabulating numeric values of the NPS matrix for selected spectra and tasks.
The numeric values and mathematical expressions of the NPS of ideal SXDs reported here can be used
to normalize measurements of the frequency-dependent SNR of SXDs for experimental study of the
task-dependent DQE.

Richard P. Feynman's work on gravitation, as can be inferred from several published and unpublished
sources, is reviewed. Feynman was involved with this subject at least from late 1954 to the late 1960s,
giving several pivotal contributions to it. Even though he published only three papers, much more
material is available, beginning with the records of his many interventions at the Chapel Hill conference
in 1957, which are here analyzed in detail, and show that he had already considerably developed his
ideas on gravity. In addition he expressed deep thoughts about fundamental issues in quantum mechanics
which were suggested by the problem of quantum gravity, such as superpositions of the wave functions
of macroscopic objects and the role of the observer. Feynman also lectured on gravity several times.
Besides the famous lectures given at Caltech in 1962-63, he extensively discussed this subject
in a series of lectures delivered at the Hughes Aircraft Company in 1966-67, whose focus was on astronomy
and astrophysics. All this material allows to reconstruct a detailed picture of Feynman's ideas
on gravity and of their evolution until the late sixties. According to him, gravity, like electromagnetism,
has quantum foundations, therefore general relativity has to be regarded as the classical limit
of an underlying quantum theory; this quantum theory should be investigated by computing physical
processes, as if they were experimentally accessible. The same attitude is shown with respect to
gravitational waves, as is evident also from an unpublished letter addressed to Victor F. Weisskopf.
In addition, an original approach to gravity, which closely mimics (and probably was inspired by)
the derivation of the Maxwell equations given by Feynman in that period, is sketched in the unpublished
Hughes lectures.

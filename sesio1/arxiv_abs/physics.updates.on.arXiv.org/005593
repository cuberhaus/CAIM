Emanuel's concept of maximum potential intensity (E-PI) estimates the maximum velocity of tropical
cyclones from environmental parameters. At the point of maximum wind, E-PI's key equation relates
proportionally the centrifugal acceleration (squared maximum velocity divided by radius) to
the radial gradient of saturated moist entropy. The proportionality coefficient depends on the
outflow temperature. Here it is shown that a different relationship between the same quantities
derives straightforwardly from the gradient-wind balance and the definition of entropy, with
the proportionality coefficient depending on the radial gradient of local air temperature. The
robust alternative reveals a previously unexplored constraint: for E-PI to be valid, the the outflow
temperature should be a function of the radial temperature gradient at the point of maximum wind.
When the air is horizontally isothermal (which, as we argue, is not an uncommon condition), this
constraint cannot be satisfied, and E-PI's key equation underestimates the squared maximum velocity
by approximately twofold. This explains "superintensity" (maximum wind speeds exceeding E-PI).
The new formulation predicts less superintensity at higher temperatures, corroborating recent
numerical simulations. Previous analyses are re-evaluated to reveal inconsistent support for
the explanation of superintensity by supergradient winds alone. In Hurricane Isabel 2003, maximum
superintensity is found to be associated with minimal gradient-wind imbalance. Modified to diagnostically
account for supergradient winds, the new formulation shows that air temperature increasing towards
the storm center can mask the effect of gradient-wind imbalance, thus reducing "superintensity"
and formally bringing E-PI closer to observations. The implications of these findings for assessing
real storms are discussed.

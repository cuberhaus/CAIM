Corner-shared ABX$_3$ perovskites have long featured prominently in solid-state chemistry and
condensed matter physics. Still, the joint understanding of their two main subgroups-halides
and oxides-has not been fully developed. Indeed, unlike the case that compounds having a single
repeated motif ("monomorphous"), certain cubic perovskites can manifest a non-thermal distribution
of local motifs ("polymorphous networks"). Such intrinsic deformations can include positional
degrees of freedom. Unlike thermal motion, such intrinsic distortions do not time-average to zero.
The present study compares electronic structure features of oxide and halide perovskites starting
from the intrinsic polymorphous network described by DFT minimization of the internal energy,
continuing to finite temperature thermal disorder using AIMD. We find that (i) different oxide
vs. halide ABX$_3$ compounds adopt different energy-lowering distortion modes. The DFT calculated
pair distribution function (PDF) of SrTiO$_3$ agrees with the recently measured PDF. (ii) In both
oxides and halides, such intrinsic distortions lead to bandgap blueshifts with respect to monomorphous
structure. (iii) For oxide perovskites, high-temperature AIMD simulations initiated from the
polymorphous structures reveal that the thermally-induced distortions can lead to a bandgap redshift.
(iv) In contrast, for cubic CsPbI$_3$, both the intrinsic distortions and the thermal distortions
contribute in tandem to bandgap blueshift, the former, intrinsic effect being dominant. (v) In
the oxide SrTiO$_3$ and CaTiO$_3$ (but not in halide), octahedral tilting leads to the emergence
of a distinct $\Gamma$-$\Gamma$ direct bandgap component as a secondary valley minimum to the well-known
indirect R-$\Gamma$ gap. Understanding such intrinsic vs. thermal effects on oxide vs. halide
perovskites holds the potential for designing target electronic properties.

Although typically possessing four limbs and short bodies, lizards have evolved a diversity of
body plans, from short-bodied and fully-limbed to elongate and nearly limbless. Such diversity
in body morphology is hypothesized as adaptations to locomotion cluttered terrestrial environments,
but the mode of propulsion -- e.g., the use of body and/or limbs to interact with the substrate -- and
potential body/limb coordination remain unstudied. Here, we use biological experiments, a geometric
theory of locomotion, and robophysical experiments to comparatively and systematically investigate
such dynamics in a diverse sample of lizard morphologies. Locomotor field studies in short-limb,
elongated lizards (Brachymeles) and laboratory studies of full-limbed lizards (Uma scoparia
and Sceloporus olivaceus) and a limbless laterally undulating organism (Chionactis occipitalis)
reveal that the body wave dynamics can be described by a combination of traveling and standing waves;
the ratio of the amplitudes of these components is inversely related to limb length. We use geometric
theory to analyze and explain the wave dynamics and body-leg coordination observations; the theory
predicts that leg thrust modulates the body weight distribution and self-propulsion generation
mechanism, which in turn facilitates the choice of body waves. We test our hypothesis in biological
experiments by inducing the use of traveling wave in stereotyped lizards by modulating the ground
penetration resistance, as well as in controlled non-biological experiments involving an undulating
limbed robophysical model. Our models could be valuable in understanding functional constraints
on the evolutionary process of elongation and limb reduction in lizards, as well as advancing robot
designs.

It is well known that the fluid-particle acceleration is intimately related to the dissipation
rate of turbulence, in line with the Kolmogorov assumptions. On the other hand, various experimental
and numerical works have reported as well its dependence on the kinetic energy. The analyses given
in this paper focus on statistics of the fluid-particle acceleration conditioned on both the local
dissipation rate and the kinetic energy. It is shown that this quantity presents an exponential
dependence on the kinetic energy, in addition to the expected power law behavior with the dissipation
rate. The exponential growth, which clearly departs from the previous propositions, reflects
the additive nature of the kinetic energy, and gives the possibility to see the acceleration as a
multiplicative cascade process integrating the effects of sweeps by the flow structures along
the fluid-particle trajectory. It is then proposed scaling laws for the Reynolds number dependence
of the conditional and unconditional acceleration variance using Barenblatt's incomplete similarity
framework. On the basis of these observations, we introduce a vectorial stochastic model for the
dynamics of a tracer in turbulent flows. This model incorporates the non-Markovian log-normal
model for the dissipation rate recently proposed by L. Chevillard (Phys. Rev. E 2017), as well as
an additional hypothesis regarding non-diagonal terms in the diffusion tensor. This model is shown
to be in good agreement with direct numerical simulations and presents the essential characteristics
of the Lagrangian turbulence highlighted in recent years, namely (i) non-Gaussian PDF of acceleration,
(ii) scale separation between the norm of the acceleration and its components, (iii) anomalous
scaling law for the Lagrangian velocity spectra, and (iv) negative skewness of the power increments,
reflecting the temporal irreversibility.

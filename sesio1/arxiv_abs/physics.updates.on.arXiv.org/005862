Recent breakthroughs in thin-film lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI) have enabled low-loss photonic
integrated circuits (PICs) based on LiNbO3. Excellent physical properties together with commercial
availability have made this material extremely compelling for the photonics community. Low-voltage,
high-speed modulators, electro-optic frequency combs, and novel on-chip electro-optic devices
have been demonstrated, with applications ranging from microwave photonics to quantum interfaces.
Yet to date, LiNbO3 PICs have mostly been fabricated using highly specialized etching techniques
that are not part of the CMOS process and that lack the reproducibility and scalability exhibited
by, e.g., silicon photonics. The typically used ridge waveguides make input coupling inherently
inefficient and limit opportunities for hybrid integration. Widespread future application of
thin-film LiNbO3 requires a reliable and scalable solution using standard processing and precise
lithographic control. Here, we overcome the abovementioned challenges by employing wafer-scale
bonding of thin-film LiNbO3 with planarized Si3N4 PICs fabricated using the photonic Damascene
process. We demonstrate a scalable, high-yield LiNbO3 integrated photonic platform that maintains
the ultra-low propagation losses (< 0.1 dB/cm) of the underlying Si3N4 waveguides and that is compatible
with conventional CMOS photonics. We realize a variety of photonic devices on a single wafer, including
individual resonators with ultra-high quality factors (Q > 4 Mio), electro-optic frequency combs,
and voltage-tunable photonic dimers. We also perform nonlinear frequency conversion, enabling
carrier-envelope phase detection of a femtosecond laser. Importantly, the devices exhibit efficient
input coupling (18% fiber-to-fiber). Our hybrid platform thus provides a reliable, foundry-ready,
and low-loss approach to LiNbO3 integrated photonics.

Disordered nanostructures are commonly encountered in many nanophotonic systems, from colloid
dispersions for sensing, to heterostructured photocatalysts. Randomness, however, imposes
severe challenges for nanophotonics modeling, often constrained by the irregular geometry of
the scatterers involved or the stochastic nature of the problem itself. In this article, we resolve
this conundrum by presenting a universal theory of averaged light scattering of randomly oriented
objects. Specifically, we derive formulas of orientation-and-polarization-averaged absorption
cross section, scattering cross section and asymmetry parameter, for single or collection of objects
of arbitrary shape, that can be solved by any electromagnetic scattering method. These three parameters
can be directly integrated into traditional unpolarized radiative energy transfer modelling,
enabling a practical tool to predict multiple scattering and light transport in disordered nanostructured
materials. Notably, the formulas of average light scattering can be derived under the principles
of fluctuational electrodynamics, allowing analogous mathematical treatment to the methods
used in thermal radiation, non-equilibrium electromagnetic forces, and other associated phenomena.
The proposed modelling framework is validated against optical measurements of polymer composite
films with metal-oxide microcrystals. Our work sets a new paradigm in the theory of light scattering,
that may contribute to a better understanding of light-matter interactions in applications such
as, plasmonics for sensing and photothermal therapy, photocatalysts for water splitting and CO2
dissociation, photonic glasses for artificial structural colours, diffuse reflectors for radiative
cooling, to name just a few.

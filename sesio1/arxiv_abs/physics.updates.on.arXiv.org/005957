In this paper we study the Motter-Lai model of cascading failures induced by overloads in both isotropic
and anisotropic spatial networks, generated by placing nodes in a square lattice and using various
distributions of link lengths and angles. Anisotropy has not been earlier considered in the Motter-Lai
model and is a real feature that may affect the cascading failures. This could reflect the existence
of a preferred direction in which a given attribute of the system manifests, such as power lines that
follow a city built parallel to the coast. We show that the anisotropy causes a greater spread of damage
along the preferential direction of links. We also identify the critical linear size, $l_c$, for
a square shaped localized attack, which satisfies with high probability that above $l_c$ the cascading
disrupts the giant component of functional nodes, while below $l_c$ the damage does not spread.
We find that, for networks with any characteristic link length, their robustness decreases with
the strength of the anisotropy. We show that the value of $l_c$ is finite and independent of the system
size (for large systems), both for isotropic and anisotropic networks. Thus, in contrast to random
attacks, where the critical fraction of nodes that survive the initial attack, $p_c$, is usually
below 1, here $p_c = 1$. Note that the analogy to $p_c = 1$ is also found for localized attacks in interdependent
spatial networks. Finally, we measure the final distribution of functional cluster sizes and find
a power-law behavior, with exponents similar to regular percolation. This indicates that, after
the cascade which destroys the giant component, the system is at a percolation critical point. Additionally,
we observe a crossover in the value of the distribution exponent, from critical percolation in a
two-dimensional lattice for strong spatial embedding, to mean-field percolation for weak embedding.

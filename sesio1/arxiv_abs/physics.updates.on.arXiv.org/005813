A framework is introduced to compare moist `potential' temperatures. The equivalent potential
temperature, $\theta_e,$ the liquid water potential temperature, $\theta_\ell,$ and the entropy
potential temperature, $\theta_s$, are all shown to be potential temperatures, in the sense that
they measure the temperatures of certain reference state systems whose entropy is the same as that
of the air-parcel. They only differ in the choice of reference state composition: $\theta_\ell$
describes the temperature a condensate-free state, $\theta_e$ a vapor-free state, and $\theta_s$
a water-free state would require to have the same entropy as the given state. Although in this sense
$\theta_e,$ $\theta_\ell,$ and $\theta_s$ are all different flavors of the same thing, only $\theta_\ell$
satisfies the stricter definition of a `potential temperature', as corresponding to a reference
temperature accessible by an isentropic and closed transformation of a system in equilibrium;
both $\theta_e$ and $\theta_\ell$ measure the `relative' enthalpy of an air parcel at their respective
reference states; but only $\theta_s$ measures air-parcel entropy. None mix linearly, but all
do so approximately, and all reduce to the dry potential temperature, $\theta$ in the limit as the
water mass fraction goes to zero. As is well known, $\theta$ does mix linearly and inherits all the
favorable (entropic, enthalpic, and potential temperature) properties of its various -- but descriptively
less rich -- moist counterparts. All, involve quite complex expressions, but admit relatively
simple and useful approximations. Of the three moist `potential' temperatures, $\theta_s$ is
the least familiar, but the most well mixed in the broader tropics, a property that merits further
study as a possible basis for constraining mixing processes.

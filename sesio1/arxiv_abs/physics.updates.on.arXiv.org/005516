The behaviour of microscopic swimmers has previously been explored near large scale confining
geometries and in the presence of very small-scale surface roughness. Here we consider an intermediate
case of how a simple microswimmer, the tangential spherical squirmer, behaves adjacent to singly-
and doubly-periodic sinusoidal surface topographies that spatially oscillate with an amplitude
that is an order of magnitude less than the swimmer size and wavelengths within an order of magnitude
of this scale. The nearest neighbour regularised Stokeslet method is used for numerical explorations
after validating its accuracy for a spherical tangential squirmer that swims stably near a flat
surface. The same squirmer is then introduced to the different surface topographies. The key governing
factor in the resulting swimming behaviour is the size of the squirmer relative to the surface topography
wavelength. When the squirmer is much larger, or much smaller, than the surface topography wavelength
then directional guidance is not observed. Once the squirmer size is on the scale of the topography
wavelength limited guidance is possible, often with local capture in the topography troughs. However,
complex dynamics can also emerge, especially when the initial configuration is not close to alignment
along topography troughs or above topography crests. In contrast to sensitivity in alignment and
the topography wavelength, reductions in the amplitude of the surface topography or variations
in the shape of the periodic surface topography do not have extensive impacts on the squirmer behaviour.
Our findings more generally highlight that detailed numerical explorations are necessary to determine
how surface topographies may interact with a given swimmer that swims stably near a flat surface
and whether surface topographies may be designed to provide such swimmers with directional guidance.

Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) at cryogenic temperatures enable a wide range of applications
in scalable classical and quantum systems for computing and sensing. A promising application of
cryogenic PICs is to provide optical interconnects by up-converting signals from electrical to
optical domain, allowing massive data-transfer from 4 K superconducting (SC) electronics to room
temperature environment. Such a solution is central to overcome the major bottleneck in the scalability
of cryogenic systems, which currently rely on bulky copper cables that suffer from limited bandwidth,
large heat load, and do not show any scalability path. A key element for realizing a cryogenic-to-room
temperature optical interconnect is a high-speed electro-optic (EO) modulator operating at 4
K with operation voltage at mV scale, compatible with SC electronics. Although several cryogenic
EO modulators have been demonstrated, their driving voltages are significantly large compared
to the mV scale voltage required for SC circuits. Here, we demonstrate a cryogenic modulator with
~10 mV peak-to-peak driving voltage and gigabits/sec data rate, with ultra-low electric and optical
energy consumptions of ~10.4 atto-joules/bit and ~213 femto-joules/bit, respectively. We achieve
this record performance by designing a compact optical ring resonator modulator in a heterogeneous
InP-on-Silicon platform, where we optimize a multi-quantum well layer of InAIGaAs to achieve a
strong EO effect at 4 K. Unlike other semiconductors such as silicon, our platform benefits from
the high-carrier mobility and minimal free carrier freezing of III-V compounds at low temperatures,
with moderate doping level and low loss (intrinsic resonator Q~272,000). These modulators can
pave the path for complex cryogenic photonic functionalities and massive data transmission between
cryogenic and room-temperature electronics.

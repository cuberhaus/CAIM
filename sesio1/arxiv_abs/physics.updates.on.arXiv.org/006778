Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are large scale eruptions observed close to the Sun. They are travelling
through the heliosphere and possibly interacting with the Earth environment creating interruptions
or even damaging new technology instruments. Most of the time their physical conditions (velocity,
density, pressure) are only measured in situ at one point in space, with no possibility to have information
on the variation of these parameters during their journey from Sun to Earth. Our aim is to understand
the evolution of internal physical parameters of a set of three particular fast halo CMEs. These
CMEs were launched between 15 and 18 July 2002. Surprisingly, the related interplanetary CMEs (ICMEs),
observed near Earth, have a low, and in one case even very low, plasma density. We use the EUropean
Heliosphere FORecasting Information Asset (EUHFORIA) model to simulate the propagation of the
CMEs in the background solar wind by placing virtual spacecraft along the Sun--Earth line. We set
up the initial conditions at 0.1 au, first with a cone model and then with a linear force free spheromak
model. A relatively good agreement between simulation results and observations concerning the
speed, density and arrival times of the ICMEs is obtained by adapting the initial CME parameters.
In particular, this is achieved by increasing the initial magnetic pressure so that a fast expansion
is induced in the inner heliosphere. This implied the develop First, we show that a magnetic configuration
with an out of force balance close to the Sun mitigates the EUHFORIA assumptions related to an initial
uniform velocity. Second, the over-expansion of the ejected magnetic configuration in the inner
heliosphere is one plausible origin for the low density observed in some ICMEs at 1 au. The in situ
observed very low density has a possible coronal origin of fast expansion for two of the three ICMEs.

HOLODEC, an airborne cloud particle imager, captures holographic images of a fixed volume of cloud
to characterize the types and sizes of cloud particles, such as water droplets and ice crystals.
Cloud particle properties include position, diameter, and shape. We present a hologram processing
algorithm, HolodecML, that utilizes a neural segmentation model, GPUs, and computational parallelization.
HolodecML is trained using synthetically generated holograms based on a model of the instrument,
and predicts masks around particles found within reconstructed images. From these masks, the position
and size of the detected particles can be characterized in three dimensions. In order to successfully
process real holograms, we find we must apply a series of image corrupting transformations and noise
to the synthetic images used in training. In this evaluation, HolodecML had comparable position
and size estimation performance to the standard processing method, but improved particle detection
by nearly 20\% on several thousand manually labeled HOLODEC images. However, the improvement only
occurred when image corruption was performed on the simulated images during training, thereby
mimicking non-ideal conditions in the actual probe. The trained model also learned to differentiate
artifacts and other impurities in the HOLODEC images from the particles, even though no such objects
were present in the training data set, while the standard processing method struggled to separate
particles from artifacts. The novelty of the training approach, which leveraged noise as a means
for parameterizing non-ideal aspects of the HOLODEC detector, could be applied in other domains
where the theoretical model is incapable of fully describing the real-world operation of the instrument
and accurate truth data required for supervised learning cannot be obtained from real-world observations.

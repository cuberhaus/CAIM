Magnetic reconnection is a ubiquitous astrophysical process that rapidly converts magnetic energy
into some combination of plasma flow energy, thermal energy, and non-thermal energetic particles,
including energetic electrons. Various reconnection acceleration mechanisms in different low-$\beta$
(plasma-to-magnetic pressure ratio) and collisionless environments have been proposed theoretically
and studied numerically, including first- and second-order Fermi acceleration, betatron acceleration,
parallel electric field acceleration along magnetic fields, and direct acceleration by the reconnection
electric field. However, none of them have been heretofore confirmed experimentally, as the direct
observation of non-thermal particle acceleration in laboratory experiments has been difficult
due to short Debye lengths for \textit{in-situ} measurements and short mean free paths for \textit{ex-situ}
measurements. Here we report the direct measurement of accelerated non-thermal electrons from
low-$\beta$ magnetically driven reconnection in experiments using a laser-powered capacitor
coil platform. We use kiloJoule lasers to drive parallel currents to reconnect MegaGauss-level
magnetic fields in a quasi-axisymmetric geometry. The angular dependence of the measured electron
energy spectrum and the resulting accelerated energies, supported by particle-in-cell simulations,
indicate that the mechanism of direct electric field acceleration by the out-of-plane reconnection
electric field is at work. Scaled energies using this mechanism show direct relevance to astrophysical
observations. Our results therefore validate one of the proposed acceleration mechanisms by reconnection,
and establish a new approach to study reconnection particle acceleration with laboratory experiments
in relevant regimes.

Adaptive radiation therapy (ART) could protect organs at risk (OARs) while maintain high dose coverage
to targets. However, there still lack efficient online patient QA methods. We aim to develop a clinically
relevant online patient quality assurance (QA) solution for ART using daily CT scans and electronic
portal imaging device (EPID)-based in vivo dosimetry. Ten patients with rectal cancer at our center
were included. Patients' daily CT scans and portal images were collected to generate reconstructed
3D dose distributions. Contours of targets and OARs were recontoured on these daily CT scans by a
clinician or an auto-segmentation algorithm, then dose-volume indices were calculated, and the
percent deviation of these indices to their original plans were determined. This deviation was
regarded as the metric for clinically relevant patient QA. The tolerance level was obtained using
a 95% interval of the QA metric distribution. These deviations could be further divided into anatomically
relevant or delivery relevant indicators for error source analysis. Finally, our QA solution was
validated on an additional six clinical patients. In rectal cancer, the lower and upper tolerance
of the QA metric for PTV {\Delta}D95 (%) were [-3.11%, 2.35%], and for PTV {\Delta}D2 (%) were [-0.78%,
3.23%]. In validation, the 68% for PTV {\Delta}D95 (%) and the 79% for PTV {\Delta}D2 ({%)of the 28
fractions are within tolerances of the QA metrics. By using four or more out-of-tolerance QA metrics
as an action level, there were 5 fractions (18%) have four or more out-of-tolerance QA metrics in
validation patient dataset. The online patient QA solution using daily CT scans and EPID-based
in vivo dosimetry is clinically feasible. Source of error analysis has the potential for distinguishing
sources of error and guiding ART for future treatments.

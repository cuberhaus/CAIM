The field of UHECRs (Ultra-High energy cosmic Rays) and the understanding of particle acceleration
in the cosmos, as a key ingredient to the behaviour of the most powerful sources in the universe, is
of outmost importance for astroparticle physics as well as for fundamental physics and will improve
our general understanding of the universe. The current main goals are to identify sources of UHECRs
and their composition. For this, increased statistics is required. A space-based detector for
UHECR research has the advantage of a very large exposure and a uniform coverage of the celestial
sphere. The aim of the JEM-EUSO program is to bring the study of UHECRs to space. The principle of observation
is based on the detection of UV light emitted by isotropic fluorescence of atmospheric nitrogen
excited by the Extensive Air Showers (EAS) in the Earth's atmosphere and forward-beamed Cherenkov
radiation reflected from the Earth's surface or dense cloud tops. In addition to the prime objective
of UHECR studies, JEMEUSO will do several secondary studies due to the instruments' unique capacity
of detecting very weak UV-signals with extreme time-resolution around 1 microsecond: meteors,
Transient Luminous Events (TLE), bioluminescence, maps of human generated UV-light, searches
for Strange Quark Matter (SQM) and high-energy neutrinos, and more. The JEM-EUSO program includes
several missions from ground (EUSO-TA), from stratospheric balloons (EUSO-Balloon, EUSO-SPB1,
EUSO-SPB2), and from space (TUS, Mini-EUSO) employing fluorescence detectors to demonstrate
the UHECR observation from space and prepare the large size missions K-EUSO and POEMMA. A review
of the current status of the program, the key results obtained so far by the different projects, and
the perspectives for the near future are presented.

A quantitative understanding of how cells interact with their extracellular matrix via molecular
bonds is fundamental for many important processes in cell biology and engineering. In these interactions,
the deformability of cells and matrix are usually comparable with that of the bonds, making their
rebinding events globally coupled with the deformation states of whole systems. Unfortunately,
this important principle is not realized or adopted in most conventional theoretical models for
analyzing cellular adhesions. In this study, we considered a new theoretical model of a cluster
of ligand-receptor bonds between two soft elastic bodies, in which the rebinding rates of ligands
to receptors are described, for the first time, by considering the deformation of the overall system
under the influence of bond distributions. On the basis of theory of continuum mechanics and statistical
mechanics, we obtained an elasticity-associated rebinding rate of open bonds in a closed analytical
form that highly depends on the binding states and distributions of all other bonds, as well as on
the overall deformation energy stored in the elastic bodies and all closed bonds. On the basis of
this elasticity-associated rebinding rate and by performing Monte Carlo simulations, we uncovered
new mechanisms underlying the adhesion stability of molecular bond clusters associated with deformable
elastic bodies. Moreover, we revealed that the rebinding processes of molecular bonds is not only
dependent on interfacial separation but is related to overall energy. This newly proposed rebinding
rate may substantially improve our understanding of how cells adapt to their microenvironments
by adjusting their mechanical properties through cytoskeleton remodeling and of how we can accurately
calibrate the measurements of adhesion strength of molecular bond clusters between soft media.

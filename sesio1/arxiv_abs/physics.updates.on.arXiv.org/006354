X-ray Compton spectroscopy is one of the few direct probes of the electron momentum distribution
of bulk materials in ambient and operando environments. We report high-resolution inelastic X-ray
scattering experiments with high momentum and energy transfer performed at a storage-ring-based
high-energy X-ray light source facility using an X-ray microcalorimeter detector. Compton profiles
were measured for lithium and cobalt oxide powders relevant to lithium-ion battery research. Spectroscopic
analysis of the measured Compton profiles shows high-sensitivity to the low-Z elements and oxidation
states. The lineshape analysis of the measured Compton profiles in comparison with computed Hartree-Fock
profiles is limited by the resolution of the energy-resolving semiconductor detector. We have
characterized an X-ray transition-edge sensor microcalorimeter detector for high-resolution
Compton scattering experiments using a bending magnet source at the Advanced Photon Source (APS)
with a double crystal monochromator providing monochromatic photon energies near 27.5 keV. The
momentum resolution below 0.16 atomic units was measured yielding an improvement of more than a
factor of 7 over a state-of-the-art silicon drift detector for the same scattering geometry. Furthermore,
the lineshapes of narrow valence and broad core electron profiles of sealed lithium metal were clearly
resolved using an X-ray microcalorimeter detector compared to smeared and broadened lineshapes
observed when using a silicon drift detector. High-resolution Compton scattering using the energy-resolving
detector shown here presents new opportunities for spatial imaging of electron momentum distributions
for a wide class of materials with applications ranging from electrochemistry to condensed matter
physics.

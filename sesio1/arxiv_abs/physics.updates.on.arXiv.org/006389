Aggregation of chemotactic bacteria under a unimodal distribution of chemical cues was investigated
by Monte Carlo simulation and asymptotic analysis based on a kinetic transport equation, which
considers an internal adaptation dynamics as well as a finite tumbling duration. It was found that
there exist two different regimes of the adaptation time, between which the effect of the adaptation
time on the aggregation behavior is reversed; that is, when the adaptation time is as small as the
running duration, the aggregation becomes increasingly steeper as the adaptation time increases,
while, when the adaptation time is as large as the diffusion time of the population density, the aggregation
becomes more diffusive as the adaptation time increases. Moreover, notably, the aggregation profile
becomes bimodal (volcano) at the large adaptation-time regime while it is always unimodal at the
small adaptation-time regime. The volcano effect occurs in such a way that the population of tumbling
cells considerably decreases in a diffusion layer which is created near the peak of the external
chemical cues due to the coupling of diffusion and internal adaptation of the bacteria. Two different
continuum-limit models are derived by the asymptotic analysis according to the scaling of the adaptation
time; that is, at the small adaptation-time regime, the Keller-Segel model while, at the large adaptation-time
regime, an extension of KS model, which involves both the internal variable and the tumbling duration.
Importantly, either of the models can accurately reproduce the MC results at each adaptation-time
regime, involving the volcano effect. Thus, we conclude that the coupling of diffusion, adaptation,
and finite tumbling duration is crucial for the volcano effect.

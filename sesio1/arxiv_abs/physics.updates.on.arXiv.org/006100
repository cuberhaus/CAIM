Myocardial infarction (MI) is the leading cause of mortality in the world that occurs due to a blockage
of the coronary arteries feeding the myocardium. An early diagnosis of MI and its localization can
mitigate the extent of myocardial damage by facilitating early therapeutic interventions. Following
the blockage of a coronary artery, the regional wall motion abnormality (RWMA) of the ischemic myocardial
segments is the earliest change to set in. Echocardiography is the fundamental tool to assess any
RWMA. Assessing the motion of the left ventricle (LV) wall only from a single echocardiography view
may lead to missing the diagnosis of MI as the RWMA may not be visible on that specific view. Therefore,
in this study, we propose to fuse apical 4-chamber (A4C) and apical 2-chamber (A2C) views in which
a total of 12 myocardial segments can be analyzed for MI detection. The proposed method first estimates
the motion of the LV wall by Active Polynomials (APs), which extract and track the endocardial boundary
to compute myocardial segment displacements. The features are extracted from the A4C and A2C view
displacements, which are concatenated and fed into the classifiers to detect MI. The main contributions
of this study are 1) creation of a new benchmark dataset by including both A4C and A2C views in a total
of 260 echocardiography recordings, which is publicly shared with the research community, 2) improving
the performance of the prior work of threshold-based APs by a Machine Learning based approach, and
3) a pioneer MI detection approach via multi-view echocardiography by fusing the information of
A4C and A2C views. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves 90.91% sensitivity
and 86.36% precision for MI detection over multi-view echocardiography.

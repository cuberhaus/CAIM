Since the discovery of electron-wave duality, electron scattering instrumentation has developed
into a powerful array of techniques for revealing the atomic structure of matter. Beyond detecting
local lattice variations in equilibrium structures, recent research efforts have been directed
towards the long sought-after dream of visualizing the dynamic evolution of matter in real-time.
The atomic behavior at ultrafast timescales carries critical information on phase transition
and chemical reaction dynamics, the coupling of electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom in materials
and molecules, the correlation between structure, function and previously hidden metastable
or nonequilibrium states of matter. Ultrafast electron pulses play an essential role in this scientific
endeavor, and their generation has been facilitated by rapid technical advances in both ultrafast
laser and particle accelerator technologies. This review presents a summary of the remarkable
developments in this field over the last few decades. The physics and technology of ultrafast electron
beams is presented with an emphasis on the figures of merit most relevant for ultrafast electron
diffraction (UED) experiments. We discuss recent developments in the generation, manipulation
and characterization of ultrashort electron beams aimed at improving the combined spatio-temporal
resolution of these measurements. The fundamentals of electron scattering from atomic matter
and the theoretical frameworks for retrieving dynamic structural information from solid-state
and gas-phase samples are described, together with essential experimental techniques and several
landmark works. Ultrafast electron probes with ever improving capabilities, combined with other
complementary photon-based or spectroscopic approaches, hold tremendous potential for revolutionizing
our ability to observe and understand energy and matter at atomic scales.

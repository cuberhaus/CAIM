Context. The adiabatic exponent $\Gamma_1$ is studied as a thermodynamic quantity in the partially
ionized plasma of the solar convection zone. Aims. The aim of this study is to understand the impact
of heavy elements on the $\Gamma_1$ profile. We calculated $\Gamma_1$ with the SAHA-S equation
of state for different chemical compositions of plasma, and we analyzed contributions of individual
elements to $\Gamma_1$. Methods. We studied the decrease in $\Gamma_1$ due to the ionization of
heavy elements in comparison with the value obtained for a pure hydrogen-helium plasma. These types
of differences are denoted as "Z contributions", and we analyzed them for eight elements (C, N, O,
Ne, Mg, S, Si, and Fe) as well as for a mixture of elements corresponding to the solar chemical composition.
We compared linear combinations of individual Z contributions with the exact Z contribution. Applying
a least-squares technique to the decomposition of the full Z contribution to a basis of individual-element
contributions, we obtained the mass fractions of the heavy elements. Results. The Z contribution
of heavy elements can be described by a linear combination of individual-element Z contributions
with a high level of accuracy of 5e-6 . The inverse problem of estimating the mass fractions of heavy
elements from a given $\Gamma_1$ profile was considered for the example of solar-type mixtures.
In ideal numerical simulations, the mass fractions of the most abundant elements could be determined
with a relative accuracy better than a few tenths of a percent. In the presence of random or systematic
errors in the $\Gamma_1$ profile, abundance estimations become remarkably less accurate. If the
amplitude of the errors does not exceed 1e-4, we can expect a determination of at least the oxygen
abundance with a relative error of about 10%.

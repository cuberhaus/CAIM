Destabilization of the water cycle threatens human lives and livelihoods. Meanwhile our understanding
of whether and how changes in vegetation cover could trigger abrupt transitions in moisture regimes
remains incomplete. This challenge calls for better evidence as well as for the theoretical concepts
to describe it. Here we briefly summarise the theoretical questions surrounding the role of vegetation
cover in the dynamics of a moist atmosphere. We discuss the previously unrecognized sensitivity
of local wind power to condensation rate as revealed by our analysis of the continuity equation for
a gas mixture. Using the framework of condensation-induced atmospheric dynamics, we then show
that with the temperature contrast between land and ocean increasing up to a critical threshold,
ocean-to-land moisture transport reaches a tipping point where it can stop or even reverse. Land-ocean
temperature contrasts are affected by both global and regional processes, in particular, by the
surface fluxes of sensible and latent heat that are strongly influenced by vegetation. Our results
clarify how a disturbance of natural vegetation cover, e.g., by deforestation, can disrupt large-scale
atmospheric circulation and moisture transport. In view of the increasing pressure on natural
ecosystems, successful strategies of mitigating climate change require taking into account the
impact of vegetation on moist atmospheric dynamics. Our analysis provides a theoretical framework
to assess this impact. The available data for Eurasia indicate that the observed climatological
land-ocean temperature contrasts are close to the threshold. This can explain the increasing fluctuations
in the continental water cycle including droughts and floods and signifies a yet greater potential
importance for large-scale forest conservation.

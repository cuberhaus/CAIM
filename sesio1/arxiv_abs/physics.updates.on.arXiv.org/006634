Breakthrough Starshot is an initiative to explore the Centauri system using laser-accelerated
sailcraft. Earlier work produced a point design for a 0.2 c mission carrying 1 g of payload. The present
work widens the design space to missions having 0.1 mg to 100 kt payload and 0.0001-0.99 c cruise velocity.
Also, the beam director may now draw up to 5 GW of power directly from the grid to augment the power drawn
from its energy storage system. Augmenting stored energy with grid power shrinks beam director
capital cost by up to 5 orders of magnitude for smaller missions, enabling new possibilities: A 0.1
mg microbiome accelerated to 0.01 c in only 4 min by a \$21M beam director, expending only \$6k worth
of energy to do so. A 10 kg Solar system cubesat accelerated to 0.001 c (63 au/yr) by a \$610M beam director
that expends \$58M worth of energy per mission. A progression from cost-optimized point designs
to whole performance maps has been made possible by replacing numerical trajectory integration
with closed-form equations. Consequently, the system model computes point designs 1-2 orders
of magnitude faster than before. Resulting maps reveal different solution regimes characterized
by their performance-limiting constraints. The performance maps also reveal a family of missions
that accelerate at Earth gravity. The heaviest such mission is a 6.9 km diameter 100 kt vessel (equivalent
to 225 International Space Stations) that is accelerated for 23 days to achieve 0.07 c, reaching
the Centauri system within a human lifetime. While unthinkable at this time, the required 340 PW
peak radiated power (twice terrestrial insolation) might be generated by space solar power or fusion
within a few centuries. Regardless, it is now possible to contemplate such a mission as a laser-accelerated
sailcraft.

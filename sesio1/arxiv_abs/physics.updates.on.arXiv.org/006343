End-to-end optimization of diffractive optical elements (DOEs) profile through a digital differentiable
model combined with computational imaging have gained an increasing attention in emerging applications
due to the compactness of resultant physical setups. Despite recent works have shown the potential
of this methodology to design optics, its performance in physical setups is still limited and affected
by manufacturing artifacts of DOE, mismatch between simulated and resultant experimental point
spread functions, and calibration errors. Additionally, the computational burden of the digital
differentiable model to effectively design the DOE is increasing, thus limiting the size of the
DOE that can be designed. To overcome the above mentioned limitations, the broadband imaging system
with phase-only spatial light modulator (SLM) as an encoded DOE is proposed and developed in this
paper. A co-design of the SLM phase pattern and image reconstruction algorithm is produced following
the end-to-end strategy, using for optimization a convolutional neural network equipped with
quantitative and qualitative loss functions. The optics of the imaging system is hybrid consisting
of SLM as DOE and refractive lens. SLM phase-pattern is optimized by applying the Hardware-in-the-loop
technique, which helps to eliminate the mismatch between numerical modeling and physical reality
of image formation as light propagation is not numerically modeled but is physically done. In our
experiments, the hybrid optics is implemented by the optical projection of the SLM phase-pattern
on a lens plane for a depth range 0.4-1.9m. Comparison with compound multi-lens optics such as Sony
A7 III and iPhone Xs Max cameras show that the proposed system is advanced in all-in-focus sharp imaging.

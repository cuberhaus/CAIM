The purpose of this work is to understand the fundamental connection between structural correlations
and light localization in three-dimensional (3D) open scattering systems of finite size. We numerically
investigate the transport of vector electromagnetic waves scattered by resonant electric dipoles
spatially arranged in 3D space by stealthy hyperuniform disordered point patterns. Three-dimensional
stealthy hyperuniform disordered systems (3D-SHDS) are engineered with different structural
correlation properties determined by their degree of stealthiness $\chi$. Such fine control of
exotic states of amorphous matter enables the systematic design of optical media that interpolate
in a tunable fashion between uncorrelated random structures and crystalline materials. By solving
the electromagnetic multiple scattering problem using Green's matrix spectral method, we establish
a transport phase diagram that demonstrates a distinctive transition from a diffusive to a weak
localization regime beyond a critical scattering density that depends on $\chi$. The transition
is characterized by studying the Thouless number and the spectral statistics of the scattering
resonances. In particular, by tuning the $\chi$ parameter, we demonstrate large spectral gaps
and suppressed sub-radiant proximity resonances, facilitating light localization. Moreover,
consistently with previous studies, our results show a region of the transport phase diagram where
the investigated scattering systems become transparent. Our work provides a systematic description
of the transport and weak localization properties of light in stealthy hyperuniform structures
and motivates the engineering of novel photonic systems with enhanced light-matter interactions
for applications to both classical and quantum devices.

Fronts and near-inertial waves are energetic motions in the upper ocean that can interact and provide
a route for kinetic energy (KE) dissipation of balanced oceanic flows. A quasilinear model is developed
to study the KE exchanges between a two-dimensional geostrophically-balanced front undergoing
strain-induced semigeostrophic frontogenesis and internal wave (IW) vertical modes. The quasilinear
model is solved numerically for variable imposed strain magnitudes, initial IW vertical modes,
and for both minimum frequency (near-inertial) and high-frequency IWs. The front-IW KE exchanges
are quantified separately during two frontogenetic stages: an exponential sharpening stage that
is characterized by a low Rossby number and is driven by the imposed geostrophic strain, followed
by a superexponential sharpening stage that is characterized by an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ Rossby number
and is driven by the convergence of the ageostrophic secondary circulation. It is demonstrated
that minimum frequency IWs are substantially more efficient at extracting KE from the front than
higher frequency IWs, which quickly escape the fontal zone. During the exponential stage, the front-IW
interactions are consistent with those reported in Thomas (\textit{J. Fluid Mech.}, vol. $711,
2012$, pp. $620-640$), where minimum-frequency IWs extract KE from the geostrophic front due to
the externally imposed strain field. However, during the superexponential stage, the KE extraction
is dominated by a newly identified mechanism, `convergence production', which is directly linked
to the convergent secondary circulation that naturally develops during frontogenesis. Most of
the extracted KE is ultimately transferred from the IWs to the unbalanced ageostrophic secondary
circulation, suggesting that internal waves may play a catalytic role in the loss of balance.

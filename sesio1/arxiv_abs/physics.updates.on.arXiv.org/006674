This study has numerically investigated the effect of surface wettability on two-phase immiscible
flow and dynamics of droplet pinch-off in a T-junction microchannel using finite element method.
A conservative level set method (CLSM) has been adopted to capture the interface topology in squeezing
regime ($Ca_c <10^{-2}$) for wide flow rate ratio ($1/10 \leq Q_r \leq 10$) and contact angle ($120^{\circ}
\leq \theta \leq 180^{\circ}$). Based on the instantaneous phase profiles, droplet formation
stages are classified as initial, filling, squeezing, pinch-off and stable droplet. Wettability
effects are insignificant in filling stage. However, hydrophobic effects are more visible in squeezing
and pinch-off stages. Engineering parameters have generally shown complex dependence on dimensionless
parameters ($Ca_c$, $Q_r$, $\theta$). Capturing the instantaneous interface evolution has revealed
droplet shape senstivity with the contact angle. Interface profiles transform from convex into
concave immediately for hydrophobic ($120^{\circ} \leq \theta \leq 135^{\circ}$) whereas slowly
for super hydrophobic ($150^{\circ} \leq \theta \leq 180^{\circ}$) conditions. In contrast to
the literature, pressure in dispersed phase is not constant, but it is an anti-phase with pressure
in continuous phase. Comparing the filling and pinch-off time based on the pressure and phase profiles
has brought new insights that the droplet pinch-off mechanism can be elucidated by installing the
pressure sensors even without the flow visualization and phase profiles. The interface curvature
adopts a flattened to a more concave shape when the Laplace pressure varies from a smaller to a higher
value. The interface neck width (2r) shows an increasing trend up to a threshold value and then decreases
linearly with the contact angle.

Typically, an ultrasound flow imaging system employs the conventional delay and sum (DAS) beamformer
due to its inherent low complexity. But the conventional DAS technique offers poor contrast, low
imaging resolution, and limited spatiotemporal sensitivity. This article attempts to improve
the spatiotemporal sensitivity of conventional flow imaging with a novel multiply and sum based
nonlinear high-resolution (NLHR) beamforming approach. The major advantages of the proposed
beamformer are the harmonic generation and the enhanced coherence in beamformed signals that improve
the spatiotemporal sensitivity towards flow transients. We demonstrate the proposed beamformer
for a directional cross-correlation as well as an autocorrelation based velocity estimator with
simulated parabolic flow profiles of different velocities and flow directions, an in-vitro rotating
disk dataset, and pulsatile flow experiments. The sensitivity of NLHR beamforming towards the
flow transients is validated in-vitro with a sudden reversal of flow direction and air bubble tracking
experiments. The comparison between the time-frequency plots of DAS and NLHR beamforming indicates
that the impulsive spatiotemporal changes induced by the flow of air bubbles are clearly characterized
by nonlinear beamforming than that of DAS beamforming. Furthermore, better spatiotemporal velocity
tracking of a single air bubble and a clear distinguishability between the tracking of two proximal
air bubbles are observed in-vitro. Preliminary studies on the in-vivo carotid data also show comparable,
if not better, results than that of the DAS algorithm. Detailed results for each test case in simulation,
phantom, and in-vivo studies are available as movies with the supplementary material and online.

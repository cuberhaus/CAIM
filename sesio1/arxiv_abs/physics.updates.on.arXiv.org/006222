This study aims to reconcile quantum theory with the universality of the speed of light in vacuum
and its implications on relativity, through an information-theoretic approach. We introduce
the concepts of a holographic sphere and variational potential. Entropy variation expressed in
terms of information capacity of this sphere results in the concept of binary potential in units
of negative, squared speed of light in vacuum. Accordingly, the event horizon is a fundamental holographic
sphere in thermodynamic equilibrium with only one exterior side: a noncompressible binary message
that maximizes Shannon entropy. Therefore, the Jordan-Brouwer separation theorem and generalized
Stokes theorem do not hold for black holes. We introduce the concept of inertial potential and demonstrate
its equivalence to the variational potential, which ensures that any inertial acceleration represents
a nonequilibrium thermodynamic condition. We introduce the concept of the complementary time
period and relate it with the classical time period through integral powers of the imaginary unit
to formulate the notions of unobservable velocity and acceleration, which are perpendicular and
tangential to the holographic sphere, respectively, and bounded with the observable velocity
and acceleration based on Pythagorean relations. We further discuss certain dynamics scenarios
between the two masses. The concept of black hole information-less emission is introduced as a complement
to informationless Bekenstein absorption and extended to arbitrary wavelengths. Black hole quantum
statistics with degeneracy interpret-ed as the number of Planck areas on the event horizon are discussed.
The study concludes that holographic screens and equipotential surfaces are spherical equivalents,
and every observer is a sphere in nonequilibrium thermodynamic condition. Lastly, we propose a
solution to the black hole information paradox.

Bone is a stiff and though, hierarchical and continuously evolving material that optimizes its
structure to respond to mechanical stimuli, which also govern growth and remodeling processes.
However, a full understanding of the underlying mechanisms responsible for the cooperation of
bone toughness and biological functions, with important implications in bone ageing, osteoporosis
and tissue repair, has yet to be achieved. In particular, how micro-damage nucleation, needed for
tissue remodeling, does not evolve into catastrophic failure in such a stiff material, still remains
a partial enigma, cement lines, interfaces and sacrificial elements alone not providing a definitive
answer to the question. Here, we bring to light a novel stress-based bone toughening mechanism,
calling into play the nearly-symmetrical, chiral and hierarchical architecture of the osteons,
demonstrating that their arrangement simultaneously gives rise to stress states alternating
in sign along the osteon radius and to localized stress amplifications, both in the tensile and compressive
regimes. This unveils a previously unforeseen synergistic mechanism allowing micro-damage accumulation
without propagating cracks, kindled by the contrast between crack-opening due to tensile hoop
stresses and crack-stopping due to compressive stresses at the crack tips in adjacent lamellae,
which seal the crack ends conferring toughness to bone well beyond that predicted by current models.
Furthermore, shear stresses occur at the lamellar interfaces, contributing with fluid flow to
mechanically stimulate the osteocytes and to amplify the bone signalling. These results, obtained
through original exact elastic solutions and confirmed by both FE fracture analyses and experimental
tests on 3D-printed osteon prototypes, contribute with another piece in the puzzle to making the
rational biophysical picture of bone mechanobiology complete.

This paper develops and evaluates a novel 3D fully-Lagrangian (particle-based) numerical model,
based on the hybrid discrete element method (DEM) and moving particle semi-implicit (MPS) mesh-free
techniques, for modeling the highly-dynamic ice-wave interactions. Both MPS and DEM belong to
mesh-free Lagrangian (particle) techniques. The model considers ice-wave dynamics as a multiphase
continuum-discrete system. While the MPS solves the continuum equations of free-surface flow
in a Lagrangian particle-based domain, the DEM uses a multi-sphere Hertzian contact dynamic model
to simulate the ice floes motion and interaction. The hybrid model predicts the motion and collision
of ice floes as well as their interaction with water, boundaries, and any obstacle in their way. Considering
the mesh-free Lagrangian nature of both DEM and MPS, the developed model has an inherent ability
to predict the free-drift (absence of internal stress) movements of the ice floes, e.g., sliding,
rolling, colliding, and piling-up, in violent free-surface flow. A small-scale and challenging
experiment based on dam-break flow over dry and wet beds with floating block floes, which mimics
the characteristics of an idealized jam release, has been conducted to provide useful and comprehensive
quality data for the validation of the proposed model, as well as other numerical models. Experimental
and numerical results of the free-surface profile and the position of the blocks are compared. The
results show the ability of the model to numerically reproduce and predict the complex three-dimensional
dynamic behavior of wave-ice floes interaction. Overall, this study is a first effort toward developing
an ice-wave dynamics within a fully Lagrangian framework, and its results can be extended to bring
an in-depth understanding of the physics of the real-scale ice-wave or river ice dynamic problems
in the future.

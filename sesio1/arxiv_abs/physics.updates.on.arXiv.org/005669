In the sciences and engineering, the concept of bandwidth is often subject to interpretation depending
upon context and the requirements of a specific community. The focus of this work is to formulate
this concept for a general class of passive oscillatory dynamical systems, including but not limited
to mechanical, structural, acoustic, electrical, and optical. Typically, the bandwidth of these
systems is determined by the half-power (-3 dB) method, and the result is often referred to as half-power
bandwidth. The fundamental assumption underlying this definition is that the system performance
degrades once its power decreases by 50%; moreover, there are restrictive conditions that are rarely
met. Here the concept of root mean square bandwidth is considered, justified by the Fourier uncertainty
principle, to generalize the definition of bandwidth to encompass linear and nonlinear, single
and multi-mode, low and high loss and time-varying and invariant oscillating systems. By tying
the bandwidth of an oscillatory dynamical system directly to its dissipative capacity, one can
formulate a definition based solely on its transient energy evolution, effectively circumventing
the previous restrictions. Further, applications are given that highlight the limitations of
the traditional half-power bandwidth; including a Duffing oscillator with hardening nonlinearity,
and a geometrically nonlinear oscillator with tunable hardening or softening nonlinearity. The
resulting energy-dependent bandwidth computations are compatible with the nonlinear dynamics
of these systems, since at low energies they recover the half-power bandwidth, whereas at high energies
they accurately capture the nonlinear physics. Moreover, the bandwidth computation is directly
tied to nonlinear harmonic generation in the transient dynamics.

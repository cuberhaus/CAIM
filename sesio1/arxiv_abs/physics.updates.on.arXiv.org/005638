Rocket engine combustors are prone to transverse instabilities that are characterized by large
amplitude high frequency oscillations in the acoustic pressure and the heat release rate. We study
the coupled interaction between the acoustic pressure and the CH* intensity oscillations in a 2D
multi-element self-excited model rocket combustor during the transition from a stable state to
thermoacoustic instability through intermittency. We show the emergence of synchronization
between these oscillations from desynchronization through intermittent phase synchronization
during the onset of thermoacoustic instability. We find substantial evidence that the intensities
of the jet flames close to the end wall is higher than that observed near the center of the combustor
as a result of its strong coupling to the local acoustic field. Using concepts from recurrence theory,
we distinguish the type of synchronization between the acoustic pressure and the CH* intensity
oscillations at the end wall and the center of the combustor during thermoacoustic instability.
Analyzing the local CH* intensity oscillations, we observe that the longitudinally propagating
jet flames experience substantial transverse displacement with flame merging effects during
thermoacoustic instability. Furthermore, we differentiate the interaction of the jet flames
with the shock wave during intermittency and thermoacoustic instability at both the end wall and
the center of the combustor. We also discerned the change from stochastic to deterministic nature
in the local CH* intensity oscillations during the transition to thermoacoustic instability.
Our results demonstrate that only the first few transverse modes contribute to the generation of
acoustic power from the reacting flow, in spite of the pressure oscillations featuring several
harmonics.

Unforced shoaling waves experience growth and changes to wave shape. Similarly, wind-forced waves
on a flat-bottom likewise experience growth/decay and changes to wave shape. However, the combined
effect of shoaling and wind-forcing on wave shape, particularly relevant in the near shore environment,
has not yet been investigated theoretically. Here, we consider small-amplitude, shallow-water
solitary waves propagating up a gentle, planar bathymetry forced by a weak, Jeffreys-type wind-induced
surface pressure. We derive a variable-coefficient Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers (vKdV-B) equation
governing the wave profile's evolution and solve it numerically using a Runge-Kutta third-order
finite difference solver. The simulations run until convective pre-breaking -- a Froude number
limit appropriate to the order of the vKdV-B equation. Offshore winds weakly enhance the ratio of
pre-breaking height to depth as well as pre-breaking wave slope. Onshore winds have a strong impact
on narrowing the wave peak, and wind also modulates the rear shelf formed behind the wave. Furthermore,
wind strongly affects the width of the pre-breaking zone, with larger effects for smaller beach
slopes. After converting our pressure magnitudes to physically realistic wind speeds, we observe
qualitative agreement with prior laboratory and numerical experiments on breakpoint location.
Additionally, our numerical results have qualitatively similar temporal wave shape to shoaling
and wind-forced laboratory observations, suggesting that the vKdV-B equation captures the essential
aspects of wind-induced effects on shoaling wave shape. Finally, we isolate the wind's effect by
comparing the wave profiles to the unforced case. This reveals that the numerical results are approximately
a superposition of a solitary wave, a shoaling-induced shelf and a wind-induced, bound, dispersive,
and decaying tail.

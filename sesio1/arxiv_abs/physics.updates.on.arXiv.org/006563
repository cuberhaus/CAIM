Solvent interactions and specifically hydration are of utmost importance in chemical and biochemical
systems. Model systems enable us to unravel the relevance of microscopic details of these interactions.
Here, we characterized the electronic structure of the prototypical biomolecular chromophore
indole (\ind) in aqueous solution and disentangled the specific and non-specific effects of the
solvent on indole's electronic structure. The complete photoelectron-emission spectrum of indole\textsubscript{aq}
in a liquid microjet was measured using 600~eV synchrotron radiation. The first valence photoelectron
peak corresponds to the ionization from the HOMO and HOMO$-$1 orbitals, for which we assigned the
binding energies to 7.38 and 7.93~eV. The solvent shifts for these peaks indicate the presence of
simultaneous specific and non-specific effects of the aqueous environment. The valence photoemission
data were also compared to available data to determine the reorganization energy of aqueous-phase
indole associated with its ionization. The core-electron binding energies for nitrogen and carbon
demonstrated a distinct interaction of the water solvent with these atoms: a strong $\text{N-H}\cdots\text{OH}_2$
hydrogen bond and an unstructured interaction of the water solvent with the carbon atoms. Auger-electron
contributions to the spectra are also reported and discussed. The experimental data were interpreted
with the aid of extensive \emph{ab initio} modeling. The combination of the maximum-overlap method
with the non-equilibrium polarizable-continuum model was demonstrated as an efficient and accurate
technique for a modeling of both the valence and core peaks in the spectra. The two-hole electron-population
analysis is shown to provide a quantitative theoretical description of Auger spectra.

Keratoconus is a pathology of the cornea associated with a tissue thinning and a weakening of its
mechanical properties. However, it remains elusive which aspect is the leading cause of the disease.
To investigate this question, we combined a multiscale model with a patient-geometry in order to
simulate the mechanical response of healthy and pathological corneas under intraocular pressure.
The constitutive behavior of the cornea is described through an energy function which takes into
account the isotropic matrix of the cornea, the geometric structure of collagen lamellae and the
quasi-incompressibility of the tissue. A micro-sphere description is implemented to take into
account the typical features of the collagen lamellae as obtained experimentally, namely their
orientation, their stiffness and their dispersion, as well as the their unfolding stretch, at which
they start to provide a significant force. A set of reference parameters is obtained to fit experimental
inflation data of the literature. We show that the most sensitive parameter is the unfolding stretch,
as a small variation of this parameter induces a major change in the corneal apex displacement. The
keratoconus case is then studied by separating the impact of the geometry and the one of the mechanics.
We computed the evolution of the SimK (a clinical indicator of cornea curvature) and elevation maps:
we were able to reproduce the reported changes of SimK with pressure only by a mechanical weakening,
and not by a change in geomtry. More specifically, the weakening has to target the lamellae and not
the matrix. The mechanical weakening leads to elevations close to early stage keratoconus, but
our model lacks the remodeling component to couple the change in mechanics with changes in geometry.

A major strategy to prevent the spread of COVID-19 is the limiting of in-person contacts. However,
this is impractical or impossible for the many disabled people who do not live in care facilities,
but still require caregivers. We seek to determine which interventions can prevent infections
among disabled people and their caregivers. We simulate transmission with a model that includes
susceptible, exposed, asymptomatic, symptomatically ill, hospitalized, and removed individuals.
The networks on which we simulate disease spread incorporate heterogeneity in the risks of different
types of interactions, time-dependent lockdown and reopening measures, and contact distributions
for four different groups (caregivers, disabled people, essential workers, and the general population).
We find the probability of becoming infected is largest for caregivers and second largest for disabled
people. Our analysis of network structure illustrates that caregivers have the largest modal eigenvector
centrality. We find that two interventions -- contact-limiting by all groups and mask-wearing
by disabled people and caregivers -- most reduce the cases among disabled people and caregivers.
We also test which group spreads COVID-19 most readily by seeding infections in a subset of each group.
We find caregivers are the most potent spreaders of COVID-19, particularly to other caregivers
and to disabled people. We test where to use limited vaccine doses most effectively and find (1) vaccinating
caregivers better protects disabled people than vaccinating the general population or essential
workers and (2) vaccinating caregivers protects disabled people about as much as vaccinating disabled
people themselves. Our results highlight the potential effectiveness of mask-wearing, contact-limiting
throughout society, and strategic vaccination for limiting the exposure of disabled people and
their caregivers to COVID-19.

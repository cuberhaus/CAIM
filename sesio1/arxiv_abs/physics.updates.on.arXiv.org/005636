We examine the dynamics of low-frequency gravito-inertial waves (GIWs) in differentially rotating
deformed radiation zones in stars and planets by generalising the traditional approximation of
rotation (TAR). The TAR treatment was built on the assumptions that the star is spherical and uniformly
rotating. However, it has been generalised in our previous work by including the effects of the centrifugal
deformation using a non-perturbative approach in the uniformly rotating case. We aim to carry out
a new generalisation of the TAR treatment to account for the differential rotation and the strong
centrifugal deformation simultaneously. We generalise our previous work by taking into account
the differential rotation in the derivation of our complete analytical formalism that allows the
study of the dynamics of GIWs in differentially and rapidly rotating stars. We derived the complete
set of equations that generalises the TAR, simultaneously taking the full centrifugal acceleration
and the differential rotation into account. Within the validity domain of the TAR, we derived a generalised
Laplace tidal equation for the horizontal eigenfunctions and asymptotic wave periods of the GIWs,
which can be used to probe the structure and dynamics of differentially rotating deformed stars
with asteroseismology. A new generalisation of the TAR, which simultaneously takes into account
the differential rotation and the centrifugal acceleration in a non-perturbative way, was derived.
This generalisation allowed us to study the detectability and the signature of the differential
rotation on GIWs in rapidly rotating deformed stars and planets. We found that the effects of the
differential rotation in early-type deformed stars on GIWs is theoretically largely detectable
in modern space photometry using observations from $\textit{Kepler}$ and TESS.

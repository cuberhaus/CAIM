Chiral transition-metal complexes are of interest in many fields ranging from asymmetric catalysis
and molecular materials science to optoelectronic applications or fundamental physics including
parity violation effects. We present here a combined theoretical and experimental investigation
of gas-phase valence-shell photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) on the challenging open-shell
ruthenium(iii)-tris-(acetylacetonato) complex, Ru(acac)$_3$. Enantiomerically pure $\Delta$-
or $\Lambda$-Ru(acac)$_3$, characterized by electronic circular dichroism (ECD), were vaporized
and adiabatically expanded to produce a supersonic beam and photoionized by circularly-polarized
VUV light from the DESIRS beamline at Synchrotron SOLEIL. Photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) and
PECD experiments were conducted using a double imaging electron/ion coincidence spectrometer,
and compared to density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations.
The open-shell character of Ru(acac)$_3$, which is not taken into account in our DFT approach, is
expected to give rise to a wide multiplet structure, which is not resolved in our PES signals but whose
presence might be inferred from the additional striking features observed in the PECD curves. Nevertheless,
the DFT-based assignment of the electronic bands leads to the characterisation of the ionized orbitals.
In line with other recent works, the results confirm that PECD persists independently on the localization
and/or on the achiral or chiral nature of the initial orbital, but is rather a probe of the molecular
potential as a whole. Overall, the measured PECD signals on Ru(acac)$_3$, a system exhibiting D$_3$
propeller-type chirality, are of similar magnitude compared to those on asymmetric-carbon-based
chiral organic molecules which constitute the vast majority of species investigated so far, thus
suggesting that PECD is a universal mechanism, inherent to any type of chirality.

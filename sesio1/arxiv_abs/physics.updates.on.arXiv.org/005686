Geomagnetic storms are an important aspect of space weather and can result in significant impacts
on space- and ground-based assets. The majority of strong storms are associated with the passage
of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) in the near-Earth environment. In many cases,
these ICMEs can be traced back unambiguously to a specific coronal mass ejection (CME) and solar
activity on the frontside of the Sun. Hence, predicting the arrival of ICMEs at Earth from routine
observations of CMEs and solar activity currently makes a major contribution to the forecasting
of geomagnetic storms. However, it is clear that some ICMEs, which may also cause enhanced geomagnetic
activity, cannot be traced back to an observed CME, or, if the CME is identified, its origin may be
elusive or ambiguous in coronal images. Such CMEs have been termed "stealth CMEs." In this review,
we focus on these "problem" geomagnetic storms in the sense that the solar/CME precursors are enigmatic
and stealthy. We start by reviewing evidence for stealth CMEs discussed in past studies. We then
identify several moderate to strong geomagnetic storms (minimum Dst < -50 nT) in solar cycle 24 for
which the related solar sources and/or CMEs are unclear and apparently stealthy. We discuss the
solar and in situ circumstances of these events and identify several scenarios that may account
for their elusive solar signatures. These range from observational limitations (e.g., a coronagraph
near Earth may not detect an incoming CME if it is diffuse and not wide enough) to the possibility that
there is a class of mass ejections from the Sun that have only weak or hard-to-observe coronal signatures.
In particular, some of these sources are only clearly revealed by considering the evolution of coronal
structures over longer time intervals than is usually considered. We also review a variety of numerical
modelling approaches...

Cancer development is a multistep process often starting with a single cell in which a number of epigenetic
and genetic alterations have accumulated thus transforming it into a tumor cell. The progeny of
such a single benign tumor cell expands in the tissue and can at some point progress to malignant tumor
cells until a detectable tumor is formed. The dynamics from the early phase of a single cell to a detectable
tumor with billions of tumor cells are complex and still not fully resolved, not even for the well-known
prototype of multistage carcinogenesis, the adenoma-adenocarcinoma sequence of colorectal
cancer. Mathematical models of such carcinogenesis are frequently tested and calibrated based
on reported age-specific incidence rates of cancer, but they usually require calibration of four
or more parameters due to the wide range of processes these models aim to reflect. We present a cell-based
model, which focuses on the competition between wild-type and tumor cells in colonic crypts, with
which we are able reproduce epidemiological incidence rates of colon cancer. Additionally, the
fraction of cancerous tumors with precancerous lesions predicted by the model agree with clinical
estimates. The correspondence between model and reported data suggests that the fate of tumor development
is majorly determined by the early phase of tumor growth and progression long before a tumor becomes
detectable. Due to the focus on the early phase of tumor development, the model has only a single fit
parameter, the time scale set by an effective replacement rate of stem cells in the crypt. We find
this effective rate to be considerable smaller than the actual replacement rate, which implies
that the time scale is limited by the processes succeeding clonal conversion of crypts.

Ptychography is an enabling coherent diffraction imaging technique for both fundamental and applied
sciences. Its applications in optical microscopy, however, fall short for its low imaging throughput
and limited resolution. Here, we report a resolution-enhanced parallel coded ptychography technique
achieving the highest numerical aperture and an imaging throughput orders of magnitude greater
than previous demonstrations. In this platform, we translate the samples across the disorder-engineered
surfaces for lensless diffraction data acquisition. The engineered surface consists of chemically
etched micron-level phase scatters and printed sub-wavelength intensity absorbers. It is designed
to unlock an optical space with spatial extent (x, y) and frequency content (kx, ky) that is inaccessible
using conventional lens-based optics. To achieve the best resolution performance, we also report
a new coherent diffraction imaging model by considering both the spatial and angular responses
of the pixel readouts. Our low-cost prototype can directly resolve 308-nm linewidth on the resolution
target without aperture synthesizing. Gigapixel high-resolution microscopic images with a 240-mm^2
effective field of view can be acquired in 15 seconds. For demonstrations, we recover slow-varying
3D phase objects with many 2{\pi} wraps, including optical prism and convex lens. The low-frequency
phase contents of these objects are challenging to obtain using other existing lensless techniques.
For digital pathology applications, we perform accurate virtual staining by using the recovered
phase as attention guidance in a deep neural network. Parallel optical processing using the reported
technique enables novel optical instruments with inherent quantitative nature and metrological
versatility.

Light-assisted micro-nanoscale temperature control in complex nanoparticle network attracts
lots of research interests. Many efforts have been put on the optical properties of the nanoparticle
networks and only a few investigation on its light-induced thermal behavior was reported. We consider
two-dimensional (2D) square-lattice nanoparticle ensemble made of typical metal Ag with radius
of 5 nm. The effect of complex optical coupling and thermal accumulation on the light-induced thermal
behavior at plasmonic resonance frequency (around 383 nm) is analyzed by means of the Green's function
approach. Similar to the three-dimensional random nanoparticle ensemble reported in literature
[V. Siahpoush, S. Ahmadi-kandjani, and A. Nikniazi, Opt. Commun. 420, 52 (2018).], optical coupling
in 2D square-lattice nanoparticle ensemble can also inhibit temperature increase $\Delta T$ of
nanoparticles. A dimensionless parameter $\varphi$ is defined as the ratio of full temperature
increase to that without considering optical coupling or thermal accumulation to quantify the
optical coupling and thermal accumulation effects on photothermal behavior. The more compact
the nanoparticle ensemble is, the stronger the optical coupling on thermal behavior is. When the
lattice spacing increases to 10 times of nanoparticle radius, the optical coupling becomes no significant.
When $\varphi \approx 1$ (lattice spacing increases to 30 times of nanoparticle radius), the thermal
accumulation effects are weak and can be neglected safely. The polarization-dependent distribution
of temperature increase of nanoparticle is observed only in the compact nanoparticle ensemble,
while for dilute ensemble, such polarization-dependent temperature increase distribution can
not be observed anymore. This work may help for the understanding of the photon-induced thermal
transport in the 2D particle ensemble.

The self-organization of dust grains into stable filamentary dust structures (or "chains") largely
depends on dynamic interactions between the individual charged dust grains and the complex electric
potential arising from the distribution of charges within the local plasma environment. Recent
studies have shown that the positive column of the gas discharge plasma in the Plasmakristall-4
(PK-4) experiment onboard the International Space Station (ISS) supports the presence of fast-moving
ionization waves, which lead to variations of plasma parameters by up to an order of magnitude from
the average background values. The highly-variable environment resulting from ionization waves
may have interesting implications for the dynamics and self-organization of dust particles, particularly
concerning the formation and stability of dust chains. Here we investigate the electric potential
surrounding dust chains in the PK-4 by employing a molecular dynamics model of the dust and ions with
boundary conditions supplied by a Particle-in-Cell with Monte Carlo collisions (PIC-MCC) simulation
of the ionization waves. The model is used to examine the effects of the plasma conditions within
different regions of the ionization wave and compare the resulting dust structure to that obtained
by employing the time-averaged plasma conditions. Comparison between simulated dust chains and
experimental data from the PK-4 shows that the time-averaged plasma conditions do not accurately
reproduce observed results for dust behavior, indicating that more careful treatment of plasma
conditions in the presence of ionization waves is required. It is further shown that commonly used
analytic forms of the electric potential do not accurately describe the electric potential near
charged dust grains under these plasma conditions.

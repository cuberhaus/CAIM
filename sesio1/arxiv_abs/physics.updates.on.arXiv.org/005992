The energy dependence of the rates of the reactions between He$^+$ and ammonia (NY$_3$, Y= {H,D}),
forming NY$_2^+$, Y and He as well as NY$^+$, Y$_2$ and He, and the corresponding product branching
ratios have been measured at low collision energies between 0 and $k_{\mathrm{B}}\cdot40$ K using
a recently developed merged-beam technique [Allmendinger {\it et al.}, ChemPhysChem {\bf 17},
3596 (2016)]. To avoid heating of the ions by stray electric fields, the reactions are observed within
the large orbit of a highly excited Rydberg electron. A beam of He Rydberg atoms was merged with a supersonic
beam of ammonia using a curved surface-electrode Rydberg-Stark deflector, which was also used
for adjusting the final velocity of the He Rydberg atoms, and thus the collision energy ($E_{\rm
coll}$). A collision-energy resolution of about 200 mK was reached at the lowest $E_{\rm coll}$
values. The reaction rate coefficients exhibit a sharp increase at collision energies below $\sim
k_{\mathrm{B}}\cdot5$ K and pronounced deviations from Langevin-capture behaviour. The experimental
results are interpreted in terms of an adiabatic capture model describing the rotational-state-dependent
orientation of the ammonia molecules by the electric field of the He$^+$ atom. The model faithfully
describes the experimental observations. The enhancement of the reaction yields of both reactions
observed at the lowest collision energies is attributed to high-field-seeking states which experience
linear Stark shifts at low electric fields. Thermal capture rate constants are derived from the
model for the temperature range between 0 and 10~K relevant for astrochemistry. Comparison of the
calculated thermal capture rate coefficients with the absolute reaction rates measured above
27 K by Marquette {\it et al.} (Chem. Phys. Lett., 1985, {\bf 122}, 431) suggests that only 40\% of
the close collisions are reactive.

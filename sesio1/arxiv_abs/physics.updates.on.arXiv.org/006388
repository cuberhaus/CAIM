Resource are often not uniformly distributed within a population. Spatial variations of concentration
of a resource, change the fitness of competing strategies locally. The notion of fitness varying
with respect to both genotype and environment is important in modeling cancer initiation, microbial
evolution and evolution of drug resistance. Environmental interactions can be asymmetric, that
is, they affect the fitness of one type more than the other. The question is how local environmental
variations in network population structures change the selection dynamics in a finite population
setting. We consider one-dimensional lattice population structures with spatial fitness distributions
with a periodic pattern. Heterogeneity is determined by standard deviation of fitnesses and period.
The model covers biologically relevant limits of two-habitat subdivided populations and randomly-distributed
resources in high- and low-periods. We numerically calculate fixation probability and fixation
times for a constant population birth-death process as fitness heterogeneity and period vary.
We identify levels of heterogeneity for which a previously deleterious mutant, in a uniform environment,
becomes beneficial. In other regimes of the problem we observe unexpected behavior where the fixation
probability of both types are larger than their neutral value at the same time. This coincides with
an exponential increase in time to fixation as a function of population size, which points to significant
slow-down in selection process and the potential for coexistence between types in realistic time
scales. We also discuss `fitness shift' model where the fitness function of one type is identical
to the other up to a constant spatial shift. This leads to significant increase (or decrease) in the
fixation probability of the mutant depending the value of the shift.

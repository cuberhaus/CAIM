A complete understanding of jet dynamics is greatly enabled by accurate separation of the acoustically
efficient wavepackets from their higher-energy convecting turbulent counterparts. Recent developments
using Momentum Potential Theory (MPT) have successfully isolated the acoustic component in all
regions of the jet, to better understand the dynamics as well as to develop wavepacket models. MPT
is however a data-intensive method since the inherent Poisson equation solution requires fluctuation
quantities in the entire flowfield; as such, it has to date been applied only to numerically obtained
data. This work develops an approach to extend its application to extract coherent wavepackets
from high-speed schlieren images. The procedure maps pixel intensities from the schlieren to a
scaled surrogate for the density gradient integrated along the line of sight. The effectiveness
of the procedure is demonstrated using experimental as well as simulated schlieren images representing
a wide range of imperfectly-expanded free and impinging jet configurations. When combined with
Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition, the method yields modes that accurately capture (i)
the Mach wave radiation from a military-style jet, (ii) the mode shapes of the feedback tones in an
impinging jet, and (iii) the screech signature in twin rectangular jets, without recourse to user
adjusted parameters. This technique has the potential to greatly expand the use of high-speed diagnostics
and provide real-time monitoring of the acoustic content of the jet in the nearfield, with feedback
control implications. Additionally, although the present study focuses on jets, the general nature
of the approach allows a straightforward application to other flows, such as cavity flow-acoustic
interactions, among others.

Identifying the mechanism of intercellular feedback regulation is critical for the basic understanding
of tissue growth control in organisms. In this paper, we analyze a tissue growth model consisting
of a single lineage of two cell types regulated by negative feedback signalling molecules that undergo
spatial diffusion. By deriving the fixed points for the uniform steady states and carrying out linear
stability analysis, phase diagrams are obtained analytically for arbitrary parameters of the
model. Two different generic growth modes are found: blow-up growth and final-state controlled
growth which are governed by the non-trivial fixed point and the trivial fixed point respectively,
and can be sensitively switched by varying the negative feedback regulation on the proliferation
of the stem cells. Analytic expressions for the characteristic time scales for these two growth
modes are also derived. Remarkably, the trivial and non-trivial uniform steady states can coexist
and a sharp transition occurs in the bistable regime as the relevant parameters are varied. Furthermore,
the bi-stable growth properties allows for the external control to switch between these two growth
modes. In addition, the condition for an early accelerated growth followed by a retarded growth
can be derived. These analytical results are further verified by numerical simulations and provide
insights on the growth behavior of the tissue. Our results are also discussed in the light of possible
realistic biological experiments and tissue growth control strategy. Furthermore, by external
feedback control of the concentration of regulatory molecules, it is possible to achieve a desired
growth mode, as demonstrated with an analysis of boosted growth, catch-up growth and the design
for the target of a linear growth dynamic.

Advanced nanomaterials with enhanced optical and photocatalytic properties for the photodegradation
of organic pollutants, in particular pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), were
successfully prepared by a swift one-pot synthesis. Nanostructured materials were synthesized
through an integrated hydrothermal procedure which generates titanate nanowires (TNWs) with
different carbon dots (C-dots) contents, from an amorphous titanium oxide-based source and cork
industry wastewaters (CIWWs) as carbon source. Their structural, microstructural, morphological,
and optical properties were studied by XRD, TEM, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance and photoluminescence
spectroscopies. As aimed, the hybrid C-dots/TNW nanomaterials extend their light absorption
towards the red, in comparison to pristine TNWs, prompting them for a more efficient use of light
in photocatalysis by widening the TNWs energy uptake range. The decrease of bandgap energy with
increasing sample's C-dots content seems to be originated from energy intermediate states formed
within the TNWs forbidden band resulting from Ti-O-C bonds established between the TNWs and the
C-dots that form tails of states. The as-synthesized C-dots/TNW samples were tested in the photodegradation
of caffeine as a pollutant model. Rewarding results were obtained, with the hybrid C-dots/TNW nanomaterials
showing significant enhanced photocatalytic ability toward caffeine degradation in comparison
to pristine TNWs. Photocatalysis assays in the presence of scavengers and/or in the absence of oxygen
were also performed aiming to characterize the most reactive species formed during the semiconductor
photo-activation process and thus assessing to possible reactive pathways underpinning the photocatalytic
activity of the hybrid C-dots/TNW nanomaterials.

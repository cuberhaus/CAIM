There is a growing interest in developing data-driven reduced-order models for atmospheric and
oceanic flows that are trained on data obtained either from high-resolution simulations or satellite
observations. The data-driven models are non-intrusive in nature and offer significant computational
savings compared to large-scale numerical models. These low-dimensional models can be utilized
to reduce the computational burden of generating forecasts and estimating model uncertainty without
losing the key information needed for data assimilation to produce accurate state estimates. This
paper aims at exploring an equation-free surrogate modeling approach at the intersection of machine
learning and data assimilation in Earth system modeling. With this objective, we introduce an end-to-end
non-intrusive reduced-order modeling (NIROM) framework equipped with contributions in modal
decomposition, time series prediction, optimal sensor placement, and sequential data assimilation.
Specifically, we use proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) to identify the dominant structures
of the flow, and a long short-term memory network to model the dynamics of the POD modes. The NIROM
is integrated within the deterministic ensemble Kalman filter (DEnKF) to incorporate sparse and
noisy observations at optimal sensor locations obtained through QR pivoting. The feasibility
and the benefit of the proposed framework are demonstrated for the NOAA Optimum Interpolation Sea
Surface Temperature (SST) V2 dataset. Our results indicate that the NIROM is stable for long-term
forecasting and can model dynamics of SST with a reasonable level of accuracy. Furthermore, the
prediction accuracy of the NIROM gets improved by one order of magnitude by the DEnKF algorithm.
This work provides a way forward toward transitioning these methods to fuse information from Earth
system models and observations to achieve accurate forecasts.

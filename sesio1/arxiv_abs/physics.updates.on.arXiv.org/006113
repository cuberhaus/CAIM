This paper describes the dose delivery system used at the Centro Nazionale di Adroterapia Oncologica
(CNAO) for ion beam modulated scanning radiotherapy. CNAO Foundation, INFN and University of Torino
have developed and commissioned a Dose Delivery System (DDS) to monitor and guide ion beams accelerated
by a synchrotron and to distribute the dose with a 3D scanning technique. The target volume, segmented
in several layers orthogonally to the beam direction, is irradiated by thousands of pencil beams
which must be steered and held to the prescribed positions until the prescribed number of particles
has been delivered. At CNAO, these operations are performed by the DDS. The main components of this
system are 2 independent beam monitoring detectors (BOX1 and BOX2), interfaced with 2 control systems
performing real-time control, and connected to the scanning magnets and the beam chopper. As a reaction
to any potential hazard, a DDS interlock signal is sent to the Patient Interlock System which immediately
stops the irradiation. The tasks and operations performed by the DDS are described following the
data flow from the Treatment Planning System through the end of the treatment delivery. The ability
of the DDS to guarantee a safe and accurate treatment was validated during the commissioning phase
by means of checks of the charge collection efficiency, gain uniformity of the chambers and 2D dose
distribution homogeneity and stability. A high level of reliability and robustness has been proven
by 3 years of system activity. The DDS described in this paper is one among the few worldwide existing
systems to operate ion beam for modulated scanning radiotherapy. It has proven to guide and control
the therapeutic pencil beams with accuracy and stability showing dose deviations lower than the
acceptance threshold of 5% and 2.5% respectively during daily Quality Assurance measurements.

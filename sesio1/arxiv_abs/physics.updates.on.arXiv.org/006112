NEXT (Neutrino Experiment with a Xenon TPC) is a neutrinoless double beta decay experiment located
at the Laboratorio Subterr\'aneo de Canfranc (LSC, Spain). Its aim is to demonstrate that the neutrino
is a Majorana particle by detecting the neutrinoless double beta decay process in xenon gas enriched
in the $^{136}$Xe isotope. The detector technology used in NEXT is that of radiopure high pressure
time projection chambers with electroluminescence amplification, which provide excellent energy
resolution better than 1$\%$ FWHM in the energy region of interest, topological reconstruction
that allows rejecting single-electron background events and a strong potential for "in situ" tagging
of the barium daughter ion. The experiment has been developing in phases. The NEXT-White detector
has recently finished operation at the LSC and contained approximately an active Xe mass of 5 kg.
Its purpose was to demonstrate the excellent energy resolution, to validate the reconstruction
algorithms and the background model, and to make a measurement of the two-neutrino double beta decay
of $^{136}$Xe. The 100 kg NEXT-100 detector is under construction and is scheduled to be installed
and assembled by the first half of 2022. The predicted 90$\%$ CL sensitivity to the neutrinoless
double beta decay half-life will reach $10^{26}$ years for an exposure of about 400 kg $\cdot$ year.
A vigorous program towards the development of ton-scale detectors is also under way, including
extensive R$\&$D towards the realization of in-situ Ba$^{2+}$ tagging as means to achieve virtually
zero-background detection. A first module with a mass of at least 500 kg may be operating as early
as 2026 at the LSC. In this manuscript, recent results obtained with the NEXT-White detector will
be presented, as well as the NEXT-100 construction status and on the prospects of future NEXT detectors.

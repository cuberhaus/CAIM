The objective of this study is to predict road flooding risks based on topographic, hydrologic,
and temporal precipitation features using machine learning models. Predictive flood monitoring
of road network flooding status plays an essential role in community hazard mitigation, preparedness,
and response activities. Existing studies related to the estimation of road inundations either
lack observed road inundation data for model validations or focus mainly on road inundation exposure
assessment based on flood maps. This study addresses this limitation by using crowdsourced and
fine-grained traffic data as an indicator of road inundation, and topographic, hydrologic, and
temporal precipitation features as predictor variables. Two tree-based machine learning models
(random forest and AdaBoost) were then tested and trained for predicting road inundations in the
contexts of 2017 Hurricane Harvey and 2019 Tropical Storm Imelda in Harris County, Texas. The findings
from Hurricane Harvey indicate that precipitation is the most important feature for predicting
road inundation susceptibility, and that topographic features are more essential than hydrologic
features for predicting road inundations in both storm cases. The random forest and AdaBoost models
had relatively high AUC scores (0.860 and 0.810 for Harvey respectively and 0.790 and 0.720 for Imelda
respectively) with the random forest model performing better in both cases. The random forest model
showed stable performance for Harvey, while varying significantly for Imelda. This study advances
the emerging field of smart flood resilience in terms of predictive flood risk mapping at the road
level. For example, such models could help impacted communities and emergency management agencies
develop better preparedness and response strategies with improved situational awareness of road
inundation likelihood as an extreme weather event unfolds.

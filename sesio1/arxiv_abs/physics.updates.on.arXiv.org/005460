Spatio-temporal pattern formation in complex systems presents rich nonlinear dynamics which
leads to the emergence of periodic nonequilibrium structures. One of the most prominent equations
for the theoretical and numerical study of the evolution of these textures is the Swift-Hohenberg
(SH) equation, which presents a bifurcation parameter (forcing) that controls the dynamics by
changing the energy landscape of the system, and has been largely employed in phase-field models.
Though a large part of the literature on pattern formation addresses uniformly forced systems,
nonuniform forcings are also observed in several natural systems, for instance, in developmental
biology and in soft matter applications. In these cases, an orientation effect due to forcing gradients
is a new factor playing a role in the development of patterns, particularly in the class of stripe
patterns, which we investigate through the nonuniformly forced SH dynamics. The present work addresses
amplitude instability of stripe textures induced by forcing gradients, and the competition between
the orientation effect of the gradient and other bulk, boundary, and geometric effects taking part
in the selection of the emerging patterns. A weakly nonlinear analysis suggests that stripes are
stable with respect to small amplitude perturbations when aligned with the gradient, and become
unstable to such perturbations when when aligned perpendicularly to the gradient. This analysis
is vastly complemented by a numerical work that accounts for other effects, confirming that forcing
gradients drive stripe alignment, or even reorient them from preexisting conditions. However,
we observe that the orientation effect does not always prevail in the face of competing effects,
whose hierarchy is suggested to depend on the magnitude of the forcing gradient.

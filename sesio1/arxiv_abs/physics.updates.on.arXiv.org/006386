Objective: Numerical modeling of electric fields induced by transcranial alternating current
stimulation (tACS) is currently a part of the standard procedure to predict and understand neural
response. Quasi-static approximation for electric field calculations is generally applied to
reduce the computational cost. This study aims to analyze and quantify the validity of the approximation
over a broad frequency range. Methods: We performed electromagnetic modeling studies using an
anatomical head models. We considered approximations assuming either a purely ohmic medium (i.e.,
static formulation) or a lossy dielectric medium (quasi-static formulation). The results were
compared with the solution of Maxwell's equations for the cases of harmonic and pulsed signals.
Finally, we analyzed the effect of electrode positioning on these errors. Results: Our findings
demonstrate that the quasi-static approximation is valid and produces a relative error below 1%
up to 1.43 MHz. The largest error is introduced in the static case, where the error is over 1% across
the entire considered spectrum and as high as 20% in the brain at 10 Hz. Finally, we highlight the special
importance of considering the capacitive effect of tissues for pulsed waveforms, which allows
to avoid significant signal distortion induced by the purely ohmic approximation. Conclusion:
Quasi-static approximation remains valid in the frequency range currently used for tACS. However,
neglecting the permittivity introduces significant error for both harmonic and non-harmonic
signals. Significance: The results point out that reliable low frequency dielectric data are needed
for tCS numerical modeling. Quasi-static approximation should be favored over the static one given
the low additional computational cost.

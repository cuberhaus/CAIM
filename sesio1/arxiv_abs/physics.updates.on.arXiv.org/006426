CT perfusion imaging (CTP) is used in the diagnostic workup of acute ischemic stroke (AIS). CTP may
be performed within the angio suite using flat detector CT (FDCT) to help reduce patient management
time. In order to significantly improve FDCT perfusion (FDCTP) imaging, data-processing algorithms
need to be able to compensate for the higher levels of noise, slow rotation speed, and a lower frame
rate of current FDCT devices. We performed a realistic simulation of FDCTP acquisition based on
CTP data from seven subjects. We used the time separation technique (TST) as a model-based approach
for FDCTP data processing. We propose a novel dimension reduction in which we approximate the time
attenuation curves by a linear combination of trigonometric functions. Our goal was to show that
the TST can be used even without prior assumptions on the shape of the attenuation profiles. We first
demonstrated that a trigonometric basis is suitable for dimension reduction of perfusion data.
Using simulated FDCTP data, we have shown that a trigonometric basis in the TST provided better results
than the classical straightforward processing even with additional noise. Average correlation
coefficients of perfusion maps were improved for cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume,
mean transit time (MTT) maps. In a moderate noise scenario, the average Pearson's coefficient for
the CBF map was improved using the TST from 0.76 to 0.81. For the MTT map, it was improved from 0.37 to
0.45. Furthermore, we achieved a total processing time from the reconstruction of FDCTP data to
the generation of perfusion maps of under 5 min. In our study cohort, perfusion maps created from
FDCTP data using the TST with a trigonometric basis showed equivalent perfusion deficits to classic
CT perfusion maps. It follows, that this novel FDCTP technique has potential to provide fast and
accurate FDCTP imaging for AIS patients.

For the numerical simulation of earth system models, Arakawa grids are largely employed. A quadrilateral
mesh is assumed for their classical definition, and different types of grids are identified depending
on the location of the discretized quantities. The B-grid has both velocity components at the center
of a cell, the C-grid places the velocity components on the edges in a staggered fashion, and the D-grid
is a ninety-degree rotation of a C-grid. Historically, B-grid formulations of sea ice dynamics
have been dominant because they have matched the grid type used by ocean models. In recent years,
as ocean models have increasingly progressed to C-grids, sea ice models have followed suit on quadrilateral
meshes, but few if any implementations of unstructured C-grid sea ice models have been developed.
In this work, we present an unstructured CD-grid type formulation of the elastic-viscous-plastic
rheology, where the velocity unknowns are located at the edges, rather than at the vertices, as in
the B-grid. The notion of a CD-grid has been recently introduced and assumes that the velocity components
are co-located at the edges. The mesh cells in our analysis have $n$ sides, with $n$ greater than or
equal to four. Numerical results are included to investigate the features of the proposed method.
Our framework of choice is the Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS) within E3SM, the climate
model of the U.S. Department of Energy, although our approach is general and could be applied to other
models as well. While MPAS-Seaice is currently defined on a B-grid, MPAS-Ocean runs on a C-grid,
hence interpolation operators are heavily used when coupled simulations are performed. The discretization
introduced here aims at transitioning the dynamics of MPAS-Seaice to a CD-grid, to ultimately facilitate
improved coupling with MPAS-Ocean and reduce numerical errors associated with this communication.

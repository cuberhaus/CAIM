Cardiac disease and clinical intervention may both lead to an increased risk for thrombosis events
due to modified blood flow in the heart, and thereby a change in the mechanical stimuli of blood cells
passing through the chambers of the heart. Specifically, the degree of platelet activation is influenced
by the level and type of mechanical stresses in the blood flow. Here we analyze the blood flow in the
left ventricle of the heart through a computational model constructed from patient-specific data.
The blood flow in the ventricle is modeled by the Navier-Stokes equations, and the flow through the
mitral valve by a parameterized model which represents the projected opening of the valve. A finite
element method is used to solve the equations, from which a simulation of the velocity and pressure
of the blood flow is constructed. A triple decomposition of the velocity gradient tensor is then
used to distinguish between rigid body rotational flow, irrotational straining flow, and shear
flow. The triple decomposition enables the separation of three fundamentally different flow structures,
each generating a distinct type of mechanical stimulus on the blood cells in the flow. We compare
the results to simulations where a mitral valve clip intervention is modelled, which leads to a significant
modification of the ventricular flow. It was found that the shear in the simulation cases treated
with clips increased more compared to the untreated case than the rotation and strain did. A decrease
in valve opening area of 64 % in one of the cases led to a 90 % increase in rotation and strain, but a 150
% increase in shear. The computational analysis suggests a process for patient-specific simulation
of clinical interventions in the heart with a detailed analysis of the resulting blood flow, which
could support clinical risk assessment with respect to platelet activation and thrombosis events.

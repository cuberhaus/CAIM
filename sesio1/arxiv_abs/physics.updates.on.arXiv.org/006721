Aerobreakup of fluid droplets under the influence of impulsively generated high-speed gas flow
using an open-ended shock tube is studied using experiments and numerical simulations. Breakup
of mm-sized droplets at high Weber number was analyzed for water and two-phase nanofluids consisting
of dispersions of Al2O3 and TiO2 nanoparticles in water with high loading of 20 and 40 weight % respectively.
Droplet breakup is visualized using high-speed imaging in the experimental setup, where an open
ended shock tube generates impulsive high-speed flow impinging on a droplet held stationary using
an acoustic levitator. Axisymmetric simulations using the Volume of Fluid technique are conducted
to capture the gas dynamics of the flowfield and droplet deformation at the initial stages. Fluid
droplets are subject to a transient flow field generated by the open ended shock tube, characterized
by a propagating incident shock wave, a recirculating vortex ring, and standing shock cells. Droplet
breakup for all fluids proceeds through an initial flattening of the droplet followed by generation
of a liquid sheet at the periphery in the presence of a curved, detached shock front at the leading
edge. The breakup appears to follow a sheet stripping process whereby stretched ligaments undergo
secondary atomization through viscous shear. Mist generated in the wake of the droplet appears
to expand laterally due to the unconstrained expansion of the high-speed gas jet. The breakup morphology
of droplets for all fluids appears consistent with previous observations using conventional shock
tubes. Lateral deformation of the coherent droplet mass is observed to be higher for nanofluids
as compared to water. This is attributed to higher viscosity and Ohnesorge number of nanofluid droplets,
which results in delayed breakup and increased lateral stretching.

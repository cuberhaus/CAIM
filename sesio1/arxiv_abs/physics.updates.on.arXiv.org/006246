The High Energy Physics community can benefit from a natural synergy in research activities into
next-generation large-scale water and scintillator neutrino detectors, now being studied for
remote reactor monitoring, discovery and exclusion applications in cooperative nonproliferation
contexts. Since approximately 2010, US nonproliferation researchers, supported by the National
Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), have been studying a range of possible applications of
relatively large (100 ton) to very large (hundreds of kiloton) water and scintillator neutrino
detectors. This work has been motivated by an NNSA strategic goal of demonstrating the capability
to remotely monitor nuclear reactors using antineutrinos. In parallel, the fundamental physics
community has been developing detectors at similar scales and with similar design features for
a range of high-priority physics topics, primarily in fundamental neutrino physics. These topics
include neutrino oscillation studies at beams and reactors, solar, and geological neutrino measurements,
supernova studies, and others. Examples of ongoing synergistic work at U.S. national laboratories
and universities include prototype gadolinium-doped water and water-based and opaque scintillator
test-beds and demonstrators, extensive testing and industry partnerships related to large area
fast position-sensitive photomultiplier tubes, and a proposed underground kiloton-scale water-based
detector for reactor monitoring and technology demonstrations at the Morton Salt mine in Ohio.
Some opportunities for engagement between the two communities include bi-annual Applied Antineutrino
Physics conferences, collaboration with U.S. National Laboratories engaging in this research,
and occasional NNSA funding opportunities supporting a blend of nonproliferation and basic science
R&D, directed at the U.S. academic community.

A fundamental challenge in the design of photonic devices, and electromagnetic structures more
generally, is the optimization of their overall architecture to achieve a desired response. To
this end, topology or shape optimizers based on the adjoint variables method have been widely adopted
due to their high computational efficiency and ability to create complex freeform geometries.
However, the functional understanding of such freeform structures remains a black box. Moreover,
unless a design space of high-performance devices is known in advance, such gradient-based optimizers
can get trapped in local minima valleys or saddle points, which limits performance achievable through
this inverse design process. To elucidate the relationships between device performance and nanoscale
structuring while mitigating the effects of local minima trapping, we present an inverse design
framework that combines adjoint optimization, automated machine learning (AutoML), and explainable
artificial intelligence (XAI). Integrated with a numerical electromagnetics simulation method,
our framework reveals structural contributions towards a figure-of-merit (FOM) of interest.
Through an explanation-based reoptimization process, this information is then leveraged to minimize
the FOM further than that obtained through adjoint optimization alone, thus overcoming the optimization's
local minima. We demonstrate our framework in the context of waveguide design and achieve between
39% and 74% increases in device performance relative to state-of-the-art adjoint optimization-based
inverse design across a range of telecom wavelengths. Results of this work therefore highlight
machine learning strategies that can substantially extend and enhance the capabilities of a conventional,
optimization-based inverse design algorithm while revealing deeper insights into the algorithm's
designs.

Results on the effects of ionizing radiation on the signal produced by plastic scintillating rods
manufactured by Eljen Technology company are presented for various matrix materials, dopant concentrations,
fluors (EJ-200 and EJ-260), anti-oxidant concentrations, scintillator thickness, doses, and
dose rates. The light output before and after irradiation is measured using an alpha source and a
photomultiplier tube, and the light transmission by a spectrophotometer. Assuming an exponential
decrease in the light output with dose, the change in light output is quantified using the exponential
dose constant $D$. The $D$ values are similar for primary and secondary doping concentrations of
1 and 2 times, and for antioxidant concentrations of 0, 1, and 2 times, the default manufacturer's
concentration. The $D$ value depends approximately linearly on the logarithm of the dose rate for
dose rates between 2.2 Gy/hr and 70 Gy/hr for all materials. For EJ-200 polyvinyltoluene-based
(PVT) scintillator, the dose constant is approximately linear in the logarithm of the dose rate
up to 3400 Gy/hr, while for polystyrene-based (PS) scintillator or for both materials with EJ-260
fluors, it remains constant or decreases (depending on doping concentration) above about 100 Gy/hr.
The results from rods of varying thickness and from the different fluors suggest damage to the initial
light output is a larger effect than color center formation for scintillator thickness $\leq1$
cm. For the blue scintillator (EJ-200), the transmission measurements indicate damage to the fluors.
We also find that while PVT is more resistant to radiation damage than PS at dose rates higher than
about 100 Gy/hr for EJ-200 fluors, they show similar damage at lower dose rates and for EJ-260 fluors.

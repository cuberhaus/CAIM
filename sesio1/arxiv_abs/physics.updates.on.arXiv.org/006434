The reconstruction of electrons and photons in CMS depends on topological clustering of the energy
deposited by an incident particle in different crystals of the electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL).
These clusters are formed by aggregating neighbouring crystals according to the expected topology
of an electromagnetic shower in the ECAL. The presence of upstream material (beampipe, tracker
and support structures) causes electrons and photons to start showering before reaching the calorimeter.
This effect, combined with the 3.8T CMS magnetic field, leads to energy being spread in several clusters
around the primary one. It is essential to recover the energy contained in these satellite clusters
in order to achieve the best possible energy resolution for physics analyses. Historically satellite
clusters have been associated to the primary cluster using a purely topological algorithm which
does not attempt to remove spurious energy deposits from additional pileup interactions (PU).
The performance of this algorithm is expected to degrade during LHC Run 3 (2022+) because of the larger
average PU levels and the increasing levels of noise due to the ageing of the ECAL detector. New methods
are being investigated that exploit state-of-the-art deep learning architectures like Graph
Neural Networks (GNN) and self-attention algorithms. These more sophisticated models improve
the energy collection and are more resilient to PU and noise, helping to preserve the electron and
photon energy resolution achieved during LHC Runs 1 and 2. This work will cover the challenges of
training the models as well the opportunity that this new approach offers to unify the ECAL energy
measurement with the particle identification steps used in the global CMS photon and electron reconstruction.

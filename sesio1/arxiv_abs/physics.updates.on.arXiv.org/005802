This paper describes the development and validation of a Monte Carlo (MC) dose computing module
dedicated to organ dose calculations of patients undergoing nuclear medicine (NM) internal radiation
exposures involving 18F-FDG PET/CT examination. This new module extends the more-than-10-years-long
ARCHER project that developed a GPU-accelerated MC dose engine by adding dedicated NM source-definition
features. To validate the code, we compared dose distributions from the 0.511-MeV point photon
source calculated for a water phantom as well as a patient PET/CT phantom against a well-tested MC
code, GATE. The water-phantom results show excellent agreement, suggesting that the radiation
physics module in the new NM code is adequate. To demonstrate the clinical utility and advantage
of ARCHER-NM, one set of PET/CT data for an adult male NM patient is calculated using the new code.
Radiosensitive organs in the CT dataset are segmented using a CNN-based tool called DeepViewer.
The PET image intensity maps are converted to radioactivity distributions to allow for MC radiation
transport dose calculations at the voxel level. The dose rate maps and corresponding statistical
uncertainties were calculated for the duration of PET image acquisition. The dose rate results
of the 18F-FDG PET imaging patient show that ARCHER-NM's results agree very well with those of the
GATE within 0.58% to 4.11%. Most impressively, ARCHER-NM obtains such results in less than 0.5 minutes
while it takes GATE as much as 376 minutes. This is the first study presenting GPU-accelerated patient-specific
MC internal radiation dose rate calculations for clinically realistic 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging
cases involving auto-segmentation of whole-body PET/CT images. This study suggests that modern
computing tools -- ARCHER-NM and DeepViewer -- are accurate and fast enough for routine internal
dosimetry in NM clinics.

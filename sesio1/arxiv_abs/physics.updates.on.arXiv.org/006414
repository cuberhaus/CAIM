A search for the $P$- and $CP(T)$-violating electric dipole moments (EDM) of atoms, particles and
nuclei with sensitivity up to $10^{-15}$ in units of magnetic dipole moments, allowed by all discrete
symmetries, is one of the topical problems of modern physics. According to Sakharov, $CP$-violation
is one of the three key criteria of baryogenesis in generally accepted paradigm of the Big Bang cosmology.
All three criteria are supported by the Standard Model (SM), but it fails to describe the observed
baryon asymmetry of the Universe. This is regarded a strong argument in favor of existence of $CP$-symmetry
breaking mechanisms beyond minimal SM, which can lead to measurable EDMs of atoms, particles and
nuclei. Direct searches for EDM of charged particles and nuclei are possible only in storage rings
(COSY, NICA). After successful studies by the JEDI collaboration at the COSY synchrotron, at the
forefront is a search for the proton EDM in an electrostatic storage ring with the proton spin frozen
at the magic energy with projected sensitivity $d_p\sim 10^{-29}\,e\cdot$cm. Following a brief
introduction to the $CP$-violation physics and the baryogenesis, the review presents a detailed
discussion of significant contributions to the spin dynamics from the terrestrial gravity along
with the new effects of Earth's rotation in ultrasensitive searches for the EDM of charged particles
and neutrons. Quite remarkably, for the projected sensitivity to the proton EDM, these false EDM
effects can by one to two orders of magnitude exceed the signal of the proton EDM, and become comparable
to an EDM contribution in experiments with ultracold neutrons. We also discuss the role of a precessing
spin as a detector of the axion-like dark matter, and consider applications of the quantum gravitational
anomalies to the dense matter hydrodynamics and the spin phenomena in the non-central nuclear collisions.

We present a generalized hydrodynamic stability theory for interacting particles in polydisperse
particle-laden flows. The addition of dispersed particulate matter to a clean flow can either stabilize
or destabilize the flow, depending on the particles' relaxation time-scale relative to the carrier
flow time scales and the particle loading. To study the effects of polydispersity and particle interactions
on the hydrodynamic stability of shear flows, we propose a new mathematical framework by combining
a linear stability analysis and a discrete Eulerian sectional formulation to describe the flow
and the dispersed particulate matter. In this formulation, multiple momentum and transport equations
are written for each size-section of the dispersed phase, where interphase and inter-particle
mass and momentum transfer are modelled as source terms in the governing equations. A new modal linear
stability framework is derived by linearizing the coupled equations. Using this approach, particle-flow
interactions, such as polydispersity, droplet vaporization, condensation, and coalescence,
may be modelled. The method is validated with linear stability analyses of clean and monodisperse
particle-laden flows. We show that the stability characteristics of a channel flow laden with particles
drastically change due to polydispersity. While relatively large monodisperse particles tend
to stabilize the flow, adding a second size section of a very small mass fraction of low-to-moderate
Stokes number particles may significantly increase the growth rates, and for high-Reynolds numbers
may destabilize flows that might have been regarded as linearly stable in the monodisperse case.
These findings may apply to a vast number of fluid mechanics applications involving particle-laden
flows such as atmospheric flows, environmental flows, medical applications, propulsion, and
energy systems.

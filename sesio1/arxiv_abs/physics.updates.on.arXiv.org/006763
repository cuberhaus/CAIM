Due to the irregular space-time sampling of sea surface observations, the reconstruction of sea
surface dynamics is a challenging inverse problem. While satellite altimetry provides a direct
observation of the sea surface height (SSH), which relates to the divergence-free component of
sea surface currents, the associated sampling pattern prevents from retrieving fine-scale sea
surface dynamics, typically below a 10-day time scale. By contrast, other satellite sensors provide
higher-resolution observations of sea surface tracers such as sea surface temperature (SST).
Multimodal inversion schemes then arise as an appealing strategy. Though theoretical evidence
supports the existence of an explicit relationship between sea surface temperature and sea surface
dynamics under specific dynamical regimes, the generalization to the variety of upper ocean dynamical
regimes is complex. Here, we investigate this issue from a physics-informed learning perspective.
We introduce a trainable multimodal inversion scheme for the reconstruction of sea surface dynamics
from multi-source satellite-derived observations. The proposed 4DVarNet schemes combine a variational
formulation involving trainable observation and a priori terms with a trainable gradient-based
solver. We report an application to the reconstruction of the divergence-free component of sea
surface dynamics from satellite-derived SSH and SST data. An observing system simulation experiment
for a Gulf Stream region supports the relevance of our approach compared with state-of-the-art
schemes. We report relative improvement greater than 50% compared with the operational altimetry
product in terms of root mean square error and resolved space-time scales. We discuss further the
application and extension of the proposed approach for the reconstruction and forecasting of geophysical
dynamics from irregularly-sampled satellite observations.

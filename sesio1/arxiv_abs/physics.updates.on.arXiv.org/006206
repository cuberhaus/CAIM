Functionalized metal nanoparticles (NPs) have been proposed as promising radiosensitizing agents
for more efficient radiotherapy treatment using photons and ion beams. Radiosensitizing properties
of NPs may depend on many different parameters (such as size, composition and density) of the metal
core, organic coatings and the molecular environment. A systematic exploration of each of these
parameters on the atomistic level remains a costly experimental task but it can be addressed by means
of advanced computational modeling. This paper outlines a detailed computational procedure for
the construction and atomistic-level characterization of radiosensitizing metal NPs in explicit
molecular media. The procedure is general and extensible to many different combinations of the
core, coating and environment. As an illustrative and experimentally relevant case study, we consider
nanometre-sized gold NPs coated with thiol-poly(ethylene glycol)-amine molecules of different
length and surface density and solvated in water at ambient conditions. Radial distribution of
different atoms in the coatings as well as distribution and structural properties of water around
the coated NPs are analyzed and linked to radiosensitizing properties of the NPs. It is revealed
that the structure of the coating layer on the solvated NPs depends strongly on the surface density
of ligands. At surface densities below $\sim$3 molecules/nm$^{2}$ the coating represents a mixture
of different conformation states, whereas elongated "brush"-like structures are formed at higher
densities of ligands. The water content in denser coatings is significantly lower at distances
from 1 to 3 nm from the gold surface depending on the length of ligands. Such dense and thick coatings
may suppress the production of hydroxyl radicals by low-energy electrons emitted from the metal
NPs and thus diminish their radiosensitizing properties.

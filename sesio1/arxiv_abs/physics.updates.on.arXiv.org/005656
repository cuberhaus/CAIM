We consider lithological tomography in which the posterior distribution of (hydro)geological
parameters of interest is inferred from geophysical data by treating the intermediate geophysical
properties as latent variables. In such a latent variable model, one needs to estimate the intractable
likelihood of the (hydro)geological parameters given the geophysical data. The pseudo-marginal
method is an adaptation of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm in which an unbiased approximation
of this likelihood is obtained by Monte Carlo averaging over samples from, in this setting, the noisy
petrophysical relationship linking (hydro)geological and geophysical properties. To make the
method practical in data-rich geophysical settings with low noise levels, we demonstrate that
the Monte Carlo sampling must rely on importance sampling distributions that well approximate
the posterior distribution of petrophysical scatter around the sampled (hydro)geological parameter
field. To achieve a suitable acceptance rate, we rely both on (1) the correlated pseudo-marginal
method, which correlates the samples used in the proposed and current states of the Markov chain,
and (2) a model proposal scheme that preserves the prior distribution. As a synthetic test example,
we infer porosity fields using crosshole ground-penetrating radar (GPR) first-arrival travel
times. We use a (50x50)-dimensional pixel-based parameterization of the multi-Gaussian porosity
field with known statistical parameters, resulting in a parameter space of high dimension. We demonstrate
that the correlated pseudo-marginal method with our proposed importance sampling and prior-preserving
proposal scheme outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in both linear and non-linear settings
by greatly enhancing the posterior exploration.

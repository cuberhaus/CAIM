High dose-rate brachytherapy (HDRBT) is widely used for gynecological cancer treatment. Although
commercial treatment planning systems (TPSs) have inverse optimization modules, it takes several
iterations to adjust planning objectives to achieve a satisfactory plan. Interactive plan-modification
modules enable modifying the plan and visualizing results in real time, but they update plans based
on simple geometrical or heuristic algorithms, which cannot ensure resulting plan optimality.
This project develops an interactive plan optimization module for HDRBT of gynecological cancer.
By efficiently solving an optimization problem in real time, it allows a user to visualize a plan
and interactively modify it to improve quality. We formulated an optimization problem with an objective
function containing a weighted sum of doses to normal organs subject to user-specified target coverage.
A user interface was developed that allows a user to adjust organ weights using scroll bars. With
a simple mouse click, the optimization problem is solved in seconds with a highly efficient alternating-direction
method of multipliers and a warm start optimization strategy. Resulting clinically relevant D2cc
of organs are displayed immediately. This allows a user to intuitively adjust plans with satisfactory
quality. We tested the effectiveness of our development in cervix cancer cases treated with a tandem-and-ovoid
applicator. It took a maximum of 3 seconds to solve the optimization problem in each instance. With
interactive optimization capability, a satisfactory plan can be obtained in <1 min. In our clinic,
although the time for plan adjustment was typically <10min with simple interactive plan modification
tools in TPS, the resulting plans do not ensure optimality. Our plans achieved on average 5% lower
D2cc than clinical plans, while maintaining target coverage.

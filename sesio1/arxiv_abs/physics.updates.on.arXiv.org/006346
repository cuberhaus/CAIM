The outward propagation of asymmetries introduced to originally axisymmetric turbulent flows
is investigated, where 3D Batchelor vortices at high Reynolds numbers and with arbitrary swirl
numbers are chosen as test cases. It is well known that disturbances (asymmetries) added to a 2D axisymmetric
flow propagate radially outward, in order to re-axisymmetrize the vortex, but cease to travel at
a critical distance, known as the stagnation radius. We utilize direct numerical simulations (DNS)
and an inviscid model developed by linearizing the momentum and vorticity transport equations
around the base (unperturbed) flow in helical coordinates to demonstrate that, in contrast with
2D cases, 3D vortices enable the unbounded radial propagation of asymmetries. We further apply
the Wenzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) analysis to the linear model, treating perturbations as compact
wavepackets, to transform the PDEs of the linear model to a few ODEs. However it has been shown in the
climate science community that the WKB approach ubiquitously predicts stagnation radii and heights
for disturbances introduced to 3D cyclone-like vortices, here, we identify a narrow range of parameters,
for which the WKB analysis also supports an unrestrained propagation for disturbances. Finally,
the mechanisms governing the momentum transport at different stages and locations, thereby promoting
the outward advection of perturbations, are elucidated using the the linear rapid distortion theory
and numerical simulations. Since the DNS of the full Navier-Stokes equations rapidly stabilizes
to a laminar configuration, the DNS of the linearized transport equations and the nonlinear governing
equations without base-flow interactions are also conducted, in order to uncover the primary mechanisms
for the growth and radial propagation of perturbations as well as the nonlinear processes causing
growth arrest at fixed swirl numbers.

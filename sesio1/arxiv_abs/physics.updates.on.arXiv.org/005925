The progress of membrane technology with the development of membranes with controlled parameters
led to porous membranes. These membranes can be formed using different methods and have numerous
applications in science and technology. Anodization of aluminum in this aspect is an electro-synthetic
process that changes the surface of the metal through oxidation to deliver an anodic oxide layer.
This process results in a self-coordinated, exceptional cluster of round and hollow formed pores
with controllable pore widths, periodicity, and thickness. After the initial introduction, the
paper proceeds with a brief overview of anodizing process. That engages anodic aluminum oxide (AAO)
layers to be used as formats in various nanotechnology applications without the necessity for expensive
lithographical systems. This review article surveys the current status of the investigation on
AAO membranes. A comprehensive analysis is performed on AAO membranes in applications; filtration,
sensors, drug delivery, template-assisted growth of various nanostructures. Their multiple
usages in nanotechnology have also been discussed to gather nanomaterials and devices or unite
them into specific applications, such as nano-electronic gadgets, channel layers, and clinical
platforms tissue designing. From this review, the fact that the specified enhancement of properties
of AAO can be done by varying geometric parameters of AAO has been highlighted. No review paper focused
on a detailed discussion of applications of AAO with prospects and challenges. This review paper
represents the formation, properties, applications with objective consideration of the prospects
and challenges of AAO applications. The prospects may appeal to researchers to promote the development
of unique membranes with functionalization and controlled geometric parameters and check the
feasibility of the AAO membranes in nano-devices.

Bow-tie structures were introduced to describe the World Wide Web: in the direct network in which
the nodes are the websites and the edges are the hyperlinks connecting them, the greatest number
of nodes take part to a bow-tie, i.e. a Weakly Connected Component (WCC) composed of 3 main sectors:
IN, OUT and SCC. SCC is the main Strongly Connected Component of WCC: it contains the greatest subgraph
in which each node is reachable by any other one in the subgraph. The IN and OUT sectors are the set of
nodes not included in SCC that, respectively, can access and are accessible to nodes in SCC. In SCC
the greatest part of the websites can be found, while the search engines belongs to IN, and the authorities,
as Wikipedia, are in OUT. In the analysis of Twitter debate, the recent literature focused on discursive
communities, i.e. clusters of accounts interacting among themselves via retweets. In the present
work, we studied discursive communities in 8 different thematic Twitter data sets in various languages.
Surprisingly, we observed that almost all discursive communities therein display a bow-tie structure
during political or societal debates. Instead, they are absent when the argument of the discussion
is different as sport events, as in the case of Euro2020 Turkish and Italian data sets. We furthermore
analysed the quality of the content created in the various sectors, using the domain annotation
from the fact-checking website Newsguard: it turns out that content with the lowest quality is the
ones produced and shared in SCC. In this sense, in discursive communities displaying great OUT blocks,
the greatest part of the accounts has access to a great variety of contents, but their quality is,
in general, quite low, creating the phenomenon known as infodemic. In the present paper, we correlate
the presence of an infodemic to a peculiar network structure, i.e. a OUT-dominant bow-tie.

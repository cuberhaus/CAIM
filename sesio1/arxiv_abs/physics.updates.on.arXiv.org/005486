Thermoelectric materials have attracted more and more attention since they are friendly to the
environment and have potentials for sustainable and renewable energy applications. As typically
brittle semiconductors with low mechanical strength and always subjected to defects and damages,
to clarify the stress concentration is very important in the design and implement of thermoelectric
devices. The two-dimensional thermoelectric coupling problem due to a cavity embedded in an infinite
isotropic homogeneous thermoelectric material, subjected to uniform electric current density
or uniform energy flux, is studied, where the shape of the cavity is characterized by the Laurent
polynomial, and the electric insulated and adiabatic boundary around the cavity are considered.
The explicit analytic solutions of Kolosov-Muskhelishvili (K-M) potentials and rigid-body translation
are carried out through a novel tactic. Comparing with the reported results, the new obtained are
completely exact and possess a finite form. Some results of three typical cavities are presented
to analyze the electric current densities (energy fluxes) and stresses around the tips. The main
conclusions include: the distribution of thermoelectric field and stress at the tip obviously
depends on the curvature of the contour and loading directions; for triangle and square with symmetrical
tips, the maximum thermoelectric and stress concentration reach the maximum or minimum when the
loading direction is parallel to or perpendicular to the symmetry axis of the tip, which is distinct
to the extremum characteristics of pentagram with bimodal of curvature around the tip; the maximum
thermoelectric and stress concentration appear near the maximum curvature point for most load
directions, but not at the maximum curvature point.

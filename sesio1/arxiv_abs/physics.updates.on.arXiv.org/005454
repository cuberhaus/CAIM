To rapidly obtain high resolution T2, T2* and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) source
separation maps with whole-brain coverage and high geometric fidelity. We propose Blip Up-Down
Acquisition for Spin And Gradient Echo imaging (BUDA-SAGE), an efficient echo-planar imaging
(EPI) sequence for quantitative mapping. The acquisition includes multiple T2*-, T2'- and T2-weighted
contrasts. We alternate the phase-encoding polarities across the interleaved shots in this multi-shot
navigator-free acquisition. A field map estimated from interim reconstructions was incorporated
into the joint multi-shot EPI reconstruction with a structured low rank constraint to eliminate
geometric distortion. A self-supervised MR-Self2Self (MR-S2S) neural network (NN) was utilized
to perform denoising after BUDA reconstruction to boost SNR. Employing Slider encoding allowed
us to reach 1 mm isotropic resolution by performing super-resolution reconstruction on BUDA-SAGE
volumes acquired with 2 mm slice thickness. Quantitative T2 and T2* maps were obtained using Bloch
dictionary matching on the reconstructed echoes. QSM was estimated using nonlinear dipole inversion
(NDI) on the gradient echoes. Starting from the estimated R2 and R2* maps, R2' information was derived
and used in source separation QSM reconstruction, which provided additional para- and dia-magnetic
susceptibility maps. In vivo results demonstrate the ability of BUDA-SAGE to provide whole-brain,
distortion-free, high-resolution multi-contrast images and quantitative T2 and T2* maps, as
well as yielding para- and dia-magnetic susceptibility maps. Derived quantitative maps showed
comparable values to conventional mapping methods in phantom and in vivo measurements. BUDA-SAGE
acquisition with self-supervised denoising and Slider encoding enabled rapid, distortion-free,
whole-brain T2, T2* mapping at 1 mm3 isotropic resolution in 90 seconds.

Fragmentation is an important decay mechanism for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) under
harsh interstellar conditions and represents a possible formation pathway for small molecules
such as H2, C2H2, C2H4. Our aim is to investigate the dissociation mechanism of superhydrogenated
PAHs that undergo energetic processing and the formation pathway of small hydrocarbons. We obtain,
experimentally, the mass distribution of protonated tetrahydropyrene (C16H15 , py+5H+) and protonated
hexahydropyrene (C16H17+, py+7H+) upon collision induced dissociation (CID). The IR spectra
of their main fragments are recorded by infrared multiple-photon dissociation (IRMPD). Extended
tight-binding (GFN2-xTB) based molecular dynamics simulations are performed in order to provide
the missing structure information in experiment and identify fragmentation pathways. The pathways
for fragmentation are further investigated at a hybrid-density functional theory (DFT) and dispersion
corrected level. A strong signal for loss of 28 mass units of py+7H+ is observed both in the CID experiment
and the MD simulation, while py+5H+ shows negligible signal for the product corresponding to a mass
loss of 28. The 28 mass loss from py+7H+ is assigned to the loss of ethylene (C2H4) and a good fit between
the calculated and experimental IR spectrum of the resulting fragment species is obtained. Further
DFT calculations show favorable kinetic pathways for loss of C2H4 from hydrogenated PAH configurations
involving three consecutive CH2 molecular entities. This joint experimental and theoretical
investigation proposes a chemical pathway of ethylene formation from fragmentation of superhydrogenated
PAHs. This pathway is sensitive to hydrogenated edges (e.g. the degree of hydrogenation and the
hydrogenated positions). The inclusion of this pathway in astrochemical models may improve the
estimated abundance of ethylene.

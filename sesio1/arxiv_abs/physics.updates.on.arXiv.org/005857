We propose two methods to calibrate the parameters of the epidemic-type aftershock sequence (ETAS)
model based on expectation maximization (EM) while accounting for temporal variation of catalog
completeness. The first method allows for model calibration on long-term earthquake catalogs
with temporal variation of the completeness magnitude, $m_c$. This calibration technique is beneficial
for long-term probabilistic seismic hazard assessment (PSHA), which is often based on a mixture
of instrumental and historical catalogs. The second method generalizes the concept of $m_c$, considering
rate- and magnitude-dependent detection probability, and allows for self-consistent estimation
of ETAS parameters and high-frequency detection incompleteness. With this approach, we aim to
address the potential biases in parameter calibration due to short-term aftershock incompleteness,
embracing incompleteness instead of avoiding it. Using synthetic tests, we show that both methods
can accurately invert the parameters of simulated catalogs. We then use them to estimate ETAS parameters
for California using the earthquake catalog since 1932. To explore how model calibration, inclusion
of small events, and accounting for short-term incompleteness affect earthquakes' predictability,
we systematically compare variants of ETAS models based on the second approach in pseudo-prospective
forecasting experiments for California. Our proposed model significantly outperforms the ETAS
null model, with decreasing information gain for increasing target magnitude threshold. We find
that the ability to include small earthquakes for simulation of future scenarios is the primary
driver of the improvement and that accounting for incompleteness is necessary. Our results have
significant implications for our understanding of earthquake interaction mechanisms and the
future of seismicity forecasting.

A next-generation rare pion decay experiment, PIONEER, is strongly motivated by several inconsistencies
between Standard Model (SM) predictions and data pointing towards the potential violation of lepton
flavor universality. It will probe non-SM explanations of these anomalies through sensitivity
to quantum effects of new particles even if their masses are at very high scales. Measurement of the
charged-pion branching ratio to electrons vs. muons $R_{e/\mu}$ is extremely sensitive to new
physics effects. At present, the SM prediction for $R_{e/\mu}$ is known to 1 part in $10^4$, which
is 15 times more precise than the current experimental result. An experiment reaching the theoretical
accuracy will test lepton flavor universality at an unprecedented level, probing mass scales up
to the PeV range. Measurement of pion beta decay, $\pi^+\to \pi^0 e^+ \nu (\gamma)$, with 3 to 10-fold
improvement in sensitivity, will determine $V_{ud}$ in a theoretically pristine manner and test
CKM unitarity, which is very important in light of the recently emerged tensions. In addition, various
exotic rare decays involving sterile neutrinos and axions will be searched for with unprecedented
sensitivity. The experiment design benefits from experience with the recent PIENU and PEN experiments
at TRIUMF and the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI). Excellent energy and time resolutions, greatly
increased calorimeter depth, high-speed detector and electronics response, large solid angle
coverage, and complete event reconstruction are all critical aspects of the approach. The PIONEER
experiment design includes a 3$\pi$ sr 25 radiation length calorimeter, a segmented low gain avalanche
detector stopping target, a positron tracker, and other detectors. Using intense pion beams, and
state-of-the-art instrumentation and computational resources, the experiments can be performed
at the PSI ring cyclotron.

The halo-mediated inverse mass cascade is a key feature of the intermediate statistically steady
state for self-gravitating collisionless dark matter flow (SG-CFD). A broad spectrum of halos
and halo groups are necessary to form from inverse mass cascade for long-range interaction system
to maximize its entropy. The limiting velocity ($\textbf X$), speed ($\textbf Z$), and energy ($\textbf
E$) distributions of collisionless particles can be obtained analytically from a maximum entropy
principle. Halo mass function, the distribution of total mass in halos, is a fundamental quantity
for structure formation and evolution. Instead of basing mass functions on simplified spherical/elliptical
collapse models, it is possible to reformulate mass function as an intrinsic distribution to maximize
system entropy during the everlasting statistically steady state. Starting from halo-based description
of non-equilibrium dark matter flow, distributions of particle virial dispersion ($\textbf H$),
square of particle velocity ($\textbf P$), and number of halos ($\textbf J$) are proposed. Their
statistical properties and connections with velocity distribution ($\textbf X$) are well studied
and established. With $\textbf H$ being essentially the halo mass function, two limiting cases
of $\textbf H$ distribution are analyzed for large halos ($\textbf H_\infty$) and small halos ($\textbf
H_s$), respectively. For large halos, $\textbf H_\infty$ is shown to also be a maximum entropy distribution.
For small halos, $\textbf H_s$ approximates the $\textbf P$ distribution and recovers the Press-Schechter
mass function. The full solution of $\textbf H$ distribution is determined by the velocity distribution
($\textbf X$) that maximizes system entropy and the exact model of halo velocity dispersion.

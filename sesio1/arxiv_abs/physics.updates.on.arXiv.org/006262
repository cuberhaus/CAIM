A large eddy simulation is performed to study secondary tones generated by a NACA0012 airfoil at
angle of attack of $\alpha = 3^{\circ}$ with freestream Mach number of $M_{\infty} = 0.3$ and Reynolds
number of $Re = 5 \times 10^4$. Laminar separation bubbles are observed over the suction side and
near the trailing edge, on the pressure side. Flow visualization and spectral analysis are employed
to investigate vortex shedding aft of the suction side separation bubble. Vortex interaction results
in merging or bursting such that coherent structures or turbulent packets are advected towards
the trailing edge leading to different levels of noise emission. Despite the intermittent occurrence
of laminar-turbulent transition, the noise spectrum depicts a main tone with multiple equidistant
secondary tones. To understand the role of flow instabilities on the tones, the linearized Navier-Stokes
equations are examined in its operator form through bi-global stability and resolvent analyses,
and by time evolution of disturbances using a matrix-free method. These linear global analyses
reveal amplification of disturbances over the suction side separation bubble. Non-normality
of the linear operator leads to further transient amplification due to modal interaction among
eigenvectors. Two-point, one time autocovariance calculations of pressure along the spanwise
direction elucidate aspects of the acoustic feedback loop mechanism in the non-linear solutions.
This feedback process is self-sustained by acoustic waves radiated from the trailing edge, which
reach the most sensitive flow location between the leading edge and the separation bubble, as identified
by the resolvent analysis. Leading edge disturbances arising from secondary diffraction and phase
interference among the most unstable frequencies computed in the eigenspectrum are also shown
to have an important role in the feedback loop.

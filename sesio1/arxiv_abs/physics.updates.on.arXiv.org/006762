In this study, we analysed a three-dimensional Taylor decaying vortex under an applied magnetic
field as a benchmark test problem to verify the calculation method of an electromagnetic fluid flow
and investigated the validity of the decaying magnetic field model. First, we observed the flow
structure of a three-dimensional Taylor decaying vortex without an applied magnetic field. We
investigated the changes in the error between the calculation result and the exact solution when
the number of grid points and the Reynolds number varied and showed the effectiveness of the benchmark
test. Next, we analysed a three-dimensional Taylor decaying vortex under an applied magnetic field
and clarified the characteristics of the decaying magnetic field. When a magnetic field is applied,
low magnetic pressure regions are connected in a mesh pattern, and the magnetic pressure distribution
with a distorted cubic structure occurs to surround a high magnetic pressure region. In a stagnation
region, the magnetic energy becomes low, and the magnetic flux line is similar to the streamline
of the velocity field. High current densities occur in a grid pattern, and the magnetic flux lines
swirl around the high current density region. The magnetic pressure and magnetic energy are high
in the high current density region. When the Reynolds number and the magnetic Reynolds number vary,
the decay trends of various energies agree well with the exact solution. The transition to turbulent
flow occurs at a high Reynolds number, and the kinetic and total energies decrease rapidly. After
the dissipation rate of kinetic energy becomes maximum, the vortex structure decays, and the flow
field approaches a stationary state without magnetic fields. The three-dimensional Taylor decaying
magnetic field belonging to the Beltrami flow is a valuable model for verifying the calculation
method of electromagnetic fluid flows.

The formation of inorganic cloud particles takes place in several atmospheric environments including
those of warm, hot, rocky and gaseous exoplanets, brown dwarfs, and AGB stars. The cloud particle
formation needs to be triggered by the in-situ formation of condensation seeds since it can not be
assumed that such condensation seeds preexist in these chemically complex gas-phase environments.
We aim to develop a methodology to calculate the thermochemical properties of clusters as key inputs
to model the formation of condensation nuclei in gases of changing chemical composition. TiO$_2$
is used as benchmark species for cluster sizes N = 1 - 15. We create 90000 candidate geometries, for
cluster sizes N = 3 - 15. We employ a hierarchical optimisation approach, consisting of a force field
description, density functional based tight binding (DFTB) and all-electron density functional
theory (DFT) to obtain accurate energies and thermochemical properties for the clusters. We find
B3LYP/cc-pVTZ including Grimmes empirical dispersion to perform most accurately with respect
to experimentally derived thermochemical properties of the TiO$_2$ molecule. We present a hitherto
unreported global minimum candidate for size N = 13. The DFT derived thermochemical cluster data
are used to evaluate the nucleation rates for a given temperature-pressure profile of a model hot
Jupiter atmosphere. We find that with the updated and refined cluster data, nucleation becomes
unfeasible at slightly lower temperatures, raising the lower boundary for seed formation in the
atmosphere. The approach presented in this paper allows to find stable isomers for small (TiO$_2$)$_N$
clusters. The choice of functional and basis set for the all-electron DFT calculations have a measurable
impact on the resulting surface tension and nucleation rate and the updated thermochemical data
is recommended for future considerations.

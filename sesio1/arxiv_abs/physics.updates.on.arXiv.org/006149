Purpose: In this study, we present the creation of an anthropomorphic, head and neck, nuclear medicine
phantom and its characterization for the validation of a Monte Carlo, SPECT image based, Iodine-131
RPT dosimetry workflow. Methods: 3D printing techniques were used to create the anthropomorphic
phantom from a patient CT dataset. Three Iodine-131 SPECT/CT imaging studies were performed using
a homogeneous, Jaszczak, and an anthropomorphic phantom to quantify the SPECT images. The impact
of collimator detector response (CDR) modeling and volume-based partial volume corrections (PVC)
upon the absorbed dose was calculated using an image based, Geant4 Monte Carlo RPT dosimetry workflow
and compared against a ground truth scenario. Finally, uncertainties were quantified in accordance
with recent EANM guidelines. Results: The 3D printed anthropomorphic phantom was an accurate re-creation
of patient anatomy including bone. The extrapolated Jaszczak recovery coefficients were greater
than that of the 3D printed insert (~22.8 ml) for both the CDR and non-CDR cases. Utilizing Jaszczak
phantom PVCs, the absorbed dose was underpredicted by 0.7% and 4.9% without and with CDR, respectively.
Utilizing anthropomorphic phantom RCs overpredicted the absorbed dose by 3% both with and without
CDR. All dosimetry scenarios that incorporated PVC were within the calculated uncertainty of the
activity. The uncertainties in the cumulative activity ranged from 25.6% to 113% for Jaszczak spheres
ranging in volume from 0.5 ml to 16 ml. Conclusion: The accuracy of Monte Carlo-based dosimetry for
Iodine-131 RPT in head and neck cancer was validated with an anthropomorphic phantom. Future applications
of the phantom could involve 3D printing and characterizing patient specific volumes for more personalized
RPT dosimetry estimates.

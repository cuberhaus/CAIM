In recent years, China has made great efforts to control air pollution. During the governance process,
it is found that fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) change in the same trend among some
areas and the opposite in others, which brings some difficulties to take measures in a planned way.
Therefore, this study adopted multi-year and large-scale air quality data to explore the distribution
of correlation between PM2.5 and O3, and proposed a concept called dynamic similar hu lines to replace
the single fixed division in the previous research. Furthermore, this study discussed the causes
of distribution patterns quantitatively with geographical detector and random forest. The causes
included natural factors and anthropogenic factors. And these factors could be divided into three
parts according to the characteristics of spatial distribution: broadly changing with longitude,
changing with latitude, and having local characteristics. Overall, regions with relatively more
densely population, higher GDP, lower altitude, higher humidity, higher atmospheric pressure,
higher surface temperature, less sunshine hours and more accumulated precipitation often corresponds
to positive correlation coefficient between PM2.5 and O3, no matter in which season. The parts with
opposite conditions that mentioned above are essentially negative correlation coefficient.
And what's more, humidity, global surface temperature, air temperature and accumulated precipitation
are four decisive factors to form the distribution of correlation between PM2.5 and O3. In general,
collaborative governance of atmospheric pollutants should consider particular time and space
background and also be based on the local actual socio-economic situations, geography and geomorphology,
climate and meteorology and other comprehensive factors.

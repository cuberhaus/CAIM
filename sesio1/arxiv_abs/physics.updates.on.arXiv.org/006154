This study revisits the absorption and scattering process by which a massless scalar field impinges
on a charged dilatonic black hole. First, we review the classical analysis to obtain the deflection
angle and the differential scattering cross-section. Then, using the partial wave method, we determine
the total absorption cross-section numerically in terms of the decoupling parameter called $M\omega$,
finding that the amplitude of the dilatonic black hole is lower than the Reissner-Nordstr\"om one
for mild frequencies. In the high-frequency limit, the absorption cross-section exhibits two
different complex behaviors; the fine structure and the hyperfine structure. For the differential
scattering cross-section, smaller values of $M\omega$ lead to more significant amplitudes; the
opposite scenario is obtained by increasing the charge-to-mass ratio. To fully grasp the main properties
of the charged dilatonic black hole, we consider a different framework where the compact object
is impinged by a charged massive scalar field. The superradiant effect is lessened for intermediate
frequency concerning the Reissner-Nordstr\"om case. However, this effect does not necessarily
imply the existence of any dynamical instability. In order to trigger the superradiant instability,
unstable modes must remain trapped outside the event horizon with a mechanism based on the reflecting-mirror
boundary conditions. In this way, a charged scalar field plus a charged black hole configure a charged
black hole bomb. We provide an analytic formula (lower bound) for the values of the charge field,
which can trigger this superradiant instability. We extend this minimal setup by considering the
dilaton perturbations while freezing the other degree of freedom. The new perturbation scheme
enhances the superradiance scattering and reduces the lower bound of the charge-to-mass ratio
to develop a superradiant instability.

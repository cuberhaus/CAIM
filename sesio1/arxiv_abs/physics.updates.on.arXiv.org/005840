Methods: A phase space file in a plane at 202 mm downstream of the beam exit window is generated through
tuning parameters to match FDC results with measured or MCNPX Monte Carlo-simulated integrated
depth-dose distribution (IDD) and lateral dose profiles. To spread out the Bragg peak, widen the
beam and reduce the penumbra, a ridge filter (RF), a high-Z material scatterer and a collimator with
compensator are inserted in the beam path and their shapes and sizes have been optimized. The FDC
calculations are validated by comparing Geant4 Monte Carlo simulations. In addition, a set of algorithms
to automatically choose the optimum dimensions of the beam shaping elements is developed and tested
using the same beams. At the last part, dose rates for optimized beams were estimated by scaling their
dose distributions to that of their original beams. Results: The optimized 86.4 MeV beam had an 8.5
mm wide spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP) (proximal 90% to distal 90% of the maximum dose), 14.5 mm, 12.0
mm and 11.0 lateral widths with dose above 50%, 80% and 90% respectively and a 2.5 mm penumbra from
80% to 20% in the lateral profile for the energy. The 159.5 MeV beam had a SOBP of 39.0 mm and the lateral
widths with dose above 50%, 80% and 90% of 20.5 mm, 15.0 and 12.5 mm when the source to surface distance
(SSD) was 550 mm. Wider lateral widths was obtained with increased SSD. The FDC calculations had
passing rates higher than 96% using 3mm/3% as the gamma-index criterion comparing with Geant4 simulations
for both energies. The set of automatic algorithms can choose the proper dimensions for the high-density
scatterer, RF, collimator and compensator efficiently. And the optimized 159.5 MeV beam with different
SDDs had entrance dose rate higher than 40 Gy/s if the entrance dose rate of the original beam was 150
Gy/s.

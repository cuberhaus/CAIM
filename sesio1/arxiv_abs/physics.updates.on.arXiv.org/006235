Ion cyclotron resonance is one of the fundamental energy conversion processes through field-particle
interaction in collisionless plasmas. However, the key evidence for ion cyclotron resonance (i.e.,
the coherence between electromagnetic fields and the ion phase space density) and the resulting
damping of ion cyclotron waves (ICWs) has not yet been directly observed. Investigating the high-quality
measurements of space plasmas by the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) satellites, we find that
both the wave electromagnetic field vectors and the bulk velocity of the disturbed ion velocity
distribution rotate around the background magnetic field. Moreover, we find that the absolute
gyro-phase angle difference between the center of the fluctuations in the ion velocity distribution
functions and the wave electric field vectors falls in the range of (0, 90) degrees, consistent with
the ongoing energy conversion from wave-fields to particles. By invoking plasma kinetic theory,
we demonstrate that the field-particle correlation for the damping ion cyclotron waves in our theoretical
model matches well with our observations. Furthermore, the wave electric field vectors ($\delta
\mathbf{E'}_{\mathrm {wave,\perp}}$), the ion current density ($\delta \mathbf{J}_\mathrm
{i,\perp}$) and the energy transfer rate ($\delta \mathbf{J}_\mathrm {i,\perp}\cdot \delta
\mathbf{E'}_{\mathrm {wave,\perp}}$) exhibit quasi-periodic oscillations, and the integrated
work done by the electromagnetic field on the ions are positive, indicates that ions are mainly energized
by the perpendicular component of the electric field via cyclotron resonance. Therefore, our combined
analysis of MMS observations and kinetic theory provides direct, thorough, and comprehensive
evidence for ICW damping in space plasmas.

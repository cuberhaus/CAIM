Data assimilation presents computational challenges because many high-fidelity models must
be simulated. Various deep-learning-based surrogate modeling techniques have been developed
to reduce the simulation costs associated with these applications. However, to construct data-driven
surrogate models, several thousand high-fidelity simulation runs may be required to provide training
samples, and these computations can make training prohibitively expensive. To address this issue,
in this work we present a framework where most of the training simulations are performed on coarsened
geomodels. These models are constructed using a flow-based upscaling method. The framework entails
the use of a transfer-learning procedure, incorporated within an existing recurrent residual
U-Net architecture, in which network training is accomplished in three steps. In the first step.
where the bulk of the training is performed, only low-fidelity simulation results are used. The
second and third steps, in which the output layer is trained and the overall network is fine-tuned,
require a relatively small number of high-fidelity simulations. Here we use 2500 low-fidelity
runs and 200 high-fidelity runs, which leads to about a 90% reduction in training simulation costs.
The method is applied for two-phase subsurface flow in 3D channelized systems, with flow driven
by wells. The surrogate model trained with multifidelity data is shown to be nearly as accurate as
a reference surrogate trained with only high-fidelity data in predicting dynamic pressure and
saturation fields in new geomodels. Importantly, the network provides results that are significantly
more accurate than the low-fidelity simulations used for most of the training. The multifidelity
surrogate is also applied for history matching using an ensemble-based procedure, where accuracy
relative to reference results is again demonstrated.

Stroke is a leading cause of neurological injury characterized by impairments in multiple neurological
domains including cognition, language, sensory and motor functions. Clinical recovery in these
domains is tracked using a wide range of measures that may be continuous, ordinal, interval or categorical
in nature, which presents challenges for standard multivariate regression approaches. This has
hindered stroke researchers' ability to achieve an integrated picture of the complex time-evolving
interactions amongst symptoms. Here we use tools from network science and machine learning that
are particularly well-suited to extracting underlying patterns in such data, and may assist in
prediction of recovery patterns. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we analyzed data
from the NINDS tPA trial using the Trajectory Profile Clustering (TPC) method to identify distinct
stroke recovery patterns for 11 different neurological domains at 5 discrete time points. Our analysis
identified 3 distinct stroke trajectory profiles that align with clinically relevant stroke syndromes,
characterized both by distinct clusters of symptoms, as well as differing degrees of symptom severity.
We then validated our approach using graph neural networks to determine how well our model performed
predictively for stratifying patients into these trajectory profiles at early vs. later time points
post-stroke. We demonstrate that trajectory profile clustering is an effective method for identifying
clinically relevant recovery subtypes in multidimensional longitudinal datasets, and for early
prediction of symptom progression subtypes in individual patients. This paper is the first work
introducing network trajectory approaches for stroke recovery phenotyping, and is aimed at enhancing
the translation of such novel computational approaches for practical clinical application.

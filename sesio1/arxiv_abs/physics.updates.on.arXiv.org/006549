Non-perturbative and phase-sensitive light-matter interactions have led to the generation of
attosecond pulses of light and the control electrical currents on the same timescale. Traditionally,
probing these effects via high harmonic generation has involved complicated lasers and apparatuses
to generate the few-cycle and high peak power pulses needed to obtain and measure spectra that are
sensitive to the phase of the light wave. Instead, we show that nonlinear effects dependent on the
carrier-envelope phase can be accessed in solid state crystals with simple low-energy frequency
combs that we combine with high-sensitivity demodulation techniques to measure harmonic spectral
modulations. Central to this advance is the use of a scalable 100 MHz Erbium-fiber frequency comb
at 1550 nm to produce 10 nJ, 20 fs pulses which are focused to the TW/cm2 level. In a single pass through
a 500 {\mu}m ZnO crystal this yields harmonic spectra as short as 200 nm. With this system, we introduce
a technique of carrier-envelope amplitude modulation spectroscopy (CAMS) and use it to characterize
the phase-sensitive modulation of the ultraviolet harmonics with 85 dB signal-to-noise ratio.
We further verify the non-perturbative nature of the harmonic generation through polarization
gating of the driving pulse to increase the effects of the carrier-envelope phase. Our work demonstrates
robust and ultra-sensitive methods for generating and characterizing harmonic generation at
100 MHz rates that should provide advantages in the study of attosecond nonlinear processes in solid
state systems. Additionally, as a simple and low-noise frequency comb, this broadband source will
be useful for precision dual-comb spectroscopy of a range of physical systems across the ultraviolet
and visible spectral regions (200 - 650 nm).

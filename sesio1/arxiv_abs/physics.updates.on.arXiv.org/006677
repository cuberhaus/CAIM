This article is an introductory work to a larger research project devoted to pure, applied and philosophical
aspects of dimension theory. It concerns a novel approach toward an alternate dimension theory
foundation: the point-dimension theory. For this purpose, historical research on this notion
and related concepts, combined with critical analysis and philosophical development proved necessary.
Hence, our main objective is to challenge the conventional zero dimension assigned to the point.
This reconsideration allows us to propose two new ways of conceiving the notion of dimension, which
are the two sides of the same coin. First as an organization; accordingly, we suggest the existence
of the Dimensionad, an elementary particle conferring dimension to objects and space-time. The
idea of the existence of this particle could possibly adopted as a projection to create an alternative
way to unify quantum mechanics and Einstein's general relativity. Secondly, in connection with
Boltzmann and Shannon entropies, dimension appears essentially as a comparison between entropies
of sets. Thus, we started from the point and succeeded in constructing a point-dimension notion
allowing us to extend the principle of box dimension in many directions. More precisely, we introduce
the notion of point-extended box dimension in the large framework of topological vector spaces,
freeing it from the notion of metric. This general setting permits us to treat the case of finite,
infinite and invisible dimensions. This first part of our research project focuses essentially
on general properties and is particularly oriented towards establishing a well founded framework
for infinite dimension. Among others, one prospect is to test the possibility of using other types
of spaces as a setting for quantum mechanics, instead of limiting it to the exclusive Hilbertian
framework.

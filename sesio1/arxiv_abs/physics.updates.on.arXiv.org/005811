We present the first statistical analysis of complexity changes affecting the magnetic structure
of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs), with the aim of answering the questions: How
frequently do ICMEs undergo magnetic complexity changes during propagation? What are the causes
of such changes? Do the in situ properties of ICMEs differ depending on whether they exhibit complexity
changes? We consider multi-spacecraft observations of 31 ICMEs by MESSENGER, Venus Express, ACE,
and STEREO between 2008 and 2014 while radially aligned. By analyzing their magnetic properties
at the inner and outer spacecraft, we identify complexity changes which manifest as fundamental
alterations or significant re-orientations of the ICME. Plasma and suprathermal electron data
at 1 au, and simulations of the solar wind enable us to reconstruct the propagation scenario for each
event, and to identify critical factors controlling their evolution. Results show that ~65% of
ICMEs change their complexity between Mercury and 1 au and that interaction with multiple large-scale
solar wind structures is the driver of these changes. Furthermore, 71% of ICMEs observed at large
radial (>0.4 au) but small longitudinal (<15 degrees) separations exhibit complexity changes,
indicating that propagation over large distances strongly affects ICMEs. Results also suggest
ICMEs may be magnetically coherent over angular scales of at least 15 degrees, supporting earlier
theoretical and observational estimates. This work presents statistical evidence that magnetic
complexity changes are consequences of ICME interactions with large-scale solar wind structures,
rather than intrinsic to ICME evolution, and that such changes are only partly identifiable from
in situ measurements at 1 au.

Dam failures occur worldwide, often from factors including aging structures, extreme hydrologic
loading, and design oversights related to the changing climate. Understanding and mitigating
risk to downstream inhabited areas require developing and improving low-cost high-fidelity tools,
such as numerical models, which allow emergency managers to predict the consequences of dam failures
better. Two-dimensional (2D) depth-averaged hydraulic models can provide valuable insights
into the importance of breach parameters or downstream flow characteristics, but historical studies
considering historic failures using real topographies are less common in literature. This study
compares Geoclaw, a 2D hydraulic model with adaptive mesh refinement capabilities, to an industry-standard
software HEC-RAS (Hydrologic Engineering Center - River Analysis System) using the 1976 Teton
Dam failure as a case study. The suitability of Geoclaw for dam failure modeling is determined based
on its capability to resolve inundation extent and flood wave arrival times. This study performs
sensitivity analyses of the HEC-RAS model to compare an instantaneous dam breach assumption with
a time-dependent breach formation for quantifying the model uncertainty. We find the 2D Geoclaw
dam-break model results compare reasonably with historical gauge and field observational data
and HEC-RAS results. The model demonstrates stability and relatively low computational costs.
Our findings highlight opportunities for future work, with the Geoclaw software performance supporting
continued studies to evaluate performance. Outcomes of this study will assist dam owners, floodplain
managers, and emergency managers by providing an additional tool for estimating the impacts of
dam failures to protect lives and infrastructure downstream.

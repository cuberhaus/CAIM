This work evaluates the potential root causes of fatigue using a biomathematical model and a robust
sample of aircrew rosters from the Brazilian regular aviation. The fatigue outcomes derive from
the software Sleep, Activity, Fatigue, and Task Effectiveness Fatigue Avoidance Scheduling Tool
(SAFTE-FAST). The average minimum SAFTE-FAST effectiveness during critical phases of flight
decreases cubically with the number of shifts that elapse totally or partially between mid-night
and 6 a.m. within a 30-day period ($N_{NS}$). As a consequence, the relative fatigue risk increases
by 23.3% (95% CI, 20.4-26.2%) when increasing $N_{NS}$ from 1 to 13. The average maximum equivalent
wakefulness in critical phases also increases cubically with the number of night shifts and exceeds
24 hours for rosters with $N_{NS}$ above 10. The average fatigue hazard area in critical phases of
flight varies quadratically with the number of departures and landings within 2 and 6 a.m. ($N_{Wocl}$).
These findings demonstrate that both $N_{NS}$ and $ N_{Wocl}$ should be considered as key performance
indicators and be kept as low as reasonably practical when building aircrew rosters. The effectiveness
scores at 30 minute time intervals allowed a model estimate for the relative fatigue risk as a function
of the time of the day, whose averaged values show reasonable qualitative agreement with previous
measurements of pilot errors. Tailored analyses of the SAFTE-FAST inputs for afternoon naps before
night shifts, commuting from home to station and vice-versa, and bedtime before early-start shifts
show relevant group effects ($p < 0.001$) comparing the groups with and without afternoon naps,
with one or two hours of commuting and with or without the advanced bedtime feature of the SAFTE-FAST
software, evidencing the need of a better and more accurate understanding of these parameters when
modelling fatigue risk factors.

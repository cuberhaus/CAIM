Lifting up objects from the floor has been identified as a risk factor for low back pain, whereby a
flexed spine during lifting is often associated with producing higher loads in the lumbar spine.
Even though recent biomechanical studies challenge these assumptions, conclusive evidence is
still lacking. This study therefore aimed at comparing lumbar loads among different lifting styles
using a comprehensive state-of-the-art motion capture-driven musculoskeletal modeling approach.
Thirty healthy pain-free individuals were enrolled in this study and asked to repetitively lift
a 15 kg-box by applying 1) a freestyle, 2) a squat and 3) a stoop lifting technique. Whole-body kinematics
were recorded using an optical motion capture system and used to drive a full-body musculoskeletal
model including a detailed thoracolumbar spine. Compressive, shear and total loads were calculated
based on a static optimization approach and expressed as factor body weight (BW). In addition, lumbar
lordosis angles and total lifting time were calculated. All parameters were compared among the
lifting styles using a repeated measures design. For all lumbar segments, stoop lifting showed
significantly lower compressive and total loads (-0.3 to -1.0BW) when compared to freestyle and
squat lifting. Stoop lifting produced higher shear loads (+0.1 to +0.8BW) in the segments T12/L1
to L4/L5, but lower loads in L5/S1 (-0.2 to -0.4BW). Peak compressive and total loads during squat
lifting occurred approximately 30% earlier in the lifting cycle compared to stoop lifting. Stoop
lifting showed larger lumbar lordosis range of motion (35.9+/-10.1{\deg}) than freestyle (24.2+/-7.3{\deg})
and squat (25.1+/-8.2{\deg}) lifting. Lifting time differed significantly with freestyle being
executed the fastest (4.6+/-0.7s), followed by squat (4.9+/-0.7s) and stoop (5.9+/-1.1s).

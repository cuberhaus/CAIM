Multicolor super-resolution imaging remains an intractable challenge for both far-field and
near-field based super-resolution techniques. Planar super-oscillatory lens (SOL), a far-field
subwavelength-focusing diffractive lens device, holds great potential for achieving sub-diffraction-limit
imaging at multiple wavelengths. However, conventional SOL devices suffer from a numerical aperture
(NA) related intrinsic tradeoff among the depth of focus (DoF), chromatic dispersion and focus
spot size, being an essential characteristics of common diffractive optical elements. Typically,
the limited DoF and significant chromatism associated with high NA can lead to unfavorable degradation
of image quality although increasing NA imporves the resolution. Here, we apply a multi-objective
genetic algorithm (GA) optimization approach to design an apochromatic binary-phase SOL that
generates axially jointed multifoci concurrently having prolonged DoF, customized working distance
(WD) and suppressed side-lobes yet minimized main-lobe size, optimizing the aforementioned NA-dependent
tradeoff. Experimental implementation of this GA-optimized SOL demonstrates simultaneous focusing
of blue, green and red light beams into an optical needle half of the incident wavelength in diameter
at 428 um WD, resulting in an ultimate resolution better than one third of the incident wavelength
in the lateral dimension. By integrating this apochromatic SOL device with a commercial fluorescence
microscope, we employ the optical needle to perform, for the first time, three-dimensional super-resolution
multicolor fluorescence imaging of the unseen fine structure of neurons at one go. The present study
provides not only a practical route to far-field multicolor super-resolution imaging but also
a viable approach for constructing imaging systems avoiding complex sample positioning and unfavorable
photobleaching.

Invasive intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) or electrocorticography (ECoG) measures
electric potential directly on the surface of the brain and can be used to inform treatment planning
for epilepsy surgery. Combined with numerical modeling they can further improve accuracy of epilepsy
surgery planning. Accurate solution of the iEEG or ECoG forward problem, which is a crucial prerequisite
for solving the inverse problem in epilepsy seizure onset zone localization, requires accurate
representation of the patient's brain geometry and tissue electrical conductivity after implantation
of electrodes. However, implantation of subdural grid electrodes causes the brain to deform, which
invalidates preoperatively acquired image data. Moreover, postoperative magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) is incompatible with implanted electrodes and computed tomography (CT) has insufficient
range of soft tissue contrast, which precludes both MRI and CT from being used to obtain the deformed
postoperative geometry. In this paper, we present a biomechanics-based image warping procedure
using preoperative MRI for tissue classification and postoperative CT for locating implanted
electrodes to perform non-rigid registration of the preoperative image data to the postoperative
configuration. We solve the iEEG forward problem on the predicted postoperative geometry using
the finite element method (FEM) which accounts for patient-specific inhomogeneity and anisotropy
of tissue conductivity. Results for the simulation of a current source in the brain show large differences
in electric potential predicted by the models based on the original images and the deformed images
corresponding to the brain geometry deformed by placement of invasive electrodes. Computation
of the lead field matrix (useful for solution of the iEEG inverse problem) also showed significant
differences between the different models.

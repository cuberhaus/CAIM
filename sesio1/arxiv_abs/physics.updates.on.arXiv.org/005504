We report the breakup dynamics of a magnetically active droplet (ferrofluid droplet) in a T-shaped
LOC device under the modulation of a non-uniform magnetic field. We adhere to high-speed imaging
modalities for the experimental quantification of the droplet splitting phenomena in the presence
of a non-uniform force field gradient, while the underlying phenomena is supported by the numerical
results in a qualitative manner as well. On reaching the T-junction divergence, the droplet engulfs
the intersection fully and eventually deforms into the dumbbell-shaped form making its bulges
to move towards the branches of the junction. We observe that the asymmetric distribution of the
magnetic force lines, acting over the T-junction divergence, induces an accelerating motion to
the left moving bulge (since the magnet is placed adjacent to the left branch). We show that the non-uniform
force field gradient allows the formation of a hump-like structure inside the left moving bulge
which triggers the onset of augmented convection in its flow field. We reveal that this augmented
internal convection developed in the left moving volume/bulge, on getting coupled with the various
involved time scales of the flow field, lead to the asymmetric splitting of the droplet into two sister
droplets. Our analysis establishes that at the critical strength of the applied forcing, as realized
by the critical magnetic Bond number, the flow time scale becomes minimum at the left branch of the
channel, leading to the formation of larger sized sister droplet therein. Inferences of the present
analysis, which focuses on the simple, wireless, robust and low-cost droplet splitting mechanism,
will provide a potential solution for rapid droplet breakup, typically finds significant importance
in point-of-care diagnostics.

High-energy neutrinos ($E>10^{17}$eV) are detected cost-efficiently via the Askaryan effect
in ice, where a particle cascade induced by the neutrino interaction produces coherent radio emission
that can be picked up by antennas. As the near-surface ice properties change rapidly within the upper
40m, a good understanding of the ice properties is required to reconstruct the neutrino properties.
In particular, continuous monitoring of the snow accumulation (which changes the depth of the antennas)
and the index-of-refraction $n(z)$ profile are crucial for an accurate determination of the neutrino's
direction and energy. We present an in-situ calibration system that extends the radio detector
station with two radio emitters to continuously monitor the firn properties within the upper 40m
by measuring the time differences between direct and reflected (off the surface) signals (D'n'R).
We determine the optimal positions of two transmitters at all three sites of current and future radio
detectors: Greenland, Moore's Bay, and the South Pole. We find that the snow accumulation $\Delta
h$ can be measured with a resolution of 5mm and the parameters of an exponential $n(z)$ profile $\Delta
n$ and $z_0$ with 0.03% and 0.2% precision respectively, which constitutes an improvement of more
than a factor of 10 as compared to the inference of the $n(z)$ profile from density measurements.
Additionally, as this technique is based on the measurement of the signal propagation times we are
not bound to the conversion of density to index-of-refraction. We quantify the impact of these ice
uncertainties on the reconstruction of the neutrino vertex, direction, and energy and find that
the calibration device measures the ice properties to sufficient precision to have negligible
influence.

In this paper a denoising strategy based on the EEMD (Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition) is
used to reduce the background noise in non-stationary signals, which represent the forces measured
in scaled model testing of the emergency water landing of aircraft, generally referred to as ditching.
Ditching tests are performed at a constant horizontal speed of 12 m/s and a vertical velocity at the
beginning of the impact of 0.45 m/s. The measured data are affected by a large amplitude broadband
noise, which has both mechanical and electronic origin. Noise sources cannot be easily avoided
or removed, since they are associated with the vibrations of the structure of the towing carriage
and to the interaction between the measurement chain and the electromagnetic fields. The EEMD noise
reduction method is based on the decomposition of the signal into modes and on its partial reconstruction
using the residue, the signal-dominant modes and some further modes treated with a thresholding
technique, which helps to retain some of the sharp features of the signal. The strategy is developed
and tested first on a synthetic signal with a superimposed and known background noise. The method
is then verified on the measurement of the inertial force acting on the fuselage when it is moving
in air, as in this case the added mass is negligible and the denoised force should equal the product
of the mass by the acceleration, both of them being known. Finally, the procedure is applied to denoise
the forces measured during the actual ditching experiments. The results are superior to those obtained
by other classical filtering methods, such as a moving average filter and a low-pass FIR filter,
particularly due to the enhanced capabilities of the EEMD-denoising strategy here developed to
preserve the sharp features of the signals and to reduce the residual low-frequency oscillations
of spurious origin.

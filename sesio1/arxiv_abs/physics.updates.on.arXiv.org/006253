In this white paper, we outline some of the scientific opportunities and challenges related to detection
and reconstruction of low-energy (less than 100 MeV) signatures in liquid argon time-projection
chamber (LArTPC) detectors. Key takeaways are summarized as follows. 1) LArTPCs have unique sensitivity
to a range of physics and astrophysics signatures via detection of event features at and below the
few tens of MeV range. 2) Low-energy signatures are an integral part of GeV-scale accelerator neutrino
interaction final states, and their reconstruction can enhance the oscillation physics sensitivities
of LArTPC experiments. 3) BSM signals from accelerator and natural sources also generate diverse
signatures in the low-energy range, and reconstruction of these signatures can increase the breadth
of BSM scenarios accessible in LArTPC-based searches. 4) Neutrino interaction cross sections
and other nuclear physics processes in argon relevant to sub-hundred-MeV LArTPC signatures are
poorly understood. Improved theory and experimental measurements are needed. Pion decay-at-rest
sources and charged particle and neutron test beams are ideal facilities for experimentally improving
this understanding. 5) There are specific calibration needs in the low-energy range, as well as
specific needs for control and understanding of radiological and cosmogenic backgrounds. 6) Novel
ideas for future LArTPC technology that enhance low-energy capabilities should be explored. These
include novel charge enhancement and readout systems, enhanced photon detection, low radioactivity
argon, and xenon doping. 7) Low-energy signatures, whether steady-state or part of a supernova
burst or larger GeV-scale event topology, have specific triggering, DAQ and reconstruction requirements
that must be addressed outside the scope of conventional GeV-scale data collection and analysis
pathways.

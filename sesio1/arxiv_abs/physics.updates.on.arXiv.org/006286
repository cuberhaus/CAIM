The development of nuclear reactors that utilize pebble fuel has drastically increased the demand
for improving the capabilities to simulate the packed beds found in these reactors. The complex
flow fields found in a pebble bed make computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations time consuming
and costly. Intermediate fidelity porous media models, however, are capable of approximating
these flow fields in a much more computationally efficient manner. These models require the use
of closures to capture the effects of complex flow phenomena without modeling them explicitly.
This research employs data obtained from high-fidelity CFD simulations of a pebble bed to improve
the drag closures used in porous media models in the near-wall region of the bed. Specifically, NekRS,
a GPU-enabled spectral element CFD code, was used to simulate a bed of 1,568 pebbles at multiple Reynolds
numbers. The case was divided into five concentric subdomains to extract radial profiles of the
average porosity, velocity, and wall shear in each subdomain. A model consistent with the high-fidelity
model was created in Idaho National Laboratory's Pronghorn porous media code and the KTA correlation
was chosen as the drag closure of comparison. It was found that the KTA correlation overestimates
the velocity in the near-wall region. An investigation of the drag coefficients between the two
codes revealed that the KTA correlation underestimated the form factor in the outermost region
while overestimating it in the inner four regions. This analysis in this work has revealed the underlying
inaccuracy in the near-wall region of the KTA correlation and has set up the process for using high-fidelity
simulation to predict more accurate drag coefficients a priori, rather than with a manual velocity-matching
approach. This process will allow for the development of an improved drag closure for use in porous
media models.

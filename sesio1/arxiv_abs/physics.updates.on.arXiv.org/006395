Predictions of the wave-induced response of floating structures that are moored in a harbour or
coastal waters require an accurate description of the (nonlinear) evolution of waves over variable
bottom topography, the interactions of the waves with the structure, and the dynamics of the mooring
system. In this paper, we present a new advanced numerical model to simulate the wave-induced response
of a floating structure that is moored in an arbitrary nearshore region. The model is based on the
non-hydrostatic approach, and implemented in the open-source model SWASH, which provides an efficient
numerical framework to simulate the nonlinear wave evolution over variable bottom topographies.
The model is extended with a solution to the rigid body that is tightly coupled to the hydrodynamic
equations. The model was validated for two test cases that consider different floating structures
of increasing geometrical complexity: a cylindrical geometry that is representative of a wave-energy-converter,
and a vessel with a more complex shaped hull. A range of wave conditions were considered, varying
from monochromatic to short-crested sea states. Model predictions of the excitation forces, added
mass, radiation damping, and the wave-induced response agreed well with benchmark solutions to
the potential flow equations. Besides the response to the primary wave (sea-swell) components,
the model was also able to capture the second-order difference-frequency forcing and response
of the moored vessel. Importantly, the model captured the wave-induced response with a relatively
coarse vertical resolution, allowing for applications at the scale of a realistic harbour or coastal
region. The proposed model thereby provides a new tool to seamlessly simulate the nonlinear evolution
of waves over complex bottom topography and the wave-induced response of a floating structure that
is moored in coastal waters.

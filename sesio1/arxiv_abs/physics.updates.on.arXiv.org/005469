I take non-locality to be the Michaelson Morley experiment of the early 21st Century, assume its
universal validity, and try to derive its consequences. Spacetime, with its locality, cannot be
fundamental, but must be emergent from entangled coherent quantum variables and their behaviors.
Two immediate consequences are: i. If we start with non-locality, we need not explain non-locality.
We must instead explain an emergence of locality and spacetime. ii. There can be no emergence of spacetime
without matter. These propositions flatly contradict General Relativity, which is foundationaly
local, can be formulated without matter, and where there is no "emergence" of spacetime. If true,
then quantum gravity cannot be a minor alteration of General Relativity, but must demand its deep
reformulation. This will lead to: Matter not only deforms spacetime, but "creates" spacetime.
This quantum creation of spacetime consists in: i. Fully non-local entangled coherent quantum
variables. ii. The onset of locality via decoherence. iii. A metric in Hilbert Space among entangled
quantum variables by the sub-additive von Neumann Entropy between pairs of variables. iv. Mapping
from metric distances in Hilbert Space to metric distances in classical spacetime by episodic actualization
events. v. Discrete spacetime is the relations among these discrete actualization events. vi.
"Now" is the shared moment of actualization of one among the entangled variables when the amplitudes
of the remaining entangled variables change instantaneously. vii. The discrete, successive,
episodic, irreversible actualization events constitute a quantum arrow of time. viii. The arrow
of time history of these events is recorded in the very structure of the spacetime constructed. ix.
Actual Time is a succession of two or more actual events.

The coil-globule transition of an energy polydisperse chain, a model heteropolymer system where
the number of monomer species is as large as the total number of monomers, is studied by means of computer
simulations. In this study, we systematically explore the consequences of having different functional
form and variance of the energy distribution on the coil-globule transition in general. In particular,
considering Gaussian (G) and uniform (U) distributions, the effect of varying polydispersity
index, $\delta$, on the transition temperature $\theta^\ast$, chain size, internal structure
and spatial organization of monomers in the globule, and kinetics of the folding are addressed.
It is found that the transition temperature of the model heteropolymer is lower than that of the homopolymer
counterpart, and $\theta^\ast$ increases with $\delta$ (both G and U) and $\theta^\ast({\rm U})
< \theta^\ast({\rm G})$ consistently. The results of our study suggest that $\theta^\ast$ is governed
by the most probable value (rather than the width) of the pair-wise energy distribution. Interestingly,
the nature of the collapse transition turns out to be universal, i.e., when scaled properly (irrespective
of the functional form and variance) all the swelling curves fall on a master curve and it is well described
by the same scaling form of the homopolymer counterpart. However, following quenching, the transition
from coil to globule is relatively fast for heteropolymer (with no significant difference between
G and U systems, and no significant $\delta$ dependence within the considered range). On the other
hand, internal organization in the collapsed state, quantified through mean contact probability,
show distinct scaling regimes. Also we observe segregation of monomers based on their identities
which is more pronounced in the case of uniform distribution.

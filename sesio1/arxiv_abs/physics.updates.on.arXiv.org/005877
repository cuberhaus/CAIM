Cell proliferation, apoptosis, and myosin-dependent contraction can generate elastic stress
and strain in living tissues, which may be dissipated by internal rearrangement through cell topological
transition and cytoskeletal reorganization. Moreover, cells and tissues can change their sizes
in response to mechanical cues. The present work demonstrates the role of tissue compressibility
and internal rearranging activities on its size and mechanics regulation in the context of differential
growth induced by a field of growth-promoting chemical factors. We develop a mathematical model
based on finite elasticity and growth theory and the reference map techniques to describe the coupled
tissue growth and mechanics in the Eulerian frame. We incorporate the tissue rearrangement by introducing
a rearranging rate to the reference map evolution, leading to elastic-energy dissipation when
tissue growth and deformation are in radial symmetry. By linearizing the model, we show that the
stress follows the Maxwell-type viscoelastic relaxation. The rearrangement rate, which we call
tissue fluidity, sets the stress relaxation time, and the ratio between the shear modulus and the
fluidity sets the tissue viscosity. By nonlinear simulation of growing tissue spheroids and discs
with graded growth rates along the radius, we find that the tissue compressibility and fluidity
influence their equilibrium size. By comparing the nonlinear simulations with the linear analytical
solutions, we show the size change as a nonlinear effect due to the advection of the tissue density
flow, which only occurs when both tissue compressibility and fluidity are small. We apply the model
to study tumor spheroid growth and epithelial disc growth when a reaction-diffusion process determines
the growth-promoting factor field.

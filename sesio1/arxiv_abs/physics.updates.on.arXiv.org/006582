Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) describes complex dynamic processes through a hierarchy of simpler
coherent features. DMD is regularly used to understand the fundamental characteristics of turbulence
and is closely related to Koopman operators. However, verifying the decomposition, equivalently
the computed spectral features of Koopman operators, remains a major challenge due to the infinite-dimensional
nature of Koopman operators. Challenges include spurious (unphysical) modes, and dealing with
continuous spectra, both of which occur regularly in turbulent flows. Residual Dynamic Mode Decomposition
(ResDMD), introduced by (Colbrook & Townsend 2021), overcomes some of these challenges through
the data-driven computation of residuals associated with the full infinite-dimensional Koopman
operator. ResDMD computes spectra and pseudospectra of general Koopman operators with error control,
and computes smoothed approximations of spectral measures (including continuous spectra) with
explicit high-order convergence theorems. ResDMD thus provides robust and verified Koopmanism.
We implement ResDMD and demonstrate its application in a variety of fluid dynamic situations, at
varying Reynolds numbers, arising from both numerical and experimental data. Examples include:
vortex shedding behind a cylinder; hot-wire data acquired in a turbulent boundary layer; particle
image velocimetry data focusing on a wall-jet flow; and acoustic pressure signals of laser-induced
plasma. We present some advantages of ResDMD, namely, the ability to verifiably resolve non-linear,
transient modes, and spectral calculation with reduced broadening effects. We also discuss how
a new modal ordering based on residuals enables greater accuracy with a smaller dictionary than
the traditional modulus ordering. This paves the way for greater dynamic compression of large datasets
without sacrificing accuracy.

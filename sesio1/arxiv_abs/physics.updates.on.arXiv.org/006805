By decomposing velocity dispersion into non-spin and spin-induced, mean flow and dispersion are
analytically solved for axisymmetric rotating and growing halos. The polar flow can be neglected
and azimuthal flow is directly related to dispersion. The fictitious ("Reynolds") stress acts
on mean flow to enable energy transfer from mean flow to random motion and maximize system entropy.
For large halos (high peak height $\nu$ at early stage of halo life) with constant concentration,
there exists a self-similar radial flow (outward in core and inward in outer region). Halo mass,
size and specific angular momentum increase linearly with time via fast mass accretion. Halo core
spins faster than outer region. Large halos rotate with an angular velocity proportional to Hubble
parameter and spin-induced dispersion is dominant. All specific energies (radial/rotational/kinetic/potential)
are time-invariant. Both halo spin ($\sim$0.031) and anisotropic parameters can be analytically
derived. For "small" halos with stable core and slow mass accretion (low peak height $\nu$ at late
stage of halo life), radial flow vanishes. Small halos rotate with constant angular velocity and
non-spin axial dispersion is dominant. Small halos are spherical in shape, incompressible, and
isotropic. Radial and azimuthal dispersion are comparable and greater than polar dispersion.
Due to finite spin, kinetic energy is not equipartitioned with the greatest energy along azimuthal
direction. Different from normal matter, small halos are hotter with faster spin. Halo relaxation
from early to late stage involves variation of shape, density, mean flow, momentum, and energy.
During relaxation, halo isotopically "stretches" with conserved specific rotational kinetic
energy, increasing concentration and momentum of inertial. Halo "stretching" leads to decreasing
angular velocity, increasing angular momentum and spin parameter.

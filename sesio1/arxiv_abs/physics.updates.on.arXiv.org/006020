We investigated the possibility of augmenting the fluence of electrons traversing CdTe thin film
and thus increasing the detected signal pursuing two venues: adding a high-Z metal layer to the back
of the detector surface, and adding a top low-Z material to the detector layer to return its backscattered
electrons. Copper (Cu) and lead (Pb) layers of varying thickness were investigated as potential
metal back-reflectors, while PMMA was tried as the top cover in multilayer detector structures.
The Monte Carlo (MC) radiation transport package MCNP5 was first used to model a basic multilayer
structure under a Varian 6MV. It was then modified by the addition of Cu and Pb to analyze the extent
of the signal enhancement and changes in secondary electron fluence spectra. Backscattering coefficients
were then calculated using EGSnrc for electron sources. Analytical functions were established
to represent the best-fitting curves to the simulation data. Finally, electron backscattering
data were related to signal enhancement. It was found that adding a metal film below the sensitive
volume of a detector increases the fraction of reflected electrons, especially in the low energy
range, resulting in ~10% and 75% increased energy deposition using Cu and Pb, respectively. We also
established a linear dependence between the energy deposition in the semiconductor layer and the
fluence of backscattered electrons in the corresponding multilayer structure. The low-Z top layer
in practically implemental thicknesses of tens of microns has a positive effect due to partial electron
reflection back to the semiconductor layer. Signal enhancement in a thin-film CdTe radiation detector
could be achieved using electron backscattering from metal reflectors. The methodology explored
here warrants further studies to quantify achievable signal enhancement for various thin-film
and other small sensitive volume detectors.

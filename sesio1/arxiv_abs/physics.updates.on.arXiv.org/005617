Families form the basis of society, and anthropologists have characterised various family systems.
This study developed a multi-level evolutionary model of pre-industrial agricultural societies
to simulate the evolution of family systems and determine how each of them adapts to environmental
conditions and forms a characteristic socio-economic structure. In the model, competing societies
evolve, which themselves comprise multiple evolving families that grow through family labour.
Each family has two strategy parameters: the time children leave the parental home and the distribution
of inheritance among siblings. The evolution of these parameters demonstrates that four basic
family systems emerge; families can become either nuclear or extended, and have either an equal
or unequal inheritance distribution. Nuclear families emerge where land resources are sufficient,
whereas extended families emerge where land resources are limited. Equal inheritance emerges
where the amount of wealth required for a family to survive is large, whereas unequal inheritance
emerges where the required wealth is small. Analyses on the wealth distribution of families demonstrate
a higher level of poverty in extended families, and that the accumulation of wealth is accelerated
for unequal inheritance. By comparing wealth distributions in the model with historical data,
family systems are associated with characteristic economic structures and modern social ideologies.
Empirical data analyses using the cross-cultural ethnographic database verify the theoretical
relationship between the environmental conditions, family systems, and socio-economic structures.
Theoretical studies by this simple constructive model, as presented here, will integrate the understandings
of family systems in evolutionary anthropology, demography, and socioeconomic histories.

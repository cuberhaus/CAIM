The inverse mechano-electrical problem in cardiac electrophysiology is the attempt to reconstruct
electrical excitation or action potential wave patterns from the heart's mechanical deformation
that occurs in response to electrical excitation. Because heart muscle cells contract upon electrical
excitation due to the excitation-contraction coupling mechanism, the resulting deformation
of the heart should reflect macroscopic action potential wave phenomena. However, whether the
relationship between macroscopic electrical and mechanical phenomena is well-defined and furthermore
unique enough to be utilized for an inverse imaging technique, in which mechanical activation mapping
is used as a surrogate for electrical mapping, has yet to be determined. Here, we provide a numerical
proof-of-principle that deep learning can be used to solve the inverse mechano-electrical problem
in phenomenological two- and three-dimensional computer simulations of the contracting heart
wall, or in elastic excitable media, with muscle fiber anisotropy. We trained a convolutional autoencoder
neural network to learn the complex relationship between electrical excitation, active stress,
and tissue deformation during both focal or reentrant chaotic wave activity, and consequently
used the network to succesfully estimate or reconstruct electrical excitation wave patterns from
mechanical deformation in sheets and bulk-shaped tissues, even in the presence of noise and at low
spatial resolutions. We demonstrate that even complicated three-dimensional electrical excitation
wave phenomena, such as scroll waves and their vortex filaments, can be computed with very high reconstruction
accuracies of about 95% from mechanical deformation using autoencoder neural networks, and we
provide a comparison with results that were obtained previously with a physics- or knowledge-based
approach.

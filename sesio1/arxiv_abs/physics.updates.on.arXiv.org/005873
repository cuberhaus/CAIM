The ASTROMOVES project studies the career moves and the career decision-making of astrophysicists.
The astrophysicists participating have to have made at least two career moves after receiving their
doctorates, which is usually between 4 and 8 years post PhD. ASTROMOVES is funded via the European
Union and thus each participant must have worked or lived in Europe. Gender, ethnicity, nationality,
marital status, and if they have children are some of the many factors for analysis. Other studies
of the careers of astronomers and astrophysicists have taken survey approaches (Fohlmeister &
Helling, 2012, 2014; Ivie et al., 2013; Ivie & White, 2015) laying a foundation upon which ASTROMOVES
builds. For ASTROMOVES qualitative interviews are combined with publicly available information
for the project, rather than surveys. Valuable information about career options and the decisions
about where not to apply will be gathered for the first time. Those few studies that have used qualitative
interviews often include both physicists and astrophysicists, nonetheless they have revealed
issues that are important to ASTROMOVES such as the role of activism and the nuances of having children
related to the long work hours culture (Ong, 2001; Rolin & Vainio, 2011). The global COVID-19 pandemic
has slowed down the project; however, at the time of this writing 20 interviews have been completed.
These interviews support previous research findings on how having a family plays an important role
in career decision making, as well as the importance of mobility in building a career in astrophysics.
Cultural Astronomy spans all aspects of the relationship between humans and the sky as well as all
times ancient to the present; and thus, studying astronomers & astrophysicists who have a professional
relationship to the sky is part of cultural astronomy, too.

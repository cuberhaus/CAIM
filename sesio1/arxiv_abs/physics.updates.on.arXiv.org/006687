Machine-learned multi-orbital tight-binding (MMTB) Hamiltonian models have been developed
to describe the electronic characteristics of intermetallic compounds $\rm Mg_2Si, Mg_2Ge, Mg_2Sn$,
and $\rm Mg_2Pb$ subject to strain. The MMTB models incorporate spin-orbital mediated interactions
and they are calibrated to the electronic band structures calculated via density functional theory
(DFT) by a massively parallelized multi-dimensional Monte-Carlo search algorithm. The results
show that a machine-learned five-band tight-binding model reproduces the key aspects of the valence
band structures in the entire Brillouin zone. The five-band model reveals that compressive strain
localizes the contribution of the $3s$ orbital of $\rm Mg$ to the conduction bands and the outer shell
$p$ orbitals of $\rm X~(X=Si,Ge,Sn,Pb)$ to the valence bands. In contrast, tensile strain has a
reversed effect as it weakens the contribution of the $3s$ orbital of $\rm Mg$ and the outer shell
$p$ orbitals of $\rm X$ to the conduction bands and valence bands, respectively. The $\pi$ bonding
in the $\rm Mg_2X$ compounds is negligible compared to the $\sigma$ bonding components, which follow
the hierarchy $|\sigma_{sp}|>|\sigma_{pp}|>|\sigma_{ss}|$, and the largest variation against
strain belongs to $\sigma_{pp}$. The five-band model allows for estimating the strength of spin-orbit
coupling (SOC) in $\rm Mg_2X$ and obtaining its dependence on the atomic number of $\rm X$ and strain.
Further, the band structure calculations demonstrate a significant band gap tuning and band splitting
due to strain. A compressive strain of $-10\%$ can open a band gap at the $\Gamma$ point in metallic
$\rm Mg_2Pb$, whereas a tensile strain of $+10\%$ closes the semiconducting band gap of $\rm Mg_2Si$.
A tensile strain of $+5\%$ removes the three-fold degeneracy of valence bands at the $\Gamma$ point
in semiconducting $\rm Mg_2Ge$.

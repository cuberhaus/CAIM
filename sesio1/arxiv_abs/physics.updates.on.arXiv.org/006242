The dynamic behavior of crystals in convecting fluids determines how magma bodies solidify. In
particular, it is often important to estimate how long crystals stay in suspension in the host liquid
before being deposited at its bottom (or top, for light particles). We perform a systematic 3D numerical
study of particle-laden Rayleigh-Benard convection, and derive a robust model for the particle
residence time. For Rayleigh numbers higher than 10^7, inertial particles' trajectories exhibit
a monotonic transition from fluid tracer-like to free-fall dynamics, the control parameter being
the ratio between particle Stokes velocity and the fluid velocity. The average settling rate is
proportional to the particle Stokes velocity in both the end-member regimes, but the distribution
of the residence times differs markedly from one to the other. For lower Rayleigh numbers (<10^7),
an interaction between large-scale circulation and particle motion emerges, increasing the settling
rates on average. Nevertheless, the mean residence time does not exceed the terminal time, i.e.
the settling time from a quiescent fluid, by a factor larger than four. An exception are simulations
with only a slightly super-critical Rayleigh number (~ 10^4), for which stationary convection
develops and some particles become trapped indefinitely. 2D simulations of the same problem overestimate
the flow-particle interaction - and hence the residence time - for both high and low Rayleigh numbers,
which stresses the importance of using 3D geometries for simulating particle-laden flows. We outline
how our model can be used to explain depth changes of crystal size distribution in sedimentary layers
of magmatic intrusions that are thought to have formed via settling of a crystal cargo, and discuss
how the micro-structural observations of solidified intrusions can be used to infer the past convective
velocity of magma.

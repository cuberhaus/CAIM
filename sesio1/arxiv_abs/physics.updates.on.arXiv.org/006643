For turbulent bubbly flows, multi-phase simulations resolving both the liquid and bubble phases
are prohibitively expensive in the context of practical engineering design. One such example is
breaking waves, where the presence of bubbles plays a role in wave impact loads, acoustic emissions,
and atmospheric-ocean transfer, but detailed simulations in all but the simplest settings are
infeasible. An alternative is to resolve only the large scales, and model small scale bubbles, which
may be represented as a set of discrete particles. Here we introduce a large eddy simulation (LES)
Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) scheme for simulations of bubbly flows with free-surface.
The continuous liquid phase is resolved with a semi-implicit isothermally compressible SPH framework.
This is coupled via a discrete Lagrangian bubble model: bubbles and liquid interact via exchanges
of volume and momentum, and through turbulent closure, bubble breakup and entrainment, and free-surface
interaction models. By representing bubbles as discrete particles, they can be tracked over their
lifetimes, allowing closure models for sub-resolution fluctuations, bubble deformation, break-up
and free-surface interaction to be constructed in integral form, accounting for the finite timescales
over which these events occur. We use our framework to investigate two flows: bubble plumes, and
breaking waves, and find close quantitative agreement with published experimental and numerical
data. In particular, for breaking waves, our framework accurately predicts the Hinze scale, the
bubble size distribution and growth rate of the entrained bubble population for plunging breakers.
This is the first coupling of an SPH framework with a discrete bubble model (that we are aware of),
and has potential for cost effective simulations of wave-structure interactions with more accurate
predictions of wave impact loads.

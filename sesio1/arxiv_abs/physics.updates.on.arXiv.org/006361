The turbulent dynamo is a powerful mechanism that converts turbulent kinetic energy to magnetic
energy. A key question regarding the magnetic field amplification by turbulence, is, on what scale,
$\kp$, do magnetic fields become most concentrated? There has been some disagreement about whether
$\kp$ is controlled by the viscous scale, $\knu$ (where turbulent kinetic energy dissipates),
or the resistive scale, $\keta$ (where magnetic fields dissipate). Here we use direct numerical
simulations of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence to measure characteristic scales in the kinematic
phase of the turbulent dynamo. We run $104$-simulations with hydrodynamic Reynolds numbers of
\mbox{$10 \leq \Reyk \leq 3600$}, and magnetic Reynolds numbers of \mbox{$270 \leq \Reym \leq 4000$},
to explore the dependence of $\kp$ on $\knu$ and $\keta$. Using physically motivated models for
the kinetic and magnetic energy spectra, we measure $\knu$, $\keta$ and $\kp$, making sure that
the obtained scales are numerically converged. We determine the overall dissipation scale relations
\mbox{$\knu = (0.025^{+0.005}_{-0.006})\, k_\turb\, \Reyk^{3/4}$} and \mbox{$\keta = (0.88^{+0.21}_{-0.23})\,
\knu\, \Pranm^{1/2}$}, where $k_\turb$ is the turbulence driving wavenumber and $\Pranm=\Reym/\Reyk$
is the magnetic Prandtl number. We demonstrate that the principle dependence of $\kp$ is on $\keta$.
For plasmas where $\Reyk \gtrsim 100$, we find that \mbox{$\kp = (1.2_{-0.2}^{+0.2})\, \keta$},
with the proportionality constant related to the power-law `Kazantsev' exponent of the magnetic
power spectrum. Throughout this study, we find a dichotomy in the fundamental properties of the
dynamo where $\Reyk > 100$, compared to $\Reyk < 100$. We report a minimum critical hydrodynamic
Reynolds number, $\Reyk_\crit = 100$ for bonafide turbulent dynamo action.

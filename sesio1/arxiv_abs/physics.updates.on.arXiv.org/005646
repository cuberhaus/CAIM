The \textit{KArlsruhe TRItium Neutrino} (KATRIN) experiment aims to measure the neutrino mass
with a sensitivity of \SI{0.2}{\electronvolt} (\SI{90}{\percent} CL). This will be achieved
by a precision measurement of the endpoint region of the $\upbeta$-electron spectrum of tritium
decay. The $\upbeta$-electrons are produced in the \textit{Windowless Gaseous Tritium Source}
(WGTS) and guided magnetically through the beamline. In order to accurately extract the neutrino
mass the source activity is required to be stable and known to a high precision. The WGTS therefore
undergoes constant extensive monitoring from several measurement systems. The \textit{Forward
Beam Monitor} (FBM) is one such monitoring system. The FBM system comprises a complex mechanical
setup capable of inserting a detector board into the KATRIN beamline with a positioning precision
of better than \SI{0.3}{\milli\metre}. The electron flux density at that position is on the order
of \SI{e6}{\per\second\per\milli\metre\squared}. The detector board contains two silicon
detector chips of \pin diode type which can measure the $\upbeta$-electron flux from the source
with a precision of \SI{0.1}{\percent} within \SI{60}{\second} with an energy resolution of FWHM
$=$ \SI{2}{\kilo\electronvolt}. The unique challenge in developing the FBM arise from its designated
operating environment inside the Cryogenic Pumping Section which is a potentially tritium contaminated
ultra-high vacuum chamber at cryogenic temperatures in the presence of a \SI{1}{\tesla} strong
magnetic field. Each of theses parameters do strongly limit the choice of possible materials which
e.g. caused difficulties in detector noise reduction, heat dissipation and lubrication. In order
to completely remove the FBM from the beam tube a \SI{2}{\meter} long traveling distance into the
beamline is needed demanding a robust as well as highly precise moving mechanism.

The atmospheres of ultra-hot Jupiters have been characterized in detail through recent phase curve
and low- and high-resolution emission and transmission spectroscopic observations. Previous
numerical studies have analyzed the effect of the localized recombination of hydrogen on the atmospheric
dynamics and heat transport of ultra-hot Jupiters, finding that hydrogen dissociation and recombination
lead to a reduction in the day-to-night contrasts of ultra-hot Jupiters relative to previous expectations.
In this work, we add to previous efforts by also considering the localized condensation of clouds
in the atmospheres of ultra-hot Jupiters, their resulting transport by the atmospheric circulation,
and the radiative feedback of clouds on the atmospheric dynamics. To do so, we include radiatively
active cloud tracers into the existing MITgcm framework for simulating the atmospheric dynamics
of ultra-hot Jupiters. We take cloud condensate properties appropriate for the high-temperature
condensate corundum from CARMA cloud microphysics models. We conduct a suite of GCM simulations
with varying cloud microphysical and radiative properties, and we find that partial cloud coverage
is a ubiquitous outcome of our simulations. This patchy cloud distribution is inherently set by
atmospheric dynamics in addition to equilibrium cloud condensation, and causes a cloud greenhouse
effect that warms the atmosphere below the cloud deck. Nightside clouds are further sequestered
at depth due to a dynamically induced high-altitude thermal inversion. We post-process our GCMs
with the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code gCMCRT and find that the patchy clouds on ultra-hot
Jupiters do not significantly impact transmission spectra but can affect their phase-dependent
emission spectra.

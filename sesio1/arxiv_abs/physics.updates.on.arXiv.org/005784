A multiscale reduced description of turbulent free shear flows in the presence of strong stabilizing
density stratification is derived via asymptotic analysis of the Boussinesq equations in the simultaneous
limits of small Froude and large Reynolds numbers. The analysis explicitly recognizes the occurrence
of dynamics on disparate spatiotemporal scales, yielding simplified partial differential equations
governing the coupled evolution of slow large-scale hydrostatic flows and fast small-scale isotropic
instabilities and internal waves. The dynamics captured by the coupled reduced equations is illustrated
in the context of two-dimensional strongly stratified Kolmogorov flow. A noteworthy feature of
the reduced model is that the fluctuations are constrained to satisfy quasilinear (QL) dynamics
about the comparably slowly-varying large-scale fields. Crucially, this QL reduction is not invoked
as an ad hoc closure approximation, but rather is derived in a physically relevant and mathematically
consistent distinguished limit. Further analysis of the resulting slow-fast QL system shows how
the amplitude of the fast stratified-shear instabilities is slaved to the slowly-evolving mean
fields to ensure the marginal stability of the latter. Physically, this marginal stability condition
appears to be compatible with recent evidence of self-organized criticality in both observations
and simulations of stratified turbulence. lgorithmically, the slaving of the fluctuation fields
enables numerical simulations to be time-evolved strictly on the slow time scale of the hydrostatic
flow. The reduced equations thus provide a solid mathematical foundation for future studies of
three-dimensional strongly stratified turbulence in extreme parameter regimes of geophysical
relevance and suggest avenues for new sub-grid-scale parameterizations.

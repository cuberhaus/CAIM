Solar-type stars generate spherical winds, which are pressure driven flows, that start subsonic,
reach the sound speed at the sonic point and transition to supersonic flows. The sonic point, mathematically
corresponds to a singularity of the system of differential equations describing the flow. In the
problem of an isothermal wind, the Parker solution provides an exact analytical expression tuned
appropriately so that the singularity does not affect the solution. However, if the wind is polytropic
it is not possible to find an analytical solution and a numerical approach needs to be followed. We
study solutions of spherical winds that are driven by pressure within a gravitational field. The
solutions pass smoothly from the critical point and allow us to study the impact of the changes of
the polytropic index to these winds. We explore the properties of these solutions as a function of
the polytropic index and the boundary conditions used. We apply the Complex Plane Strategy (CPS)
and we obtain numerically solutions of polytropic winds. This allows us to avoid the singularity
appearing in the equations through the introduction complex variables and integration on the complex
plane. Applying this method, we obtain solutions with physical behaviour at the stellar surface,
the sonic point and at large distances from the star. We further explore the role of the polytropic
index in the flow and the effect of mass--loss rate and temperature on the solution. We find that the
increase of polytropic index as well as the decrease of flow parameter both yield to a smoother velocity
profile and lower velocities and shifts the transition point from subsonic to supersonic behaviour
further from the star. Finally, we verify that the increasing of coronal temperature yields higher
wind velocities and a weaker dependence on polytropic index.

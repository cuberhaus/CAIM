In ducts with varying cross-sectional area and sustaining a subsonic non-isentropic mean flow,
the axially varying flow conditions affect the acoustic energy balance of the system. This is significant
in understanding and controlling thermo-acoustic phenomena, particularly in combustors. This
work aims at quantifying the acoustic energy change in such configurations, using the acoustic
absorption coefficient, $\Delta$. The acoustic response of the duct to acoustic forcing is determined
using an analytical model, neglecting the effect of entropy fluctuations on the acoustic field,
and subsequently, $\Delta$ is estimated. The model predictions of $\Delta$ are validated using
a linearised Euler equations (LEEs) solver. The model was found to be accurate for Mach numbers below
$0.25$, provided the lower frequency limit set by the analytical solution is satisfied. For conically
varying area ducts with linear mean temperature gradient, it was observed that $\Delta$ showed
very little dependence on frequency, and that the absolute value of $\Delta$ tended to be maximised
when the upstream boundary was anechoic rather than non-anechoic. More importantly, $\Delta$
was also observed to show stronger dependence on the mean temperature gradient than area gradient
variation for such configurations. Further parametric and optimisation studies for $\Delta$
revealed a crucial finding that a positive mean temperature gradient, representing a heated duct
caused acoustic energy absorption. Similarly, a negative mean temperature gradient, representing
a cooled duct caused acoustic energy generation -- a key result of this analysis. This behaviour
was shown to be consistent with a simplified analysis of the acoustic energy balance. Based on this
finding, a linearly proportional reduction in acoustic energy generation was achieved by changing
the mean temperature gradient.

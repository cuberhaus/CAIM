Observations of time-resolved thermal emission from tidally locked exoplanets can tell us about
their atmospheric temperature structure. Telescopes such as JWST and ARIEL will improve the quality
and availability of these measurements. This motivates an improved understanding of the processes
that determine atmospheric temperature structure, particularly atmospheric circulation. The
circulation is important in determining atmospheric temperatures, not only through its ability
to transport heat, but also because any circulation pattern needs to be balanced by horizontal pressure
contrasts, therefore implying a particular temperature structure. In this work, we show how the
global temperature field on a tidally locked planet can be decomposed into contributions that are
balanced by different components of the atmospheric circulation. These are the superrotating
jet, stationary Rossby waves, and the divergent circulation. To achieve this, we partition the
geopotential field into components balanced by the divergent circulation and the rotational circulation,
with the latter comprising the jet and Rossby waves. The partitioned geopotential then implies
a corresponding partitioning of the temperature via the hydrostatic relation. We apply these diagnostics
to idealised general circulation model simulations, to show how the separate rotational and divergent
circulations together make up the total three-dimensional atmospheric temperature structure.
We also show how each component contributes distinct signatures to the thermal phase curve of a tidally
locked planet. We conclude that this decomposition is a physically meaningful separation of the
temperature field that explains its global structure, and can be used to fit observations of thermal
emission.

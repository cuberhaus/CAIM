Modern biomedical applications such as targeted drug delivery require a delivery system capable
of enhanced transport beyond that of passive Brownian diffusion. In this work an osmotic mechanism
for the propulsion of a vesicle immersed in a viscous fluid is proposed. By maintaining a steady-state
solute gradient inside the vesicle, a seepage flow of the solvent (e.g., water) across the semipermeable
membrane is generated which in turn propels the vesicle. We develop a theoretical model for this
vesicle-solute system in which the seepage flow is described by a Darcy flow. Using the reciprocal
theorem for Stokes flow it is shown that the seepage velocity at the exterior surface of the vesicle
generates a thrust force which is balanced by the hydrodynamic drag such that there is no net force
on the vesicle. We characterize the motility of the vesicle in relation to the concentration distribution
of the solute confined inside the vesicle. Any osmotic solute is able to propel the vesicle so long
as a concentration gradient is present. In the present work, we propose active Brownian particles
(ABPs) as a solute. To maintain a symmetry-breaking concentration gradient, we consider ABPs with
spatially varying swim speed and ABPs with constant properties but under the influence of an orienting
field. In particular, it is shown that at high activity the vesicle velocity is $\boldsymbol{U}\sim
[K_\perp /(\eta_e\ell_m) ]\int \Pi_0^\mathrm{swim} \boldsymbol{n} d\Omega $, where $\Pi_0^\mathrm{swim}$
is the swim pressure just outside the thin accumulation boundary layer on the interior vesicle surface,
$\boldsymbol{n}$ is the unit normal vector of the vesicle boundary, $K_\perp$ is the membrane permeability,
$\eta_e$ is the viscosity of the solvent, and $\ell_m$ is the membrane thickness.

In this work, the aggregation behaviour of RhB has been studied with the change in the concentration
of the RhB dye in water, ethanol and propanol using absorption and laser induced fluorescence spectroscopy.
The dimer and monomer fluorescence emissions were observed simultaneously in all the solvents.
The monomer to dimer fluorescence intensity ratio has been calculated and found that at a certain
concentration of RhB the magnitude of the ratio is different in different solvents. The ratio becomes
equivalent to one for 1.5 gm per l, 3 gm per l and 4.2 gm per l, concentration of RhB in water, ethanol
and propanol respectively. This concentration of RhB at which the monomer to dimer ratio becomes
unity is proposed as critical concentration. Above this critical concentration, the dimeric fluorescence
dominates and below which the monomeric fluorescence dominates. Moreover, in the solvent for which
the magnitude of critical concentration is less the fluorophore molecule aggregates more easily
and vice versa. So, water is found to be the most suitable solvent for RhB molecules for self-aggregation
than ethanol and propanol but with less dimeric quantum yield. It is also observed that the critical
concentration varies inversely with the dielectric constant of the solvents. Altogether, it can
be said that the proposed ratio and critical concentration quantify the aggregation process of
the fluorophore in the solvent. Hence, the critical concentration value of the fluorophore could
be assumed as the characteristic parameter to study the aggregation behaviour of the fluorophore
in solvents. The described method has the merit of use in the study of lasing ability and the wavelength
tunability of the dye laser gain media as well as in the heavy metal sensing technology in water. This
method may also be extended for other fluorophores and solvents.

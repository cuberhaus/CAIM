Cooperation among individuals has been key to sustaining societies. However, natural selection
favors defection over cooperation. Cooperation can be favored when the mobility of individuals
allows cooperators to form a cluster (or group). Mobility patterns of animals sometimes follow
a L\'evy flight. A L\'evy flight is a kind of random walk but it is composed of many small movements
with a few big movements. The role of L\'evy flights for cooperation has been studied by Antonioni
and Tomassini. They showed that L\'evy flights promoted cooperation combined with conditional
movements triggered by neighboring defectors. However, the optimal condition for neighboring
defectors and how the condition changes by the intensity of L\'evy flights are still unclear. Here,
we developed an agent-based model in a square lattice where agents perform L\'evy flights depending
on the fraction of neighboring defectors. We systematically studied the relationships among three
factors for cooperation: sensitivity to defectors, the intensity of L\'evy flights, and population
density. Results of evolutionary simulations showed that moderate sensitivity most promoted
cooperation. Then, we found that the shortest movements were best for cooperation when the sensitivity
to defectors was high. In contrast, when the sensitivity was low, longer movements were best for
cooperation. Thus, L\'evy flights, the balance between short and long jumps, promoted cooperation
in any sensitivity, which was confirmed by evolutionary simulations. Finally, as the population
density became larger, higher sensitivity was more beneficial for cooperation to evolve. Our study
highlights that L\'evy flights are an optimal searching strategy not only for foraging but also
for constructing cooperative relationships with others.

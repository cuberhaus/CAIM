The interactions of hydrated ions with solution and interface partners are strong on a chemical
energy scale. Here, we test the foremost \textit{ab initio theory} for evaluation of hydration
free energies of ions, namely, \textit{quasi-chemical theory} (QCT). We focus on halide anions,
but also the hydroxide anion, since they have been outstanding challenges for all theories. QCT
is built by identification of inner-shell clusters, separate treatment of those clusters, then
integration of those results into the broader-scale solution environment. We exploit a close comparison
with mass-spectrometric measurements of ion-hydration equilibria. That theory-experiment
comparison is excellent with moderate computational effort here. This agreement reinforces both
theory and experiment, and provides a numerically accurate inner-shell contribution to QCT. The
inner-shell complexes involving heavier halides display strikingly asymmetric hydration clusters.
QCT provides a favorable setting for exploitation of the polarizable continuum model (PCM) when
the inner-shell material shields the ion from the outer solution environment. For the asymmetrically
hydrated, and less effectively shielded, heavier halide ions, we investigate an inverse procedure
in which the inner-shell structures are sampled from readily available AIMD calculations on the
bulk solutions. This inverse procedure is a remarkable improvement and our final results are in
close agreement with a standard tabulation of hydration free energies. Comparison of anion hydration
cluster structures with bulk solutions from AIMD simulations emphasize slight differences: the
asymmetries of bulk solution inner-shell structures are moderated, but still present; and inner
shells fill to slightly higher average coordination numbers in bulk solution than in clusters.

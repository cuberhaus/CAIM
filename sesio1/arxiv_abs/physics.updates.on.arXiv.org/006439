A direct numerical simulation of an oblique shock wave impinging on a turbulent boundary layer at
Mach number 2.28 is carried out at moderate Reynolds number, matching the full conditions of the
reference experiment (Dupont et al., 2006). The low-frequency shock unsteadiness, whose characteristics
have been the focus of considerable research efforts, is here investigated via the Morlet wavelet
transform. Owing to its compact support in both physical and Fourier spaces, the wavelet transformation
makes it possible to track the time evolution of the various scales of the wall-pressure fluctuations.
This property also allows us to define a local intermittency measure, representing a frequency-dependent
flatness factor, to pinpoint the bursts of energy that characterise the shock intermittency scale
by scale. As a major result, we show that the broadband shock movement is actually the result of a collection
of sparse events in time, each characterised by its own temporal scale. This feature is hidden by
the classical Fourier analysis, which can only show the time-averaged behaviour. Then, we propose
a procedure to process any relevant time series, such as the time history of the wall-pressure or
that of the separation bubble extent,in which we use a condition based on the local intermittency
measure to filter out the turbulent content in the proximity of the shock foot and to isolate only
the intermittent component of the signal.In addition, wavelet analysis reveals the intermittent
behaviour also of the breathing motion of the recirculation bubble behind the reflected shock,
and allows us to detect a direct correspondence between the most significant intermittent events
of the separation region and those of the wall-pressure at the foot of the shock.

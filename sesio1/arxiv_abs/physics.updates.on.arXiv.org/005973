This paper studies the long-term migration of disturbed regolith materials on the surface of Solar
System small bodies from the viewpoint of nonlinear dynamics. We propose an approximation model
for secular mass movement, which combines the complex topography and irregular gravitational
field. Choosing asteroid 101955 Bennu as a representative, the global change of the dynamical environment
is examined, which presents a division of the creeping-sliding-shedding regions for a spun-up
asteroid. In the creeping region, the dynamical equation of disturbed regolith grains is established
based on the assumption of "trigger-slide" motion mode. The equilibrium points, local manifolds
and large-scale trajectories of the system are calculated to clarify the dynamical characteristics
of long-term regolith movement. Generally, we find for a low spin rate, the surface regolith grains
flow toward the middle latitudes from the polar/equatorial regions, which is dominated by the gradient
of the geopotential. While spun up to a high rate, regolith grains tend to migrate toward the equator,
which happens in parallel with a topological shift of the local equilibria at low latitudes. From
a long-term perspective, we find the equilibrium points dominate the global trends of regolith
movements. Using the methodology developed in this paper, we give a prospect or retrospect to the
secular motion of regolith materials during the spin-up process, and the results reveal a significant
regulatory role of the equilibria. Through a detailed look at the dynamical scheme under different
spin rates, we achieve a macro forecast of the global trends of regolith motion during the spin-up
process, which explains the global geologic evolution driven by the long-term movements of regolith
materials.

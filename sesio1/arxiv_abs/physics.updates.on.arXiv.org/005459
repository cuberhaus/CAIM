In our quest for investigating the nature of dark matter from the way its constituents interact with
ordinary matter, we propose an experiment using a \pbo ~calorimeter to search for or set new limits
on the production rate of i) hidden sector dark matter mediator in the $3 - 60$ MeV mass range via their
$e^+e^-$ decay (or $\gamma\gamma$ decay with limited tracking), and ii) the hypothetical X17 particle,
claimed in two recent experiments. The search for these particles is motivated by new dark matter
models and candidates introduced to account for the small-scale structure in astrophysical observations
and anomalies such as the 4.2$\sigma$ disagreement between experiments and the standard model
prediction for the muon anomalous magnetic moment, and the excess of $e^+e^-$ pairs from the $^8$Be
M1 nuclear transition to its ground state observed by the ATOMKI group. In these models the $1 - 100$
MeV mass range is particularly well-motivated and the lower part of this range still remains unexplored.
The proposed direct detection experiment will use a magnetic-spectrometer-free setup (the PRad
apparatus) to detect all three final state particles in the visible decay of the dark matter mediator
allowing for an effective control of the background and will cover the mass range in a single setting.
The use of the well-demonstrated PRad setup allows for an essentially ready-to-run and uniquely
cost-effective search for dark matter mediator in the $3 - 60$ MeV mass range with a sensitivity of
7.2$\times$10$^{-8}$ - 5.9$\times$10$^{-9}$ to $\epsilon^2$ the square of kinetic mixing interaction
coupling constant. In the first appendix, we show an example of this type of analysis using the $^{12}$C
data from the PRad experiment. In the second appendix, we detail the additional work that was done
after submitting this proposal before presenting at the JLab PAC49.

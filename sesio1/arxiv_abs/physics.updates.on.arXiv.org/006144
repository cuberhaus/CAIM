This work studies the effects of a through-flow on two-dimensional electrohydrodynamic (EHD)
flows of a dielectric liquid confined between two plane plates, as a model problem to further our
understanding of the fluid mechanics in the presence of an electric field. The liquid is subjected
to a strong unipolar charge injection from the bottom plate and a pressure gradient along the streamwise
direction. Highly-accurate numerical simulations and weakly nonlinear stability analyses based
on multiple-scale expansion and amplitude expansion methods are used to unravel the nonlinear
spatiotemporal instability mechanisms in this combined flow. We found that the through-flow makes
the hysteresis loop in the EHD flow narrower. In the numerical simulation of an impulse response,
the leading and trailing edges of the wavepacket within the nonlinear regime are consistent with
the linear ones, a result which we also verified against that in natural convection. In addition,
as the bifurcation in EHD-Poiseuille flows is of a subcritical nature, nonlinear finite-amplitude
solutions exist in the subcritical regime, and our calculation indicates that they are convectively
unstable. The validity of the Ginzburg-Landau equation (GLE), derived from the weakly nonlinear
expansion of Navier-Stokes equations and the Maxwell's equations in the quasi-electrostatic
limit, serving as a physical reduced-order model for probing the spatiotemporal dynamics in this
flow, has also been investigated. We found that the coefficients in the GLE calculated using amplitude
expansion method can predict the absolute growth rates even when the parameters are away from the
linear critical conditions, compared favourably with the local dispersion relation, whereas
the validity range of the GLE derived from the multiple-scale expansion method is confined to the
vicinity of the linear critical conditions.

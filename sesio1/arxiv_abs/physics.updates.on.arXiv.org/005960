An ensemble of identical, intrinsically non-interacting molecules exposed to quantum light is
discussed. Their interaction with the quantum light induces interactions between the molecules.
The resulting hybrid light-matter states exhibit complex structure even if only a single vibrational
coordinate per molecule is considered. Since all molecules are identical, it is appealing to start
from the uniform situation where all molecules possess the same value of this vibrational coordinate.
Then, polaritons and dark states follow like in atoms, but are functions of this coordinate, and
this vibrational degree of freedom makes the physics different from that of atoms. However, in spite
of all molecules being identical, each molecule does have its own vibrational coordinate. It is
thus a vital issue to understand the meaning of the uniform situation and how to depart from it, and
enable one to realistically investigate the ensemble. A rigorous and physically relevant meaning
of the polariton energy curves in the uniform situation has been found. It is proven that any point
on a polariton curve is a minimum or maximum for departing from the uniform situation. It is shown
how to explicitly compute the energetic impact of departing from the uniform situation using solely
properties of a single free molecule. The dark states and their behavior upon departing from the
uniform situation are analyzed as well. Useful techniques not used in this topical domain are introduced
and general results on, e.g., minimum energy path, symmetry breaking and restoration, are obtained.
It is shown how to transfer the findings to include several or even many nuclear degrees of freedom
per molecule and thus to address the problem of quantum light interacting with many complex molecules.
The interplay of several degrees of freedom in a single molecule of the ensemble leads to qualitatively
different physics.

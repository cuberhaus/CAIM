We devise reduced-dimension metrics for effectively measuring the distance between two points
(i.e., microstructures) in the microstructure space and quantifying the pathway associated with
microstructural evolution, based on a recently introduced set of hierarchical $n$-point polytope
functions $P_n$. The $P_n$ functions provide the probability of finding particular $n$-point
configurations associated with regular $n$-polytopes in the material system, and a special sub-set
of the standard $n$-point correlation functions $S_n$ that effectively decomposes the structural
features in the systems into regular polyhedral basis with different symmetry. The $n$-th order
metric $\Omega_n$ is defined as the $\mathbb{L}_1$ norm associated with the $P_n$ functions of
two distinct microstructures. By choosing a reference initial state (i.e., a microstructure associated
with $t_0 = 0$), the $\Omega_n(t)$ set quantifies the evolution of distinct polyhedral symmetries
and can in principle capture emerging polyhedral symmetries that are not apparent in the initial
state. To demonstrate their utility, we apply the $\Omega_n$ metrics to a 2D binary system undergoing
spinodal decomposition to extract the phase separation dynamics via the temporal scaling behavior
of the corresponding $\Omega_n(t)$, which reveals mechanisms governing the evolution. Moreover,
we employ $\Omega_n(t)$ to analyze pattern evolution during vapor-deposition of phase-separating
alloy films with different surface contact angles, which exhibit rich evolution dynamics including
both unstable and oscillating patterns. The $\Omega_n$ metrics have potential applications in
establishing quantitative processing-structure-property relationships, as well as real-time
processing control and optimization of complex heterogeneous material systems.

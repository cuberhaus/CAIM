Coupled cluster calculations are traditionally performed over Hartree-Fock reference orbitals
(HF-CC methodology). However, it has been repeatedly argued in the literature that the use of a Kohn-Sham
reference (KS-CC methodology) might result in improved performance relative to HF-CC at the same
computational cost. In the present theoretical study, we re-examine the relation of HF-CC and KS-CC
methods by comparing the results of widely applied truncated CC calculations (CCSD, CCSD(T), CCSDT)
to the limit of full configuration interaction (FCI), which in contrast to wave-function diagnostics
with vague physical meaning or experimental data with considerable uncertainty serves as an undebatable
reference point of accuracy. We find that apart from incidental exceptions, the Kohn-Sham referenced
CC methods show systematic deterioration compared to HF-CC, that is, the KS-CC molecular properties
(electronic energy and density) are always farther from the FCI limit than those obtained from HF-CC
at the same coupled cluster level. Furthermore, the introduction of common approximations (frozen
core, density fitting) to the CC calculation results in significantly higher errors in the case
of KS reference. We conclude that the use of KS reference orbitals is not expected to increase the
reliability of low-level CC energetics. Nevertheless, molecular errors from the components of
the studied chemical reaction might fortunately cancel out resulting in illusory improvement
compared to HF-CC. It is also notable that the choice of reference orbitals has negligible influence
on the results at sufficiently high CC levels which can be estimated by test calculations or by the
magnitude of double amplitudes. Therefore, the application of KS-CC is not unreasonable as it might
bypass the difficulties of HF convergence.

The subthalamic nucleus (STN) has an important role in the pathophysiology of the basal ganglia
in Parkinson's disease. The ability of STN cells to generate bursting rhythms under either transient
or sustained hyperpolarization may underlie the excessively synchronous beta rhythms observed
in Parkinson's disease. In this study, we developed a conductance-based single compartment model
of an STN neuron, which is able to generate characteristic activity patterns observed in experiments
including hyperpolarization-induced bursts and post-inhibitory rebound bursts. This study
focused on the role of three currents in rhythm generation: T-type calcium (CaT) current, L-type
calcium (CaL) current, and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) current.
To investigate the effects of these currents in rhythm generation, we performed a bifurcation analysis
using slow variables in these currents. Bifurcation analysis showed that the HCN current promotes
single-spike activity patterns rather than bursting in agreement with experimental results.
It also showed that the CaT current is necessary for characteristic bursting activity patterns.
In particular, the CaT current enables STN neurons to generate these activity patterns under hyperpolarizing
stimuli. The CaL current enriches and reinforces these characteristic activity patterns. In hyperpolarization-induced
bursts or post-inhibitory rebound bursts, the CaL current allows STN neurons to generate long bursting
patterns. Thus, bifurcation analysis explained the synergistic interaction of the CaT and CaL
currents, which enables STN neurons to respond to hyperpolarizing stimuli in a salient way. The
results of this study implicate the importance of CaT and CaL currents in the pathophysiology of
the basal ganglia in Parkinson's disease.

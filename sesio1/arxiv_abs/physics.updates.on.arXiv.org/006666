The seismic data not only acquired by seismometers but also acquired by vibrometers installed in
buildings and infrastructure and accelerometers installed in smartphones will be certainly utilized
for seismic research in the near future. Since it is impractical to utilize all the seismic big data
in terms of the computational cost, methods which can select observation sites depending on the
purpose are indispensable. We propose an observation site selection method for the accurate reconstruction
of the seismic wavefield by process-driven approaches. The proposed method selects observation
sites suitable for accurately estimating physical model parameters such as subsurface structures
and source information to be input into a numerical simulation of the seismic wavefield. The seismic
wavefield is reconstructed by the numerical simulation using the parameters estimated based on
the observed signals at only observation sites selected by the proposed method. The observation
site selection in the proposed method is based on the sensitivity of each observation site candidate
to the physical model parameters; the matrix corresponding to the sensitivity is constructed by
approximately calculating the derivatives based on the simulations, and then, observation sites
are selected by evaluating the quantity of the sensitivity matrix based on the D-optimality criterion
proposed in the optimal design of experiments. In the present study, physical knowledge on the sensitivity
to the parameters such as seismic velocity, layer thickness, and hypocenter location was obtained
by investigating the characteristics of the sensitivity matrix. Furthermore, the effectiveness
of the proposed method was shown by verifying the accuracy of seismic wavefield reconstruction
using the observation sites selected by the proposed method.

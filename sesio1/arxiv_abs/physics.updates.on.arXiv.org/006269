Modeling mass flows is classically based on hydrostatic balance equations. However, if momentum
transfers scale similarly in slope parallel and flow depth directions, then the gravity and acceleration
can have the same order of magnitude effects, urging for a non-hydrostatic model formulation. Here,
we extend existing single-phase Boussinesq-type models by developing a new non-hydrostatic model
for multi-phase mass flows consisting of solid and fine-solid particles and viscous fluid (Pudasaini
& Mergili, 2019). The new model includes enhanced gravity and dispersion considering various interfacial
momentum transfers. We outline new contributions in the non-hydrostatic Boussinesq-type multi-phase
gravity waves emerging from phase-interactions. We present a general, well-structured framework
of multi-phase mass flows with enhanced gravity and dispersion, setting a foundation for comprehensive
simulations. We discuss situations where non-hydrostatic, dispersive effects are more pronounced
for such flows. Reduced models demonstrate the importance of non-hydrostatic contributions.
Simplified analytical solutions reveal how the new dispersive model can be reduced to non-dispersive
ones, yet largely generalizing existing models. We postulate a novel, spatially varying dissipative
force, called the prime-force, which physically controls the dynamics and run-out of the mass flow
in a precise way. Practitioners and engineers may find this force very useful in technical applications.
This illuminates the need of formally including the prime-force in momentum equations. A simple
dispersion equation is derived highlighting the essence of dispersion on mass flow dynamics. Dispersion
produces a wavy velocity field about a reference state without dispersion, the first of this kind
for avalanching debris mass. Dispersion intensity increases energetically as the solid volume
fraction or friction decreases.

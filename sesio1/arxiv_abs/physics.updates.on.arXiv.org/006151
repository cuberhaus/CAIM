We are in the midst of quantum hype with some excessive claims of quantum computing potential, many
vendors' and even some research organizations' exaggerations, and a funding frenzy for very low
technology readiness level startups. Governments are contributing to this hype with their large
quantum initiatives and their technology sovereignty aspirations. Technology hypes are not bad
per se since they create emulation, drive innovations and also contribute to attracting new talents.
It works as scientists and vendors deliver progress and innovation on a continuous basis after a
so-called peak of expectations. It fails with exaggerated overpromises and underdeliveries that
last too long. It can cut short research and innovation funding in the mid to long term. After looking
at the shape and form of technology and science hypes and driving some lessons from past technology
hypes, we investigate the current quantum hype phenomenon and identify some of its specifics. We
find that, although there is some significant uncertainty on the potential to create real scalable
quantum computers, the scientific and vendor fields are relatively solid compared to other technology
hypes. Also, quantum technologies comprise other fields like quantum telecommunications and
quantum sensing with a higher technology readiness level, which are less prone to hype. We then make
some proposals to mitigate the potential negative effects of the current quantum hype including
recommendations on scientific communication to strengthen the trust in quantum science, vendor
behavior improvements, benchmarking methodologies, public education and putting in place a responsible
research and innovation approach. All-in-all, it is about restoring the role of science and scientists
in the current debates.

Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) has developed to be the most effective treatment for
aortic diseases. This study aims to evaluate the biomechanical implications of the implanted endograft
after TEVAR. We present a novel image-based, patient-specific, fluid-structure computational
framework. The geometries of blood, endograft, and aortic wall were reconstructed based on clinical
images. Patient-specific measurement data was collected to determine the parameters of the three-element
Windkessel. We designed three postoperative scenarios with rigid wall assumption, blood-wall
interaction, blood-endograft-wall interplay, respectively, where a two-way fluid-structure
interaction (FSI) method was applied to predict the deformation of the composite stent-wall. Computational
results were validated with Doppler ultrasound data. Results show that the rigid wall assumption
fails to predict the waveforms of blood outflow and energy loss (EL). The complete storage and release
process of blood flow energy, which consists of four phases is captured by the FSI method. The endograft
implantation would weaken the buffer function of the aorta and reduce mean EL by 19.1%. The closed
curve area of wall pressure and aortic volume could indicate the EL caused by the interaction between
blood flow and wall deformation, which accounts for 68.8% of the total EL. Both the FSI and endograft
have a slight effect on wall shear stress-related-indices. The deformability of the composite
stent-wall region is remarkably limited by the endograft. Our results highlight the importance
of considering the interaction between blood flow, the implanted endograft, and the aortic wall
to acquire physiologically accurate hemodynamics in post-TEVAR computational studies and the
deformation of the aortic wall is responsible for the major EL of the blood flow.

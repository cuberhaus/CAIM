We rigorously assess the potential for extracting high-resolution, multi-mode surface wave dispersion
data from distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) measurements using active-source multichannel
analysis of surface waves (MASW). We have utilized both highly-controlled, broadband vibroseis
shaker trucks and more-variable, narrow-band sledgehammer sources to excite the near surface,
and compare the DAS-derived dispersion data obtained from both source types directly with concurrently
acquired traditional geophone-derived dispersion data. We find that the differences between
the two sensing approaches are minimal and well within the dispersion uncertainty bounds associated
with each individual measurement type when the following conditions are met for DAS: (a) a tight-buffered
or strain-sensing fiber-optic cable is used, (b) the cable is buried in a shallow trench to enhance
coupling, and (c) short gauge lengths and small channel separations are used. We also show that frequency-dependent
normalization of the dispersion image following MASW processing removes the effects of scaling,
integration, and differentiation on the measured waveforms, thereby allowing nearly identical
dispersion data to be extracted from geophone waveforms and DAS waveforms without requiring them
to first be converted into equivalent units. We demonstrate that the short wavelength DAS dispersion
measurements are limited by both the gauge length and the more commonly considered channel separation.
We further show that it is possible to extract essentially equivalent surface wave dispersion data
from seismic measurements made using a traditional geophone array or two different DAS cables.
Finally, we show that shear wave velocity profiles recovered from the DAS data using an uncertainty-consistent,
multi-mode inversion agree favorably with cone penetration tests performed at the site.

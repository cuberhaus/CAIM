We develop a method to simulate the excitonic dynamics of realistic photosynthetic light harvesting
systems including non-Markovian coupling to phonon degrees of freedom, under excitation by N-photon
Fock state pulses. This method combines the input-output formalism and the hierarchical equations
of motion (HEOM) formalism into a double hierarchy of coupled linear equations in density matrices.
We show analytically that, under weak field excitation relevant to natural photosynthesis conditions,
an N-photon Fock state input and a corresponding coherent state input give rise to equal density
matrices in the excited manifold. However, an important difference is that an N-photon Fock state
input has no off-diagonal coherence between the ground and excited subspaces, in contrast with
the coherences created by a coherent state input. We derive expressions for the probability to absorb
a single Fock state photon, with or without the influence of phonons. For short pulses (or equivalently,
wide bandwidth pulses), we show that the absorption probability has a universal behavior that depends
only upon a system-dependent effective energy spread parameter {\Delta} and an exciton-light
coupling constant {\Gamma}. This holds for a broad range of chromophore systems and for a variety
of pulse shapes. We also analyse the absorption probability in the opposite long pulses (narrow
bandwidth) regime. We also derive an expression for the long time emission rate in the presence of
phonons and use it to study the difference between collective versus independent emission. Finally,
we present a numerical simulation for the LHCII monomer (14-mer) system under single photon excitation
that illustrates the use of the double hierarchy for calculation of Fock state excitation of a light
harvesting system including chromophore coupling to a non-Markovian phonon bath.

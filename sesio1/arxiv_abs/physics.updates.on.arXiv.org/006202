We investigate temporal and causal threads in the fabric of contemporary physical theories with
an emphasis on empirical and operationalistic aspects. Building on the axiomatization of general
relativity proposed by J. Ehlers, F. Pirani and A. Schild and the global space-time structure elaborated
by R. Penrose, S.W. Hawking, B. Carter and others, we argue that the current way of doing relativistic
physics presupposes treating time and causality as primitive concepts, neither of them being `more
primitive' than the other. The decision regarding which concepts to assume as primitive and which
statements to regard as axioms depends on the choice of the angle at which we contemplate the whole.
This standard approach is based on the presupposition that the concept of a point-like particle
is a viable approximation. However, this assumption is not supported by a realistic approach to
doing physics and, in particular, by quantum theory. We remove this assumption by analysing the
recent works by M. Eckstein and T. Miller. They consider the space $P(M)$ of probability measures
on space-time $M$ such that, for an element $\mu \in P(M)$, the number $\mu (K)$ specifies the probability
of the occurrence of some event associated with the space-time region $K$ and the measure $\mu$.
In this way, $M$ is not to be regarded as a collection of space-time events, but rather as a support
for corresponding probability measures. As shown by Eckstein and Miller, the space $P(M)$ inherits
the causal order from the underlying space-time and facilitates a rigorous notion of a `causal evolution
of probability measures'. We look at the deductive chains creating temporal and causal structures
analysed in these works, in order to highlight their operational (or quasi-operational) aspect.
This is impossible without taking into account the relative frequencies and correlations observed
in relevant experiments.

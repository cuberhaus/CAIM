The terrestrial water cycle links the soil and atmosphere moisture reservoirs through four fluxes:
precipitation, evaporation, runoff, and atmospheric moisture convergence (net import of water
vapor to balance runoff). Each of these processes is essential for human and ecosystem well-being.
Predicting how the water cycle responds to changes in vegetation cover remains a challenge. Recently,
changes in plant transpiration across the Amazon basin were shown to be associated exponentially
with changes in rainfall, suggesting that even small declines in transpiration (e.g. from deforestation)
would lead to much larger declines in rainfall. Here, constraining these findings by the law of mass
conservation, we show that in a sufficiently wet atmosphere, forest transpiration can control
atmospheric moisture convergence such that increased transpiration enhances atmospheric moisture
import and resulting water yield. Conversely, in a sufficiently dry atmosphere increased transpiration
reduces atmospheric moisture convergence and water yield. This previously unrecognized dichotomy
explains the otherwise mixed observations of how water yield responds to re-greening, as we illustrate
with examples from China's Loess Plateau. Our analysis indicates that any additional moisture
recycling due to additional vegetation increases precipitation but decreases local water yield
and steady-state runoff. Therefore, in the drier regions/periods and early stages of ecological
restoration, the role of vegetation can be confined to moisture recycling, while once a wetter stage
is achieved, additional vegetation enhances atmospheric moisture convergence. Evaluating the
transition between regimes, and recognizing the potential of vegetation for enhancing moisture
convergence, are crucial for characterizing the consequences of deforestation as well as for motivating
and guiding ecological restoration.

Quantum nonseparability is a central feature of quantum mechanics, and raises important philosophical
questions. Interestingly, a particular theoretical development of quantum mechanics, called
the process matrix formalism (PMF), features another kind of nonseparability, called causal nonseparability.
The PMF appeals to the notion of quantum process, which is a generalisation of the concept of quantum
state allowing to represent quantum-like correlations between quantum events over multiple parties
without specifying a priori their spatiotemporal locations. Crucially, since the PMF makes no
assumption about the global causal structure between quantum events, it allows for the existence
of causally nonseparable quantum processes having an indefinite causal structure. This work aims
at investigating the philosophical implications of causal nonseparability, especially for the
notion of spatiotemporal relations. A preliminary discussion will study the formal connection
between quantum and causal nonseparability. It will be emphasised that, although quantum processes
can be seen as a generalisation of density matrices, the conceptual distinction between the two
notions yields significant differences between quantum and causal nonseparability. From there,
it will be shown that, depending on the interpretative framework, causal nonseparability suggests
some kind of indeterminacy of spatiotemporal relations. Namely, within a realist context, spatiotemporal
relations can be epistemically or metaphysically indeterminate. Finally, it will be argued that,
in spite of the disanalogies between standard and causal nonseparability, similar implications
for spatial relations can already be defended in the context of standard quantum mechanics. This
work highlights the potentially very fruitful explorations of the implications of quantum features
on the conception of spacetime.

The three-dimensional structures of individual trees are important pieces of information necessary
to understand the effect of trees on urban environments. In this study, we demonstrate a method for
estimating the leaf area density (LAD) distribution of individual trees using high-resolution
airborne LiDAR. This method improves upon the previously proposed method, which calculates LAD
based on the contact frequency between the laser beams and leaves by tracing the paths of the laser
beams. The proposed method in this study exploits the last and intermediate pulses in addition to
the first and single pulses to capture the foliage distribution in the inner part of the crown. Each
laser beam is traced from a point derived by the last pulse to the point derived by the first or intermediate
pulse that is recorded immediately before the last pulse. The laser beam interceptions and intersections
can thus be accurately reproduced while considering the last and intermediate pulses. We verify
the estimation accuracy of the three-dimensional LAD distribution using terrestrial LiDAR data
from a single tree (Z. serrata). The appropriate voxel size for representing the LAD distribution
from the airborne LiDAR is first determined by comparing the distribution of voxels containing
one or more airborne LiDAR points with that containing one or more terrestrial LiDAR points. The
estimated LAD distribution with a voxel size of 1 m by 1 m by 0.5 m is subsequently compared to the terrestrial
LiDAR-derived LAD distribution. When only the first and single pulses are used, the LAD is overestimated
and underestimated in the upper and lower part of the crown, respectively. We confirmed that using
the last and intermediate pulses improves the estimation accuracy of the entire crown area.

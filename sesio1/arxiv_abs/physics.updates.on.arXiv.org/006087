In the nearly 60 years of spaceflight we have accomplished wonderful feats of exploration that have
shown the incredible spirit of the human drive to explore and understand our universe. Yet in those
60 years we have barely left our solar system with the Voyager 1 spacecraft launched in 1977 finally
leaving the solar system after 37 years of flight at a speed of 17 km/s or less than 0.006% the speed
of light. As remarkable as this is we will never reach even the nearest stars with our current propulsion
technology in even 10 millennium. We have to radically rethink our strategy or give up our dreams
of reaching the stars, or wait for technology that does not currently exist. While we all dream of
human spaceflight to the stars in a way romanticized in books and movies, it is not within our power
to do so, nor it is clear that this is the path we should choose. We posit a technological path forward,
that while not simple, it is within our technological reach. We propose a roadmap to a program that
will lead to sending relativistic probes to the nearest stars and will open up a vast array of possibilities
of flight both within our solar system and far beyond. Spacecraft from gram level complete spacecraft
on a wafer ("wafersats") that reach more than $1/4c$ and reach the nearest star in 20 years to spacecraft
with masses more than $10^5$ kg (100 tons) that can reach speeds of greater than 1000 km/s. These systems
can be propelled to speeds currently unimaginable with existing propulsion technologies. To do
so requires a fundamental change in our thinking of both propulsion and in many cases what a spacecraft
is. In addition to larger spacecraft, some capable of transporting humans, we consider functional
spacecraft on a wafer, including integrated optical communications, imaging systems, photon
thrusters, power and sensors combined with directed energy propulsion.

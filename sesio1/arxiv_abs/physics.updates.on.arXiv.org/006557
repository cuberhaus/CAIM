We present three methodological improvements of the "SCK CEN approach" for Bayesian inference
of the radionuclide inventory in radioactive waste drums, from radiological measurements. First
we resort to the Dirichlet distribution for the prior distribution of the isotopic vector. The Dirichlet
distribution possesses the attractive property that the elements of its vector samples sum up to
1. Second, we demonstrate that such Dirichlet priors can be incorporated within an hierarchical
modeling of the prior uncertainty in the isotopic vector, when prior information about isotopic
composition is available. Our used Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework makes use of this
available information but also acknowledges its uncertainty by letting to a controlled extent
the information content of the indirect measurement data (i.e., gamma and neutron counts) shape
the actual prior distribution of the isotopic vector. Third, we propose to regularize the Bayesian
inversion by using Gaussian process (GP) prior modeling when inferring 1D spatially-distributed
quantities. As of uncertainty in the efficiencies, we keep using the same stylized drum modeling
approach as proposed in our previous work to account for the source distribution uncertainty across
the vertical direction of the drum. A series of synthetic tests followed by application to a real
waste drum show that combining hierarchical modeling of the prior isotopic composition uncertainty
together with GP prior modeling of the vertical Pu profile across the drum works well. We also find
that our GP prior can handles both cases with and without spatial correlation. The computational
times involved by our proposed approach are on the order of a few hours, say about 2, to provide uncertainty
estimates for all variables of interest in the considered inverse problem. This warrants further
investigations to speed up the inference.

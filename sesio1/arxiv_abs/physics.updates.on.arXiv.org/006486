This study estimates the cost of building lunar landing pads and examines whether any construction
methods are economically superior to others. Some proposed methods require large amounts of mass
transported from the Earth, others require high energy consumption on the lunar surface, and others
have a long construction time. Each of these factors contributes direct and indirect costs to lunar
activities. The most important economic variables turn out to be the transportation cost to the
lunar surface and the magnitude of the program delay cost imposed by a construction method. The cost
of a landing pad depends sensitively on the optimization of the mass and speed of the construction
equipment, so a minimum-cost set of equipment exists for each construction method within a specified
economic scenario. Several scenarios have been analyzed across a range of transportation costs
with both high and low program delay costs. It is found that microwave sintering is currently the
most favorable method to build the inner, high temperature zone of a lunar landing pad, although
other methods are within the range of uncertainty. The most favorable method to build the outer,
low temperature zone of the landing pad is also sintering when transportation costs are high, but
it switches to polymer infusion when transportation costs drop below about \$110K/kg to the lunar
surface. It is estimated that the Artemis Basecamp could build a landing pad with a budgeted line-item
cost of \$229M assuming that transportation costs will be reduced modestly from the current rate
\$1M/kg to the lunar surface to \$300K/kg. A landing pad drops to \$130M when the transportation
cost drops further to \$100K/kg, or to \$47M if transportation costs fall below \$10K/kg. Ultimately,
landing pads can be built around the Moon at very low cost, due to economies of scale.

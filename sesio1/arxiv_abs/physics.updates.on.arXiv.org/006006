Organic aerosol (OA) is a key component to total submicron particulate matter (PM1), and comprehensive
knowledge of OA sources across Europe is crucial to mitigate PM1 levels. Europe has a well-established
air quality research infrastructure from which yearlong datasets using 21 aerosol chemical speciation
monitors (ACSMs) and 1 aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) were gathered during 2013-2019. It includes
9 non-urban and 13 urban sites. This study developed a state-of-the-art source apportionment protocol
to analyse long-term OA mass spectrum data by applying the most advanced source apportionment strategies
(i.e., rolling PMF, ME-2, and bootstrap). This harmonised protocol enables the quantifications
of the most common OA components such as hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA), biomass burning OA (BBOA), cooking-like
OA (COA), more oxidised-oxygenated OA (MO-OOA), and less oxidised-oxygenated OA (LO-OOA). Other
components such as coal combustion OA (CCOA), solid fuel OA (SFOA: mainly mixture of coal and peat
combustion), cigarette smoke OA (CSOA), sea salt (mostly inorganic but part of the OA mass spectrum),
coffee OA, and ship industry OA could also be separated at a few specific sites. Oxygenated OA (OOA)
components make up most of the submicron OA mass (average = 71.1%, a range of 43.7-100%). Solid fuel
combustion-related OA components (i.e., BBOA, CCOA, and SFOA) are still considerable with in total
16.0% yearly contribution to the OA, yet mainly during winter months (21.4%). Overall, this comprehensive
protocol works effectively across all sites governed by different sources and generates robust
and consistent source apportionment results. Our work presents a comprehensive overview of OA
sources in Europe with a unique combination of high time resolution and long-term data coverage
(9-36 months), providing essential information to improve/validate air quality, health impact,
and climate models.

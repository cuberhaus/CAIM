This study aims at introducing two conservative thermodynamic variables (moist-air entropy potential
temperature and total water content) into a one-dimensional variational data assimilation system
(1D-Var) to demonstrate the benefit for future operational assimilation schemes. This system
is assessed using microwave brightness temperatures from a ground-based radiometer installed
during the field campaign SOFOG3D dedicated to fog forecast improvement. An underlying objective
is to ease the specification of background error covariance matrices that are highly dependent
on weather conditions when using classical variables, making difficult the optimal retrievals
of cloud and thermodynamic properties during fog conditions. Background error covariance matrices
for these new conservative variables have thus been computed by an ensemble approach based on the
French convective scale model AROME, for both all-weather and fog conditions. A first result shows
that the use of these matrices for the new variables reduces some dependencies to the meteorological
conditions (diurnal cycle, presence or not of clouds) compared to usual variables (temperature,
specific humidity). Then, two 1D-Var experiments (classical vs. conservative variables) are
evaluated over a full diurnal cycle characterized by a stratus-evolving radiative fog situation,
using hourly brightness temperatures. Results show, as expected, that analysed brightness temperatures
by the 1D-Var are much closer to the observed ones than background values for both variable choices.
This is especially the case for channels sensitive to water vapour and liquid water. On the other
hand, analysis increments in model space (water vapour, liquid water) show significant differences
between the two sets of variables.

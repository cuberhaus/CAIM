Open-loop control is known to be an effective strategy for controlling self-excited thermoacoustic
oscillations in turbulent combustors. In this study, we investigate the suppression of thermoacoustic
instability in a lean premixed, laboratory-scale combustor using experiments and analysis. Starting
with a self-excited thermoacoustic instability in the combustor, we find that a progressive increase
in the swirler rotation rate transitions the system from thermoacoustic instability to the suppressed
state through a state of intermittency. To model such transition while also quantifying the underlying
synchronization characteristics, we extend the model of Dutta et al. [Phys. Rev. E 99, 032215 (2019)]
by introducing a feedback between the ensemble of mean-field phase oscillators and the basis expansion
of the acoustic pressure governing equation. The assumption that coupling strength among the oscillators
is a linear combination of acoustic and swirler rotation frequency is justified \textit{a posteriori}.
The link between the model and experimental results is quantitatively established by implementing
an optimization algorithm for model parameter estimation. We show that the model replicates the
bifurcation characteristics, time series, probability density function (PDF), and power spectral
density (PSD) of the various dynamical states observed during the transition to the suppressed
state, to excellent accuracy. Specifically, the model captures the change in the PDF of pressure
and heat release rate fluctuations from a bimodal distribution during thermoacoustic instability
to a unimodal distribution during suppression. Finally, we discuss the global and local flame dynamics
and show that the model qualitatively captures various aspects of spatio-temporal synchronization
that underlies the transition.

The treatment decisions for brain metastatic disease are driven by knowledge of the primary organ
site cancer histology, often requiring invasive biopsy. This study aims to develop a novel deep
learning approach for accurate and rapid non-invasive identification of brain metastatic tumor
histology with conventional whole-brain MRI. The use of clinical whole-brain data and the end-to-end
pipeline obviate external human intervention. This IRB-approved single-site retrospective
study was comprised of patients (n=1,293) referred for MRI treatment-planning and gamma knife
radiosurgery from July 2000 to May 2019. Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted contrast enhanced and
T2-weighted-Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery brain MRI exams (n=1,428) were minimally preprocessed
(voxel resolution unification and signal-intensity rescaling/normalization), requiring only
seconds per an MRI scan, and input into the proposed deep learning workflow for tumor segmentation,
modality transfer, and primary site classification associated with brain metastatic disease
in one of four classes (lung, melanoma, renal, and other). Ten-fold cross-validation generated
the overall AUC of 0.941, lung class AUC of 0.899, melanoma class AUC of 0.882, renal class AUC of 0.870,
and other class AUC of 0.885. It is convincingly established that whole-brain imaging features
would be sufficiently discriminative to allow accurate diagnosis of the primary organ site of malignancy.
Our end-to-end deep learning-based radiomic method has a great translational potential for classifying
metastatic tumor types using whole-brain MRI images, without additional human intervention.
Further refinement may offer invaluable tools to expedite primary organ site cancer identification
for treatment of brain metastatic disease and improvement of patient outcomes and survival.

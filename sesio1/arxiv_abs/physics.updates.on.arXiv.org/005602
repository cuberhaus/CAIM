In this article we present a new formulation and an associated algorithm for the simultaneous numerical
simulation of multiple condensed phase explosives in direct contact with each other, which may
also be confined by (or interacting with one or more) compliant inert materials. Examples include
composite rate-stick problems and interaction of shock waves with chemically-active particles
in condensed-phase explosives. There are several formulations which address the compliant or
structural response of confiners and particles due to detonations, but the direct interaction
of explosives remains a challenge for most formulations and algorithms. The proposed formulation
addresses this problem by extending the conservation laws and mixture rules of an existing hybrid
formulation to model the interaction of multiple explosive mixtures. An algorithm for the solution
of the resulting system of partial differential equations is presented, which includes a new robust
method for the retrieval of the densities of the constituents of each explosive mixture. The algorithm
is implemented in a hierarchical adaptive mesh refinement framework and validated against results
from problems with known solutions. It is evaluated for robustness for rate-stick and shock-induced
flows in particle-laden explosives case-studies. It is shown that the method can simulate the interaction
of detonation waves produced by military grade and commercial explosives in direct contact, each
with its own distinct equation of state and reaction rate law. The ability of the new model to simulate
reactive particles which are explicitly resolved in a heterogeneous explosive is demonstrated
by a case-study of a shock wave interacting with a high explosive bead embedded in liquid nitromethane.

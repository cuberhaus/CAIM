Mechanical properties of cellular structures, including the cell cytoskeleton, are increasingly
used as biomarkers for disease diagnosis and fundamental studies in cell biology. Recent experiments
suggest that the cell cytoskeleton and its permeating cytosol, can be described as a poroelastic
(PE) material. Biot theory is the standard model used to describe PE materials. Yet, this theory
does not account for the fluid viscous stress, which can lead to inaccurate predictions of the mechanics
in the dilute filamentous network of the cytoskeleton. Here, we adopt a two-phase model that extends
Biot theory by including the fluid viscous stresses in the fluid's momentum equation. We use generalized
linear viscoelastic (VE) constitutive equations to describe the permeating fluid and the network
stresses and assume a constant friction coefficient that couples the fluid and network displacement
fields. As the first step in developing a computational framework for solving the resulting equations,
we derive closed-form general solutions of the fluid and network displacement fields in spherical
coordinates. To demonstrate the applicability of our results, we study the motion of a rigid sphere
moving under a constant force inside a PE medium, composed of a linear elastic network and a Newtonian
fluid. We find that the network compressibility introduces a slow relaxation of the sphere and a
non-monotonic network displacements with time along the direction of the applied force. These
novel features cannot be predicted if VE constitutive equation is used for the medium. We show that
our results can be applied to particle-tracking microrheology to differentiate between PE and
VE materials and to independently measure the permeability and VE properties of the fluid and the
network phases.

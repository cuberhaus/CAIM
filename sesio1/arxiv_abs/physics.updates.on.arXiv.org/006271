In this study, ensembles of experimental data are presented and utilized to compare and validate
two models used in the simulation of variable density, compressible turbulent mixing. Though models
of this kind (Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes and Large Eddy Simulations) have been validated extensively
with more canonical flows in previous studies, the present approach offers novelty in the complexity
of the geometry, the ensemble based validation, and the uniformity of the computational framework
on which the models are tested. Moreover, all experimental and computational tasks were completed
by the authors which has led to a tightly coupled experimental configuration with its digital twin.
The experimental divergent shock tube facility and its data acquisition methods are described
and replicated in simulation space. A 2D Euler model which neglects the turbulent mixing at the interface
is optimized to experimental data using a Gaussian process. This model then serves as the basis for
both the 2D RANS and 3D LES studies that make comparisons to the mixing layer data from the experiment.
RANS is shown to produce good agreement with experimental data only at late flow development times.
The LES ensembles generally show good agreement with experimental data, but display sensitivity
to the characterization of initial conditions. Resolution dependent behavior is also observed
for certain higher-order statistics of interest. Overall, the LES model successfully captures
the effects of divergent geometry, compressibility, and combined non-linear instabilities inherent
to the problem. The successful prediction of mixing width and its growth rate highlight the existence
of three distinct regimes in the development of the instability, each with similarities to previously
studied instabilities.

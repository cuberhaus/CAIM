Long-chained, viscoelastic surfactant solutions (VES) have been widely employed in the oil and
gas industry, particularly in hydraulic fracturing and gravel-packing operations, where turbulence
is commonly reached due to high pumping rates. With this motivation, we experimentally investigate
the turbulent duct flow of an under-studied class of wormlike micellar solutions that forms a gel
at room temperature. The fluid is characterized via rotational rheometry, and the turbulent velocity
and Reynolds stress profiles are measured via Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA). Three surfactant
concentrations are investigated at increasing Reynolds numbers. The turbulent flow fields of
water, and semi-dilute solutions of partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) and xanthan gum
(XG) are used as comparisons. Our study reveals that the gel-like structure of the wormlike micellar
gel is mostly broken down during turbulent flow, especially in the near-wall region where the results
indicate the presence of a water layer. Turbulent flow at low concentrations of surfactant show
a Newtonian-like flow field throughout most of the duct, where the energy spectra shows a -5/3 power
law scale with wavenumber, whereas higher concentrations lead to drag reduction and lower power
spectral densities at large wavenumbers. A comparison of the flow of polymeric fluids and the wormlike
micellar solutions at maximum drag reduction (MDR) shows comparable drag-reduction effects,
with a large decrease in Reynolds shear stresses, and increased turbulence anisotropy in the buffer
layer due to the large streamwise fluctuations and near-zero wall-normal fluctuations. Additionally,
the MDR regime was bounded by Virk's asymptote for both polymers and the micellar gel, which implies
a similar mechanism of drag reduction at MDR.

Molecules in molecular junctions are subject to current-induced forces that can break chemical
bonds, induce reactions, destabilize molecular geometry, and halt the operation of the junction.
Theories behind current-driven molecular dynamics simulations rely on a perturbative time-scale
separation within the system with subsequent use of nonequilibrium Green's functions (NEGF) to
compute conservative, non-conservative, and stochastic forces exerted by electrons on nuclear
degrees of freedom. We analyze the effectiveness of this approximation, paying particular attention
to the phenomenon of negative viscosities. The perturbative approximation is directly compared
to the nonequilibrium Ehrenfest approach. We introduce a novel time-stepping approach to calculate
the forces present in the Ehrenfest method via exact integration of the equations of motion for the
nonequilibrium Green's functions, which does not necessitate a time-scale separation within
the system and provides an exact description for the corresponding classical dynamics. We observe
that negative viscosities are not artifacts of a perturbative treatment but also emerge in Ehrenfest
dynamics. However, the effects of negative viscosity have the possibility of being overwhelmed
by the predominantly positive dissipation due to the higher-order forces unaccounted for by the
perturbative approach. Additionally, we assess the validity of the white-noise approximation
for the stochastic forces, finding that it is justifiable in the presence of a clear time-scale separation
and is more applicable when the current-carrying molecular orbital is moved outside of the voltage
window. Finally, we demonstrate the method for molecular junction models consisting of one and
two classical degrees of freedom.

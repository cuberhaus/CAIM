It was discovered several decades ago that eddy covariance measurements systematically underestimate
sensible and latent heat fluxes, creating an imbalance in the surface energy budget. Since then,
many studies have addressed this problem and proposed a variety of solutions to the problem, including
improvements to instruments and correction methods applied during data postprocessing. However,
none of these measures have led to the complete closure of the energy balance gap. The leading hypothesis
is that not only surface-attached turbulent eddies but also sub-mesoscale atmospheric circulations
contribute to the transport of energy in the atmospheric boundary layer, and the contribution from
organized motions has been grossly neglected. The problem arises because the transport of energy
through these secondary circulations cannot be captured by the standard eddy covariance method
given the relatively short averaging periods of time (~30 minutes) used to compute statistics.
There are various approaches to adjust the measured heat fluxes by attributing the missing energy
to the sensible and latent heat flux in different proportions. However, few correction methods
are based on the processes causing the energy balance gap. Several studies have shown that the magnitude
of the energy balance gap depends on the atmospheric stability and the heterogeneity scale of the
landscape around the measurement site. Based on this, the energy balance gap within the surface
layer has already been modelled as a function of a nonlocal atmospheric stability parameter by performing
a large-eddy simulation study with idealized homogeneous surfaces. We have further developed
this approach by including thermal surface heterogeneity in addition to atmospheric stability
in the parameterization.

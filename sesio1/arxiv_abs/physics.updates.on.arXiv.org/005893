Beam Intercepting Devices (BIDs) are essential protection elements for the operation of the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC) complex. The LHC internal beam dump (LHC Target Dump Injection or LHC TDI)
is the main protection BID of the LHC injection system; its main function is to protect LHC equipment
in the event of a malfunction of the injection kicker magnets during beam transfer from the SPS to
the LHC. Several issues with the TDI were encountered during LHC operation, most of them due to outgassing
from its core components induced by electron cloud effects, which led to limitations of the injector
intensity and hence had an impact on LHC availability. The absorbing cores of the TDIs, and of beam
intercepting devices in general, need to deal with high thermo-mechanical loads induced by the
high intensity particle beams. In addition, devices such as the TDI - where the absorbing materials
are installed close to the beam, are important contributors to the accelerator impedance budget.
To reduce impedance, the absorbing materials that make up the core must be typically coated with
high electrical conductivity metals. Beam impact testing of the coated absorbers is a crucial element
of development work to ensure their correct operation. The behaviour of several metal-coated absorber
materials was investigated when exposed to high intensity and high energy proton beams in the HiRadMat
facility at CERN. Different coating configurations based on copper and molybdenum, and absorbing
materials such as isostatic graphite, Carbon Fibre Composite (CfC) and Silicon Carbide reinforced
with Silicon Carbide fibres (SiC-SiC), were tested in the facility to assess the TDI's performance
and to extract information for other BIDs using these materials. In addition to beam impact tests
and an extensive Post Irradiation Examination (PIE) campaign, extensive numerical simulations
were carried out.

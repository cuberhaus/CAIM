Morphing wings comprised of fixed leading sections with piezocomposite trailing control surfaces
have emerged as a novel active control technique for unmanned aerial vehicles. However, the wake
dynamics and aerodynamic performance of such hybrid airfoil configuration has not been thoroughly
investigated. In this paper, direct numerical simulations of two-dimensional flows over hybrid
airfoils comprised of NACA 0012 leading sections with piezocomposite trailing control surfaces
are performed at a fixed Reynolds number of 1000. The effects of length and camber of the trailing
control surface on the laminar aerodynamic characteristics are studied over a wide range of angle
of attack. It is shown that the flow behind the airfoil exhibits different features, including steady
flow, periodic vortex shedding, and quasi-periodic vortex shedding for different configurations.
The transition between these wake states occurs at slightly smaller angles of attack compared to
the nominal NACA 0012 airfoil. While the drag coefficient remains close to each other at a fixed angle
of attack, the lift coefficient of the hybrid airfoil is positively affected by the length and camber
of the trailing control surface. The mechanism of lift generation is examined by surface pressure
distributions and a force element analysis. It is revealed that with increased camber of the trailing
control surface, the flow on both the suction and pressure sides of the airfoil are modified in a beneficial
way to enhance lift. Increasing the length ratio only significantly modifies the flow near the aft
section on the pressure side. The results herein provide a laminar aerodynamic characterization
of hybrid airfoils with trailing control surfaces, and could potentially aid the design of control
techniques for next-generation small unmanned aerial vehicles.

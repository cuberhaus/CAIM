Climate change is an ongoing topic in nearly all areas of society since many years. A discussion of
climate change without referring to scientific results is not imaginable. This is especially the
case for policies since action on the macro scale is required to avoid costly consequences for society.
In this study, we deal with the question of how research on climate change and policy are connected.
In 2019, the new Overton database of policy documents was released including links to research papers
that are cited by policy documents. The use of results and recommendations from research on climate
change might be reflected in citations of scientific papers in policy documents. Although we suspect
a lot of uncertainty related to the coverage of policy documents in Overton, there seems to be an impact
of international climate policy cycles on policy document publication. We observe local peaks
in climate policy documents around major decisions in international climate diplomacy. Our results
point out that IGOs and think tanks -- with a focus on climate change -- have published more climate
change policy documents than expected. We found that climate change papers that are cited in climate
change policy documents received significantly more citations on average than climate change
papers that are not cited in these documents. Both areas of society (science and policy) focus on
similar climate change research fields: biology, earth sciences, engineering, and disease sciences.
Based on these and other empirical results in this study, we propose a simple model of policy impact
considering a chain of different document types: the chain starts with scientific assessment reports
(systematic reviews) that lead via science communication documents (policy briefs, policy reports
or plain language summaries) and government reports to legislative documents.

Accurate modeling of sea ice dynamics is critical for predicting environmental variables and is
important in applications such as navigating ice breaker ships. Research for both modeling and
simulating sea ice dynamics is ongoing, with the most widely accepted model based on the viscous-plastic
(VP) formulation introduced by Hibler in 1979. Due to its highly nonlinear features, this model
is intrinsically challenging for computational solvers. In particular, sea ice simulations often
significantly differ from satellite observations. This study therefore focuses on improving
the numerical accuracy of the VP sea ice model. Since the poor convergence observed in existing numerical
simulations stems from the nonlinear nature of the VP formulation, this investigation proposes
using the celebrated weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme -- as opposed to the frequently
employed centered difference (CD) scheme -- for the spatial derivatives in the VP sea ice model.
We then proceed to numerically demonstrate that WENO yields higher-order convergence for smooth
solutions, and that furthermore it is able to resolve the discontinuities in the sharp features
of sea ice covers -- something that is not possible using CD methods. Finally, our proposed framework
integrates a potential function method that utilizes the phase field method to naturally incorporates
the physical restrictions of ice thickness and ice concentration in transport equations, resulting
in a modified transport equations which includes additional forcing terms. Our method does not
require post-processing, thereby avoiding the possible introduction of discontinuities and
corresponding negative impact on the solution behavior. Numerical experiments are provided to
demonstrate the efficacy of our new methodology.

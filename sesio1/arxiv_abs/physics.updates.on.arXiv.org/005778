Ionic liquid ion sources are a promising technology that can be used for many applications from space
propulsion to focused ion beam microetching. Ionic liquid ion sources produce ion beams by extracting
single ions and metastable solvated ion clusters from the surface of the ionic liquid and accelerating
them using an electric field generated by applying a voltage between a sharp tip and a plate with an
aperture. The solvated ion clusters often fragment in the electric field region, reducing the specific
impulse and efficiency for propulsion applications and increasing the beam spot size for focused
ion beam applications. Fragmentation behavior has previously been characterized in the region
with no electric field. However, fragmentation in an electric field has not been investigated as
experimental results are difficult to interpret. The goal of this work is to use various numerical
methods to characterize fragmentation under the effect of an electric field. Molecular dynamics
simulations are performed of various ionic liquid clusters under different conditions to determine
the rate of fragmentation. Physics-based models are compared to the molecular dynamics results
with the goal of deriving a new model that accounts for the effect of the electric field on fragmentation.
Approximate Bayesian computational methods are employed to infer the temperature of different
ionic liquid cluster types and the percentage of the beam composed of each species by comparing simulated
retarding potential analysis curves to experimental ones. Finally, the results of multi-scale
N-body simulations are postprocessed and compared to experimental data. Results show agreement
between experimental data and N-body simulations using the fragmentation rates determined by
molecular dynamics.

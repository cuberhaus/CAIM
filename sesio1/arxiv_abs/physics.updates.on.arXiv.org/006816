We present the Migdal In Galactic Dark mAtter expLoration (MIGDAL) experiment aiming at the unambiguous
observation and study of the so-called Migdal effect induced by fast-neutron scattering. It is
hoped that this elusive atomic process can be exploited to enhance the reach of direct dark matter
search experiments to lower masses, but it is still lacking experimental confirmation. Our goal
is to detect the predicted atomic electron emission which is thought to accompany nuclear scattering
with low, but calculable probability, by deploying an Optical Time Projection Chamber filled with
a low-pressure gas based on CF$_4$. Initially pure CF$_4$ will be used, and then mixed with other
elements employed by leading dark matter search technologies -- including noble species, plus
Si and Ge. High resolution track images generated by a Gas Electron Multiplier stack, together with
timing information from scintillation and ionisation readout, will be used for 3D reconstruction
of the characteristic event topology expected for this process -- an arrangement of two tracks sharing
a common vertex, with one belonging to a Migdal electron and the other to a nuclear recoil. Different
energy-loss rate distributions along both tracks will be used as a powerful discrimination tool
against background events. In this article we present the final design of the experiment, informed
by extensive particle and track simulations and detailed estimations of signal and background
rates. In pure CF$_4$ we expect to observe 8.9 (29.3) Migdal events per calendar day of exposure to
an intense D-D (D-T) neutron generator beam at the NILE facility located at the Rutherford Appleton
Laboratory (UK). With our assumptions, 5$\sigma$ median discovery significance can be achieved
in under one day with either generator.

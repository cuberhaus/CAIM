The term 'resilience' is increasingly being used in social-technical-environmental systems
sciences and particularly also in the Earth system sciences. However, the diversity of resilience
concepts and a certain (sometimes intended) openness of proposed definitions can lead to misunderstandings
and may impede their application to complex systems modelling. We propose a guideline that aims
to ease communication as well as to support systematic development of research questions and models
in the context of resilience. It can be applied independently of the modelling framework or underlying
theory of choice. At the heart of this guideline is a checklist consisting of four questions to be
answered: (i) Resilience of what? (ii) Resilience regarding what? (iii) Resilience against what?
(iv) Resilience how? We refer to the answers to these resilience questions as the "system", the "sustainant",
the "adverse influence", and the "response options". The term 'sustainant' is a neologism describing
the feature of the system (state, structure, function, pathway, ...) that should be maintained
(or restored quickly enough) in order to call the system resilient. The use of this proposed guideline
in the field of Earth system resilience is demonstrated for the application example of a potential
climate tipping element: the Amazon rainforest. The example illustrates the diversity of possible
answers to the checklist's questions as well as their benefits in structuring the modelling process.
The guideline supports the modeller in communicating precisely what is actually meant by 'resilience'
in a specific context. This combination of freedom and precision could help to advance the resilience
discourse by building a bridge between those demanding unambiguous definitions and those stressing
the benefits of generality and flexibility of the resilience concept.

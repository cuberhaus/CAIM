Natural hazards cause disruptions in access to critical facilities, such as grocery stores, impeding
residents ability to prepare for and cope with hardships during the disaster and recovery; however,
disrupted access to critical facilities is not equal for all residents of a community. In this study,
we examine disparate access to grocery stores in the context of the 2017 Hurricane Harvey in Harris
County, Texas. We utilized high-resolution location-based datasets in implementing spatial
network analysis and dynamic clustering techniques to uncover the overall disparate access to
grocery stores for socially vulnerable populations during different phases of the disaster. Three
access indicators are examined using network-centric measures: number of unique stores visited,
average trip time to stores, and average distance to stores. These access indicators help us capture
three dimensions of access: redundancy, rapidity, and proximity. The findings show the insufficiency
of focusing merely on the distributional factors, such as location in a food desert and number of
facilities, to capture the disparities in access, especially during the preparation and impact/short-term
recovery periods. Furthermore, the characterization of access by considering combinations of
access indicators reveals that flooding disproportionally affects socially vulnerable populations.
High-income areas have better access during preparation as they are able to visit a greater number
of stores and commute farther distances to obtain supplies. The conclusions of this study have important
implications for urban development (facility distribution), emergency management, and resource
allocation by identifying areas most vulnerable to disproportionate access impacts using more
equity-focused and data-driven approaches.

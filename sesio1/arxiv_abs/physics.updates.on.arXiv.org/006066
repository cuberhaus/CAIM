A two-phase, low-Mach-number flow solver is created and verified for variable-density liquid
and gas with phase change. The interface is captured in a sharp manner using a split Volume-of-Fluid
method generalized for a non divergence-free liquid velocity and with mass exchange across the
interface. Mass conservation to machine-error precision is achieved in the limit of incompressible
liquid. This model is implemented for two-phase mixtures at supercritical pressure but subcritical
temperature conditions for the liquid, as it is the common case in the early times of liquid hydrocarbon
injection under real-engine conditions. Under this thermodynamic environment, the dissolution
of the gas species into the liquid phase is enhanced and vaporization or condensation can occur simultaneously
at different locations along the liquid-gas interface. The greater numerical challenges that
appear compared to incompressible two-phase solvers are successfully addressed for the first
time: (a) local thermodynamic phase equilibrium and jump conditions determine the interface solution
(e.g., temperature, composition, surface-tension coefficient); (b) a real-fluid thermodynamic
model is considered; and (c) phase-wise values for certain variables (e.g., velocity) are obtained
via extrapolation techniques. The increased numerical cost is alleviated by using the split pressure-gradient
technique to develop a pressure Poisson equation (PPE) for the low-Mach-number flow. Thus, a Fast
Fourier Transform (FFT) method is implemented, which directly solves the continuity constraint
without an iterative process. Various verification tests show the accuracy and viability of the
present approach. Then, the growth of surface instabilities in a binary system composed of liquid
n-decane and gaseous oxygen at supercritical pressures for n-decane is analyzed. Other features
of supercritical liquid injection are also shown.

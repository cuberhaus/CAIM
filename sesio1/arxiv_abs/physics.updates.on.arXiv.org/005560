Emulating natural mechanisms in technology has become a very efficient technique to optimize and
improve the current machinery. Riblets are such kinds of bio-inspired surface patterns which are
seen on Sharks. Their geometric properties induce secondary flows resulting in lower drag, allowing
Sharks to achieve such high speeds. Secondary flows are broadly subcategorized into Prandtls first
and second kind; the secondary flows induced by riblets belong primarily to Prandtls second kind.
These secondary flows have been proven to delay the boundary layer separation by reducing momentum
losses. This paper aims to optimize the use of these bio-inspired patterns on an airfoil. By applying
the ribletted surface on an airfoil, the boundary layer separation can be delayed, thus leading
to a reduction in drag and increasing the critical angle of attack. Specific geometric properties
such as the height and the wavelength of the riblets are varied to find the most optimal design. The
design framework couples the optimization algorithm, computational fluid dynamics, and post-processing
analysis. An Invasive Weed Model is implemented for optimization due to its commendable performance
in converging close to global optima. The optimization process is initialized by generating a population
of riblet profiles with randomly distributed geometry parameters. These profiles are then evolved
over generations with the objective to minimize the drag, which is computed through Computational
Fluid Dynamics simulations conducted on OpenFOAM. The optimized geometries show a significant
reduction in drag as compared to bare airfoils. Lastly, a flow field analysis of the optimized geometry
established using the genetic algorithm is done to understand the riblets-induced enhancement
in the aerodynamic efficiency of the airfoil.

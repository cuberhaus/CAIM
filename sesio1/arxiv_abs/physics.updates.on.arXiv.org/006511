Micro- and nanoscale optical or microwave cavities are used in a wide range of classical applications
and quantum science experiments, ranging from precision measurements, laser technologies to
quantum control of mechanical motion. The dissipative photon loss via absorption, present to some
extent in any optical cavity, is known to introduce thermo-optical effects and thereby impose fundamental
limits on precision measurements. Here, we theoretically and experimentally reveal that such
dissipative photon absorption can result in quantum feedback via in-loop field detection of the
absorbed optical field, leading to the intracavity field fluctuations to be squashed or antisquashed.
Strikingly, this modifies the optical cavity susceptibility in coherent response measurements
and causes excess noise and correlations in incoherent interferometric optomechanical measurements
using a cavity. We experimentally observe such unanticipated dissipative dynamics in optomechanical
spectroscopy of sideband-cooled optomechanical crystal cavitiess at both cryogenic temperature
(approximately 8 K) and ambient conditions. The dissipative feedback introduces effective modifications
to the optical cavity linewidth and the optomechanical scattering rate and gives rise to excess
imprecision noise in the interferometric quantum measurement of mechanical motion. Such dissipative
feedback differs fundamentally from a quantum nondemolition feedback, e.g., optical Kerr squeezing.
The dissipative feedback itself always results in an antisqueezed out-of-loop optical field,
while it can enhance the coexisting Kerr squeezing under certain conditions. Our result has wide-ranging
implications for future dissipation engineering, such as dissipation enhanced sideband cooling
and Kerr squeezing, quantum frequency conversion, and nonreciprocity in photonic systems.

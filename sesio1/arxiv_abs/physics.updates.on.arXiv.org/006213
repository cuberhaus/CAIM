Maxwell theory is usually treated in the lab frame under the standard time order (light-signal clock
synchronization). Particle tracking in the lab frame usually treats time as an independent variable.
Then, the evolution of electron beams is treated according to the absolute time convention (non-standard
clock synchronization). This point has never received attention in the accelerator community.
There are two ways of coupling fields and particles. The first, Lorentz's way, consists in `translating'
Maxwell's electrodynamics to the absolute time world-picture. The second, Einstein's way, consists
in `translating' particle tracking results to the electromagnetic world-picture. Conventional
particle tracking shows that the electron beam direction changes after a transverse kick, while
the orientation of the microbunching fronts stays unvaried. We show that under Einstein's time
order, in the ultrarelativistic asymptote the orientation of the planes of simultaneity is always
perpendicular to the electron beam velocity. This allows for the production of coherent undulator
radiation from a modulated electron beam in the kicked direction without suppression. We hold a
recent FEL study at the LCLS as experimental evidence of microbunching wavefront readjusting after
a large kick. In a previous paper we quantitatively described this result invoking the aberration
of light, corresponding to Lorentz's way of coupling fields and particles. Here we give details
of the Lorentz's approach used in that paper. We also demonstrate that an `inverse translation'
of particle tracking results to the standard time order resolves puzzles related with the strong
qualitative disagreement between simulations and experiments. Previous simulation results
in ultrarelativistic electron beam physics should be reexamined in the light of the difference
between particle tracking and electromagnetic world-pictures.

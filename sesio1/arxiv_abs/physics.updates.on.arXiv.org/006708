The SuperFGD will be a part of the ND280 near detector of the T2K and Hyper Kamiokande projects, that
will help to reduce systematic uncertainties related with neutrino flux and cross-section modeling.
The upgraded ND280 will be able to perform a full exclusive reconstruction of the final state from
neutrino-nucleus interactions, including measurements of low momentum protons, pions and, for
the first time, event-by event measurements of neutron kinematics. The time resolution defines
the neutron energy resolution. We present the results of time resolution measurements made with
the SuperFGD prototype that consists of 9216 plastic scintillator cubes (cube size is 1 cm$^3$)
readout with 1728 wavelength-shifting fibers going along three orthogonal directions. We use
data from the muon beam exposure at CERN. The time resolution of 0.97 ns was obtained for one readout
channel after implementing the time calibration with a correction for the time-walk effect. The
time resolution improves with energy deposited in a scintillator cube. Averaging two readout channels
for one scintillator cube improves the time resolution to 0.68 ns which means that signals in different
channels are not synchronous. Therefore the contribution from the time recording step of 2.5 ns
is averaged as well. Averaging time values from N channels improves the time resolution by $\sim
1/\sqrt{N}$. Therefore a very good time resolution should be achievable for neutrons since neutron
recoils hit typically several scintillator cubes and in addition produce larger amplitudes than
muons. Measurements performed with a laser and a wide-bandwidth oscilloscope demonstrated that
the time resolution obtained with the muon beam is not far from its expected limit. The intrinsic
time resolution of one channel is 0.67 ns for signals of 56 photo-electron typical for minimum ionizing
particles.

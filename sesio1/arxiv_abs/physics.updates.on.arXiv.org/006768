We investigate wind wave growth by direct numerical simulations solving for the two-phase Navier-Stokes
equations. We consider ratio of the wave speed $c$ to wind friction velocity $u_*$ from $c/u_*=$
2 to 8, i.e. in the slow to intermediate wave regime; and initial wave steepness $ak$ from 0.1 to 0.3;
the two being varied independently. The turbulent wind and the travelling, nearly monochromatic
waves are fully coupled without any subgrid scale models. The wall friction Reynolds number is 720.
The novel fully-coupled approach captures the simultaneous evolution of the wave amplitude and
shape, together with the underwater boundary layer (drift current), up to wave breaking. The wave
energy growth computed from the time-dependent rms surface elevation is in quantitative agreement
with that computed from the extracted surface pressure distribution, which confirms the leading
role of the pressure forcing for finite amplitude gravity waves. The phase shift and the amplitude
of the principal mode of surface pressure distribution are systematically reported, to provide
direct evidence for possible wind wave growth theories. Intermittent and localised airflow separation
is observed for steep waves with small wave age. The wave form drag force is not a strong function of
wave age but closely related to wave steepness. The time evolution of the rms steepness and the wave
form drag suggests that there is an effect of the history of wind wave coupling, which is due to the
different wave crest shape and other complex coupling effects. The normalised wave growth rate
we obtain agrees with previous experimental and numerical studies. We make an effort to clarify
various commonly-adopted underlying assumptions, and to reconcile the scattering of the data
between different previous theoretical, numerical, and experimental results, as we revisit this
longstanding problem with new numerical evidence.

We describe a procedure to obtain the plasma parameters from the I-V Langmuir curve by using the Druyvesteyn
equation. We propose to include two new parameters, $q$ and $r$, to the usual plasma parameters:
plasma potential ($V_p$), floating potential ($V_f$), electron density ($n$), and electron temperature
($T$). These new parameters can be particularly useful to represent non-Maxwellian distributions.
The procedure is based on the fit of the I-V Langmuir curve with the $q$-Weibull distribution function,
and is motivated by recent works which use the $q$-exponential distribution function derived from
Tsallis statistics. We obtain the usual plasma parameters employing three techniques: the numerical
differentiation using Savitzky Golay (SG) filters, the $q$-exponential distribution function,
and the $q$-Weibull distribution function. We explain the limitations of the $q$-exponential
function, where the experimental data $V>V_p$ needs to be trimmed beforehand, and this results
in a lower accuracy compared to the numerical differentiation with SG. To overcome this difficulty,
the $q$-Weibull function is introduced as a natural generalization to the $q$-exponential distribution,
and it has greater flexibility in order to represent the concavity change around $V_p$. We apply
this procedure to analyze the measurements corresponding to a nitrogen $N_2$ cold plasma obtained
by using a single Langmuir probe located at different heights from the cathode. We show that the $q$
parameter has a very stable numerical value with the height. This work may contribute to clarify
some advantages and limitations of the use of non-extensive statistics in plasma diagnostics,
but the physical interpretation of the non-extensive parameters in plasma physics remains not
fully clarified, and requires further research.

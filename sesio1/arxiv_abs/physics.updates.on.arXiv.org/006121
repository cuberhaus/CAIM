Shortening acquisition time and reducing the motion artifacts are two of the most essential concerns
in magnetic resonance imaging. As a promising solution, deep learning-based high-quality MR image
restoration has been investigated to generate higher resolution and motion artifact-free MR images
from lower resolution images acquired with shortened acquisition time, without costing additional
acquisition time or modifying the pulse sequences. However, numerous problems still exist to prevent
deep learning approaches from becoming practical in the clinic environment. Specifically, most
of the prior works focus solely on the network model but ignore the impact of various downsampling
strategies on the acquisition time. Besides, the long inference time and high GPU consumption are
also the bottlenecks to deploy most of the prior works in clinics. Furthermore, prior studies employ
random movement in retrospective motion artifact generation, resulting in uncontrollable severity
of motion artifact. More importantly, doctors are unsure whether the generated MR images are trustworthy,
making diagnosis difficult. To overcome all these problems, we employed a unified 2D deep learning
neural network for both 3D MRI super resolution and motion artifact reduction, demonstrating such
a framework can achieve better performance in 3D MRI restoration tasks compared to other states
of the art methods and remains the GPU consumption and inference time significantly low, thus easier
to deploy. We also analyzed several downsampling strategies based on the acceleration factor,
including multiple combinations of in-plane and through-plane downsampling, and developed a
controllable and quantifiable motion artifact generation method. At last, the pixel-wise uncertainty
was calculated and used to estimate the accuracy of the generated image, providing additional information
for reliable diagnosis.

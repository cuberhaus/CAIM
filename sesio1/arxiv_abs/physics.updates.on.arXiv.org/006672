In this paper, we perform full-waveform regional moment tensor (RMT) inversions, to gain insight
into the stress distribution along the Lesser Antilles arc. We developed a novel inversion approach,
AmPhiB - Amphibious Bayesian, taking into account uncertainties associated with OBS deployments
like the orientation of horizontal components and the high noise level. The inversion is conducted
using a direct, uniform importance sampling of the fault parameters within a tree structure. We
show that the alignment of the horizontal OBS components influences the obtained source mechanism
when using standard least-squares (L2) RMT inversion schemes, resulting in systematic errors
in the recovered focal mechanisms including high artificial CLVD contributions. AmPhiB reduces
these CLVD components by nearly 60% and the aberration of the focal geometry as measured by the Kagan
angle by around 40% relative to a standard L2 inversion. Subsequently, we obtain 45 (Mw > 3.8) regional
MT solutions. Combining our new results with existing solutions, we subsequently analyze a total
of 151 solutions in a FMC diagram and map them to the regional tectonic setting. We perform stress
tensor inversions along the arc. On the plate interface, we observe a compressional stress regime
and find evidence for upper-plate strike slip and normal fault behaviour in the north and a near arc-perpendicular
extensional stress regime towards the south. A dominant slab perpendicular extensional stress
regime is found in the slab at 100-200 km at the arcs center. We interpret this stress condition to
be a result of slab pull varying along the arc due to partial slab detachment along previously hypothesized
lateral slab tear near Grenada, at the southern end of the LA arc, leading to reactivation of preexisting
structures around the subducted Proto-Caribbean ridge.

The relationships between material constructions and reflective spectrum patterns are important
properties of photonic crystals. One particular interesting reflectance profile is a high-intensity
and uniform three-peak pattern with peak positions right located at the red, green, and blue (RGB,
three original colors) region. For ease of construction, a seek for using one-dimensional photonic
crystals to achieve RGB triple reflective bands is a meaningful endeavor. Only very limited previous
studies exist, all relying on traditional periodic photonic crystals (PPCs) and of large thickness.
The underlying physical principles remain elusive, leaving the question of thickness limit to
achieve RGB bands unaddressed. Here, we present the first detailed work to explore the thickness
limit issue based on both theoretical and experimental investigation. A set of heuristically derived
design principles are used to uncover that the break of translational symmetry, thus introducing
heterostructure photonic crystals (HPCs), is essential to reduce the total optical path difference
(OPD) to ~ 3200nm (the theoretical limit) while still exhibiting high-quality RGB bands. A systematic
experiment based on a 12-layer heterostructure construction was performed and well confirmed
the theoretical predictions. The associated three-peak properties are successfully used to realize
quantum dot fluorescent enhancement phenomena. Furthermore, the HPC exhibits unusually stability
against solvent stimulus, in strong contrast to typical behaviors reported in PPCs. Our work for
the first time proposes and verifies important rational rules for designing ultrathin HPCs toward
RGB reflective bands, and provides insights for a wider range of explorations of light manipulation
in photonic crystals.

Background: Edge-on-irradiated silicon detectors are currently being investigated for use in
photon-counting CT applications. The low atomic number of silicon leads to a significant number
of incident photons being Compton scattered in the detector, depositing a part of their energy and
potentially being counted multiple times. Although the physics of Compton scatter is well established,
the effects of Compton interactions in the detector on image quality for an edge-on-irradiated
silicon detector have still not been thoroughly investigated. Purpose: To investigate and explain
effects of Compton scatter on zero-frequency DQE for photon-counting CT using edge-on-irradiated
silicon detectors. Methods: We extend an existing Monte Carlo model of an edge-on-irradiated silicon
detector to develop projection and image domain performance metrics for pure density and pure spectral
imaging tasks. We show that the lowest energy threshold of the detector can be used as an effective
discriminator of primary counts and cross-talk caused by Compton scatter. We study the developed
metrics as functions of the lowest threshold energy. Results: Density imaging performance decreases
monotonically as a function of the lowest threshold in both projection and image domains. Spectral
imaging performance has a plateau between 0 and 10 keV and decreases monotonically thereafter,
in both projection and image domain. Conclusions: Compton interactions contribute significantly
to the density imaging performance of edge-on-irradiated silicon detectors. With the studied
detector topology, the benefit of counting primary Compton interactions outweighs the penalty
of multiple counting at all lower threshold energies. Compton interactions also contribute significantly
to the spectral imaging performance for measured energies above 10 keV.

To celebrate Hans Frauenfelder's achievements, we examine energy(-like) "landscapes" for complex
living systems. Energy landscapes summarize all possible dynamics of some physical systems. Energy(-like)
landscapes can explain some biomolecular processes, including gene expression and, as Frauenfelder
showed, protein folding. But energy-like landscapes and existing frameworks like statistical
mechanics seem impractical for describing many living systems. Difficulties stem from living
systems being high dimensional, nonlinear, and governed by many, tightly coupled constituents
that are noisy. The predominant modeling approach is devising differential equations that are
tailored to each living system. This ad hoc approach faces the notorious "parameter problem": models
have numerous nonlinear, mathematical functions with unknown parameter values, even for describing
just a few intracellular processes. One cannot measure many intracellular parameters or can only
measure them as snapshots in time. Another modeling approach uses cellular automata to represent
living systems as discrete dynamical systems with binary variables. Quantitative (Hamiltonian-based)
rules can dictate cellular automata (e.g., Cellular Potts Model). But numerous biological features,
in current practice, are qualitatively described rather than quantitatively (e.g., gene is (highly)
expressed or not (highly) expressed). Cellular automata governed by verbal rules are useful representations
for living systems and can mitigate the parameter problem. However, they can yield complex dynamics
that are difficult to understand because much of the existing mathematical tools and theorems apply
to continuous but not discrete dynamical systems. Recent studies found ways to overcome this challenge
by discovering a predictive "landscape" that yield low-dimensional representations of cellular
automata dynamics. We review these studies.

The ground-state Hanle effect (GSHE) in alkali-metal atomic vapors using a single circularly polarized
wave underlies one of the most robust and simplest techniques in atomic magnetometry. This effect
causes a narrow (subnatural-width) resonance in the light wave intensity transmitted through
a vapor cell. Usually, GSHE-based sensors operate in the spin-exchange-relaxation-free (SERF)
regime. However, this regime requires a relatively high temperature of vapors (150 C or higher),
leading to a relatively large heat release and power consumption of the sensor head. Besides, without
applying special measures, SERF regime significantly limits a dynamic range of measurements.
Here, we study a pump-probe scheme involving a single elliptically polarized wave and a polarimetric
detection technique. The wave is in resonance with two adjacent optical transitions in the cesium
D1 line (894.6 nm) owing to their overlapping in presence of a buffer gas (Ne, 130 Torr). Using a small
(0.1 cm$^3$) glass vapor cell, we demonstrate a possibility of observing subnatural-width resonances
with a high contrast-to-width ratio (up to 45 %/mG) under a low-temperature (60 C) regime of operation
thanks to a strong light-induced circular dichroism. Basing on a $\Lambda$ scheme of atomic energy
levels, we obtain explicit analytical expressions for the line shape. The model reveals a linewidth
narrowing effect due to openness of the scheme. This result is unusual for magneto-optical atomic
spectroscopy because the openness is commonly considered as a undesirable effect, degrading the
resonance characteristics. We estimate a sensitivity of 1.8 pT/$\surd$Hz with a 60 fT/$\surd$Hz
sensitivity in the photon-shot-noise limit. The results contribute to the theory of GSHE resonances
and can be applied to development of a low-temperature high-sensitivity miniaturized magnetic
field sensor with an extended dynamic range.

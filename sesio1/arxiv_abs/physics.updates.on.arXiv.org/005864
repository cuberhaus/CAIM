Recent advances in the processing of thin-film LNOI have enabled low-loss photonic integrated
circuits, modulators with improved half-wave voltage, electro-optic frequency combs and novel
on-chip electro-optic devices, with applications ranging from 5G telecommunication and microwave
photonics to microwave-to-optical quantum interfaces. Lithium niobate integrated photonic
circuits could equally be the basis of integrated narrow-linewidth frequency-agile lasers. Pioneering
work on polished lithium niobate crystal resonators has led to the development of electrically
tunable narrow-linewidth lasers. Here we report low-noise frequency-agile lasers based on lithium
niobate integrated photonics and demonstrate their use for coherent laser ranging. This is achieved
through heterogeneous integration of ultra-low-loss silicon nitride photonic circuits with
thin-film lithium niobate via direct wafer bonding. This platform features low propagation loss
of 8.5 dB/m enabling narrow-linewidth lasing (intrinsic linewidth of 3 kHz) by self-injection
locking to a III-V semiconductor laser diode. The hybrid mode of the resonator allows electro-optical
laser frequency tuning at a speed of 12 PHz/s with high linearity, low hysteresis and while retaining
narrow linewidth. Using this hybrid integrated laser, we perform a proof-of-concept FMCW LiDAR
ranging experiment, with a resolution of 15 cm. By fully leveraging the high electro-optic coefficient
of lithium niobate, with further improvements in photonic integrated circuits design, these devices
can operate with CMOS-compatible voltages, or achieve mm-scale distance resolution. Endowing
low loss silicon nitride integrated photonics with lithium niobate, gives a platform with wide
transparency window, that can be used to realize ultrafast tunable lasers from the visible to the
mid-infrared, with applications from OCT and LiDAR to environmental sensing.

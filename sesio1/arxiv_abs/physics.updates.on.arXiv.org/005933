Our ability to grasp and understand complex phenomena is essentially based on recognizing structures
and relating these to each other. For example, any meteorological description of a weather condition
and explanation of its evolution recurs to meteorological structures, such as convection and circulation
structures, cloud fields and rain fronts. All of these are spatiotemporal structures, defined
by time-dependent patterns in the underlying fields. Typically, such a structure is defined by
a verbal description that corresponds to the more or less uniform, often somewhat vague mental images
of the experts. However, a precise, formal definition of the structures or, more generally, concepts
is often desirable, e.g., to enable automated data analysis or the development of phenomenological
models. Here, we present a systematic approach and an interactive tool to obtain formal definitions
of spatiotemporal structures. The tool enables experts to evaluate and compare different structure
definitions on the basis of data sets with time-dependent fields that contain the respective structure.
Since structure definitions are typically parameterized, an essential part is to identify parameter
ranges that lead to desired structures in all time steps. In addition, it is important to allow a quantitative
assessment of the resulting structures simultaneously. We demonstrate the use of the tool by applying
it to two meteorological examples: finding structure definitions for vortex cores and center lines
of temporarily evolving tropical cyclones. Ideally, structure definitions should be objective
and applicable to as many data sets as possible. However, finding such definitions, e.g., for the
common atmospheric structures in meteorology, can only be a long-term goal. The proposed procedure,
together with the presented tool, is just a first approach to facilitate this long and arduous way.

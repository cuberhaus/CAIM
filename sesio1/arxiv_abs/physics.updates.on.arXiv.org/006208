Chemical kinetic models are an essential component in the development and optimisation of combustion
devices through their coupling to multi-dimensional simulations such as computational fluid
dynamics (CFD). Low-dimensional kinetic models which retain good fidelity to the reality are needed,
the production of which requires considerable human-time cost and expert knowledge. Here, we present
a novel automated compute intensification methodology to produce overly-reduced and optimised
(compact) chemical kinetic models. This algorithm, termed Machine Learned Optimisation of Chemical
Kinetics (MLOCK), systematically perturbs each of the four sub-models of a chemical kinetic model
to discover what combinations of terms results in a good model. A virtual reaction network comprised
of n species is first obtained using conventional mechanism reduction. To counteract the imposed
decrease in model performance, the weights (virtual reaction rate constants) of important connections
(virtual reactions) between each node (species) of the virtual reaction network are numerically
optimised to replicate selected calculations across four sequential phases. The first version
of MLOCK, (MLOCK1.0) simultaneously perturbs all three virtual Arrhenius reaction rate constant
parameters for important connections and assesses the suitability of the new parameters through
objective error functions, which quantify the error in each compact model candidate's calculation
of the optimisation targets, which may be comprised of detailed model calculations and/or experimental
data. MLOCK1.0 is demonstrated by creating compact models for the archetypal case of methane air
combustion. It is shown that the NUGMECH1.0 detailed model comprised of 2,789 species is reliably
compacted to 15 species (nodes), whilst retaining an overall fidelity of ~87% to the detailed model
calculations, outperforming the prior state-of-art.

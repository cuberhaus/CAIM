Reductions of the self-consistent mean field theory model of amphiphilic molecules in solvent
leads to a singular family of functionalized Cahn-Hilliard (FCH) energies. We modify the energy,
removing singularities to stabilize the computation of the gradient flows and develop a series
of benchmark problems that emulate the "morphological complexity" observed in experiments. These
benchmarks investigate the delicate balance between the rate of arrival of amphiphilic materials
onto an interface and a least energy mechanism to accommodate the arriving mass. The result is a trichotomy
of responses in which two-dimensional interfaces grow either by a regularized motion against curvature,
pearling bifurcations, or curve-splitting directly into networks of interfaces. We evaluate
a number of schemes that use second order BDF2-type time stepping coupled with Fourier pseudo-spectral
spatial discretization. The BDF2-type schemes are either based on a fully implicit time discretization
with a preconditioned steepest descent (PSD) nonlinear solver or upon linearly implicit time discretization
based on the standard implicit-explicit (IMEX) and the scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) approaches.
We add an exponential time differencing (ETD) scheme for comparison purposes. All schemes use a
fixed local truncation error target with adaptive time-stepping to achieve the error target. Each
scheme requires proper "preconditioning" to achieve robust performance that can enhance efficiency
by several orders of magnitude. The nonlinear PSD scheme achieves the smallest global discretization
error at fixed local truncation error, however the IMEX and SAV schemes are the most computationally
efficient as measured by the number of FFT calls required to achieve a desired global error.

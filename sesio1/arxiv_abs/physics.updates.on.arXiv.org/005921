Traditional microbial detection methods often rely on the overall property of microbial cultures
and cannot resolve individual growth event at high spatiotemporal resolution. As a result, they
require bacteria to grow to confluence and then interpret the results. Here, we demonstrate the
application of an integrated ptychographic sensor for lensless cytometric analysis of microbial
cultures over a large scale and with high spatiotemporal resolution. The reported device can be
placed within a regular incubator or used as a standalone incubating unit for long-term microbial
monitoring. For longitudinal study where massive data are acquired at sequential time points,
we report a new temporal-similarity constraint to increase the temporal resolution of ptychographic
reconstruction by 7-fold. With this strategy, the reported device achieves a centimeter-scale
field of view, a half-pitch spatial resolution of 488 nm, and a temporal resolution of 15-second
intervals. For the first time, we report the direct observation of bacterial growth in a 15-second
interval by tracking the phase wraps of the recovered images, with high phase sensitivity like that
in interferometric measurements. We also characterize cell growth via longitudinal dry mass measurement
and perform rapid bacterial detection at low concentrations. For drug-screening application,
we demonstrate proof-of-concept antibiotic susceptibility testing and perform single-cell
analysis of antibiotic-induced filamentation. The combination of high phase sensitivity, high
spatiotemporal resolution, and large field of view is unique among existing microscopy techniques.
As a quantitative and miniaturized platform, it can improve studies with microorganisms and other
biospecimens at resource-limited settings.

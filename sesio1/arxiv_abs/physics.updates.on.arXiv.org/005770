We use hybrid density functional calculations to assess n-type doping in monoclinic (Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$
alloys. We focus on Si, the most promising donor dopant, and study the structural properties, formation
energies and charge-state transition levels of its various configurations. We also explore the
impact of C and H, which are common impurities in metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD).
In Ga$_2$O$_3$, Si$_{Ga}$ is an effective shallow donor, but in Al$_2O_3$ Si$_{Al}$ acts as a DX
center with a (+/-) transition level in the band gap. Interstitial H acts as a shallow donor in Ga$_2$O$_3$,
but behaves as a compensating acceptor in n-type Al$_2O_3$. Interpolation indicates that Si is
an effective donor in (Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ up to 70% Al, but it can be compensated by H already
at 1% Al. We also assess the diffusivity of H and study complex formation. Si$_{cation}$-H complexes
have relatively low binding energies. Substitutional C on a cation site acts as a shallow donor in
Ga$_2$O$_3$, but can be stable in a negative charge state in (Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ when
x>5%. Substitutional C on an O site (C$_O$) always acts as an acceptor in n-type (Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$,
but will incorporate only under relatively O-poor conditions. C$_O$-H complexes can actually
incorporate more easily, explaining observations of C-related compensation in Ga$_2$O$_3$ grown
by MOCVD. We also investigate C$_{cation}$-H complexes, finding they have high binding energies
and act as compensating acceptors when x>56%; otherwise the H just passivates the unintentional
C donors. C-H complex formation explains why MOCVD grown Ga$_2$O$_3$ can exhibit record-low free-carrier
concentrations, in spite of the unavoidable incorporation of C. Our study highlights that, while
Si is a suitable shallow donor in ALGO alloys, control of unintentional impurities is essential
to avoid compensation.

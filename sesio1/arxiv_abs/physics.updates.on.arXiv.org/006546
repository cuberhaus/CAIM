We study theoretically and numerically spatial distribution and collision rate of droplets that
sediment in homogeneous isotropic Navier-Stokes turbulence. It is assumed that typical turbulent
accelerations of fluid particles are much smaller than gravity. This was shown to imply that the
particles interact weakly with individual vortices and, as a result, form a smooth flow in most of
the space. In weakly intermittent turbulence with moderate Reynolds number, rare regions where
the flow breaks down can be neglected in the calculation of space averaged rate of droplet collisions.
However, increase of Re increases probability of rare, large quiescent vortices whose long coherent
interaction with the particles destroys the flow. Thus at higher Re the space averaged collision
rate forms in rare regions where the assumption of smooth flow breaks down. We describe the transition
between the regimes and provide collision kernel in the case of moderate Re describable by the flow.
The distribution of pairwise distances is shown to obey a separable dependence on the magnitude
and the polar angle of the separation vector. Magnitude dependence obeys a power-law with a negative
exponent, manifesting multifractality of the droplet's attractor. We provide the so far missing
numerical confirmation of a relation between this exponent and the Lyapunov exponents and demonstrate
that it holds beyond the theoretical range. The angular dependence of the RDF exhibits a maximum
at small angles quantifying particle's formation of spatial columns. We derive the droplet's collision
kernel using that in the considered limit the gradients of droplet's flow are Gaussian. We demonstrate
that as Re increases the column's aspect ratio decreases, eventually becoming one when the isotropy
is restored. We propose how the theory could be constructed at higher Re of clouds by using the example
of the RDF.

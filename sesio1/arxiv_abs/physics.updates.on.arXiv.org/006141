While our natural intuition suggests us that we live in 3D space evolving in time, modern physics
presents fundamentally different picture: 4D spacetime, Einstein's block universe, in which
we travel in thermodynamically emphasized direction: arrow of time. Suggestions for such nonintuitive
and nonlocal living in kind of "4D jello" come among others from: Lagrangian mechanics we use from
QFT to GR saying that history between fixed past and future situation is the one optimizing action,
special relativity saying that different velocity observers have different present 3D hypersurface
and time direction, general relativity deforming shape of the entire spacetime up to switching
time and space below the black hole event horizon, or the CPT theorem concluding fundamental symmetry
between past and future. Accepting this nonintuitive living in 4D spacetime: with present moment
being in equilibrium between past and future - minimizing tension as action of Lagrangian, leads
to crucial surprising differences from intuitive "evolving 3D" picture, in which we for example
conclude satisfaction of Bell inequalities - violated by the real physics. Specifically, particle
in spacetime becomes own trajectory: 1D submanifold of 4D, making that statistical physics should
consider ensembles like Boltzmann distribution among entire paths, what leads to quantum behavior
as we know from Feynman's Euclidean path integrals or similar Maximal Entropy Random Walk (MERW).
It results for example in Anderson localization, or the Born rule with squares - allowing for violation
of Bell inequalities. Specifically, quantum amplitude turns out to describe probability at the
end of half-spacetime from a given moment toward past or future, to randomly get some value of measurement
we need to "draw it" from both time directions, getting the squares of Born rules.

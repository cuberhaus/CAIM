It is theorized that in gas giants, an outer convection zone advances into the interior as the surface
cools, and multiple convective layers form beneath that convective front. To study layer formation
below an outer convection zone in a similar scenario, we investigate the evolution of a stably-stratified
fluid with a linear composition gradient that is constantly being cooled from above. We use the Boussinesq
approximation in a series of 2D simulations at low and high Prandtl numbers ($\mathrm{Pr} = 0.5$
and 7), initialized with different temperature stratifications, and cooled at different rates.
We find that simulations initialized with an isothermal temperature profile form multiple convective
layers at $\mathrm{Pr} = 7$. These layers result from an instability of a diffusive thermal boundary
layer below the outer convection zone. At low Pr, layers do not form. Double-diffusive instabilities
drive the fluid below the outer convection zone into a state of turbulent diffusion rather than layered
convection. Changing the initial distribution of temperature to decrease linearly with depth
results in lower values of the inverse density ratio $R^{-1}\equiv S_{z}/T_{z}$ (given the normalization
in this work), and consequently, the spontaneous formation of multiple convective layers at low
Pr. For the stratifications used in this study, on the long-term the composition gradient is an ineffective
barrier against the propagation of the outer convection zone and the entire fluid becomes fully-mixed,
whether layers form or not. Our results challenge 1D evolutionary models of gas giant planets, which
predict that layers are long-lived and that the outer convective envelope stops advancing inwards.
We discuss what is needed for future work to build more realistic models.

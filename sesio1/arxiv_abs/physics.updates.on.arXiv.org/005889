The primate heteromodal cortex presents an evident functional modularity at a mesoscopic level,
with physiological and anatomical evidence pointing to it as likely substrate of long-term memory.
In order to investigate some of its properties, a model of multimodular autoassociator is studied.
Each of the many modules represents a neocortical functional ensemble of recurrently connected
neurons and operates as a Hebbian autoassociator, storing a number of local features which it can
recall upon cue. The global memory patterns are made of combinations of features sparsely distributed
across the modules. Intermodular connections are modelled as a finite-connectivity random graph.
Any pair of features in any respective pair of modules is allowed to be involved in several memory
patterns; the coarse-grained modular network dynamics is defined in such a way as to overcome the
consequent ambiguity of associations. Effects of long-range homeostatic synaptic scaling on
network performance are also assessed. The dynamical process of cued retrieval almost saturates
a natural upper bound while producing negligible spurious activation. The extent of finite-size
effects on storage capacity is quantitatively evaluated. In the limit of infinite size, the functional
relationship between storage capacity and number of features per module reduces to that which other
authors found by methods from equilibrium statistical mechanics, which suggests that the origin
of the functional form is of a combinatorial nature. In contrast with its apparent inevitability
at intramodular level, long-range synaptic scaling results to be of minor relevance to both retrieval
and storage capacity, casting doubt on its existence in the neocortex. A conjecture is also posited
about how statistical fluctuation of connectivity across the network may underpin spontaneous
emergence of semantic hierarchies through learning.

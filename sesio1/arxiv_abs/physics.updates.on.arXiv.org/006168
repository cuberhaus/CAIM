I propose the Cosmic Hitchhikers hypothesis as follows. Advanced extraterrestrial civilizations
may use free-floating planets as interstellar transportation for space exploration and interstellar
colonization. Large groups or populations of their biological species, post-biological species,
and technologies may become Cosmic Hitchhikers when they ride free-floating planets to reach,
explore and colonize planetary systems. To get an interstellar ride, Cosmic Hitchhikers may travel
to free-floating planets passing close by their home worlds. Otherwise, they may use astronomical
engineering to steer free-floating planets toward their home planetary systems. Cosmic Hitchhikers
may also ride objects native to the outer regions of their planetary systems, which become free-floating
planets when ejected by astronomical engineering or by their stars during the asymptotic giant
branch evolution. During interstellar travel, Cosmic Hitchhikers may apply astronomical engineering
to steer their free-floating planets toward the planetary systems of their choice. Whereas riding
free-floating planets may not save travel time, it avoids the technical challenges of interstellar
spacecraft transporting large populations. Each civilization of Cosmic Hitchhikers may colonize
several planetary systems. Its colonies may grow into autonomous civilizations, changing the
number of civilizations in the Galaxy. Over the last 4 billion years, Cosmic Hitchhikers or their
artifacts riding free-floating planets might have passed by the Solar System. Therefore, their
artifacts might exist in the Solar System or in our stellar neighborhood. SETI and SETA should include
the search for Cosmic Hitchhikers and their artifacts. Keywords: SETI, SETA, free-floating planet,

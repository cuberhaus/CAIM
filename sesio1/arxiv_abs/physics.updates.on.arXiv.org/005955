As experimental methods become increasingly popular in crowd dynamics, the question of experimental
validity becomes more critical than ever. For the purposes of evaluation of crowd experiments,
it is paramount that we distinguish between different dimensions of their validity. Here, we differentiate
between four types of experimentation in crowd dynamics based on their underlying purpose of investigation.
This includes experiments whose main aim is (i) testing a behavioural theory/hypothesis, (ii)
exploring empirical behavioural regularities; (iii) assessing collective (system-level) performance
rather than individual behaviour (iv) calibrating and/or validating pre-existing models. While
delineating various dimensions of external/internal validity as they relate to crowd experiments,
we argue how the importance of different validity dimensions varies depending on investigation
purpose. This could provide clarity about circumstances where artificiality of laboratory settings
is justified as opposed to experiments for which higher levels of contextual fidelity should be
given more weight. It is critical that investigators (a) be conscious of the trade-off between controllability
and realism in their experiment design and (b) identify potential factors that can jeopardise validity
of their experiments and mitigate them. Inferences made from field data do not invariably supersede
those of experiments on the issue of validity. Depending on the purpose of investigation, maintaining
internal validity sometimes necessitates laboratory settings and justifies artificiality.
In the absence of adequate control over the causal relationship, the question of external validity
will be futile. Therefore, striking a reasonable balance between internal and external validity
of crowd experiments should be made a major design consideration.

Historically, the dominant conceptual paradigm of porous media flow, solute mixing and transport
was based on steady two-dimensional flows in heterogeneous porous media. Although it is now well
recognised that novel transport phenomena can arise in unsteady and/or three-dimensional flows
at both the pore- or Darcy-scales, appropriate methods for analysis and understanding of these
more complex flows have not been widely employed. In this primer we advocate for methods borrowed
from dynamical systems (chaos) theory, which aim to uncover the \emph{Lagrangian kinematics}
of these flows: namely how fluid particle trajectories (which form a dynamical system) are organized
and interact and the associated impacts on solute transport and mixing. This dynamical systems
approach to transport is inherently Lagrangian, and the Lagrangian kinematics form Lagrangian
coherent structures (LCSs), special sets of trajectories that divide the Lagrangian frame into
chaotic mixing regions, poorly mixing hold-up regions (and in some cases non-mixing ``islands'')
and the transport barriers that organise these regions. Hence the dynamical systems approach provides
insights into flows that may exhibit chaotic, regular (non-chaotic) or mixed Lagrangian kinematics,
and also into how LCSs organize solute transport and mixing. Novel experimental methods are only
recently permitting visualization of LCSs are in porous media flows. In this primer we review the
dynamical systems approach to porous media flow and transport and connect the associated tools
and techniques with the latest research findings from pore to Darcy scales. This primer provides
an introduction to the methods and tools of dynamical systems theory. Once familiar with these approaches,
porous media researchers will be better positioned to know when to expect complex Lagrangian kinematics,
how to uncover and understand LCSs and their impacts ...

The Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) is a new age detector, which can handle the high flux of particles.
The GEM foil, which is constructed using 50$\mu$m highly insulating foil (Kapton/Apical) coated
with 5$\mu$m layers of copper, on both sides, with a network of specifically shaped holes is the major
component of these detectors. The European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN) has been the sole
supplier of the GEM foils until recently when a few other companies started manufacturing GEM foils
under the transfer of technology (TOT) agrement from CERN. Techtra is one such company in Europe
which gained a right to use CERN developed technology in order to produce commercially viable GEM
foils. Micropack Pvt. Ltd. is another company in India which has successfully manufactured good
quality GEM foils. Due to the microscopic structure of holes and dependence on the electric field
inside, it becomes essential to study the defect and uniformity of holes along with the electrical
property of foils under ambient conditions. In this work we are reporting the tests condition of
Techtra GEM foils. We report on the development of a cost effective and efficient technique to study
the GEM foils holes geometry, distribution, and defects. We also report on the electrical properties
of these foils like leakage current, stability, and discharges. At the detector level, we describe
the high voltage (HV) response, gain, uniformity, and stability. The GEMs have been proposed to
have a wider applications, so we performed a feasibility study to utilize these for the imaging.
We irrediated various objects of varying density with X-rays and reconstructed the images. The
reconstructed image shows a good distinction between materials of different densities, which
can be very useful in various applications like medical imaging or cargo imaging.

Multicellular organisms exhibit a high degree of structural organization with specific cell types
always occurring in characteristic locations. The conventional framework for describing the
emergence of such consistent spatial patterns is provided by Wolpert's "French flag" paradigm.
According to this view, intra-cellular genetic regulatory mechanisms use positional information
provided by morphogen concentration gradients to differentially express distinct fates, resulting
in a characteristic pattern of differentiated cells. However, recent experiments have shown that
suppression of inter-cellular interactions can alter these spatial patterns, suggesting that
cell fates are not exclusively determined by the regulation of gene expression by local morphogen
concentration. Using an explicit model where adjacent cells communicate by Notch signaling, we
provide a mechanistic description of how contact-mediated interactions allow information from
the cellular environment to be incorporated into cell fate decisions. Viewing cellular differentiation
in terms of trajectories along an epigenetic landscape (as first enunciated by Waddington), our
results suggest that the contours of the landscape are moulded differently in a cell position-dependent
manner, not only by the global signal provided by the morphogen but also by the local environment
via cell-cell interactions. We show that our results are robust with respect to different choices
of coupling between the inter-cellular signaling apparatus and the intra-cellular gene regulatory
dynamics. Indeed, we show that the broad features can be observed even in abstract spin models. Our
work reconciles interaction-mediated self-organized pattern formation with boundary-organized
mechanisms involving signals that break symmetry.

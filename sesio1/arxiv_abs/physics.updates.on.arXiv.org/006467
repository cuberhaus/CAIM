The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a need for widespread and rapid vaccine development. As several
vaccines have recently been approved for human use or are in different stages of development, governments
across the world are preparing comprehensive guidelines for vaccine distribution and monitoring.
In this early article, we identify challenges in logistics, health outcomes, user-centric matters,
and communication associated with disease-related, individual, societal, economic, and privacy
consequences. Primary challenges include difficulty in equitable distribution, vaccine efficacy,
duration of immunity, multi-dose adherence, and privacy-focused record-keeping to be HIPAA compliant.
While many of these challenges have been previously identified and addressed, some have not been
acknowledged from a comprehensive view accounting for unprecedented interactions between challenges
and specific populations. The logistics of equitable widespread vaccine distribution in disparate
populations and countries of various economic, racial, and cultural constitutions must be thoroughly
examined and accounted for. We also describe unique challenges regarding the efficacy of vaccines
in specialized populations including children, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals.
Furthermore, we report the potential for understudied drug-vaccine interactions as well as the
possibility that certain vaccine platforms may increase susceptibility to HIV. Given these complicated
issues, the importance of privacy-focused, user-centric systems for vaccine education and incentivization
along with clear communication from governments, organizations, and academic institutions is
imperative. These challenges are by no means insurmountable, but require careful attention to
avoid consequences spanning a range of disease-related, individual, societal, economic, and
security domains.

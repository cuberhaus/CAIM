The model is based on a vector representation of each agent. The components of the vector are the key
continuous attributes that determine the social behavior of the agent. A simple mathematical force
vector model is used to predict the effect of each agent on all other agents. The force law used is motivated
by gravitational force laws and electrical force laws for dipoles. It assumes that the force between
two agents is proportional to the similarity of attributes, which is implemented mathematically
as the dot product of the vectors representing the attributes of the agents, and the force goes as
the inverse square of the difference in attributes, which is expressed as the Euclidean distance
in attribute space between the two vectors. The force between the agents may be positive (attractive),
zero, or negative (repulsive) depending on whether the angle between the corresponding vectors
is less than, equal to, or greater than 90 degrees. A positive force causes the attributes of the agents
to become more similar and the corresponding vectors to become more nearly parallel. Interaction
between all agents is allowed unless the distance between the attributes representing the agents
exceeds a confidence limit (the Attribute Influence Bound) set in the simulation. Agents with similar
attributes tend to form groups. For small values of the Attribute Influence Bound, numerous groups
remain scattered throughout attribute space at the end of a simulation. As the Attribute Influence
Bound is increased, and agents with increasingly different attributes can communicate, fewer
groups remain at the end, and the remaining groups have increasingly different characteristic
attributes and approximately equal sizes. With a large Attribute Influence Bound all agents are
connected and extreme bi- or tri-polarization results.

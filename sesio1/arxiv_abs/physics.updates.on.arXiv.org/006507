We present a new methodology -- the Keplerian Optical Dynamics Analysis (KODA) -- for analyzing
the dynamics of dense, cool material in the solar corona. The technique involves adaptive spatiotemporal
tracking of propagating intensity gradients and their characterization in terms of time-evolving
Keplerian areas swept out by the position vectors of moving plasma blobs. Whereas gravity induces
purely ballistic motions consistent with Kepler's second law, non-central forces such as the Lorentz
force introduce non-zero torques resulting in more complex motions. KODA algorithms enable direct
evaluation of the line-of-sight component of the net torque density from the image-plane projection
of the areal acceleration. The method is applied to the prominence eruption of 2011 June 7, observed
by the Solar Dynamics Observatory's Atmospheric Imaging Assembly. Results obtained include quantitative
estimates of the magnetic forces, field intensities, and blob masses and energies across a vast
region impacted by the post-reconnection redistribution of the prominence material. The magnetic
pressure and energy are strongly dominant during the early, rising phase of the eruption, while
the dynamic pressure and kinetic energy become significant contributors during the subsequent
falling phases. Measured intensive properties of the prominence blobs are consistent with those
of typical active-region prominences; measured extensive properties are compared with those
of the whole pre-eruption prominence and the post-eruption coronal mass ejection of 2011 June 7,
all derived by other investigators and techniques. We argue that KODA provides valuable information
on characteristics of erupting prominences that are not readily available via alternative means,
thereby shedding new light on their environment and evolution.

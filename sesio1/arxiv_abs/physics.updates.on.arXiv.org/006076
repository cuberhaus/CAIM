Controlling light penetration depth in Avalanche Photodiodes (APDs) and Single Photon Avalanche
Diodes (SPADs) play a major role in achieving high multiplication gain by delivering light near
the multiplication region where the electric field is the strongest. Such control in the penetration
depth for a particular wavelength of light has been previously demonstrated using integrated photon-trapping
nanostructures. In this paper, we show that an optimized periodic nanostructure design can control
the penetration depth for a wide range of visible and near-infrared wavelengths simultaneously.
A conventional silicon APD structure suffers from high photocarrier loss due to recombination
for shorter wavelengths as they are absorbed near the surface region, while silicon has low absorption
efficiency for longer wavelengths. This optimized nanostructure design allows shorter wavelengths
of light to penetrate deeper into the device, circumventing recombination sites while trapping
the longer wavelengths in the thin silicon device by bending the vertically propagating light into
horizontal modes. This manipulation of penetration depth improves the absorption in the device,
increasing light sensitivity while nanostructures reduce the reflectance from the top surface.
While delivery of light near the multiplication region reduces the photogenerated carrier loss
and shortens transit time, leading to high multiplication gain in APDs and SPADs over a wide spectral
range. These high gain APDs and SPADs will find their potential applications in Time-Of-Flight
Positron Emission Tomography (TOF-PET), Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM), and
pulse oximetry where high detection efficiency and high gain-bandwidth is required over a multitude
of wavelengths.

The principal difficulty in large magnetic systems having an extensive flux return yoke is to characterize
the magnetic flux distribution in the yoke steel blocks. Continuous measurements of the magnetic
flux density in the return yoke are not possible and the usual practice uses software modelling of
the magnetic system with special 3D computer programs. The flux return yoke of the Compact Muon Solenoid
(CMS) magnet encloses a 3.8 T superconducting solenoid with a 6-m-diameter by 12.5-m-length free
bore and consists of five dodecagonal three-layered barrel wheels around the coil and four endcap
disks at each end. The yoke steel blocks serve as the absorber plates of the muon detection system.
A TOSCA 3D model of the CMS magnet has been developed to describe the magnetic field outside of the
solenoid volume, which was measured with a field-mapping machine. To verify the magnetic flux distribution
calculated in the yoke steel blocks, direct measurements of the magnetic flux density with 22 flux
loops installed in selected regions of the yoke were performed during the CMS magnet test in 2006
when four "fast" discharges of the CMS coil were triggered manually to test the magnet protection
system. No fast discharge of the CMS magnet from its operational current of 18.2 kA, which corresponds
to a central magnetic flux density of 3.8 T, has been performed that time. For the first time, in this
paper we present measurements of the magnetic flux density in the steel blocks of the return yoke
based on the several standard linear discharges of the CMS magnet from the operational magnet current
of 18.2 kA. To provide these measurements, the voltages induced in the flux loops have been measured
with six 16-bit DAQ modules and integrated offline over time. The results of the measurements during
magnet linear ramps performed with a current rate as low as 1-1.5 A/s are presented and discussed.

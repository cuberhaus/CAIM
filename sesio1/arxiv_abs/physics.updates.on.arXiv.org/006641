The shape of the ion energy spectra plays a critical role toward determining the ion energetics,
the acceleration mechanisms and the possible sources of different plasma and suprathermal ion
populations. The determination of the exact shape of the total particle spectrum, provide the necessary
means to address the inner heliosheath (IHS) dynamics. Apart from various modeling efforts, a direct
fit to the measured ion spectra for an extended energy range of $\sim$0.11 to 344 MeV has not been performed
to date. We use an extended set of combined 0.11-55 keV ENA measurements from the Interstellar Boundary
Explorer (IBEX-Lo and IBEX-Hi) and Cassini/Ion and Neutral Camera (INCA), converted to protons,
together with $\sim$28 keV to 344 MeV ion measurements from the Low Energy Charged Particle (LECP)
and Cosmic Ray Subsystem (CRS) experiments on Voyager 2, over the declining phase of Solar Cyle 23
(SC23) and ascending phase Solar Cylce 24 (SC24) (2009-2016) to study the characteristics of the
particle energy spectrum. We fit the 0.11 keV to 344 MeV composite spectra with a set of regularized
isotropic $\kappa$-distribution functions (RKD) allowing the determination of the macroscopic
physical properties. We demonstrate that the 2009-2012 spectrum that corresponds to the declining
phase of SC23 is well fitted by three different RKDs, while the 2013-2016 spectrum, associated with
the rise of SC24, can only be approximated with six different RKDs. Our results are generally consistent
with shock accelerated particles that undergo additional acceleration inside the IHS. We identify
a low energy transmitted population of particles, a suprathermal reflected population and a very
high energy component that is modulated by GCRs. The 2013-2016 time period is most likely associated
with a mixture of particles from SC23 and SC24, which is reflected by the need to employ six RDKs.

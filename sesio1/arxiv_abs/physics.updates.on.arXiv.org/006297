The optimization of radiofrequency-wave (RF) systems for fusion experiments is often performed
using ray-tracing codes, which rely on the geometrical-optics (GO) approximation. However, GO
fails at caustics such as cutoffs and focal points, erroneously predicting the wave intensity to
be infinite. This is a critical shortcoming of GO, since the caustic wave intensity is often the quantity
of interest, e.g. RF heating. Full-wave modeling can be used instead, but the computational cost
limits the speed at which such optimizations can be performed. We have developed a less expensive
alternative called metaplectic geometrical optics (MGO). Instead of evolving waves in the usual
$\textbf{x}$ (coordinate) or $\text{k}$ (spectral) representation, MGO uses a mixed $\textbf{X}
\equiv \textsf{A}\textbf{x} + \textsf{B}\textbf{k}$ representation. By continuously adjusting
the matrix coefficients $\textsf{A}$ and $\textsf{B}$ along the rays, one can ensure that GO remains
valid in the $\textbf{X}$ coordinates without caustic singularities. The caustic-free result
is then mapped back onto the original $\textbf{x}$ space using metaplectic transforms. Here, we
overview the MGO theory and review algorithms that will aid the development of an MGO-based ray-tracing
code. We show how using orthosymplectic transformations leads to considerable simplifications
compared to previously published MGO formulas. We also prove explicitly that MGO exactly reproduces
standard GO when evaluated far from caustics (an important property which until now has only been
inferred from numerical simulations), and we relate MGO to other semiclassical caustic-removal
schemes published in the literature. This discussion is then augmented by an explicit comparison
of the computed spectrum for a wave bounded between two cutoffs.

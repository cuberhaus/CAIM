We developed an analytical theoretical method to determine the microscopical structure of weakly
to moderately sheared colloidal suspensions in dilute conditions. The microstructure is described
by the static structure factor, obtained by solving the stationary two-body Smoluchowski advection-diffusion
equation. The singularly perturbed PDE problem is solved by performing an angular averaging over
the extensional and compressing sectors and by the rigorous application of boundary-layer theory
(intermediate asymptotics). This allows us to expand the solution to a higher order in P\'eclet
with respect to previous methods. The scheme is independent of the type of interaction potential.
We apply it to the example of charge-stabilized colloidal particles interacting via the repulsive
Yukawa potential and study the distortion of the structure factor. It is predicted that the distortion
is larger at small wavevectors $k$ and its dependence on $Pe$ is a simple power law. At increasing
$Pe$, the main peak of the structure factor displays a broadening and shift towards lower $k$ in the
extensional sectors, which indicates shear-induced spreading out of particle correlations and
neighbor particles locally being dragged away from the reference one. In the compressing sectors,
instead, a narrowing and shift towards high $k$ is predicted, reflecting shear-induced ordering
near contact and concomitant depletion in the medium-range. An overall narrowing of the peak is
also predicted for the structure factor averaged over the whole solid angle. Calculations are also
performed for hard spheres, showing good overall agreement with experimental data. It is also shown
that the shear-induced structure factor distortion is orders of magnitude larger for the Yukawa
repulsion than for the hard spheres.

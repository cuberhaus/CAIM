The large quantities of antineutrinos produced through the decay of fission fragments in nuclear
reactors provide an opportunity to study the properties of these particles and investigate their
use in reactor monitoring. The reactor antineutrino spectra are measured using specialized, large
area detectors that detect antineutrinos through inverse beta decay, electron elastic scattering,
or coherent elastic neutrino nucleus scattering; although, inverse beta decay is the only demonstrated
method so far. Reactor monitoring takes advantage of the differences in the antineutrino yield
and spectra resulting from uranium and plutonium fission providing an opportunity to estimate
the fissile material composition in the reactor. Recent experiments reveal a deviation between
the measured and calculated antineutrino flux and spectra indicating either the existence of yet
undiscovered neutrino physics, uncertainties in the reactor source term calculation, incorrect
nuclear data, or a combination of all three. To address the nuclear data that impact the antineutrino
spectrum calculations and measurements, an international group of over 180 experts in antineutrino
physics, reactor analysis, detector development, and nuclear data came together during the Workshop
on Nuclear Data for Reactor Antineutrino Measurements (WoNDRAM) to discuss nuclear data needs
and achieve concordance on a set of recommended priorities for nuclear data improvements. Three
topical sessions provided a forum to gain consensus amongst the participants on the most important
data improvements to address two goals: 1) understand the reactor anomaly and 2) improve the ability
to monitor reactors using antineutrinos. This report summarizes the outcomes of the workshop discussions
and the recommendations for nuclear data efforts that reduce reactor antineutrino measurement
uncertainties.

Sheaths ahead of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) are turbulent heliospheric structures.
Knowledge of their structure and fluctuations is important for understanding their geoeffectiveness,
their role in accelerating particles, and the interaction of ICMEs with the solar wind. We studied
observations from the Parker Solar Probe of a sheath observed at 0.5 au in March 2019, ahead of a slow
streamer blowout CME. To examine the MHD-scale turbulent properties, we calculated fluctuation
amplitudes, magnetic compressibility, partial variance of increments (PVI), cross helicity
($\sigma_c$), residual energy ($\sigma_r$), and the Jensen-Shannon permutation entropy and
complexity. The sheath consisted of slow and fast flows separated by a 15-min change in magnetic
sector that coincided with current sheet crossings and a velocity shear zone. Fluctuation amplitudes
and PVI were greater through the sheath than upstream. Fluctuations had mostly negative $\sigma_r$
and positive $\sigma_c$ in the sheath, the latter indicating an anti-sunward sense of propagation.
The velocity shear region marked an increase in temperature and specific entropy, and the faster
flow behind had local patches of positive $\sigma_r$ as well as higher fluctuation amplitudes and
PVI. Fluctuations in the preceding wind and sheath were stochastic, with the sheath fluctuations
showing lower entropy and higher complexity than upstream. The two-part sheath structure likely
resulted from a warp in the heliospheric current sheet (HCS) being swept up and compressed. The ejecta
accelerated and heated the wind at the sheath rear, which then interacted with the slower wind ahead
of the HCS warp. This caused differences in fluctuation properties across the sheath. Sheaths of
slow ICMEs can thus have complex structure where fluctuation properties are not just downstream
shock properties, but are generated within the sheath.

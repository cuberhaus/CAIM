This paper investigates the steady axisymmetric structure of the cold boundary-layer flow surrounding
fire whirls developing over localized fuel sources lying on a horizontal surface. The inviscid
swirling motion found outside the boundary layer, driven by the entrainment of the buoyant turbulent
plume of hot combustion products that develops above the fire, is described by an irrotational solution,
obtained by combining Taylor's self-similar solution for the motion in the axial plane with the
azimuthal motion induced by a line vortex of circulation $2 \pi \Gamma$. The development of the boundary
layer from a prescribed radial location is determined by numerical integration for different swirl
levels, measured by the value of the radial-to-azimuthal velocity ratio $\sigma$ at the initial
radial location. As in the case $\sigma=0$, treated in the seminal boundary-layer analysis of Burggraf
et al. (Phys. Fluids, 1971), the pressure gradient associated with the centripetal acceleration
of the inviscid flow is seen to generate a pronounced radial inflow. Specific attention is given
to the terminal shape of the boundary-layer velocity near the axis, which displays a three-layered
structure that is described by matched asymptotic expansions. The resulting composite expansion,
dependent on the level of ambient swirl through the parameter $\sigma$, is employed as boundary
condition to describe the deflection of the boundary-layer flow near the axis to form a vertical
swirl jet. Numerical solutions of the resulting non-slender collision region for different values
of $\sigma$ are presented both for inviscid flow and for viscous flow with moderately large values
of the controlling Reynolds number $\Gamma/\nu$. The velocity description provided is useful
in mathematical formulations of localized fire-whirl flows, providing consistent boundary conditions
accounting for the ambient swirl level.

A decade ago, two-dimensional microscopic flow visualization proved the theoretically predicted
existence of electroconvection roles as well as their decisive role in destabilizing the concentration
polarization layer at ion-selective fluid/membrane interfaces. Electroconvection induces
chaotic flow vortices injecting volume having bulk concentration into the ion-depleted diffusion
layer at the interface. Experimental quantification of these important flow patterns have so far
only been carried out in 2D. Numerical direct simulations suggest 3D features, yet experimental
proof is lacking. 3D simulations are also limited in covering extended spacial and temporal scales.
This study presents a new comprehensive experimental method for the time-resolved recording of
the 3D electroconvective velocity field near a cation-exchange membrane. For the first time, the
spatio-temporal velocity field can be visualized in 3D at multiples of the overlimiting current
density. In contrast to today's simulations, these experiments cover length and time scales typical
for actual electrodialytic membrane processes. We visualize coherent vortex structures and reveal
the changes in the velocity field and its statistics during the transition from vortex rolls to vortex
rings with increasing current density. The transition is characterized by changes in the rotational
direction, mean square velocity, and temporal energy spectrum with only little influence on the
spatial spectrum. These findings indicate a more significant impact of EC's structural change
on the mean square velocities and temporal spectra than on the spatial spectra. This knowledge is
a prerequisite for engineering ion-selective surfaces that will enable the operation of electrically
driven processes beyond the diffusion-limited Nernst regime.

When two streams of pedestrians cross at an angle, striped patterns spontaneously emerge as a result
of local pedestrian interactions. This clear case of self-organized pattern formation remains
to be elucidated. In counterflows, with a crossing angle of 180{\deg}, alternating lanes of traffic
are commonly observed moving in opposite directions, whereas in crossing flows at an angle of 90{\deg}
diagonal stripes have been reported. Naka (1977) hypothesized that stripe orientation is perpendicular
to the bisector of the crossing angle. However, studies of crossing flows at acute and obtuse angles
remain underdeveloped. We tested the bisector hypothesis in experiments on small groups (18-19
participants each) crossing at seven angles (30{\deg} intervals), and analyzed the geometric
properties of stripes. We present two novel computational methods for analyzing striped patterns
in pedestrian data: (i) an edge-cutting algorithm, which detects the dynamic formation of stripes
and allows us to measure local properties of individual stripes; and (ii) a pattern-matching technique,
based on the Gabor function, which allows us to estimate global properties (orientation and wavelength)
of the striped pattern at a time T. We find an invariant property: stripes in the two groups are parallel
and perpendicular to the bisector at all crossing angles. In contrast, other properties depend
on the crossing angle: stripe spacing (wavelength), stripe size (number of pedestrians per stripe),
and crossing time all decrease as the crossing angle increases from 30{\deg} to 180{\deg}, whereas
the number of stripes increases with crossing angle. We also observe that the width of individual
stripes is dynamically squeezed as the two groups cross each other. The findings thus support the
bisector hypothesis at a wide range of crossing angles, although the theoretical reasons for this
invariant remain unclear.

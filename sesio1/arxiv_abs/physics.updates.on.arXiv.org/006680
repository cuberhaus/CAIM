Early detection and isolation of COVID-19 patients are essential for successful implementation
of mitigation strategies and eventually curbing the disease spread. With a limited number of daily
COVID-19 tests performed in every country, simulating the COVID-19 spread along with the potential
effect of each mitigation strategy currently remains one of the most effective ways in managing
the healthcare system and guiding policy-makers. We introduce COVIDHunter, a flexible and accurate
COVID-19 outbreak simulation model that evaluates the current mitigation measures that are applied
to a region, predicts COVID-19 statistics (the daily number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths),
and provides suggestions on what strength the upcoming mitigation measure should be. The key idea
of COVIDHunter is to quantify the spread of COVID-19 in a geographical region by simulating the average
number of new infections caused by an infected person considering the effect of external factors,
such as environmental conditions (e.g., climate, temperature, humidity), different variants
of concern, vaccination rate, and mitigation measures. Using Switzerland as a case study, COVIDHunter
estimates that we are experiencing a deadly new wave that will peak on 26 January 2022, which is very
similar in numbers to the wave we had in February 2020. The policy-makers have only one choice that
is to increase the strength of the currently applied mitigation measures for 30 days. Unlike existing
models, the COVIDHunter model accurately monitors and predicts the daily number of cases, hospitalizations,
and deaths due to COVID-19. Our model is flexible to configure and simple to modify for modeling different
scenarios under different environmental conditions and mitigation measures. We release the source
code of the COVIDHunter implementation at https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/COVIDHunter.

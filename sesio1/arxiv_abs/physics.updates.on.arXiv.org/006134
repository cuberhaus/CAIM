We tested whether refracted gravity, a theory of modified gravity that describes the dynamics of
galaxies without the aid of dark matter, can model the dynamics of the three massive elliptical galaxies,
NGC 1407, NGC 4486, and NGC 5846, out to $\sim$$10R_{\rm e}$, where the baryonic mass component fades
out and dark matter is required in Newtonian gravity. We probed these outer regions with the kinematics
of the globular clusters provided by the SLUGGS survey. Refracted gravity mimics dark matter with
the gravitational permittivity, a monotonic function of the local mass density depending on three
parameters, $\epsilon_0$, $\rho_{\rm c}$, and $Q$, which are expected to be universal. Refracted
gravity satisfactorily reproduces the velocity dispersion profiles of the stars and red and blue
globular clusters, with stellar mass-to-light ratios in agreement with stellar population synthesis
models, and orbital anisotropy parameters consistent with previous results obtained in Newtonian
gravity with dark matter. The sets of the three parameters of the gravitational permittivity found
for each galaxy are consistent with each other within $\sim$2$\sigma$. We compare the mean $\{\epsilon_0,Q,\log_{10}\left[\rho_{\rm
c}\left(\mathrm{g}\, \mathrm{cm}^{-3}\right)\right]\} = \{0.089^{+0.038}_{-0.035}, 0.47^{+0.29}_{-0.21},
-24.25^{+0.28}_{-0.20}\}$ found here with the means of the parameters required to model the rotation
curves and vertical velocity dispersion profiles of 30 disk galaxies from the DiskMass Survey (DMS):
$\rho_{\rm c}$ and $Q$ agree within 1$\sigma$ with the DMS values, whereas $\epsilon_0$ agrees
within 3$\sigma$. This agreement suggests that ellipticals and disk galaxies allow for common
values of the parameters of the permittivity and supports the universality of the permittivity
function.

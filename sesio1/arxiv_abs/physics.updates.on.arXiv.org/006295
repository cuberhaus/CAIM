Various superconducting detector solenoids for particle physics have been developed in the world.
The key technology is the aluminum-stabilized superconducting conductor for almost all the detector
magnets in particle physics experiments. With the progress of the conductor, the coil fabrication
technology has progressed as well, such as the inner coil winding technique, indirect cooling,
transparent vacuum vessel, quench protection scheme using pure aluminum strips and so on. The detector
solenoids design study is in progress for future big projects in Japan and Europe, that is, ILC, FCC
and CLIC, based on the technologies established over many years. The combination of good mechanical
properties and keeping a high RRR is a key point for the development of Al-stabilized conductor.
The present concern for the detector solenoid development is to have been gradually losing the key
technologies and experiences, because large-scale detector magnets with Al-stabilized conductor
has not been fabricated after the success of CMS and ATLAS-CS in LHC. Complementary efforts are needed
to resume an equivalent level of expertise, to extend the effort on research and to develop these
technologies and apply them to future detector magnet projects. Especially, further effort is
necessary for the industrial technology of Al-stabilized superconductor production. The worldwide
collaboration with relevant institutes and industries will be critically important to re-realize
and validate the required performances. Some detector solenoids for mid-scale experiment wound
with conventional copper-stabilized Nb-Ti conductor require precise control of magnetic field
distribution. The development efforts are on-going in terms of the magnetic field design technology
with high precision simulation, coil fabrication technology and control method of magnetic field
distribution.

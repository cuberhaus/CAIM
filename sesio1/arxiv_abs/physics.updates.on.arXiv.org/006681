Since the derivation of the Navier Stokes equations, it has become possible to numerically solve
real world viscous flow problems (computational fluid dynamics (CFD)). However, despite the rapid
advancements in the performance of central processing units (CPUs), the computational cost of
simulating transient flows with extremely small time/grid scale physics is still unrealistic.
In recent years, machine learning (ML) technology has received significant attention across industries,
and this big wave has propagated various interests in the fluid dynamics community. Recent ML CFD
studies have revealed that completely suppressing the increase in error with the increase in interval
between the training and prediction times in data driven methods is unrealistic. The development
of a practical CFD acceleration methodology that applies ML is a remaining issue. Therefore, the
objectives of this study were developing a realistic ML strategy based on a physics-informed transfer
learning and validating the accuracy and acceleration performance of this strategy using an unsteady
CFD dataset. This strategy can determine the timing of transfer learning while monitoring the residuals
of the governing equations in a cross coupling computation framework. Consequently, our hypothesis
that continuous fluid flow time series prediction is feasible was validated, as the intermediate
CFD simulations periodically not only reduce the increased residuals but also update the network
parameters. Notably, the cross coupling strategy with a grid based network model does not compromise
the simulation accuracy for computational acceleration. The simulation was accelerated by 1.8
times in the laminar counterflow CFD dataset condition including the parameter updating time.
Open source CFD software OpenFOAM and open-source ML software TensorFlow were used in this feasibility
study.

The REST-for-Physics (Rare Event Searches Toolkit for Physics) framework is a ROOT-based solution
providing the means to process and analyze experimental or Monte Carlo event data. Special care
has been taken on the traceability of the code and the validation of the results produced within the
framework, together with the connectivity between code and data stored registered through specific
version metadata members. The framework development was originally motivated to cover the needs
at Rare Event Searches experiments (experiments looking for phenomena having extremely low occurrence
probability like dark matter or neutrino interactions or rare nuclear decays), and its components
naturally implement tools to address the challenges in these kinds of experiments; the integration
of a detector physics response, the implementation of signal processing routines, or topological
algorithms for physical event identification are some examples. Despite this specialization,
the framework was conceived thinking in scalability, and other event-oriented applications could
benefit from the data processing routines and/or metadata description implemented in REST, being
the generic framework tools completely decoupled from dedicated libraries. REST-for-Physics
is a consolidated piece of software already serving the needs of different physics experiments
- using gaseous Time Projection Chambers (TPCs) as detection technology - for background data analysis
and detector characterization, as well as generic detector R\&D. Even though REST has been exploited
mainly with gaseous TPCs, the code could be easily applied or adapted to other detection technologies.
We present in this work an overview of REST-for-Physics, providing a broad perspective to the infrastructure
and organization of the project as a whole. The framework and its different components will be described
in the text.

We describe how a coherent optical drive that is near-resonant with the upper rungs of a three-level
ladder system, in conjunction with a short pulse excitation, can be used to provide a frequency-tunable
source of on-demand single photons. Using an intuitive master equation model, we identify two distinct
regimes of device operation: (i) for a resonant drive, the source operates using the Autler-Townes
effect, and (ii) for an off-resonant drive, the source exploits the ac Stark effect. The former regime
allows for a large frequency tuning range but coherence suffers from timing jitter effects, while
the latter allows for high indistinguishability and efficiency, but with a restricted tuning bandwidth
due to high required drive strengths and detunings. We show how both these negative effects can be
mitigated by using an optical cavity to increase the collection rate of the desired photons. We apply
our general theory to semiconductor quantum dots, which have proven to be excellent single-photon
sources, and find that scattering of acoustic phonons leads to excitation-induced dephasing and
increased population of the higher energy level which limits the bandwidth of frequency tuning
achievable while retaining high indistinguishability. Despite this, for realistic cavity and
quantum dot parameters, indistinguishabilities of over $90\%$ are achievable for energy shifts
of up to hundreds of $\mu$eV, and near-unity indistinguishabilities for energy shifts up to tens
of $\mu$eV. Additionally, we clarify the often-overlooked differences between an idealized Hong-Ou-Mandel
two-photon interference experiment and its usual implementation with an unbalanced Mach-Zehnder
interferometer, pointing out the subtle differences in the single-photon visibility associated
with these different setups.

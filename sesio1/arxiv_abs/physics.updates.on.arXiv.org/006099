We present a practical and effective method of planetary defense that allows for extremely short
mitigation time scales. The method involves an array of small hypervelocity non-nuclear kinetic
penetrators that pulverize and disassemble an asteroid or small comet. This mitigates the threat
using the Earth's atmosphere to dissipate the energy in the fragment cloud. The system allows a planetary
defense solution using existing technologies. This approach will work in extended time scale modes
where there is a large warning time, as well as in short interdiction time scenarios with intercepts
of minutes to days before impact. In longer time intercept scenarios, the disassembled asteroid
fragments largely miss the Earth. In short intercept scenarios, the asteroid fragments of maximum
$\sim$10-meter diameter allow the Earth's atmosphere to act as a "beam dump" where the fragments
either burn up in the atmosphere and/or air burst, with the primary channel of energy going into spatially
and temporally de-correlated shock waves. It is the de-correlated blast waves that are the key to
why PI works so well. The effectiveness of the approach depends on the intercept time and size of the
asteroid, but allows for effective defense against asteroids in the 20-1000m diameter class and
could virtually eliminate the threat of mass destruction posed by these threats with very short
warning times even in a terminal defense mode. A 20m diameter asteroid ($\sim$0.5Mt, similar to
Chelyabinsk) can be mitigated with a 100s prior to impact intercept with a 10m/s disruption. With
a 1m/s internal disruption, a 5 hours prior to impact intercept of a 50m diameter asteroid ($\sim$10Mt
yield, similar to Tunguska), a 1 day prior to impact intercept of 100m diameter asteroid ($\sim$100Mt
yield), or a 10 day prior to impact intercept of Apophis ($\sim$370m diameter, $\sim$4Gt yield)
would mitigate these threats.

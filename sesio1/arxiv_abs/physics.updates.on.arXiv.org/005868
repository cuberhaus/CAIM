Experimental observations of thermionic electron emission demonstrate a smooth transition between
TL and FSCL regions of the emitted-current-density-versus-temperature (J-T) (Miram) curve and
the emitted-current-density-versus-voltage (J-V) curve. Knowledge of the temperature and shape
of the TL-FSCL transition is important in evaluating the thermionic electron emission performance
of cathodes, including predicting the lifetime. However, there have been no first-principles
physics-based models that can predict the smooth TL-FSCL transition region for real thermionic
cathodes without applying physically difficult to justify a priori assumptions or empirical phenomenological
equations. Previous work detailing the nonuniform thermionic emission found that the effects
of 3-D space charge, patch fields, and Schottky barrier lowering can lead to a smooth TL-FSCL transition
region from a model thermionic cathode surface with a checkerboard spatial distribution of work
function values. In this work, we construct a physics-based nonuniform emission model for commercial
dispenser cathodes for the first time. This emission model is obtained by incorporating the cathode
surface grain orientation via electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and the facet-orientation-specific
work function values from density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The model enables construction
of two-dimensional emitted current density maps of the cathode surface and corresponding J-T and
J-V curves. The predicted emission curves show excellent agreement with experiment, not only in
TL and FSCL regions but, crucially, also in the TL-FSCL transition region. This model improves the
understanding on the relationship between thermionic emission and cathode microstructure, which
is beneficial to the design of vacuum electronic devices.

Population-wide screening to identify and isolate infectious individuals is a powerful tool for
controlling COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. Testing an entire population, however, requires
significant resources. Group testing can enable large-scale screening by testing more people
with fewer resources, but dilution degrades its sensitivity, reducing its effectiveness as an
infection control measure. Analysis of this tradeoff typically assumes that pooled samples are
independent. Building on recent empirical results in the literature, we argue that this assumption
significantly underestimates the true benefits of group testing. Indeed, placing samples from
a social group or household into the same pool correlates a pool's samples. As a result, a positive
pool likely contains multiple positive samples, increasing a pooled test's sensitivity and also
tending to reduce the number of pools that require follow-up tests. We prove that under a general
correlation structure, pooling correlated samples together ("correlated pooling") achieves
higher sensitivity and requires fewer tests per positive identified compared to independently
pooling the samples ("naive pooling") using the same pool size within the two-stage Dorfman procedure,
the most widely-used group testing method. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to theoretically
characterize correlation's effect on sensitivity, and the first to study its effect on test usage
under a realistic test error model. Under a representative starting prevalence of 1%, simulation
results estimate that correlated pooling requires 12.9% fewer tests than naive pooling to control
an epidemic. Thus, we argue that correlation is an important consideration for policy-makers designing
infection control interventions: it makes screening more attractive for infection control and
it suggests that sample collection should maximize correlation.

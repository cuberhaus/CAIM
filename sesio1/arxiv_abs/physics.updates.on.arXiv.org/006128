Over the course of their lifetimes, the rotation of solar-type stars goes through different phases.
Once they reach the zero-age main sequence, their global rotation rate decreases during the main
sequence until at least the solar age, approximately following the empirical Skumanich's law and
enabling gyrochronology. Older solar-type stars might then reach a point of transition when they
stop braking, according to recent results of asteroseismology. Additionally, recent 3D numerical
simulations of solar-type stars show that different regimes of differential rotation can be characterized
with the Rossby number. In particular, anti-solar differential rotation (fast poles, slow equator)
may exist for high Rossby number (slow rotators). If this regime occurs during the main sequence
and, in general, for slow rotators, we may consider how magnetic generation through the dynamo process
might be impacted. In particular, we consider whether slowly rotating stars are indeed subject
to magnetic cycles. We find that kinematic $\alpha$ $\Omega$ dynamos allow for the presence of magnetic
cycles and global polarity reversals for both rotation regimes, but only if the $\alpha$-effect
is saddled on the tachocline. If it is distributed in the convection zone, solar-type cases still
possess a cycle and anti-solar cases do not. Conversely, we have not found any possibility for sustaining
a magnetic cycle with the traditional Babcock-Leighton flux-transport dynamos in the anti-solar
differential rotation regime due to flux addition. Graphic interpretations are proposed in order
to illustrate these cases. However, we find that hybrid models containing both prescriptions can
still sustain local polarity reversals at some latitudes. We conclude that stars in the anti-solar
differential rotation regime can sustain magnetic cycles only for very specific dynamo processes.

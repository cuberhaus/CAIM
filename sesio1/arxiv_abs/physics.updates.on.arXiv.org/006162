The accurate quantification of blood flow in aortoiliac arteries is challenging but clinically
relevant because local flow patterns can influence atherosclerotic disease. To investigate the
feasibility and clinical application of two-dimensional blood flow quantification using high-frame-rate
contrast-enhanced US (HFR-CEUS) and particle image velocimetry (PIV), or US velocimetry, in participants
with aortoiliac stenosis. In this prospective study, participants with a recently diagnosed aortoiliac
stenosis underwent HFR-CEUS measurements of the pre- and poststenotic vessel segments. Two-dimensional
quantification of blood flow was achieved by performing PIV analysis, which was based on pairwise
cross-correlation of the HFR-CEUS images. Visual inspection of the entire data set was performed
by five observers to evaluate the ability of the technique to enable adequate visualization of blood
flow. The contrast-to-background ratio and average vector correlation were calculated. In two
participants who showed flow disturbances, the flow complexity and vorticity were calculated.
Results: 35 participants were included. Visual scoring showed that flow quantification was achieved
in 41 of 42 locations. In 25 locations, one or multiple issues occurred that limited optimal flow
quantification, including loss of correlation during systole, shadow regions, a short vessel
segment in the image plane, and loss of contrast during diastole. In the remaining 16 locations,
optimal quantification was achieved. The contrast-to-background ratio was higher during systole
than during diastole, whereas the vector correlation was lower. Flow complexity and vorticity
were high in regions with disturbed flow. Blood flow quantification with US velocimetry is feasible
in patients with an aortoiliac stenosis, but several challenges must be overcome before implementation
into clinical practice.

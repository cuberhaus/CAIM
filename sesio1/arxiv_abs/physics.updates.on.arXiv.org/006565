We propose the first machine-learned control-oriented flow estimation for multiple-input multiple-output
plants. Starting point are experiments or simulations with representative steady actuation commands
leading to a database with simultaneously recorded actuation commands, sensor signals and flow
fields. A key enabler is an estimator input vector comprising sensor signals and actuation commands.
The mapping from the sensor signals and actuation commands to the flow fields is realized in an analytically
simple, data-centric and general nonlinear approach. The analytically simple estimator generalizes
Linear Stochastic Estimation (LSE) for actuation commands. The data-centric approach yields
flow fields by interpolating from the database. The interpolation is performed with k Nearest Neighbors
(kNN). The general global nonlinear mapping from inputs to flow fields is obtained from a Deep Neural
Network (DNN) via an iterative training approach. The estimator comparison is performed for the
fluidic pinball plant, which is a multipleinput, multiple-output wake control benchmark (Deng
et al. 2020) featuring rich dynamics. The steady rotations of three cylinders represent actuation
commands while the flow state is monitored by downstream sensors. We conclude that the machine learning
methods clearly outperform the linear model. The performance of kNN and DNN estimators are comparable
for periodic dynamics. Yet, DNN performs consistently better when the flow is chaotic. Moreover,
a thorough comparison regarding to the complexity, computational cost, and prediction accuracy
is presented to demonstrate the relative merits of each estimator. The proposed machine-learning
estimation methods can be applied to a wide range of flow control configurations with promising
accuracy.

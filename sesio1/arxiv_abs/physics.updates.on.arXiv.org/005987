We use spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) to extract and analyze coherent structures
in the turbulent wake of a disk at Reynolds number $Re = 5 \times 10^{4}$ and Froude numbers $Fr$ = $2,
10$. We find that the SPOD eigenspectra of both wakes exhibit a low-rank behavior and the relative
contribution of low-rank modes to total fluctuation energy increases with $x/D$. The vortex shedding
(VS) mechanism, which corresponds to $St \approx 0.11-0.13$ in both wakes, is active and dominant
throughout the domain in both wakes. The continual downstream decay of the SPOD eigenspectrum peak
at the VS mode, which is a prominent feature of the unstratified wake, is inhibited by buoyancy, particularly
for $Fr = 2$. The energy at and near the VS frequency is found to appear in the outer region of the wake
when the downstream distance exceeds $Nt = Nx/U = 6 - 8$. Visualizations show that unsteady internal
gravity waves (IGWs) emerge at the same $Nt = 6 - 8$. A causal link between the VS mechanism and the unsteady
IGW generation is also established using the SPOD-based reconstruction and analysis of the pressure-transport
term. These IGWs are also picked up in SPOD analysis as a structural change in the shape of the leading
SPOD eigenmode. The $Fr = 2$ wake shows layering in the wake core at {$Nt > 15$} which is captured by
the leading SPOD eigenmodes of the VS frequency at downstream locations $x/D > 30$. The VS mode of
the $Fr = 2$ wake is streamwise-coherent, consisting of V-shaped structures at $x/D \gtrsim 30$.
Overall, we find that the coherence of wakes, initiated by the VS mode at the body, is prolonged by
buoyancy to far downstream. Also, this coherence is spatially modified by buoyancy into horizontal
layers and IGWs. Low-order truncations of SPOD modes are shown to efficiently reconstruct important
second-order statistics.

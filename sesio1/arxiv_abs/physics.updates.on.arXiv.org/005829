Sensor fusion is a technique used to combine sensors with different noise characteristics into
a super sensor that has superior noise performance. To achieve sensor fusion, complementary filters
are used in current gravitational-wave detectors to combine relative displacement sensors and
inertial sensors for active seismic isolation. Complementary filters are a set of digital filters,
which have transfer functions that are summed to unity. Currently, complementary filters are shaped
and tuned manually rather than optimized, which can be suboptimal and hard to reproduce for future
detectors. In this paper, an optimization-based method called $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ synthesis
is proposed for synthesizing optimal complementary filters according to the sensor noises themselves.
The complementary filter design problem is converted into an optimization problem that seeks minimization
of an objective function equivalent to the maximum difference between the super sensor noise and
the lower bound in logarithmic scale. The method is exemplified by synthesizing complementary
filters for sensor fusion of 1) a relative displacement sensor and an inertial sensor, 2) a relative
displacement sensor coupled with seismic noise and an inertial sensor, and 3) hypothetical displacement
sensor and inertial sensor, which have slightly different noise characteristics compared to the
typical ones. In all cases, the method produces complementary filters that suppress the super sensor
noise equally close to the lower bound at all frequencies in logarithmic scale. The synthesized
filters contain features that better suppress the sensor noises compared to the pre-designed complementary
filters. Overall, the proposed method allows the synthesis of optimal complementary filters according
to the sensor noises themselves and is a better and versatile method for solving sensor fusion problems.

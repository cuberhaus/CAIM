Combined studies on fluorescence quantum yield in coenzymes NADH and FAD in water-methanol, water-ethanol
and water-propylene glycol mixtures and on time-resolved fluorescence of the same molecules under
excitation at 450 and 355~nm by means of the TCSPC method have been carried out. The dependence of
quantum yield in NADH on alcohol concentration was found to be similar in methanol and ethanol and
different from that in propylene glycol. The behavior of quantum yield in FAD was found to be almost
independent of the type of alcohol and exhibited a dramatic 5--6 times increase with alcohol concentration.
A model describing molecular excited state relaxation dynamics in pico- and nanosecond time domain
was developed on the basis on the quantum mechanical theory and used for analysis of the experimental
results. In particular, the model provided a new insight into the nature of the Decay Associated
Spectra (DAS) phenomenon. The analysis of the role of pico- and nanosecond quenching in NADH suggested
that the picosecond decay in methanol and ethanol likely does not occur through electron transfer
in the stacking configuration of the nicotinamide and adenine moieties, but through other mechanisms.
However in propylene glycol the picosecond quenching in NADH depended strongly on propylene glycol
concentration and sharp increase of the measured quantum yield was associated with the contribution
of both picosecond and nanosecond quenching mechanisms. The picosecond quenching to FAD was found
to depend significantly on the any alcohol concentration suggesting that it gives a profound contribution
to the rise of the measured quantum yield with alcohol concentration. This conclusion supports
the established mechanism of the fluorescence quenching in FAD through electron transfer reaction
in the $\pi$-stacked conformation between isoalloxazine and adenine moieties.

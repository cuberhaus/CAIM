Anthropologists have observed gift relationships that establish social relations as well as the
transference of goods in many human societies. The totality of social relations constitute the
network. Social scientists have analyzed different types of social organizations with characteristic
network, including bands of small kin groups, tribes composed of many families with moderate inequalities,
and hierarchically organized chiefdoms. However, the factors and mechanisms causing the transition
between these types are hardly explained. Here, we focus on the gift as the driving force in changing
interpersonal relationships and shaping social organizations. We build a simple constructive
model of societies. In this model, people give their assets to each other, produce them, and reciprocate
for the gift. The gift and reciprocation strengthen their relationships. Through the simulation,
we demonstrate that as the frequency of the gift increases, the structure of social networks and
the extent of economic and social disparities exhibit a significant transition. The network structures
are less clustered and more hierarchically organized. The economic and social disparities successively
emerge, characterized by the power-law tails in the distributions of wealth and network connectivity.
Such a transition corresponds to the change from bands to tribes and to chiefdoms. Following this,
statistical analysis using the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample, a global ethnographic database,
empirically verifies the theoretical results on the emergence of disparities and hierarchical
organizations due to the increase in the gift. The constructive model, supported by empirical data,
can provide the basic mechanistic explanation for social evolution and integrate social science
theories.

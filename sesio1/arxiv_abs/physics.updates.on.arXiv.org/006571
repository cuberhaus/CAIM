Thermal conductivity is one of the important mechanisms of heat transfer in the solar corona. In
the limit of strongly magnetized plasma, it is typically modeled by Spitzer's expression where
the heat flux is aligned with the magnetic field. This paper describes the implementation of the
heat conduction into the code MANCHA3D with an aim of extending single-fluid MHD simulations from
the upper convection zone into the solar corona. Two different schemes to model heat conduction
are implemented: (1) a standard scheme where a parabolic term is added to the energy equation, and
(2) a scheme where the hyperbolic heat flux equation is solved. The first scheme limits the time step
due to the explicit integration of a parabolic term, which makes the simulations computationally
expensive. The second scheme solves the limitations on the time step by artificially limiting the
heat conduction speed to computationally manageable values. The validation of both schemes is
carried out with standard tests in one, two, and three spatial dimensions. Furthermore, we implement
the model for heat flux derived by Braginskii (1965) in its most general form, when the expression
for the heat flux depends on the ratio of the collisional to cyclotron frequencies of the plasma,
and, therefore on the magnetic field strength. Additionally, our implementation takes into account
the heat conduction in parallel, perpendicular, and transverse directions, and provides the contributions
from ions and electrons separately. The model also transitions smoothly between field-aligned
conductivity and isotropic conductivity for regions with a low or null magnetic field. Finally,
we present a two-dimensional test for heat conduction using realistic values of the solar atmosphere
where we prove the robustness of the two schemes implemented.

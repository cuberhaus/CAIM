The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is a long-baseline neutrino experiment designed
to mainly investigate oscillation parameters, supernova physics and proton decay. Its far detector
will be composed of four liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) underground modules, in
South Dakota-USA, which will detect a neutrino beam produced at Fermilab, 1300 km away, where a near
detector will be in place. The second DUNE far detector module, Vertical Drift, will be a single phase
LArTPC with electron drift along the vertical axis with two volumes of 13.5 m x 6.5 m x 60 m dimensions
separated by a cathode plane. The charge collection will be performed by two anode planes placed
at the top and bottom of the module, each composed by stacked layers of a perforated PCB technology
with electrode strips. The photon detection system (PDS) will make use of large size X-Arapuca tiles
distributed over three detection planes. One plane will consist of a horizontal arrangement of
double sided tiles installed on the high voltage cathode plane and two vertical planes, each placed
on the longest cryostat membrane walls. A light active coverage of 14.8% over the cathode and 7.4%
over the laterals should allow improvements in the low energy physics range that can be probed in
DUNE, especially regarding supernova neutrinos (~10 MeV). We present the initial characterization
of the Vertical Drift PDS using a Monte Carlo simulation and preliminary studies on its reconstruction
capabilities at the MeV scale. The information obtained with the PDS alone should allow determination
of a neutrino interaction region with a precision of at least 65 cm for events with deposited energy
above 5 MeV and the deposited energy can be reconstructed with precision better than 10%, both at
the center of the volume.

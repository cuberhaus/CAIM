The necessity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions has prompted the search for carbon-free fuel alternatives.
One such carbon-free fuel source that can be used for power generation in a gas turbine-based system
is ammonia. Ammonia combustion poses challenges due to reduced flame speed and reactivity, which
can be alleviated by addition of methane or natural gas. However, NOx emission is an important issue,
which needs resolution before practical consideration of ammonia. One of the potential solutions
that has been proposed is a two-stage, rich-lean combustion process to minimize NOx while ensuring
complete reactant consumption. This work evaluates the use of two strategies to widen stability
limits for swirl combustors operating on premixed methane-ammonia-air mixtures, which would
facilitate the two-stage combustion approach. The first strategy involves the use of a distributed
fuel injection approach utilizing a novel micro fuel injection swirler while preventing flashback
concerns. The second strategy involves use of inlet air preheating to increase flame stability
and delay blow-off. Experiments and reactor network simulations are carried out to evaluate the
effectiveness of the two strategies in expanding combustor operability limits. The influence
of the proposed strategies on NOx emissions are studied and underlying reaction pathways leading
to NOx production are analyzed. Results of the study indicate that a distributed fuel injection
strategy significantly expands stability limits of a swirl combustor operating on methane-ammonia-air
mixtures. Inlet air preheating provides additional expansion of stability limits; however, this
increases NOx production, which is undesirable from an emissions standpoint. NOx is found to be
significantly lower for rich fuel-air mixtures primarily through the effect of NHi reaction pathways
responsible for NO consumption.

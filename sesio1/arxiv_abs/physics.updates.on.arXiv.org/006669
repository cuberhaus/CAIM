We show the impact that stretching and mixing has on the fate of plumes of waterborne contaminant
solutes transported through a chemically heterogeneous, partially adsorbing porous medium,
at a typical P\'eclet number characterizing saturated flows in subsurfaces, $\textit{Pe}= O(1)$.
Via pore-scale lattice Boltzmann simulations, we follow the dynamic of a passive scalar injected
in a packed bed consisting of a mixture of chemically inert and adsorbing spherical particles. By
varying the fraction of the adsorbers, randomly and uniformly distributed in the porous volume,
and the adsorption rate, we find that the waterborne solute forms different plumes emerging between
pairs of adsorbing particles. The plumes are stretched at a rate linearly increasing with time and
inversely proportional to the adsorbers' interparticle dimensionless distance $\ell_\xi^*=\ell_\xi/d$,
with $d$ being the pore size. We provide a relationship between the characteristic small-scale
scalar concentration width $\sigma_B$ and the adsorption-induced stretching rate. The stretching
process competes with diffusion broadening to asymptotically determine $\sigma_B/d\propto({\textit{Pe}/\ell_\xi^*})^{-1/2}$
and sets the characteristic scale of concentration width larger than the characteristic pore size,
that is $\sigma_B>d$. Because of the latter condition, small scalar structures overlap among adjacent
pores until mass transport and adsorption are equilibrated at a time $t_\xi$, when the plume is well-mixed
at a larger scale, corresponding to its transverse cross-section dimension. The plume mixing rate
related to the average flow velocity $1/(U t_\xi )$ very well approximates a macrohomogenous adsorption
coefficient, thus predicting the macroscopic adsorption process and the probability of solute
leakage from the porous volume.

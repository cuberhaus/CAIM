The stability of ventilated supercavitation is strongly influenced by gas leakage characteristics
of the cavity. Here we conduct a systematic investigation of such characteristics under different
closure conditions including re-entrant jet (RJ), quad vortex (QV), twin vortex (TV), and pulsating
twin vortex (PTV). Using high-speed digital inline holography (DIH), all the individual bubbles
shed from the cavity are imaged downstream and are used to quantify the instantaneous gas leakage
from the cavity. In general, the supercavity gas leakage exhibits significant fluctuations under
all closure types with the instantaneous leakage rate spiking up to 20 times of the ventilation input
under RJ and QV closures. However, the magnitude and occurrence rate of such excessive gas leakage
vary substantially across different closures, tunnel speeds, and ventilation conditions. Particularly,
as the supercavity transitions from RJ, to QV, TV, and PTV with increasing ventilation or decreasing
tunnel speed, the relative excessive gas leakage decreases sharply from RJ to QV, plateaus from
QV to TV, and drops again from TV to PTV. Correspondingly, the occurrence frequency of such excessive
leakage first exhibits a double peak distribution under RJ, migrates to a single peak mode under
QV and TV, and eventually transitions to a distribution with a broadened peak at a higher frequency
under PTV. These trends can be explained by the flow instabilities associated with three distinct
gas leakage mechanisms. Subsequently, two metrics are introduced to quantify the relative change
of ventilation needed to compensate for the change of extra gas loss and the predictability of the
occurrence of excessive gas leakage, respectively. Based on these metrics, we suggest that the
supercavity operating under TV closure with moderate ventilation is optimal for ventilation-based
controls of supercavity stability.

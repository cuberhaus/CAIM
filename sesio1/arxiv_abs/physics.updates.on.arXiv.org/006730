We present a user-friendly open-source MATLAB\textsuperscript{\textregistered} package developed
by the research group Turbulence, Wind energy and Stochastics (TWiSt) at the Carl von Ossietzky
University of Oldenburg. Firstly, this package helps the user to perform a very basic statistical
analysis of a given turbulent data set which we believe to be useful to the entire turbulence community.
It can be used to estimate the statistical quantities of turbulence such as the spectrum density,
turbulent intensity, integral length scale, Taylor microscale, Kolmogorov scale and dissipation
rate. Different well-known methods available in the literature were selected so that they can be
compared. Secondly, this package also performs an advanced analysis which includes the scale-dependent
statistical description of turbulent cascade using the Fokker-Planck equation which consequently
leads to the assessment of integral fluctuation theorem. This is utilized to estimate velocity
increments, structure functions and their scaling exponents, drift and diffusion coefficients
of the Fokker-Planck equation and consequently the total entropy production of the turbulent cascade.
As a precondition for the stochastic process approach, Markovian properties of the turbulent cascade
in scale are tested. The knowledge of a Fokker-Planck equation allows to determine for each independent
cascade trajectories a total entropy production. The estimation of total entropy production allows
to verify a rigorous law of non-equilibrium stochastic thermodynamics, namely the integral fluctuation
theorem, which must be valid if Markov properties hold and the Fokker-Planck equation is correct.
This approach to the turbulent cascade process has the potential for a new way to link the statistical
description of turbulence, non-equilibrium stochastic thermodynamics and local turbulent flow
structures.

The rise in computational capability has increased reliance on simulations to inform aircraft
design. However aircraft airworthiness testing for flight certification remains rooted in real-world
experiments performed after manufacturing an aircraft prototype. Leveraging multi-fidelity
modeling and uncertainty quantification, we present a framework creating a stochastic representation
of the aircraft, uses it to simulate flight certification maneuvers, and determines the likelihood
of successfully meeting the certification requirement. We focus on uncertainties associated
with Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations solving the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes
equations. The simulation predictions and associated uncertainties are combined with data from
other analysis tools to create stochastic aerodynamics and controls databases. The databases
describe the aircraft's behavior across its flight envelope and provide probability distributions
for its predictions. Databases are generated for two aircraft configurations, the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration (NASA) Common Research Model and the Generic T-tail Transport aircraft.
Samples from the databases, representing different aircraft behavior, are created. Each sample
is run through a flight simulation representing a real-world airworthiness test performed by the
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). These tests are agglomerated to create distributions
of the performance metrics, quantifying the probability that the aircraft succeeds in performing
the certification maneuver. Simulating flight certification testing before building a full-size
aircraft prototype mitigates the enormous costs of expensive redesigns late in the aircraft design
process. The calculation of the failure rates provides design suggestions to ensure the aircraft
can meet the certification requirement with a prescribed success rate.

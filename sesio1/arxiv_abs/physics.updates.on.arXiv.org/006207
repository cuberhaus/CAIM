This article describes experimental research studies conducted towards understanding the implementation
aspects of high-capacity quantum-secured optical channels in mission-critical metro-scale
operational environments based on Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) technology. The test bed for
this research study was carefully designed to mimic such environments. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first time that an 800 Gbps quantum-secured optical channel--along with several other
Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexed (DWDM) channels on the C-band and multiplexed with the QKD
channel on the O-band--was established at distances up to 100 km, with secure-key rates relevant
for practical industry use cases. In addition, during the course of these trials, transporting
a blockchain application over this established channel was utilized as a demonstration of securing
a financial transaction in transit over a quantum-secured optical channel. In a real-world operational
environment, deployment of such high-capacity quantum-secured optical channels multiplexed
with the quantum channel will inevitably introduce challenges due to their strict requirements,
such as high launch powers and polarization fluctuations. Therefore, in the course of this research,
experimental studies were conducted on the impact on the system performance--and specifically
on the quantum channel--of several degradation factors present in real-world operational environments,
including inter-channel interference (due to Raman scattering and nonlinear effects), attenuation,
polarization fluctuations and distance dependency. The findings of this research pave the way
towards the deployment of QKD-secured optical channels in high-capacity, metro-scale, mission-critical
operational environments, such as Inter-Data Center Interconnects.

The high computational scaling with the number of correlated electrons and the size of the basis
set is a bottleneck which limits applications of coupled cluster (CC) algorithms. This is particularly
so for calculations based on 4-component relativistic Hamiltonians, which generally employ uncontracted
basis sets and lead to large virtual molecular orbital (VMO) spaces. This problem may be alleviated
by employing a more compact set of virtual spinors than those provided by the canonical Hartree-Fock
(HF) set, such as those based on natural orbitals (NOs). In this paper we describe the implementation
of a module for generating NOs for correlated wavefunctions, and in particular MP2 frozen natural
orbitals (MP2FNOs), as a component of our novel implementation of relativistic coupled cluster
theory for massively parallel architectures [J. Pototschnig et. al., J. Chem. Theory Comput. 17,
5509, 2021]. Our implementation is capable of manipulating both complex and quaternion density
matrices, thus allowing for the generation of both Kramers-restricted and Kramers-unrestricted
MP2FNOs. Furthermore, NOs are re-expressed in the parent atomic orbital (AO) basis, so that the
code also makes it possible to generate CCSD natural orbitals in AO basis for further analysis. By
investigating the truncation errors of MP2FNOs for both the correlation energy and molecular properties
at CCSD level such as the electric field gradients at the nuclei (EFGs), electric dipole and quadrupole
moments for hydrogen halides HX (X=F-Ts), and parity-violating energy differences (PV) for H$_2$Y$_2$
(Y=O-Se), we find that MP2FNOs accelerate the convergence of the correlation energy in a roughly
uniform manner across the periodic table and that, with VMO spaces truncated to around half the size
of the full spaces ones, it is possible to obtain reliable estimates for both energies and all molecular
properties considered.

The diverse near-Earth radiation environment due to cosmic rays and solar radiation has direct
impact on human civilization. In the present and upcoming era of increasing air transfer, it is important
to have precise idea of radiation dose effects on human body during air travel. Here, we calculate
the radiation dose on the human body at the aviation altitude, also considering the shielding effect
of the aircraft structure, using Monte Carlo simulation technique based on Geant4 toolkit. We consider
proper 3D mathematical model of the atmosphere and geomagnetic field, updated profile of the incoming
particle flux due to cosmic rays and appropriate physics processes. We use quasi-realistic computational
phantoms to replicate the human body (male/female) for the effective dose calculation and develop
a simplified mathematical model of the aircraft (taking Boeing 777--200LR as reference) for the
shielding study. We simulate the radiation environment at the flying altitude (considering geomagnetic
latitude in the range of 45-50$^{\circ}$), as well as at various locations inside the fuselage of
the aircraft. Then, we calculate the dose rates in the different organs for both male and female phantoms,
based on latest recommendations of International Commission on Radio logical Protection. This
calculation shows that the sex-averaged effective dose rate in human phantom is 5.46 $\mu$Sv/h,
whereas, if we calculate weighted sum of equivalent dose contributions separately in female and
male body: total weighted sum of equivalent dose rate received by the female phantom is 5.72 $\mu$Sv/h
and that by the male phantom is 5.20 $\mu$Sv/h. From the simulation, we also calculate the numerous
cosmogenic radionuclides produced inside the phantoms through activation or spallation processes
which may induce long-term biological effects.

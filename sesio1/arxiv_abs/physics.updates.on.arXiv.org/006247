Machine learning techniques including neural networks are popular tools for materials and chemical
scientists with applications that may provide viable alternative methods in the analysis of structure
and energetics of systems ranging from crystals to biomolecules. However, efforts are less abundant
for prediction of dynamics. Here we explore the ability of three well established recurrent neural
network architectures for forecasting the energetics of a macromolecular polymer-lipid aggregate
solvated in ethyl acetate at ambient conditions. Data models generated from recurrent neural networks
are trained and tested on nanoseconds-long time series of the intra-macromolecules potential
energy and their interaction energy with the solvent generated from Molecular Dynamics and containing
half million points. Our exhaustive analyses convey that the three recurrent neural network investigated
generate data models with limited capability of reproducing the energetic fluctuations and yielding
short or long term energetics forecasts with underlying distribution of points inconsistent with
the input series distributions. We propose an in silico experimental protocol consisting on forming
an ensemble of artificial network models trained on an ensemble of series with additional features
from time series containing pre-clustered time patterns of the original series. The forecast process
improves by predicting a band of forecasted time series with a spread of values consistent with the
molecular dynamics energy fluctuations span. However, the distribution of points from the band
of forecasts is not optimal. Although the three inspected recurrent neural networks were unable
of generating single models that reproduce the actual fluctuations of the inspected molecular
system energies in thermal equilibrium at the nanosecond scale, the proposed protocol provides
useful estimates of the molecular fate

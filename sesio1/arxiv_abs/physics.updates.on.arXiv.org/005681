Cognitive neuroscience methods can identify the fMRI-measured neural representation of familiar
individual concepts, such as apple, and decompose them into meaningful neural and semantic components.
This approach was applied here to determine the neural representations and underlying dimensions
of representation of far more abstract physics concepts related to matter and energy, such as fermion
and dark matter, in the brains of 10 Carnegie Mellon physics faculty members who thought about the
main properties of each of the concepts. One novel dimension coded the measurability vs. immeasurability
of a concept. Another novel dimension of representation evoked particularly by post-classical
concepts was associated with four types of cognitive processes, each linked to particular brain
regions: (1) Reasoning about intangibles, taking into account their separation from direct experience
and observability; (2) Assessing consilience with other, firmer knowledge; (3) Causal reasoning
about relations that are not apparent or observable; and (4) Knowledge management of a large knowledge
organization consisting of a multi-level structure of other concepts. Two other underlying dimensions,
previously found in physics students, periodicity, and mathematical formulation, were also present
in this faculty sample. The data were analyzed using factor analysis of stably responding voxels,
a Gaussian-na\"ive Bayes machine-learning classification of the activation patterns associated
with each concept, and a regression model that predicted activation patterns associated with each
concept based on independent ratings of the dimensions of the concepts. The findings indicate that
the human brain systematically organizes novel scientific concepts in terms of new dimensions
of neural representation.

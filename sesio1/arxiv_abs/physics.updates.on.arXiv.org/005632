Nanostructuring allows altering of the electronic and photonic properties of two-dimensional
(2D) materials. The efficiency, flexibility, and convenience of top-down lithography processes
are however compromised by nm-scale edge roughness and resolution variability issues, which especially
affects the performance of 2D materials. Here we study how dry anisotropic etching of multilayer
2D materials with sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) may overcome some of these issues, showing results
for hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), tungsten disulfide (WS2), tungsten diselenide (WSe2), molybdenum
disulfide (MoS2), molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe2). Scanning and transmission electron microscopy
reveal that etching leads to anisotropic hexagonal features in the studied transition metal dichalcogenides,
with the relative degree of anisotropy ranked as: WS2 > WSe2 > MoTe2 / MoS2. Etched holes are terminated
by zigzag edges while etched dots (protrusions) are terminated by armchair edges. This can be explained
by Wulff constructions, taking the relative stabilities of the edges and the AA stacking order into
account. Patterns in WS2 are transferred to an underlying graphite layer, demonstrating a possible
use for creating sub-10 nm features. In contrast, multilayer hBN exhibits no lateral anisotropy,
but shows consistent vertical etch angles, independent of crystal orientation. This is used to
create super-resolution lithographic patterns with ultra-sharp corners at the base of the hBN
crystal, which are transferred into an underlying graphite crystal. We find that the anisotropic
SF6 reactive ion etching process makes it possible to downsize nanostructures to obtain smooth
edges, sharp corners, and feature sizes significantly below the resolution limit of electron beam
lithography. The nanostructured 2D materials can be used themselves or as etch-masks to pattern
other nanomaterials.

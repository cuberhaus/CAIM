The direct measurement of wall shear stress in turbulent boundary layers (TBL) is challenging,
therefore requiring it to be indirectly determined from mean profile measurements. Most popular
methods assume the mean streamwise velocity to satisfy either a logarithmic law in the inner layer
or a composite velocity profile with many tuned constants for the entire TBL, both of which require
reliable data from the inner layer. The presence of roughness and pressure gradient brings additional
complications where most existing methods either fail or require significant modification. A
novel method is proposed to determine the wall shear stress in zero pressure gradient TBL from measured
mean profiles, without requiring near-wall data. The method is based on the stress model of Kumar
and Mahesh [Phys. Rev. Fluids 6, 024603 (2021)], who developed accurate models for mean stress and
wall-normal velocity in zero pressure gradient TBL. The proposed method requires a single point
measurement of mean streamwise velocity and mean shear stress in the outer layer, preferably between
$20$ to $50 \%$ of the TBL, and an estimate of boundary layer thickness and shape factor. The method
can handle wall roughness without modification and is shown to predict friction velocities to within
$3 \%$ over a range of Reynolds number for both smooth and rough wall zero pressure gradient TBL. In
order to include the pressure gradients effects, the work of Kumar and Mahesh [Phys. Rev. Fluids
6, 024603 (2021)] is revisited to derive a novel model for both mean stress and wall-normal velocity
in pressure gradient TBL, which is then used to formulate a method to obtain the wall shear stress
from the profile data. Overall, the proposed method is shown to be robust and accurate for a variety
of pressure gradient TBL.

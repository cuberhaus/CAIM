The risks of disease transmission due to these droplets are significantly high in confined public
spaces like elevators. A numerical analysis using OpenFOAM has been performed in this work to investigate
the droplet dispersion routes in an enclosed environment resembling an elevator. The effect of
two scenarios on droplet dispersal, namely the quiescent and the fan-driven ventilation, both
subjected to various climatic conditions (of temperature and humidity) ranging from cold humid
(15 degree C, 70 percent relative humidity) to hot dry (30 degree C, 30 percent relative humidity
and 30 degree C, 50 percent relative humidity) and hot humid (30 degree C, 70 percent relative humidity)
have been studied. A risk factor derived from a dose response model based on the time averaged pathogen
quantity present around the passengers mouth is used to quantify the risk of infection through airborne
mode. It is found that the hot, dry quiescent scenario poses the greatest threat of infection (spatio
averaged risk factor 42 percent), whereas the cold humid condition poses the least risk of infection
(spatio averaged risk factor 30 percent. The implementation of Fan ventilation at low RPM increases
the risk as compared to a quiescent scenario, however with the increase in speed the risk decreases
significantly. The Fan ventilation scenario with 1100 RPM (having a spatio averaged risk factor
of 10 percent) decreases the risk of infection by 67 percent in a hot, dry climatic condition as compared
to a quiescent scenario. However, there is no significant reduction in risk beyond a certain Fan
speed, 1100 RPM. The deposition potential of aerosolized droplets in various parts of the respiratory
tract namely the Extrathoracic and the Alveolar and Bronchial regions has been analyzed thoroughly
because of the concomitant repercussions of infection in various depths of the respiratory region.

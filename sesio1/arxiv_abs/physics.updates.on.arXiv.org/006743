The gas-solid particle two-phase flow in a fluidized bed shows complex physics. Following our previous
work, the multi-scale framework based on gas-kinetic scheme (GKS) and unified gas-kinetic wave-particle
method (UGKWP) for the gas-particle system is firstly extended to the three-dimensional simulation
of the fluidized bed. For the solid particle evolution, different from the widely-used Eulerian
and Lagrangian approaches, the UGKWP unifies the wave (dense particle region) and discrete particle
(dilute particle region) formulation seamlessly according to a continuous variation of particle
cell's Kundsen number ($Kn$). The GKS-UGKWP for the coupled gas-particle evolution system can
automatically become an Eulerian-Eulerian (EE) method in the high particle collision regime and
Eulerian-Lagrangian (EL) formulation in the collisionless particle regime. In the transition
regime, the UGKWP can achieve a smooth transition between the Eulerian and Lagrangian limiting
formulation. More importantly, the weights of mass distributions from analytical wave and discrete
particle are related to the local $Kn$ by $\exp(-1/Kn)$ for wave and $(1-\exp(-1/Kn))$ for discrete
particle. As a result, the UGKWP provides an optimal modeling for capturing the particle phase in
terms of physical accuracy and numerical efficiency. In the numerical simulation, the UGKWP does
not need any prior division of dilute/dense regions, which makes it suitable for the fluidized bed
problem, where the dilute/transition/dense regions instantaneously coexist and are dynamically
interconvertible. In this paper, based on the GKS-UGKWP formulation two lab-scale fluidization
cases are simulated in 3D and the simulation results are compared with the experimental measurements.
The typical heterogeneous flow features of the fluidized bed are well captured and the statistics
are in good agreement with experiment data.

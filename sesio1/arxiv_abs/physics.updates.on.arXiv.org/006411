Background: Filtered back projection algorithms for voxel-based CT image reconstruction have
noise properties defined by the filter. Iterative algorithms must stop at some point in their convergence
and do not necessarily produce consistent noise properties for images with different degrees of
heterogeneity. Purpose: A least-squares iterative algorithm for pCT image reconstruction converges
toward a unique solution that optimally fits the protons. We present a stopping criterion that delivers
solutions with the property that correlations of RSP noise between voxels are relatively low. This
provides a method to produce pCT images with consistent noise properties useful for proton therapy
treatment planning, which relies on summing RSP along columns of voxels. Consistent noise properties
will also be useful for future studies of image quality using metrics such as contrast to noise ratio,
and to compare RSP noise and dose of pCT with other modalities such as dual-energy CT. With simulated
and real images with varying heterogeneity from a prototype clinical proton imaging system, we
calculate average RSP correlations between voxel pairs in uniform regions-of-interest versus
distance between voxels. We define a parameter r, the remaining distance to the unique solution
relative to estimated RSP noise, and our stopping criterion is based on r falling below a chosen value.
Results: We find large correlations between voxels for larger values of r, and anticorrelations
for smaller values. For r in the range of 0.5 to 1, voxels are relatively uncorrelated, and compared
to smaller values of r have lower noise with only slight loss of spatial resolution. Conclusions:
A least-squares iterative algorithm with an r-based stopping criterion defines a pCT image reconstruction
method with consistent statistical properties optimal for clinical use, including for treatment
planning with pCT images.

Newtonian machine learning (NML) is a wave-equation inversion method that inverts single-dimensional
latent space (LS) features of the seismic data for retrieving the subsurface background velocity
model. The single-dimensional LS features mainly contain the kinematic information of the seismic
data, which are automatically extracted from the seismic signal by using an autoencoder network.
Because its LS feature dimension is too small to preserve the dynamic information, such as the waveform
variations, of the seismic data. Therefore the NML inversion is not able to recover the high-wavenumber
velocity details. To mitigate this problem, we propose to invert multi-dimensional LS features,
which can fully represent the entire characters of the seismic data. We denote this method as multi-dimensional
Newtonian machine learning (MNML). In MNML, we define a new multi-variable connective function
that works together with the multi-variable implicit function theorem to connect the velocity
perturbations to the multi-dimensional LS feature perturbations. Numerical tests show that (1)
the multi-dimensional LS features can preserve more data information than the single-dimensional
LS features; (2) a higher resolution velocity model can be recovered by inverting the multi-dimensional
LS features, and the inversion quality is comparable to that of FWI; (3) the MNML method requires
a much smaller storage space than conventional FWI because only the low-dimensional representations
of the high-dimensional seismic data are needed to be stored. The disadvantage of MNML is that it
can more easily get stuck in local minima compared to the NML method. So we suggest a multiscale inversion
approach that inverts for higher dimensional LS features as the iteration count increase.

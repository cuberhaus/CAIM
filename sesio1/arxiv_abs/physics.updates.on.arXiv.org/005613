This paper is an {\sf application} to Einstein's gravity (EG) of the mathematics developed in A.
Plastino, M. C. Rocca: J. Phys. Commun. {\bf 2}, 115029 (2018). We will quantize EG by appeal to the
most general quantization approach, the Schwinger-Feynman variational principle, which is more
appropriate and rigorous that the functional integral method, when we are in the presence of derivative
couplings \nd We base our efforts on works by Suraj N. Gupta and Richard P. Feynman so as to undertake
the construction of a Quantum Field Theory (QFT) of Einstein Gravity (EG). We explicitly use the
Einstein Lagrangian elaborated by Gupta \cite{g1} but choose a new constraint for the theory that
differs from Gupta's one. In this way, we avoid the problem of lack of unitarity for the $S$ matrix
that afflicts the procedures of Gupta and Feynman. Simultaneously, we significantly simplify
the handling of constraints. This eliminates the need to appeal to ghosts for guarantying the unitarity
of the theory. Our ensuing approach is obviously non-renormalizable. However, this inconvenience
can be overcome by appealing tho the mathematical theory developed by Bollini et al. \cite{tp3,tp18,tp19,tp20,pr}
Such developments were founded in the works of Alexander Grothendieck \cite{gro} and in the theory
of Ultradistributions of Jose Sebastiao e Silva \cite{tp6} (also known as Ultrahyperfunctions).
Based on these works, we have constructed a mathematical edifice, in a lapse of about 25 years, that
is able to quantize non-renormalizable Field Theories (FT). Here we specialize this mathematical
theory to treat the quantum field theory of Einsteins's gravity (EG). Because we are using a Gupta-Feynman
inspired EG Lagrangian, we are able to evade the intricacies of Yang-Mills theories.

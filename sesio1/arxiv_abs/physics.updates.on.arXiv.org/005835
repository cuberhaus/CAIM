Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy is a preferred technique for fast and direct multi-elemental
mapping of samples under ambient pressure, without any limitation on the targeted element. However,
LIBS mapping data have two peculiarities: an intrinsically low signal-to-noise ratio due to single-shot
measurements, and a high dimensionality due to the high number of spectra acquired for imaging.
This is all the truer as lateral resolution gets higher: in this case, the ablation spot diameter
is reduced, as well as the ablated mass and the emission signal, while the number of spectra for a given
surface increases. Therefore, efficient extraction of physico-chemical information from a noisy
and large dataset is a major issue. Multivariate approaches were introduced by several authors
as a means to cope with such data, particularly Principal Component Analysis. Yet, PCA is known to
present theoretical constraints for the consistent reconstruction of the dataset, and has therefore
limitations to efficient interpretation of LIBS mapping data. In this paper, we introduce HyperPCA,
a new analysis tool for hyperspectral images based on a sparse representation of the data using Discrete
Wavelet Transform and kernel-based sparse PCA to reduce the impact of noise on the data and to consistently
reconstruct the spectroscopic signal, with a particular emphasis on LIBS data. The method is first
illustrated using simulated LIBS mapping datasets to emphasize its performances with highly noisy
and/or highly interfered spectra. Comparisons to standard PCA and to traditional univariate data
analyses are provided. Finally, it is used to process real data in two cases that clearly illustrate
the potential of the proposed algorithm. We show that the method presents advantages both in quantity
and quality of the information recovered, thus improving the physico-chemical characterisation
of analysed surfaces.

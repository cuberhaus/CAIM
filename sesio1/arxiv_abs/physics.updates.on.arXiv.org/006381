When light propagates through a multimode optical fibre (MMF), the spatial information it carries
is scrambled. Wavefront shaping can undo this scrambling, typically one spatial mode at a time -
enabling deployment of MMFs as ultra-thin micro-endoscopes. In this work we go beyond serial wavefront
shaping by showing how to simultaneously unscramble all spatial modes emerging from an MMF in parallel.
We introduce a passive multiple-scattering element - crafted through the process of inverse design
- that is complementary to an MMF and undoes its optical effects. This optical inverter makes possible
both single-shot wide-field imaging and super-resolution imaging through MMFs. Our design consists
of a cascade of diffractive elements, and can be understood from the perspective of both multi-plane
light conversion, and as a physically inspired deep diffractive neural network. This physical
architecture can outperform state-of-the-art electronic neural networks tasked with unscrambling
light, as it preserves the phase and coherence information of the optical signals flowing through
it. Here we demonstrate our MMF inversion concept through numerical simulations, and efficiently
sort and unscramble up to ~400 step-index fibre modes, reforming incoherent images of scenes at
arbitrary distances from the distal fibre facet. We also describe how our optical inverter can dynamically
adapt to see through flexible fibres with a range of experimentally realistic TMs - made possible
by moulding optical memory effects into the structure of our design. Although complex, our inversion
scheme is based on current fabrication technology so could be realised in the near future. Beyond
imaging through scattering media, these concepts open up a range of new avenues for optical multiplexing,
communications and computation in the realms of classical and quantum photonics.

Photonics integrated circuitry would benefit considerably from the ability to arbitrarily control
waveguide cross-sections with high precision and low loss, in order to provide more degrees of freedom
in manipulating propagating light. Here, we report a new method for femtosecond laser writing of
optical-fibre-compatible glass waveguides, namely spherical phase induced multi-core waveguide
(SPIM-WG), which addresses this challenging task with three dimensional on-chip light control.
Fabricating in the heating regime with high scanning speed, precise deformation of cross-sections
is still achievable along the waveguide, with shapes and sizes finely controllable of high resolution
in both horizontal and vertical transversal directions. We observed that these waveguides have
high refractive index contrast of 0.017, low propagation loss of 0.14 dB/cm, and very low coupling
loss of 0.19 dB coupled from a single mode fibre. SPIM-WG devices were easily fabricated that were
able to perform on-chip beam rotation through varying angles, or manipulate polarization state
of propagating light for target wavelengths. We also demonstrated SPIM-WG mode converters that
provide arbitrary adiabatic mode conversion with high efficiency between symmetric and asymmetric
non-uniform modes; examples include circular, elliptical modes and asymmetric modes from ppKTP
(periodically-poled potassium titanyl phosphate) waveguides which are generally applied in
frequency conversion and quantum light sources. Created inside optical glass, these waveguides
and devices have the capability to operate across ultra-broad bands from visible to infrared wavelengths.
The compatibility with optical fibre also paves the way toward packaged photonic integrated circuitry,
which usually needs input and output fibre connections.

Data-driven methods have increasingly been applied to the development of optical systems as inexpensive
and effective inverse design approaches. Optical properties (e.g., band-gap properties) of photonic
crystals (PCs) are closely associated with characteristics of their light reflection spectra.
Finding optimal PC constructions (within a pre-specified parameter space) that generate reflection
spectra closest to a targeted spectrum is thus an interesting and meaningful inverse design problem,
although relevant studies are still limited. Here we report a generally effective machine learning-based
inverse design approach for one-dimensional photonic crystals (1DPCs), focusing on visible light
spectra which are of high practical relevance. For a given class of 1DPC system, a deep neural network
(DNN) in a unified structure is first trained over data from sizeable forward calculations (from
layer thicknesses to spectrum). An iterative optimization scheme is then developed based on a coherent
integration of DNN backward predictions (from spectrum to layer thicknesses), forward calculations,
and Monte Carlo moves. We employ this new approach to four representative 1DPC systems including
periodic structures with two-, three-, and four-layer repeating units and a heterostructure.
The approach successfully converges to solutions of optimal 1DPC constructions for various targeted
spectra regardless of their exact achievability. As two demonstrating examples, inverse designs
toward a specially constructed "rectangle-shaped" green-light or red-light reflection spectrum
are presented and discussed in detail. Remarkably, the results show that the approach can efficiently
find out optimal layer thicknesses even when they are far outside the range covered by the original
training data of DNN.

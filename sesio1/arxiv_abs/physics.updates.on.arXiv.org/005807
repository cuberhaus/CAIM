The brain is in a state of perpetual reverberant neural activity, even in the absence of specific
tasks or stimuli. Shedding light on the origin and functional significance of such activity is essential
to understanding how the brain transmits, processes, and stores information. An inspiring, albeit
controversial, conjecture proposes that some statistical characteristics of empirically observed
neuronal activity can be understood by assuming that brain networks operate in a dynamical regime
near the edge of a phase transition. Moreover, the resulting critical behavior, with its concomitant
scale invariance, is assumed to carry crucial functional advantages. Here, we present a data-driven
analysis based on simultaneous high-throughput recordings of the activity of thousands of individual
neurons in various regions of the mouse brain. To analyze these data, we construct a unified theoretical
framework that synergistically combines cutting-edge methods for the study of brain activity
(such as a phenomenological renormalization group approach and techniques that infer the general
dynamical state of a neural population), while designing complementary tools. This unified approach
allows us to uncover strong signatures of scale invariance that is "quasi-universal" across brain
regions and reveal that these areas operate, to a greater or lesser extent, at the edge of instability.
Furthermore, this framework allows us to distinguish between quasi-universal background activity
and non-universal input-related activity. Taken together, the following study provides strong
evidence that brain networks actually operate in a critical regime which, among other functional
advantages, provides them with a scale-invariant substrate of activity in which optimal input
representations can be sustained.

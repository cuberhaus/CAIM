We derive the general solution of the unsteady Stokes equations for an unbounded fluid in spherical
polar coordinates, in both time and frequency domains. The solution is an expansion in vector spherical
harmonics and given as a sum of a particular solution, proportional to pressure gradient exhibiting
power-law spatial dependence, and a solution of vector Helmholtz equation decaying exponentially
in far field, the decomposition originally introduced by Lamb. The solution can be applied to construct
the transient exterior flow induced by an arbitrary velocity distribution at the spherical boundary,
such as arising in the squirmer model of a microswimmer. It can be used to construct solutions for
transient flows driven by initial conditions, unbounded flows driven by volume forces or disturbance
to the unsteady flow due to a stationary spherical particle. The long-time behavior of solution
is controlled by the flow component corresponding to average (or collective) motion of the boundary.
This conclusion is illustrated by the study of decay of transversal wave in the presence of a fixed
sphere. We further show that the general representation reduces to the well-known solutions for
unsteady flow around a sphere undergoing oscillatory rigid-body (translation and rotation) motion.
The proposed solution representation provides an explicit form of the velocity potential far from
an oscillating body ("generalized" Darcy's law) and high- and low-frequency expansions. The leading-order
high-frequency expansion yields the well-known ideal (inviscid) flow approximation, and the
leading-order low-frequency expansion yields the steady Stokes equations. We derive the higher-order
corrections to these approximations and discuss d'Alembert paradox. Continuation of the general
solution to imaginary frequency yields the general solution of the Brinkman equations describing
viscous flow in porous medium.

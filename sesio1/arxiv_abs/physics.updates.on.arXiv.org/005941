Vector field analysis is presented for a highly overmoded iris-line structure that can act as a medium
of transportation for THz radiation. The axisymmetric structure is capable of supporting hybrid
modes with desirable features such as low propagation loss, uniformly linear polarization and
approximately-Gaussian intensity profile across the iris. A specific application that can benefit
from these features is the transportation of THz undulator radiation over hundreds of meters to
reach the experimental halls at the LCLS facility, SLAC, Stanford. Such a structure has been modelled
before as a boundary-value problem using Vainstein's impedance boundary condition and assuming
infinitely-thin screens. Given that physical realizations of such screens must have finite thickness
and that the THz wavelength in the 3-15 THz range is expected to be smaller than convenient screen
thicknesses in practice, the question of the impact of finite screen thickness on propagation performance
becomes rather pressing. To address this question, we present a mode-matching analysis of the structure,
with finite screen thickness and perturbatively clustered (localized) field expansions, for
computational feasibility. The effect of screen thickness is seen to lower the attenuation constant
on the iris line, which is dominated by diffraction loss. The propagation loss predictions based
on the Vainstein-model are compared with the numerical results from mode-matching for infinitely-thin
screens, where the former method is observed to agree with the numerical results better at higher
Fresnel numbers (highly-overmoded structures). The properties of the dominant mode fields are
formally derived from first principles and a recommended approach is discussed for the inclusion
of screen-thickness effects into propagation loss estimations.

Spreading dynamics and complex contagion processes on networks are important mechanisms underlying
the emergence of critical transitions, tipping points and other nonlinear phenomena in complex
human and natural systems. Increasing amounts of temporal network data are now becoming available
to study such spreading processes of behaviours, opinions, ideas, diseases and innovations to
test hypotheses regarding their specific properties. To this end, we here present a methodology
based on dose-response functions and hypothesis testing using surrogate data models that randomise
most aspects of the empirical data while conserving certain structures relevant to contagion,
group or homophily dynamics. We demonstrate this methodology for synthetic temporal network data
of spreading processes generated by the adaptive voter model. Furthermore, we apply it to empirical
temporal network data from the Copenhagen Networks Study. This data set provides a physically-close-contact
network between several hundreds of university students participating in the study over the course
of three months. We study the potential spreading dynamics of the health-related behaviour "regularly
going to the fitness studio" on this network. Based on a hierarchy of surrogate data models, we find
that our method neither provides significant evidence for an influence of a dose-response-type
network spreading process in this data set, nor significant evidence for homophily. The empirical
dynamics in exercise behaviour are likely better described by individual features such as the disposition
towards the behaviour, and the persistence to maintain it, as well as external influences affecting
the whole group, and the non-trivial network structure. The proposed methodology is generic and
promising also for applications to other temporal network data sets and traits of interest.

The Rossiter modes of an open cavity were studied using global linear analysis and nonlinear numerical
simulations. The length over depth ratio was two and the Reynolds numbers based on cavity depth were
close to 1000. The effect of Mach on such cavities was studied. The global analysis revealed that,
in the Mach range 0.1 to 0.9, for thick boundary layers, only R1 and R2 modes could become unstable,
whereas for thin boundary layer up to R4 could be unstable. Compressibility was very destabilizing
at low Mach. At moderate Mach the instability either saturated with Mach or had an irregular dependence.
Analysis of the Rossiter mode eigenfunctions indicated that the acoustic feedback scaled to Ma^3,
and explained the strong destabilizing effect of compressibility. The irregular dependence was
associated with resonances between Rossiter modes and acoustic cavity modes. The analysis explained
why the irregular Mach dependence occurred only for higher order Rossiter modes. In this parameter
region three dimensional modes are stable or marginally unstable. Two-dimensional simulations
were performed to evaluate how much of the nonlinear regime could be captured by the linear stability
results. As the flow became more unstable, an increasing more complex final stage was reached. Yet
the spectra present distinct tones that are close to linear predictions. However, a closer look
reveals the dominant frequency in the saturated state corresponds to R1 while linear theory predicts
R2 as the most unstable mode. This is associated with a nonlinear thickening of the mixing layer in
the nonlinear regime. Moreover, the frequencies are much closer to Rossiter empirical predictions
than the linear instability ones. Even at these conditions close to critical, the spectra are well
described by the mode R1 and a cascade of nonlinearly generated harmonics, with no reminiscence
of the linear instability.

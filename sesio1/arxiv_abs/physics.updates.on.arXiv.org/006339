Localized plasmons formed in ultrathin metallic nanogaps can lead to robust absorption of incident
light. Plasmonic metasurfaces based on this effect can efficiently generate energetic charge
carriers, also known as hot electrons, owing to their ability to squeeze and enhance electromagnetic
fields in confined subwavelength spaces. However, it is very challenging to accurately identify
and quantify the dynamics of hot carriers, mainly due to their ultrafast time decay. Their non-equilibrium
temperature response is one of the key factors missing to understand the short time decay and overall
transient tunable absorption performance of gap-plasmon metasurfaces. Here, we systematically
study the temperature dynamics of hot electrons and their transition into thermal carriers at various
timescales from femto to nanoseconds by using the two-temperature model. Additionally, the hot
electron temperature and generation rate threshold values are investigated by using a hydrodynamic
nonlocal model approach that is more accurate when ultrathin gaps are considered. The derived temperature
dependent material properties are used to study the ultrafast transient nonlinear modification
in the absorption spectrum before plasmon-induced lattice heating is established leading to efficient
tunable nanophotonic absorber designs. We also examine the damage threshold of these plasmonic
absorbers under various pulsed laser illuminations, an important quantity to derive the ultimate
input intensity limits that can be used in various emerging nonlinear optics and other tunable nanophotonic
applications. The presented results elucidate the role of hot electrons in the response of gap-plasmon
metasurface absorbers which can be used to design more efficient photocatalysis, photovoltaics,
and photodetection devices.

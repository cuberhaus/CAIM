In many hypothesis testing applications, we have mixed priors, with well-motivated informative
priors for some parameters but not for others. The Bayesian methodology uses the Bayes factor and
is helpful for the informative priors, as it incorporates Occam's razor via multiplicity or trials
factor in the Look Elsewhere Effect. However, if the prior is not known completely, the frequentist
hypothesis test via the false positive rate is a better approach, as it is less sensitive to the prior
choice. We argue that when only partial prior information is available, it is best to combine the
two methodologies by using the Bayes factor as a test statistic in the frequentist analysis. We show
that the standard frequentist likelihood-ratio test statistic corresponds to the Bayes factor
with a non-informative Jeffrey's prior. We also show that mixed priors increase the statistical
power in frequentist analyses over the likelihood ratio test statistic. We develop an analytic
formalism that does not require expensive simulations using a statistical mechanics approach
to hypothesis testing in Bayesian and frequentist statistics. We introduce the counting of states
in a continuous parameter space using the uncertainty volume as the quantum of the state. We show
that both the p-value and Bayes factor can be expressed as energy versus entropy competition. We
present analytic expressions that generalize Wilks' theorem beyond its usual regime of validity
and work in a non-asymptotic regime. In specific limits, the formalism reproduces existing expressions,
such as the p-value of linear models and periodograms. We apply the formalism to an example of exoplanet
transits, where multiplicity can be more than $10^7$. We show that our analytic expressions reproduce
the p-values derived from numerical simulations.

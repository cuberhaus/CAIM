Biophysical models of diffusion in white matter are based on what is now commonly referred to as the
"Standard Model" (SM) of non-exchanging anisotropic Gaussian compartments. In this work, we focus
on diffusion MRI in gray matter, which requires rethinking basic microstructure modeling blocks.
In particular, at least three contributions beyond the SM need to be considered: water exchange
across the cell membrane - between neurites and the extracellular space; non-Gaussian diffusion
along neuronal and glial processes - resulting from structural disorder; and signal contribution
from soma. For the first contribution, we propose Neurite Exchange Imaging (NEXI) as an extension
of the SM of diffusion, which builds on the anisotropic K\"arger model of two exchanging compartments.
Using datasets acquired at multiple diffusion weightings (b) and diffusion times (t) in the rat
brain in vivo, we show that for the investigated diffusion time window (~10-45 ms) there is minimal
diffusivity time-dependence and more pronounced kurtosis decay with time in gray matter, which
is well fit by the exchange model. Moreover, we observe lower signal for longer diffusion times at
high b. In light of these observations, we identify exchange as the mechanism that best explains
these signal signatures in both low-b and high-b regime, and thereby propose NEXI as the minimal
model for gray matter microstructure mapping. We finally highlight multi-b multi-t acquisitions
protocols as being best suited to estimate NEXI model parameters reliably. Using this approach,
we estimate the inter-compartment water exchange time to be 15 - 60 ms in the rat cortex and hippocampus
in vivo, which is of the same order or shorter than the diffusion time in typical diffusion MRI acquisitions.
This suggests water exchange as an essential component for interpreting diffusion MRI measurements
in gray matter.

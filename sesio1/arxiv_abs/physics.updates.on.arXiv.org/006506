MR-STAT is an emerging quantitative magnetic resonance imaging technique which aims at obtaining
multi-parametric tissue parameter maps from single short scans. It describes the relationship
between the spatial-domain tissue parameters and the time-domain measured signal by using a comprehensive,
volumetric forward model. The MR-STAT reconstruction solves a large-scale nonlinear problem,
thus is very computationally challenging. In previous work, MR-STAT reconstruction using Cartesian
readout data was accelerated by approximating the Hessian matrix with sparse, banded blocks, and
can be done on high performance CPU clusters with tens of minutes. In the current work, we propose
an accelerated Cartesian MR-STAT algorithm incorporating two different strategies: firstly,
a neural network is trained as a fast surrogate to learn the magnetization signal not only in the full
time-domain but also in the compressed lowrank domain; secondly, based on the surrogate model,
the Cartesian MR-STAT problem is re-formulated and split into smaller sub-problems by the alternating
direction method of multipliers. The proposed method substantially reduces the computational
requirements for runtime and memory. Simulated and in-vivo balanced MR-STAT experiments show
similar reconstruction results using the proposed algorithm compared to the previous sparse Hessian
method, and the reconstruction times are at least 40 times shorter. Incorporating sensitivity
encoding and regularization terms is straightforward, and allows for better image quality with
a negligible increase in reconstruction time. The proposed algorithm could reconstruct both balanced
and gradient-spoiled in-vivo data within 3 minutes on a desktop PC, and could thereby facilitate
the translation of MR-STAT in clinical settings.

Thermal electrons cannot directly participate in the process of diffusive acceleration at electron-ion
shocks because their Larmor radii are smaller than the shock transition width: this is the well-known
electron injection problem of diffusive shock acceleration. Instead, an efficient pre-acceleration
process must exist that scatters electrons off of electromagnetic fluctuations on scales much
shorter than the ion gyro radius. The recently found intermediate-scale instability provides
a natural way to produce such fluctuations in parallel shocks. The instability drives comoving
(with the upstream plasma) ion-cyclotron waves at the shock front and only operates when the drift
speed is smaller than half of the electron Alfven speed. Here, we perform particle-in-cell simulations
with the SHARP code to study the impact of this instability on electron acceleration at parallel
non-relativistic, electron-ion shocks. To this end, we compare a shock simulation in which the
intermediate-scale instability is expected to grow to simulations where it is suppressed. In particular,
the simulation with an Alfvenic Mach number large enough to quench the intermediate instability
shows a great reduction (by two orders of magnitude) of the electron acceleration efficiency. Moreover,
the simulation with a reduced ion-to-electron mass ratio (where the intermediate instability
is also suppressed) not only artificially precludes electron acceleration but also results in
erroneous electron and ion heating in the downstream and shock transition regions. This finding
opens up a promising route for a plasma physical understanding of diffusive shock acceleration
of electrons, which necessarily requires realistic mass ratios in simulations of collisionless
electron-ion shocks.

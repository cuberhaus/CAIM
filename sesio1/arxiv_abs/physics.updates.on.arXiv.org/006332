The critical heat flux (CHF) is an important thermal-hydraulic parameter that must be determined
during the design of water-cooled reactors to ensure safety of operation. In this paper, a methodology
is proposed to predict the CHF in VVER rod bundles. A whole-reactor model of VVER-1000 is implemented
in RELAP-SCDAPSIM, and, based on the bundle-average approach, the parameters of the hot channel
are used to assess four CHF predictors (i.e., the 2006 Groeneveld look-up table (LUT), and the Bowring,
W-3, Biasi, and OKB-Gidropress correlations) upon comparison with the 2011 Bobkov LUT. A brief
critique is given of the correction factors for both the Groeneveld and Bobkov LUTs. The effects
of channel diameter and non-uniform axial heat flux on the predicted values of CHF in subcooled conditions
are also studied. The performance and time complexity of the standard and Bourke trilinear interpolation
algorithms are assessed for use with LUTs in safety codes. It has been concluded that the non-uniform
axial heat flux does not affect the CHF in subcooled conditions and that the Groeneveld diameter
factor exponent gives better predictability of the CHF in VVER rod bundles over the Tanase and Wong
exponent correlations. Additionally, the Groeneveld LUT has been found to nearly reproduces the
Bobkov LUT CHF values when used in conjunction with the Bobkov heated length factor. Values of MDNBR
equal to 1.83 and 1.96 can be used as thermal limits at 12\% overpower when the Bowring and W-3 correlations,
respectively, are used in subcooled conditions. The standard and Bourke algorithms nearly exhibit
the same average CPU time. The Bourke algorithm, however, is less affected by noise. Further research
is needed to ensure the smoothness of the Bobkov LUT and to derive reactor type-dependent correction
factor formulas for use with the Groeneveld LUT.

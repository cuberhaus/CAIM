Rare events arising in nonlinear atmospheric dynamics remain hard to predict and attribute. We
address the problem of forecasting rare events in a prototypical example, Sudden Stratospheric
Warmings (SSWs). Approximately once every other winter, the boreal stratospheric polar vortex
rapidly breaks down, shifting midlatitude surface weather patterns for months. We focus on two
key quantities of interest: the probability of an SSW occurring, and the expected lead time if it
does occur, as functions of initial condition. These \emph{optimal forecasts} concretely measure
the event's progress. Direct numerical simulation can estimate them in principle, but is prohibitively
expensive in practice: each rare event requires a long integration to observe, and the cost of each
integration grows with model complexity. We describe an alternative approach using integrations
that are \emph{short} compared to the timescale of the warming event. We compute the probability
and lead time efficiently by solving equations involving the transition operator, which encodes
all information about the dynamics. We relate these optimal forecasts to a small number of interpretable
physical variables, suggesting optimal measurements for forecasting. We illustrate the methodology
on a prototype SSW model developed by Holton and Mass (1976) and modified by stochastic forcing.
While highly idealized, this model captures the essential nonlinear dynamics of SSWs and exhibits
the key forecasting challenge: the dramatic separation in timescales between a single event and
the return time between successive events. Our methodology is designed to fully exploit high-dimensional
data from models and observations, and has the potential to identify detailed predictors of many
complex rare events in meteorology.

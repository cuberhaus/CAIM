Metasurfaces consisting of hybrid metal/dielectric nanostructures carry advantages of both
material platforms. The hybrid structures can not only tightly confine subwavelength electromagnetic
fields but also lower the absorption losses. Such optical characteristics are difficult to realize
in metamaterials with only metal or dielectric structures. Hybrid designs also expand the scope
of material choices and the types of optical modes that can be excited in a metasurface, thereby allowing
novel light matter interactions. Here we present a metallo-dielectric hybrid metasurface design
consisting of a high-index dielectric (silicon) nanodisk array on top of a metal layer (aluminium)
separated by a buffer oxide (silica) layer. The dimensions of the nanodisks are tuned to support
anapole states and the period of the nanodisk array is designed to excite surface plasmon polariton
(SPP) at the metal-buffer oxide interface. The physical dimensions of the Si nanodisk and the array
periods are optimized to excite the anapole and the SPP at normal incidence of light in the visible-NIR
(400-900 nm) wavelength range. Finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations show that, when
the nanodisk grating is placed at a specific height (~200 nm) from the metal surface, the two modes
strongly couple at zero detuning of the resonances. The strong coupling is evident from the avoided
crossing of the modes observed in the reflectance spectra and in the spectral profile of light absorption
inside the Si nanodisk. A vacuum Rabi splitting of up to ~ 129 meV is achievable by optimizing the diameters
of Si nanodisk and the nanodisk array grating period. The proposed metasurface design is promising
to realize open cavity strongly coupled optical systems operating at room temperatures.

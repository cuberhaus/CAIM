In this research, we extend the universal reinforcement learning (URL) agent models of artificial
general intelligence to quantum environments. The utility function of a classical exploratory
stochastic Knowledge Seeking Agent, KL-KSA, is generalized to distance measures from quantum
information theory on density matrices. Quantum process tomography (QPT) algorithms form the
tractable subset of programs for modeling environmental dynamics. The optimal QPT policy is selected
based on a mutable cost function based on algorithmic complexity as well as computational resource
complexity. Instead of Turing machines, we estimate the cost metrics on a high-level language to
allow realistic experimentation. The entire agent design is encapsulated in a self-replicating
quine which mutates the cost function based on the predictive value of the optimal policy choosing
scheme. Thus, multiple agents with pareto-optimal QPT policies evolve using genetic programming,
mimicking the development of physical theories each with different resource trade-offs. This
formal framework is termed Quantum Knowledge Seeking Agent (QKSA). Despite its importance, few
quantum reinforcement learning models exist in contrast to the current thrust in quantum machine
learning. QKSA is the first proposal for a framework that resembles the classical URL models. Similar
to how AIXI-tl is a resource-bounded active version of Solomonoff universal induction, QKSA is
a resource-bounded participatory observer framework to the recently proposed algorithmic information-based
reconstruction of quantum mechanics. QKSA can be applied for simulating and studying aspects of
quantum information theory. Specifically, we demonstrate that it can be used to accelerate quantum
variational algorithms which include tomographic reconstruction as its integral subroutine.

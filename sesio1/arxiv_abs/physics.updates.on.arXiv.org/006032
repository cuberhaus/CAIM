In this paper, we report the first observation of complete mitigation of thermoacoustic instability
in a bluff-body stabilized turbulent combustor through the method of self-coupling. Self-coupling
is achieved by coupling the acoustic field of the combustor to itself through a coupling tube. We
characterize the effects of such acoustic self-feedback on the thermoacoustic instability of
the system by varying the length and diameter of the coupling tube. We observe that the amplitude
and the dominant frequency of the acoustic pressure fluctuations gradually decrease as the length
of the coupling tube is increased. A complete suppression of thermoacoustic instability is observed
when the coupling tube length is nearly 1.5 times the combustor length. Meanwhile, as we approach
the suppression of thermoacoustic instability, the dynamical behavior of acoustic pressure changes
from the state of limit cycle oscillations to low amplitude aperiodic oscillations via intermittency.
We also study the coupling between the acoustic field and the unsteady flame dynamics for different
conditions of self-coupling in the combustor. As the combustor approaches the state of complete
suppression, the temporal synchrony between the acoustic pressure and the global heat release
rate signals changes from the state of synchronized periodicity to desynchronized aperiodicity
through intermittent synchronization. From the spatiotemporal analysis of the combustor flow
field, we find complete disruption of the coherent spatial structures of acoustic energy production
observed during the state of thermoacoustic instability when the combustor is self-coupled with
a tube of optimized size. Thus, we anticipate self-coupling to be a viable option to mitigate high
amplitude thermoacoustic oscillations in turbulent combustion systems present in gas turbines
and rocket engines.

The quantum interference occurring between two indistinguishable photons impinging on the two
input faces of a beam-splitter can be exploited for a range of applications, from quantum optical
coherence tomography, to quantum metrology including time intervals measurements. In the latter,
recent advances managed to reach a resolution in the estimation of the delay between the two photons
of the order of attoseconds, i.e. in the nanometer scale. Unfortunately, these techniques are highly
affected in the estimation precision by any experimental distinguishability between the photons
at the detectors. Here, we perform an analysis of the precision achievable in the estimation of the
delay between two independent photons interfering at a beam-splitter when frequency-resolved
measurements are employed. Remarkably, we show that the observation of the spectra of the photons
at the output ports when coincidence and bunching events are recorded, largely enhance the precision
of the estimation for any degree of distinguishability between the photons at the detectors. In
particular, we find that such scheme is effective also for temporal delays much larger than the coherence
time of each photons, a regime in which standard two-photon interferometers or spectral analyses
at the single-photon level, do not provide any information. Furthermore, we show that by increasing
the bandwidth of the photons it is possible to further increase quadratically the precision in the
estimation, differently from non-resolved two-photon interference where the precision degrades
for large bandwidth values. Therefore, such estimation scheme with frequency-resolving detectors
allows to substantially enhance the precision of measurements of time delays. Relevant applications
can range form the characterization of two-dimensional nanomaterials to the analysis of biological
samples, including DNA and cell membranes.

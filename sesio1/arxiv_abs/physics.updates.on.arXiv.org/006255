Purpose: To develop a voxel-based radiomics image analysis workflow and to characterize regional
pulmonary function on CT images using a radiomic filtering approach. Methods: We developed a radiomic
filtering technique to capture the spatially-encoded regional pulmonary ventilation information
on CT. The lung volumes were first segmented on 46 CT images. Then, a 3D sliding window kernel was implemented
to map the impulse response of radiomic features across the lung volume. Specifically, 53 radiomic
feature maps were extracted to capture spatially encoded information, resulting in a 4th order
tensor object. Accordingly, each voxel coordinate is represented as a 53-dimensional feature
vector, and each image is represented as an image tensor that we refer to as a 3D, rotationally-invariant
feature map. To test the technique as a potential biomarker of pulmonary function, the radiomic
feature maps were compared to paired functional images (Galligas PET or DTPA-SPECT) of lung ventilation.
Results: Two features were found to be highly correlated with functional imaging based on Spearman
correlation (r) analysis. In particular, the radiomic feature maps GLRLM-based Run-Length Non-uniformity
and GLCOM-based Sum Average achieved robust high correlation across 46 patients for both Galligas
PET and DTPA-SPECT functional imaging, with a median r value [range] of 0.46 [0.05, 0.67] and 0.45
[0.21, 0.65], respectively. Conclusions: Our data provide evidence that local regions of sparsely
encoded homogenous lung parenchyma on CT are associated with diminished radiotracer uptake and
measured lung ventilation defects on PET/SPECT imaging. Our results are comparable to other CT-based
pulmonary function estimation techniques. These findings demonstrate the potential of radiomics
to serve as a noninvasive surrogate of regional lung function and provide hypothesis-generating
data for future studies.

A large eddy simulation wall model is developed based on a formal interpretation of quasi-equilibrium
that governs the momentum balance integrated in the wall-normal direction. The model substitutes
the law-of-the-wall velocity profile for a smooth surface into the wall-normal integrated momentum
balance, leading to a Lagrangian relaxation towards equilibrium (LaRTE) transport equation for
the friction velocity vector $\mathbf{u}_\tau(x,z,t)$. This partial differential equation
includes a relaxation timescale governing the rate at which the wall stress can respond to imposed
fluctuations due to the inertia of the fluid layer from the wall to the wall-model height. A-priori
tests based on channel flow direct numerical simulation (DNS) data show that the identified relaxation
timescale ensures self-consistency with assumed quasi-equilibrium conditions. The new approach
enables us to formally distinguish quasi-equilibrium from additional, non-equilibrium contributions
to the wall stress. A particular model for non-equilibrium contributions is derived, motivated
by laminar Stokes layer dynamics in the viscous sublayer when applying fast varying pressure gradients.
The new wall modeling approach is first tested in standard equilibrium channel flow in order to document
various properties of the approach. The model is then applied in LES of channel flow with a suddenly
applied spanwise pressure gradient (SSPG). The resulting mean wall stress evolution is compared
to DNS with good agreement. At the onset of the SSPG, the laminar Stokes layer develops rapidly while
the LaRTE portion of the stress has a delayed response due to its inherent relaxation dynamics. Results
also highlight open challenges such as modeling the response of near-wall turbulence occurring
above the viscous sublayer and at timescales faster than quasi-equilibrium conditions.

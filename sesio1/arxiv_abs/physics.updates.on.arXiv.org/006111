Jin (Phys. Fluids, vol. 31, 2019, p. 125102) proposed a new turbulence simulation method which shows
better performance than other classic turbulence models. It is composed of a small-eddy-dissipation
mixing length (SED-ML) model for calculating the reference solution and a parameter extension
method for correcting the solution. The mechanism of this method is more deeply analyzed in this
study to find out how to develop a turbulence model with a high accuracy and a low computational cost.
The turbulent channel flows with Re_tau=821 and 2003 and decaying homogenous and isotropic turbulence
are simulated to demonstrate how the new turbulence simulation method works. The small-eddy-dissipation
(SED) mechanism for developing turbulence models has been proposed through our analysis. According
to this mechanism, the model solution is an asymptotic approximation of the exact solution of the
Navier-Stokes equations. The modeling term introduces an artificial dissipation which dissipates
small eddies. The purpose of turbulence modeling is to dissipate more small eddies without changing
the statistical solution qualitatively. We expect more small eddies can be dissipated where the
turbulence is stronger. This mechanism is different from RANS which approximates the Reynolds
stresses and LES which approximates the sub-grid-scale (SGS) motions, while it interprets the
physics of turbulence modeling more precisely. A modified mixing length with two damping functions
is developed to identify the characteristic length of turbulence, leading to the SED-ML model.
The simulation accuracy can be further improved using a linear extension. Our numerical results
show that the SED-ML model is in accordance with the SED mechanism. This might explain why the new
method is more accurate than RANS while it requires a lower computational cost than LES.

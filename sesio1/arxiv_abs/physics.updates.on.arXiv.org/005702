The development of high-power density vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) with high energy efficiencies
(EEs) is crucial for the widespread dissemination of this energy storage technology. In this work,
we report the production of novel hierarchical carbonaceous nanomaterials for VRFB electrodes
with high catalytic activity toward the vanadium redox reactions (VO2+/VO2+ and V2+/V3+). The
electrode materials are produced through a rapid (minute timescale) low-pressure combined gas
plasma treatment of graphite felts (GFs) in an inductively coupled radio frequency reactor. By
systematically studying the effects of either pure gases (O2 and N2) or their combination at different
gas plasma pressures, the electrodes are optimized to reduce their kinetic polarization for the
VRFB redox reactions. To further enhance the catalytic surface area of the electrodes, single-/few-layer
graphene, produced by highly scalable wet-jet milling exfoliation of graphite, is incorporated
into the GFs through an infiltration method in the presence of a polymeric binder. Depending on the
thickness of the proton-exchange membrane (Nafion 115 or Nafion XL), our optimized VRFB configurations
can efficiently operate within a wide range of charge/discharge current densities, exhibiting
energy efficiencies up to 93.9%, 90.8%, 88.3%, 85.6%, 77.6%, and 69.5% at 25, 50, 75, 100, 200, and
300 mA cm-2, respectively. Our technology is cost-competitive when compared to commercial ones
(additional electrode costs < 100 euro m-2) and shows EEs rivalling the record-high values reported
for efficient systems to date. Our work remarks on the importance to study modified plasma conditions
or plasma methods alternative to those reported previously (e.g., atmospheric plasmas) to improve
further the electrode performances of the current VRFB systems.

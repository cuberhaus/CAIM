Generating scientific and technological knowledge and converting them into innovations which
are of added value to society are key instruments for a society economic growth and development.
As outstanding as these capabilities are for other regions in the world, Africa science, innovation,
education and research infrastructure, particularly in fundamental and applied physics, have
over the years been under valued and under resourced. To efficiently address the scientific and
technological gaps with the rest of the world, Africa stance needs radical overhaul. With the big
ambition to drive a community wide effort in Africa, the African Strategy for Fundamental and Applied
Physics (ASFAP) was founded. The aspiration is to demonstrate the physics potential benefits for
African society and how physics can contribute to the technological infrastructure development
and to provide trained personnel needed to take advantage of scientific advances. The vision consists
in fostering scientific literacy driven by physics based technologies and their impact for economic
growth, including other sciences that draw heavily on advances in physics. In addition to developing
and enhancing collaborations and partnerships among Africans in national, regional, and Pan African
organizations. This should assist to tackle the challenges that Africans struggle and prioritize
educational and research resources, innovation and development. The ASFAP initiative could present
a unique opportunity of overcoming the complexity of the African social and economic challenges,
if Africa needs to have and maintain its position as a coleader in the global scientific process and
reap the consequent socioeconomic benefits. ASFAP will take a few years with a final report to notify
the African policymakers and broader communities.

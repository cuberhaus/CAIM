Quantitative measures of dopamine transporter (DaT) uptake in caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus
(GP) have potential as biomarkers for measuring the severity of Parkinson disease. Reliable quantification
of this uptake requires accurate segmentation of the considered regions. However, segmentation
of these regions from DaT-SPECT images is challenging, a major reason being partial-volume effects
(PVEs), which arise from the limited system resolution and reconstruction of images over finite-sized
voxel grids. The latter leads to tissue-fraction effects (TFEs). Thus, there is an important need
for methods that can account for the PVEs, including the TFEs, and accurately segment DaT-SPECT
images. The purpose of this study is to design and objectively evaluate a fully automated tissue-fraction
estimation-based segmentation method that segments the caudate, putamen, and GP from DaT-SPECT
images. The proposed method estimates the posterior mean of the fractional volumes occupied by
the caudate, putamen, and GP within each voxel of a 3-D DaT-SPECT image. The estimate is obtained
by minimizing a cost function based on the binary cross-entropy loss between the true and estimated
fractional volumes over a population of SPECT images. Evaluations using clinically guided highly
realistic simulation studies show that the proposed method accurately segmented the caudate,
putamen, and GP with high mean Dice similarity coefficients ~ 0.80 and significantly outperformed
(p < 0.01) all other considered segmentation methods. Further, objective evaluation of the proposed
method on the task of quantifying regional uptake shows that the method yielded reliable quantification
with low ensemble normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) < 20% for all the considered regions.
The results motivate further evaluation of the method with physical-phantom and patient studies.

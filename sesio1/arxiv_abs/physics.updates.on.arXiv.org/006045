When considering the optimal molecular packing to realize charge multiplication in organic photovoltaic
materials, subtle changes in intermolecular charge transfer (CT) coupling can strongly modulate
singlet fission. To understand why certain packing morphologies are more conducive to charge multiplication
by triplet pair (TT) formation, we measure the diffraction-limited transient absorption (TA)
response from four single-crystal functionalized derivatives of fluorinated anthradithiophene:
diF R-ADT (R = TES, TSBS, TDMS, TBDMS). diF TES-ADT and diF TDMS-ADT both exhibit 2D brickwork packing
structures, diF TSBS-ADT adopts a 1D sandwich-herringbone packing structure, and diF TBDMS-ADT
exhibits a 1D twisted-columnar packing structure. When brickwork or twisted-columnar single
crystals are resonantly probed parallel to their charge transfer (CT)-axis projections, the TA
signal is dominated by a rising component on the picosecond timescale (rate $k_{TT}$) attributed
to TT state population. When probed orthogonal to the CT-axis, we instead recover the falling TA
kinetics of singlet state depletion at rate, $k_{A}$. The rising to falling rate ratio estimates
the TT formation efficiency, $\epsilon_{TT}$ = $k_{TT}/k_A$ relative to exciton self-trapping.
$\epsilon_{TT}$ ranged from near unity in diF TES-ADT to 84% in diF TDMS-ADT. Interestingly, diF
TSBS-ADT crystals only manifest falling kinetics of CT-mediated self-trapping and singlet state
depletion. Singlet fission is prohibitive in diF TSBS-ADT crystals owing to its lower symmetry
sandwich herringbone packing that leads to $S_1$ to CT-state energy separation that is ~3x larger
than in other packings. Collectively, these results highlight optimal packing configurations
that either enhance or completely suppress CT-mediated TT-pair formation.

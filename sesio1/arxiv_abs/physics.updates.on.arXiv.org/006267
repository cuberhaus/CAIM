Terrestrial locomotion requires generating appropriate ground reaction forces which depend
on substrate geometry and physical properties. The richness of positions and orientations of terrain
features in the 3-D world gives limbless animals like snakes that can bend their body versatility
to generate forces from different contact areas for propulsion. Despite many previous studies
of how snakes use lateral body bending for propulsion on relatively flat surfaces with lateral contact
points, little is known about whether and how much snakes use vertical body bending in combination
with lateral bending in 3-D terrain. This lack had contributed to snake robots being inferior to
animals in stability, efficiency, and versatility when traversing complex 3-D environments.
Here, to begin to elucidate this, we studied how the generalist corn snake traversed an uneven arena
of blocks of random height variation 5 times its body height. The animal traversed the uneven terrain
with perfect stability by propagating 3-D bending down its body with little transverse motion (11{\deg}
slip angle). Although the animal preferred moving through valleys with higher neighboring blocks,
it did not prefer lateral bending. Among body-terrain contact regions that potentially provide
propulsion, 52% were formed by vertical body bending and 48% by lateral bending. The combination
of vertical and lateral bending may dramatically expand the sources of propulsive forces available
to limbless locomotors by utilizing various asperities available in 3-D terrain. Direct measurements
of contact forces are necessary to further understand how snakes coordinate 3-D bending along the
entire body via sensory feedback to propel through 3-D terrain. These studies will open a path to
new propulsive mechanisms for snake robots, potentially increasing the performance and versatility
in 3-D terrain.

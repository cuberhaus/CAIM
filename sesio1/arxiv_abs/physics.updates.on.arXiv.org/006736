Liquid-liquid segmented flows in microchannels have been extensively investigated in the context
of nanoparticle synthesis. The enhanced mixing in the slugs results in monodispersed particles.
Earlier studies have focused on Organic-Aqueous Systems (OAS). The nanoparticles synthesized
in the presence of organic solutions have limited applications. An alternative green route for
the synthesis can be developed using an Aqueous Two-Phase System (ATPS). These systems are characterized
by interfacial tensions, which are two orders of magnitude lower than typical organic aqueous systems.
In this work, flow patterns and hydrodynamics of ATPS are investigated as a first step. Polyethylene
glycol -trisodium citrate system was chosen as ATPS. The objective of this work is to see if any new
physics arises in an ATPS system. The low interfacial tension results in high Capillary numbers
(Ca >> 3) in a microfluidic system. Consequently, the flow observed here is parallel or core-annular.
However, in a millichannel, the capillary number becomes lower (Ca << 1) for an ATPS system. In this
work, experiments were carried out in a millichannel to span different flow patterns. The pattern
formation was analyzed and classified into three categories, i.e., slug flow (interfacial tension
dominated), transition flow, and core annular flow (inertia dominated). Flow regime maps based
on the Reynolds number, Capillary number, and Weber number of each phase were found to be qualitatively
similar to those of OAS. Simulations were performed for various interfacial tension values. An
interfacial tension value of 1.25x10-4 N/m was found to yield slug sizes which fitted well with the
experimental data. Film thickness was measured experimentally and with simulations compared
favorably with the correlations available in the literature for OAS.

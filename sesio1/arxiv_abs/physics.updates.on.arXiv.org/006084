Laser-produced plasmas (LPPs) engulf exotic and complex conditions ranging in temperature, density,
pressure, magnetic and electric fields, charge states, charged particle kinetics, and gas-phase
reactions, based on the irradiation conditions, target geometries, and the background cover gas.
The application potential of the LPP is so diverse that it generates considerable interest for both
basic and applied research areas. Although most of the traditional characterization techniques
developed for other plasma sources can be used to characterize the LPPs, care must be taken to interpret
the results because of their small size, transient nature, and inhomogeneities. The existence
of the large spatiotemporal density and temperature gradients often necessitates non-uniform
weighted averaging over distance and time. Among the various plasma characterization tools, optical-based
diagnostic tools play a key role in the accurate measurements of LPP parameters. The optical toolbox
contains optical probing methods (Thomson scattering, shadowgraphy, Schlieren, interferometry,
velocimetry, and deflectometry), optical spectroscopy (emission, absorption, and fluorescence),
and passive and active imaging. Each technique is useful for measuring a specific property, and
its use is limited to a certain time span during the LPP evolution because of the sensitivity issues
related to the selected measuring tool. Therefore, multiple diagnostic tools are essential for
a comprehensive insight into the entire plasma behavior. In recent times, the improvements in performance
in the lasers and detector systems expanded the capability of the aforementioned passive and active
diagnostics tools. This review provides an overview of optical diagnostic tools frequently employed
for the characterization of the LPPs and emphasizes techniques, associated assumptions, and challenges.

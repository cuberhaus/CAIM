Errors in the representation of clouds in convection-permitting numerical weather prediction
models can be introduced by different sources. These can be the forcing and boundary conditions,
the representation of orography, the accuracy of the numerical schemes determining the evolution
of humidity and temperature, but large contributions are due to the parametrization of microphysics
and the parametrization of processes in the surface and boundary layers. These schemes typically
contain several tunable parameters that are either not physical or only crudely known, leading
to model errors. Traditionally, the numerical values of these model parameters are chosen by manual
model tuning. More objectively, they can be estimated from observations by the augmented state
approach during the data assimilation. Alternatively, in this work, we look at the problem of parameter
estimation through an artificial intelligence lens by training two types of artificial neural
networks (ANNs) to estimate several parameters of the one-dimensional modified shallow-water
model as a function of the observations or analysis of the atmospheric state. Through perfect model
experiments, we show that Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) and Bayesian approximations of point
estimate neural networks (NNs) are able to estimate model parameters and their relevant statistics.
The estimation of parameters combined with data assimilation for the state decreases the initial
state errors even when assimilating sparse and noisy observations. The sensitivity to the number
of ensemble members, observation coverage, and neural network size is shown. Additionally, we
use the method of layer-wise relevance propagation to gain insight into how the ANNs are learning
and discover that they naturally select only a few gridpoints that are subject to strong winds and
rain to make their predictions of chosen parameters.

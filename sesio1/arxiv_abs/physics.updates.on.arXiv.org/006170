Single-shot Coherent Diffraction Imaging (CDI) is a powerful approach to characterize the structure
and dynamics of isolated nanoscale objects such as single viruses, aerosols, nanocrystals or droplets.
Using X-ray wavelengths, the diffraction images in CDI experiments usually cover only small scattering
angles of few degrees. These small-angle patterns represent the magnitude of the Fourier transform
of the two-dimensional projection of the sample's electron density, which can be reconstructed
efficiently but lacks any depth information. In cases where the diffracted signal can be measured
up to scattering angles exceeding 10 degrees, i.e. in the wide-angle regime, three-dimensional
morphological information of the target is contained in a single-shot diffraction pattern. However,
the extraction of the 3D structural information is no longer straightforward and defines the key
challenge in wide-angle CDI. So far, the most convenient approach relies on iterative forward fitting
of the scattering pattern using scattering simulations. Here we present the Scatman, an approximate
and fast numerical tool for the simulation and iterative fitting of wide-angle scattering images
of isolated samples. Furthermore, we publish and describe in detail our Open Source software implementation
of the Scatman algorithm, PyScatman. The Scatman approach yields quantitative results for weakly
scattering samples. PyScatman is capable of computing wide-angle scattering patterns in few milliseconds
even on consumer-level computing hardware. The high computational efficiency of PyScatman enables
effective data analysis based on model fitting, thus representing an important step towards a systematic
application of 3D Coherent Diffraction Imaging from single wide-angle diffraction patterns in
various scientific communities.

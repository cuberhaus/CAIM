Objective: Soft-tissue sarcoma spreads preferentially along muscle fibers. We explore the utility
of deriving muscle fiber orientations from diffusion tensor MRI (DT-MRI) for defining the boundary
of the clinical target volume in muscle tissue. Approach: We recruited eight healthy volunteers
to acquire MR images of the left and right thigh. The imaging session consisted of (a) two MRI spin-echo-based
scans, T1- and T2-weighted; (b) a diffusion weighted (DW) spin-echo-based scan using an echo planar
acquisition with fat suppression. The thigh muscles were auto-segmented using CNN. DT-MRI data
was used as a geometry encoding input to solve the anisotropic Eikonal equation with Hamiltonian
Fast-Marching method. The isosurfaces of the solution modeled the CTV boundary. Main results:
The auto-segmented muscles of the thigh agreed with manually delineated with the Dice score ranging
from 0.8 to 0.94 for different muscles. Anisotropy of the isosurfaces was compared across muscles
with different anatomical orientations within a thigh, between muscles in left and right thighs
of each subject, and between different subjects. Analysis showed a high degree of consistency across
all comparisons. The distance from the GTV to the isosurface and the eigenvalues ratio are two controlling
parameters for the extent and shape of the CTV. Significance: Our feasibility study with healthy
volunteers shows the promise of using muscle fiber orientations derived from diffusion weighted
MRI data for automated generation of anisotropic CTV boundary in soft tissue sarcoma. Our contribution
is significant as it is expected to lead to the improvements in the treatment outcomes of soft-tissue
sarcoma patients undergoing radiotherapy and decrease amputation rate for a subset of patients.
We expect such improvements to have a strong positive impact for the cancer centers with small volume
of sarcoma patients.

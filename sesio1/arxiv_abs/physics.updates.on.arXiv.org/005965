Scalar transport (e.g. heat or chemical species) in laminar flows is key to many industrial activities
and fluid stirring by flow reorientation is a common way to enhance this process. However, "How best
to stir?" remains a major challenge. This study aims to contribute to existing solutions by the development
of a dedicated flow-control strategy for the fast heating of a cold fluid via a hot boundary in a representative
case study. Fluid deformation acts as the "thermal actuator" via which the flow affects heat transfer
yet this may both enhance and diminish heat exchange between fluid parcels and thus restricts the
beneficial impact of flow. Moreover, the impact of fluid deformation on the global fluid heating
is primarily confined to the proximity of the moving boundary that drives the flow. These insights
make incorporation of thermal behaviour essential for effective flow-based enhancement strategies
and expose fluid mixing, the conventional approach in industry, as potentially sub-optimal. The
notion that global heating encompasses two concurrent processes, i.e. increasing energy content
and thermal homogenisation, yields the relevant metrics for the formulation of the control problem
as the minimisation of a dedicated cost function. This facilitates step-wise determination of
the "best" flow reorientation from predicted future evolutions of actual intermediate states
and thereby paves the way to (real-time) regulation of scalar transport by flow control. Performance
analyses reveal that this "adaptive flow reorientation" significantly accelerates fluid heating
and thus is superior to conventional periodic schemes (designed for efficient fluid mixing) both
in consistency and effectiveness. The controller in fact never selects these periodic schemes
and achieves the same superior performance for all flow conditions irrespective of whether said
mixing occurs.

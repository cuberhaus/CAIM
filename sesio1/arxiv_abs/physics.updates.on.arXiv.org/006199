A transparent linear magneto-dielectric material in free space that is illuminated by a finite
quasimonochromatic field is a thermodynamically closed system, definitively, regardless of
what field and material subsystems that one defines. The energy--momentum tensor that is formally
derived from the Maxwell--Minkowski field equations is inconsistent with both angular and linear
momentum conservation in this closed system; this very solid fact is the foundational and continuing
issue of the Abraham--Minkowski controversy. The extant resolution of the Abraham--Minkowski
dilemma is to treat Maxwellian continuum electrodynamics as being a subsystem and to write the total
energy--momentum tensor as the sum of a Maxwellian electromagnetic subsystem energy--momentum
tensor and a phenomenological material subsystem energy--momentum tensor. We prove that fundamental
principles of physics are violated by Maxwellian continuum electrodynamics and that fundamental
principles of physics are violated by Maxwellian continuum electrodynamics supplemented by the
material subsystem conjecture. We use field theory to derive legitimate equations for macroscopic
electromagnetic fields in a transparent linear magneto-dielectric medium. The new field equations
are a part of a self-consistent formulation of macroscopic electrodynamics, conservation laws,
special relativity, and invariance in a continuous linear medium. In the new formulation, the temporal
and spatial coordinates are renormalized by the continuous linear medium instead of the permittivity
and permeability being carried as independent material parameters. Then an isotropic, homogeneous,
flat, four-dimensional, continuous, linear, non-Minkowski spacetime is the proper setting for
the continuum electrodynamics of a simple linear medium in which the effective speed of light is
$c/n$ and each medium will be associated with a different spacetime.

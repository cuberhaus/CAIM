Electrochemical oxidation-reduction of radicals is a green and environmentally friendly approach
to generating fuels. These reactions, however, suffer from sluggish kinetics due to a low local
concentration of radicals around the electrocatalyst. A large electrode potential can enhance
the fuel generation efficiency via enhancing the radical concentration around the electrocatalyst
sites, but this comes at the cost of electricity. Here, we report about a 45 percent saving in energy
to achieve an electrochemical hydrogen generation rate of 10 mA per cm2 through localized electric
field-induced enhancement in the reagent concentration (LEFIRC) at laser-induced periodic surface
structured (LIPSS) electrodes. The finite element model is used to simulate the spatial distribution
of the electric field to understand the effects of LIPSS geometric parameters in field localization.
When the LIPSS patterned electrodes are used as substrates to support Pt-C and RuO2 electrocatalysts,
the overpotentials for HER and OER are decreased by 40 and 25 percent, respectively. Moreover, the
capability of the LIPSS-patterned electrodes to operate at significantly reduced energy is also
demonstrated in a range of electrolytes including alkaline, acidic, neutral, and seawater. Importantly,
when two LIPSS patterned electrodes were assembled as the anode and cathode into a cell, it requires
330 mVs of lower electric potential with enhanced stability over a similar cell made of pristine
electrodes to drive a current density of 10 mA/cm2. This work demonstrates a physical and versatile
approach of electrode surface patterning to boost electrocatalytic fuel generation performance
and can be applied to any metal and semiconductor catalysts for a range of electrochemical reactions.

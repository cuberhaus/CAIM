The effects of external forcing on a turbulent, liquid-fuelled, swirl-stabilized gas turbine
combustor operating at a pressure of approximately 1 MPa are explored experimentally. In particular,
the dynamics and coupling between the hydrodynamics, heat release rate and acoustics are compared
for various forcing amplitudes at a fixed forcing frequency $f_f$. The hydrodynamics were characterized
via laser Mie scattering from droplets in the fuel spray, while the heat release rate was qualitatively
measured using chemiluminescence (CL) emissions in the 312 $\pm$ 12.5 nm wavelength range, both
at 10 kHz. The dynamics at the frequencies of interest were extracted using spectral proper orthogonal
decomposition (SPOD). In the unforced case, the spray and CL oscillations exhibited similar dynamics,
dominated by oscillations at frequency $f_0$, whereas the pressure fluctuations were predominantly
at $f_P$. As the forcing amplitude was increased from zero, the spray and CL exhibited changes in
their power spectra characteristic of the suppression route to synchronization. The pressure
fluctuations, however, were observed to follow the phase-locking route to synchronization. In
contrast with expectations from synchronization theory, the amplitude of the pressure fluctuations
increased significantly not only after lock-on, but also as the frequency detuning with $f_f$ decreased.
It is shown that this increase in amplitude is not due to intermittency in the frequency of the pressure
oscillations. The simultaneous occurrence of phase-locking and suppression illustrates the
rich variety of dynamics that can occur in practical combustor systems. In addition, the amplification
of the pressure oscillations based on the frequency detuning with the forcing suggests that classical
reasoning based on the Rayleigh Index may not be sufficient to understand the high amplitude behaviour
of multimodal systems.

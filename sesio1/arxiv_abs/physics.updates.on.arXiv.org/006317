A discrete-module-finite element (DMFE) based hydroelasticity method has been proposed and well
developed. Firstly, a freely floating flexible structure is discretized into several macro-submodules
in two horizontal directions to perform a multi-rigid-body hydrodynamic analysis. Each macro-submodule
is then abstracted to a lumped mass at the center of gravity that bears the external forces including
inertia force, hydrodynamic force and hydrostatic force. Apart from external forces, all lumped
masses are also subjected to structural forces that reflect the structural deformation features
of the original flexible structure. The key to calculating the structural forces is derivation
of the equivalent overall structural stiffness matrix with respect to the displacements of all
lumped masses, which is tackled following the finite element procedure. More specifically, each
macro-submodule is discretized into a number of microelements to derive the corresponding structural
stiffness matrix, which is manipulated to a new one including only the nodes at the position of the
lumped masses and surrounding boundaries by using the substructure approach, and subsequently
the target overall stiffness matrix is obtained by combining together all macro-submodules. Finally,
based on equivalence between external and structural forces, the DMFE method establishes the hydroelastic
equation on all lumped masses with their displacements as unknown variables. Solving the equation
gives the displacement response of all lumped masses. Displacement and structural force responses
are first calculated on the interfaces of every two adjacent macro-submodules, after which at any
given position of the flexible structure, the recovery of displacement is based on the structural
stiffness matrix of the corresponding macro-submodule and the recovery of structural force uses
the spline interpolation scheme.

The thermo-fluidic transport characteristics of ferrofluids can be influenced by the application
of a magnetic field. The magnetic manipulations of ferrofluids have been useful in augmenting heat
transfer, as evident from recent investigations. In the present study, we examine a novel strategy
for augmenting two-phase heat transfer and show that the magnetic manipulation of non-boiling
Taylor bubble flow (TBF) of ferrofluids can provide on-demand augmentation. In an earlier investigation
(DOI:10.1016/j.colsurfa.2020.124589), we had shown that the characteristics of the TBF of ferrofluids
could be altered through external magnetic manipulations. As transport characteristics of TBFs
primarily depend on their flow morphology, it was anticipated that such alteration would affect
their thermal transport characteristics, which are examined in the present work. The generation
of smaller bubbles and unit-cells through magnetic manipulations decreases the void fraction
of the resulting TBF. In addition, a greater number of units participated in the heat exchange process
compared to larger bubble-slug systems at any time instance. Such flow modifications cause considerable
augmentation (which can go up to 100%) in two-phase heat transfer. The extent of augmentation depends
on the applied magnetic field and induced magnetic force, homogeneous gas fraction, liquid film
thickness/void fraction and flow morphology of the resulting TBF, which are examined in the present
study. The application of ferrofluids in TBFs provides multiple benefits, such as suspension of
nanoparticles with better thermal properties and additional functionality of the flow manipulations
through external means. The proposed application with the suggested manipulation technique provides
an effective alternative for an on-demand augmentation in two-phase heat transfer in low Reynolds
number flows.

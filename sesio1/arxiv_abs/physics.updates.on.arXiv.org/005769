We have synthesized MoS$_{2}$ incorporated $\alpha$-Fe$_{2}$O$_{3}$/ZnO nanocomposites by
the hydrothermal process. The effect of incorporating ultrasonically exfoliated MoS$_{2}$ on
the photocatalytic performance of $\alpha$-Fe$_{2}$O$_{3}$/ZnO nanocomposites has been demonstrated.
Structural, morphological and optical characteristics of the nanomaterials are investigated
by performing Rietveld refinement of powder X-ray diffraction patterns, field emission scanning
electron microscopy and UV-visible spectroscopy. The photoluminescence spectra of the nanocomposites
show that the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs is suppressed due to incorporating
MoS$_{2}$ nanosheets. The ultrasonicated MoS$_{2}$ incorporated $\alpha$-Fe$_{2}$O$_{3}$/ZnO
nanocomposite shows 91% and 83% efficiency to degrade RhB dye and antibiotic ciprofloxacin under
solar illumination. Active species trapping experiments reveal that the hydroxyl radicals play
a significant role in RhB degradation. Likewise, the dye degradation efficiency, the amount of
hydrogen produced by this nanocomposite via photocatalytic water splitting is also higher as compared
to non-ultrasonicated MoS$_{2}$ incorporated $\alpha$-Fe$_{2}$O$_{3}$/ZnO and $\alpha$-Fe$_{2}$O$_{3}$/ZnO
nanocomposites as well as Degussa P25 titania nanoparticles. This indicates the promising potential
of the incorporation of ultrasonicated MoS$_{2}$ with $\alpha$-Fe$_{2}$O$_{3}$/ZnO nanocomposite
for generation of carbon-free hydrogen by water splitting. The substantial increase in the photocatalytic
efficiency of $\alpha$-Fe$_{2}$O$_{3}$/ZnO after incorporation of ultrasonicated MoS$_{2}$
can be attributed to its favorable band structure, large surface to volume ratio, effective segregation
and migration of photogenerated electron-hole pairs at the interface of heterojunction and the
active edge sites provided by few-layer MoS$_{2}$ nanosheets.

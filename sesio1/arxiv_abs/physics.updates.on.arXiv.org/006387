A molecule of dimension 125nm has caused around 479 Million human infections (80M for the USA) & 6.1
Million human deaths (977,000 for the USA) worldwide and slashed the global economy by US$ 8.5 Trillion
over two years. The only other events in recent history that caused comparative human life loss through
direct usage (either by (wo)man or nature, respectively) of structure-property relations of 'nano-structures'
(either (wo)man-made or nature, respectively) were nuclear bomb attacks of Japanese cities by
the USA during World War II and 1918 Flu Pandemic. This molecule is SARS-CoV-2, which causes a disease
known as COVID-19. The high liability cost of the pandemic had incentivized various private, government,
and academic entities to work towards finding a cure for these & emerging diseases. As result, multiple
vaccine candidates are discovered to avoid the infection in first place. But so far, there has been
no success in finding fully effective therapeutics candidates. In this paper, we attempted to provide
multiple therapy candidates based upon a sophisticated multi-scale in-silico framework. We have
used the following robust framework to screen the ligands; Step-I: high throughput docking, Step-II:
molecular dynamics, Step-III: density functional theory analysis. In total, we have analyzed
2.2 Million unique protein binding site/ligand combinations. The proteins were selected based
on recent experimental studies. Step-I had filtered that number down to 10 ligands/protein based
on molecular docking binding energy, further screening down to 2 ligands/protein based on drug-likeness
analysis. Additionally, these two ligands/proteins were investigated in Step-II with a molecular
dynamic based RMSD analysis. It finally suggested three ligands (ZINC1176619532, ZINC517580540,
ZINC952855827) attacking different binding sites of the protein(7BV2), which were further analyzed
in Step III.

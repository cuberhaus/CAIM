Climate change is predicted to lead to major changes in terrestrial ecosystems. However, significant
differences in climate model projections for given scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions, continue
to hinder detailed assessment. Here we show, using a traditional Koppen-Geiger bioclimate classification
system, that the latest CMIP6 Earth System Models actually agree very well on the fraction of the
global land-surface that will undergo a significant change per degree of global warming. Data from
historical and ssp585 model runs are used to create bioclimate maps at various degrees of global
warming, and to investigate the performance of the ensemble mean when classifying climate data
into discrete categories. Using a streamlined scheme with 13 classifications, global bioclimate
classification maps at 2K and 4K of global warming above a 1901-1931 reference period are presented.
These projections show large shifts in bioclimate distribution, with an almost exclusive change
from colder, wetter bioclimates to hotter, dryer ones. Historical model run performance is assessed
and examined by comparison with the bioclimatic classifications derived from the observed climate
over the same time period. The fraction of the land experiencing a change in its bioclimatic class
as a function of global warming is estimated by combining the results from the individual models.
Despite the discrete nature of the bioclimatic classification scheme, we find only a weakly-saturating
dependence of this fraction on global warming which implies about 12 pct of land experiencing a significant
change in climate, per 1K increase in global mean temperature between the global warming levels
of 1 and 3K. Therefore, we estimate that stabilising the climate at 1.5K rather than 2K of global warming,
would save over 7 million square kilometres of land from a major bioclimatic change.

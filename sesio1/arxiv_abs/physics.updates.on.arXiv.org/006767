Electromagnetic (EM) instabilities and turbulence driven by the electron-temperature gradient
are considered in a local slab model of a tokamak-like plasma. The model describes perturbations
at scales both larger and smaller than the flux-freezing scale $d_e$, and so captures both electrostatic
and EM regimes of turbulence. The well-known electrostatic instabilities -- slab and curvature-mediated
ETG -- are recovered, and a new instability is found in the EM regime, called the Thermo-Alfv\'enic
instability (TAI). It exists in both a slab version (sTAI, destabilising kinetic Alfv\'en waves)
and a curvature-mediated version (cTAI), which is a cousin of the (electron-scale) kinetic ballooning
mode (KBM). The cTAI turns out to be dominant at the largest scales covered by the model (greater than
$d_e$ but smaller than $\rho_i$), its physical mechanism hinging on the fast equalisation of the
total temperature along perturbed magnetic field lines (in contrast to KBM, which is pressure balanced).
A turbulent cascade theory is then constructed, with two energy-injection scales: $d_e$, where
the drivers are slab ETG and sTAI, and a larger (parallel system size dependent) scale, where the
driver is cTAI. The latter dominates the turbulent transport if the temperature gradient is greater
than a certain critical value, which scales inversely with the electron beta. The resulting heat
flux scales more steeply with the temperature gradient than that due to electrostatic ETG turbulence,
giving rise to stiffer transport. This can be viewed as a physical argument in favour of near-marginal
steady-state in electron-transport-controlled plasmas (e.g., the pedestal). While the model
is simplistic, the new physics that is revealed by it should be of interest to those attempting to
model the effect of EM turbulence in tokamak-relevant configurations with high beta and large electron
temperature gradients.

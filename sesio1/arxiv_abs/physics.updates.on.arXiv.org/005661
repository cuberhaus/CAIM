We show that the integral cross sections for state-to-state quantum scattering of cold molecules
in a magnetic field can be efficiently computed using the total angular momentum representation
despite the presence of unphysical Zeeman states in the eigenspectrum of the asymptotic Hamiltonian.
We demonstrate that the unphysical states arise due to the incompleteness of the space-fixed total
angular momentum basis caused by using a fixed cutoff value $J_\text{max}$ for the total angular
momentum of the collision complex $J$. As a result, certain orbital angular momentum ($l$) basis
states lack the full range of $J$ values required by the angular momentum addition rules, resulting
in the appearance of unphysical states. We find that by augmenting the basis with a full range of $J$-states
for every $l$, it is possible to completely eliminate the unphysical states from quantum scattering
calculations on molecular collisions in external fields. To illustrate the procedure, we use the
augmented basis sets to calculate the state-to-state cross sections for rotational and spin relaxation
in cold collisions of $^{40}$CaH$(X^2\Sigma^+,v=0,N=1, M_N=1, M_S=1/2)$ molecules with $^4$He
atoms in a magnetic field. We find excellent agreement with benchmark calculations, validating
our proposed procedure. We find that $N$-conserving spin relaxation to the lowest-energy Zeeman
state of the $N=1$ manifold, $|11\frac{1}{2}\rangle\to |1-1-\frac{1}{2}\rangle$ is nearly
completely suppressed due to the lack of spin-rotation coupling between the fully spin-stretched
Zeeman states. Our results demonstrate the possibility of rigorous, computationally efficient,
and unphysical state-free quantum scattering calculations on cold molecular collisions in an
external magnetic field.

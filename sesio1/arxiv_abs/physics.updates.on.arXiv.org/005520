We study the classical electrodynamics of extended bodies. Currently, there is no self-consistent
dynamical theory of such bodies in the literature. Electromagnetic energy-momentum is not conserved
in the presence of charge and some addition is required. The only somewhat suitable addition found
to date are point charges. These suffer from infinite self-energy, requiring some renormalization
procedure, and perturbative methods to account for radiation. We review the history that has led
to the understanding of these facts. We then investigate possible self-consistent, non-point-charge,
classical electrodynamic theories. We start with a Lagrangian consisting only of the Ricci scalar
(gravity) and the standard electromagnetic field Lagrangian, and consider additions other than
point charges and their associated interaction Lagrangian. Including quadratic terms in the Lagrangian
involving first-order derivatives of the electromagnetic field tensor provides sufficient stress-energy
terms to allow for conservation of energy-momentum. There are three such independent terms: a direct
current-current interaction and two curvature-mediated (non-minimally coupled), short-range
interactions, one of which changes sign under a parity transformation. These could be interpreted
as non-electromagnetic, short-range forces. For the simplest possible theory, with only the metric
and the electromagnetic potential 1-form as independent fields, we find a single, stable, spherical
(spin-0) solution, which due to an integrable singularity at the solution's center, has quantized
mass and charge. Its charge is smaller than numeric error, and its mass is set by a new constant in the
Lagrangian. It has a small, central core of charge surrounded by a wave of alternatingly charged,
spherical shells, where the amplitude of the charge density wave is inversely proportional to the
radial coordinate.

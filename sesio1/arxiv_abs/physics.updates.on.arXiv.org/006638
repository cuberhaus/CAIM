Long term observation of temporal Earth's gravity field with enhanced temporal and spatial resolution
is a major objective for future satellite gravity missions. Improving the performance of the accelerometers
present in such missions is one of the main path to explore. In this context, we propose to study an
original concept of a hybrid accelerometer associating a state-of-the-art electrostatic accelerometer
(EA) and a promising quantum sensor based on cold atom interferometry. To assess the performance
potential of such instrument, numerical simulations have been performed to determine its impact
in term of gravity field retrieval. Taking advantage of the long term stability of the cold atom interferometer
(CAI), it has been shown that the reduced drift of the hybrid sensor could lead to improved gravity
field retrieval. Nevertheless this gain vanishes once temporal variations of the gravity field
and related aliasing effects are taken into account. Improved de-aliasing models or some specific
satellite constellations are then required to maximize the impact of the accelerometer performance
gain. To evaluate the achievable acceleration performance in orbit, a numerical simulator of the
hybrid accelerometer has been developed and preliminary results are given. The instrument simulator
has been in part validated by reproducing the performance achieved with a hybrid lab prototype operating
on ground. The problematic of satellite rotation impact on the CAI has been also investigated both
with instrument performance simulations and experimental demonstrations. It has been shown that
the proposed configuration, where the EA's proof-mass acts as the reference mirror for the CAI,
seems a promising approach to allow the mitigation of satellite rotation. A preliminary design
has been elaborated along with a preliminary error, mass, volume and electrical power consumption
budget.

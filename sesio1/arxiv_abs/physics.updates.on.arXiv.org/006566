The $GW$-Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) method is promising for calculating the low-lying excited
states of molecular systems. However, so far it has only been applied to rather small molecules,
and in the commonly implemented diagonal approximations to the electronic self-energy it depends
on a mean-field starting point. We describe here an implementation of the self-consistent and starting-point
independent quasiparticle self-consistent (qs$GW$)-BSE approach which is suitable for calculations
on large molecules. We herein show that self-consistency in the eigenvalues only leads to an unfaithful
description of certain excitonic states for Chlorophyll dimers while the qs$GW$-BSE excitation
energies are in excellent agreement with experiment. We use the new implementation to calculate
the lowest excitation energies of the six chromophores of the photosystem II (PSII) reaction center
(RC) with nearly 2000 correlated electrons in total. Primary charge separation in the PSII RC occurs
along the D1 branch via initial formation of Chl\textsubscript{D1}\textsuperscript{+} -Pheo\textsubscript{D1}\textsuperscript{-}
and subsequent hole transfer leading to P\textsubscript{D1}\textsuperscript{+} -Pheo\textsubscript{D1}\textsuperscript{-}.
We find the Chl\textsubscript{D1}\textsuperscript{+} -P\textsubscript{D1}\textsuperscript{-}
charge transfer (CT) state to be lowest excited state, but do not observe the Chl\textsubscript{D1}\textsuperscript{+}
-Pheo\textsubscript{D1}\textsuperscript{-} CT state at low energy. This is most likely to the
neglect of the protein environment. Notwithstanding this discrepancy, our results are in closer
agreement to experiment than the ones of previous calculations based on range-separated hybrid
kernels which only predicted local excitations among the lowest excited states of the PSII RC.

Upgrading the SuperKEKB electron-positron collider with polarized electron beams opens a new
program of precision physics at a center-of-mass energy of 10.58 GeV. This white paper describes
the physics potential of this `Chiral Belle' program. It includes projections for precision measurements
of $\sin^2\theta_W$ that can be obtained from independent left-right asymmetry measurements
of $e^+e^-$ transitions to pairs of electrons, muons, taus, charm and b-quarks. The $\sin^2\theta_W$
precision obtainable at SuperKEKB will match that of the LEP/SLC world average, but at the centre-of-mass
energy of 10.58 GeV. Measurements of the couplings for muons, charm, and $b$-quarks will be substantially
improved and the existing $3\sigma$ discrepancy between the SLC $A_{LR}$ and LEP $A_{FB}^b$ measurements
will be addressed. Precision measurements of neutral current universality will be more than an
order of magnitude more precise than currently available. As the energy scale is well away from the
$Z^0$-pole, the precision measurements will have sensitivity to the presence of a parity-violating
dark sector gauge boson, $Z_{\rm dark}$. The program also enables the measurement of the anomalous
magnetic moment $g-2$ form factor of the $\tau$ to be made at an unprecedented level of precision.
A precision of $10^{-5}$ level is accessible with 40~ab$^{-1}$ and with more data it would start
to approach the $10^{-6}$ level. This technique would provide the most precise information from
the third generation about potential new physics explanations of the muon $g-2$ $4\sigma$ anomaly.
Additional $\tau$ and QCD physics programs enabled or enhanced with having polarized electron
beams are also discussed in this White Paper. This paper includes a summary of the path forward in
R&D and next steps required to implement this upgrade and access its exciting discovery potential.

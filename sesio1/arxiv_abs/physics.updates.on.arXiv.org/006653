Objective: Knowledge based planning (KBP) typically involves training an end-to-end deep learning
model to predict dose distributions. However, training end-to-end KBP methods may be associated
with practical limitations due to the limited size of medical datasets that are often used. To address
these limitations, we propose a content based image retrieval (CBIR) method for retrieving dose
distributions of previously planned patients based on anatomical similarity. Approach: Our proposed
CBIR method trains a representation model that produces latent space embeddings of a patient's
anatomical information. The latent space embeddings of new patients are then compared against
those of previous patients in a database for image retrieval of dose distributions. Summary metrics
(e.g. dose-volume histogram, conformity index, homogeneity index, etc.) are computed and can
then be utilized in subsequent automated planning. All source code for this project is available
on github. Main Results: The retrieval performance of various CBIR methods is evaluated on a dataset
consisting of both publicly available plans and clinical plans from our institution. This study
compares various encoding methods, ranging from simple autoencoders to more recent Siamese networks
like SimSiam, and the best performance was observed for the multitask Siamese network. Significance:
Applying CBIR to inform subsequent treatment planning potentially addresses many limitations
associated with end-to-end KBP. Our current results demonstrate that excellent image retrieval
performance can be obtained through slight changes to previously developed Siamese networks.
We hope to integrate CBIR into automated planning workflow in future works, potentially through
methods like the MetaPlanner framework.

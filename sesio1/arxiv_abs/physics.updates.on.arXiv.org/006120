Carbon, the fourth most abundant element in the Universe forms a metallic fluid with transient covalent
bonds on melting. Its liquid-liquid phase transitions, intensely sought using simulations had
been elusive. Here we use density functional theory (DFT) simulations with up to 108 atoms using
molecular dynamics, as well as one-atom DFT as implemented in the neutral pseudo-atom method where
multi-atom effects are treated by ion-ion correlation functionals. Both methods use electron-electron
exchange correlation functionals for electron many-body effects. Here we show using both methods,
that liquid carbon displays multiple liquid-liquid transitions linked to changes in coordination
number in the density range 3 g/cm$^3$, to $\sim$ 6 g/cm$^3$ when a coordination number of 12 is reached.
The transitions disappear by 4 eV in temperature. The calculated pressures and transition densities
are shown to be sensitive to the exchange-correlation functionals used. Significantly, we find
that a simple metallic model yields the structure factors and thermodynamics with quantitative
accuracy, without invoking any covalent-bonding features. The ion-ion structure factor for these
densities and temperatures is found to have a subpeak tied to twice the Fermi wavevector, constraining
the fluid in momentum space. The dominant Friedel oscillations forming the pair interactions correlate
the ions and drive the multiple liquid-liquid phase transitions. Our results suggest that liquid
carbon typifies a class of fluids whose structure is ordered by the long-range Friedel oscillations
in the pair-potentials. These results are critical to terrestrial and astrophysical studies,
inertial fusion using carbon drivers, refined shock experiments, and in seeking new carbon-based
materials.

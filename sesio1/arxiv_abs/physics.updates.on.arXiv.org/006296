The threat of global warming and the demand for reliable climate predictions pose a formidable challenge
being the climate system multiscale, high-dimensional and nonlinear. Spatiotemporal recurrences
of the system hint to the presence of a low-dimensional manifold containing the high-dimensional
climate trajectory that could make the problem more tractable. Here we argue that reproducing the
geometrical and topological properties of the low-dimensional attractor should be a key target
for models used in climate projections. In doing so, we propose a general data-driven framework
to characterize the climate attractor and showcase it in the tropical Pacific ocean using a reanalysis
as observational proxy and two state-of-the-art models. The analysis spans four variables simultaneously
over the periods 1979-2019 and 2060-2100. At each time t, the system can be uniquely described by
a state space vector parameterized by N variables and their spatial variability. The dynamics is
confined on a manifold with dimension lower than the full state space that we characterize through
manifold learning algorithms, both linear and nonlinear. The local geometry and local stability
of the high-dimensional, multi-variable climate attractor are quantified through the local dimension
and persistence metrics. Model biases that hamper climate predictability are identified and found
to be similar in the multivariate attractor of the two models during the historical period while
diverging under the warming scenario considered. Finally, the relationships between different
sub-spaces (univariate fields), and therefore among climate variables, are evaluated. The proposed
framework provides a comprehensive, physically based, test for assessing climate feedbacks and
opens new avenues for improving their model representation.

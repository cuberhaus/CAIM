Proton therapy systems without a gantry can be more compact and less expensive in terms of capital
cost, and therefore more available to a larger patient population. Would the advances in pencil
beam scanning and robotics make gantry-less treatment possible? In this study, we explore if high-quality
treatment plans can be obtained without a gantry. We recently showed that proton treatments with
the patient in an upright position may be feasible with a new soft robotic immobilization device
and imaging which enables multiple possible patient orientations during a treatment. In this study,
we evaluate if this new treatment geometry could enable high quality treatment plans without a gantry.
We created pencil beam scanning (PBS) treatment plans for seven patients with head-and-neck or
brain tumors. Each patient was planned with two scenarios: one with a gantry with the patient in supine
position and the other with a gantry-less fixed horizontal beam-line with the patient sitting upright.
For the treatment plans, dose-volume-histograms (DVHs), target homogeneity index (HI), mean
dose, D_2 and D_98 are reported. A robustness analysis of one plan was performed with +/-2.5 mm setup
errors and +/-3.5% range uncertainties with nine scenarios. Most of the PBS-gantry-less plans
had similar target HI and OAR mean dose as compared to PBS-gantry plans, and similar robustness with
respect to range uncertainties and setup errors. Pencil beam scanning provides sufficient power
to deliver high quality treatment plans without requiring a gantry for head-and-neck or brain tumors.
In combination with the development of the new positioning and immobilization methods required
to support this treatment geometry, this work suggests the feasibility of further development
of a compact proton therapy system with a fixed horizontal beam-line to treat patients in sitting
and reclined positions.

Rideshare is one way to share mobility in transportation without increasing traffic demand, where
travel mobility and usage of vehicle capacity can be improved. However, current literature on rideshare
has allowed only one-modal trips and may be limited in the matching efficiency, especially when
there is a large gap between the supply and demand of mobility. Therefore, the objectives of this
paper are first to develop a multi-modal matching framework of shared mobility with public transportation
to maximize the performance of a rideshare system, and second to evaluate the effect of the public
transportation and of the schedule flexibility on the matching efficiency. To fulfill the first
objective, a multi-modal matching framework is developed to allow rideshare with both private
and public vehicles with detailed design of detour, using Genetic Algorithm. Also for the second
objective, the effects of public transportation and schedule flexibility are evaluated with a
simplified network of Sioux Falls. The results show that public transportation helps the match
rate slightly at a low supply of private vehicle, but this must be evaluated for practical implementation
as different cities may bring different results. Also, a larger schedule flexibility helps greatly
in increasing match rate even at a lower supply level. As well, the planning subject of time schedule
is benefited more with larger schedule flexibility, in this paper the drivers, on the matching efficiency.
Moreover, a rideshare system with private vehicles outperforms a public transportation system,
possibly due to the rigid route of public transportation that takes no detour burden. This confirms
the need for a flexible design of sharing mobility, as can be fulfilled with the multi-modal matching
framework developed in this research.

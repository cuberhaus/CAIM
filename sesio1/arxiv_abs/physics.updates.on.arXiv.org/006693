Quantum Chemistry (QC) is one of the most promising applications of Quantum Computing. However,
present quantum processing units (QPUs) are still subject to large errors. Therefore, noisy intermediate-scale
quantum (NISQ) hardware is limited in terms of qubits counts and circuit depths. Specific algorithms
such as Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQEs) can potentially overcome such issues. We introduce
here a novel open-source QC package, denoted Open-VQE, providing tools for using and developing
chemically-inspired adaptive methods derived from Unitary Coupled Cluster (UCC). It facilitates
the development and testing of VQE algorithms. It is able to use the Atos Quantum Learning Machine
(QLM), a general quantum programming framework enabling to write, optimize and simulate quantum
computing programs. Along with Open-VQE, we introduce myQLM-Fermion, a new open-source module
(that includes the key QLM ressources that are important for QC developments (fermionic second
quantization tools etc...). The Open-VQE package extends therefore QLM to QC providing: (i) the
functions to generate the different types of excitations beyond the commonly used UCCSD ans{\"a}tz;(ii)
a new implementation of the "adaptive derivative assembled pseudo-Trotter method" (ADAPT-VQE),
written in simple class structure python codes. Interoperability with other major quantum programming
frameworks is ensured thanks to myQLM, which allows users to easily build their own code and execute
it on existing QPUs. The combined Open-VQE/myQLM-Fermion quantum simulator facilitates the implementation,
tests and developments of variational quantum algorithms towards choosing the best compromise
to run QC computations on present quantum computers while offering the possibility to test large
molecules. We provide extensive benchmarks for several molecules associated to qubit counts ranging
from 4 up to 24.

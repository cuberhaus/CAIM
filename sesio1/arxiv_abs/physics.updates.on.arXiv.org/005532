Electrochemical energy storage is central to modern society -- from consumer electronics to electrified
transportation and the power grid. It is no longer just a convenience but a critical enabler of the
transition to a resilient, low-carbon economy. The large pluralistic battery research and development
community serving these needs has evolved into diverse specialties spanning materials discovery,
battery chemistry, design innovation, scale-up, manufacturing and deployment. Despite the maturity
and the impact of battery science and technology, the data and software practices among these disparate
groups are far behind the state-of-the-art in other fields (e.g. drug discovery), which have enjoyed
significant increases in the rate of innovation. Incremental performance gains and lost research
productivity, which are the consequences, retard innovation and societal progress. Examples
span every field of battery research , from the slow and iterative nature of materials discovery,
to the repeated and time-consuming performance testing of cells and the mitigation of degradation
and failures. The fundamental issue is that modern data science methods require large amounts of
data and the battery community lacks the requisite scalable, standardized data hubs required for
immediate use of these approaches. Lack of uniform data practices is a central barrier to the scale
problem. In this perspective we identify the data- and software-sharing gaps and propose the unifying
principles and tools needed to build a robust community of data hubs, which provide flexible sharing
formats to address diverse needs. The Battery Data Genome is offered as a data-centric initiative
that will enable the transformative acceleration of battery science and technology, and will ultimately
serve as a catalyst to revolutionize our approach to innovation.

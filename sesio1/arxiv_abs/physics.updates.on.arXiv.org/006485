The great success of point defects and dopants in semiconductors for quantum information processing
has invigorated a search for molecules with analogous properties. Flexibility and tunability
of desired properties in a large chemical space have great advantages over solid-state systems.
The properties analogous to point defects were demonstrated in Cr(IV)-based molecular family,
Cr(IV)(aryl)$_4$, where the electronic spin states were optically initialized, read out, and
controlled. Despite this kick-start, there is still a large room for enhancing properties crucial
for molecular qubits. Here we provide computational insights into key properties of the Cr(IV)-based
molecules aimed at assisting chemical design of efficient molecular qubits. Using the multireference
ab-initio methods, we investigate the electronic states of Cr(IV)(aryl)$_4$ molecules with slightly
different ligands, showing that the zero-phonon line energies agree with the experiment, and that
the excited spin-triplet and spin-singlet states are highly sensitive to small chemical perturbations.
By adding spin-orbit interaction, we find that the sign of the uniaxial zero-field splitting (ZFS)
parameter is negative for all considered molecules, and discuss optically-induced spin initialization
via non-radiative intersystem crossing. To understand electron spin decoherence, we quantify
hyperfine coupling to the $^{53}$Cr nuclear spin and to the $^{13}$C and $^1$H nuclear spins. We
show that the splitting or broadening of the electronic spin sub-levels induced by these hyperfine
interactions decreases by an order of magnitude when the molecules have a substantial transverse
ZFS parameter. This feature is applicable to other integer-spin molecules in order to significantly
reduce spin decoherence.

Mechanical properties are essential for understanding natural and induced deformational behavior
of geological formations. Brittleness characterizes energy dissipation rate and strain localization
at failure. Brittleness has been investigated in hydrocarbon-bearing mudrocks in order to quantify
the impact of hydraulic fracturing on the creation of complex fracture networks and surface area
for reservoir drainage. Typical well logging correlations associate brittleness with carbonate
content or dynamic elastic properties. However, an index of rock brittleness should involve actual
rock failure and have a consistent method to quantify it. Here we present a systematic method to quantify
mudrock brittleness based on micro-mechanical measurements from the scratch test. Brittleness
is formulated as the ratio of energy associated with brittle failure to the total energy required
to perform a scratch. Soda lime glass and polycarbonate are used for comparison to identify failure
in brittle and ductile mode and validate the developed method. Scratch testing results on mudrocks
indicate that it is possible to use the recorded transverse force to estimate brittleness. Results
show that tested samples rank as follows in increasing degree of brittleness: Woodford, Eagle Ford,
Marcellus, Mancos, and Vaca Muerta. Eagle Ford samples show mixed ductile/brittle failure characteristics.
There appears to be no definite correlation between micro-scratch brittleness and quartz or total
carbonate content. Dolomite content shows a stronger correlation with brittleness than any other
major mineral group. The scratch brittleness index correlates positively with increasing Young's
modulus and decreasing Poisson's ratio, but shows deviations in rocks with distinct porosity and
with stress-sensitive brittle/ductile behavior (Eagle Ford).

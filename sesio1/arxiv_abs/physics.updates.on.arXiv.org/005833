Finding unequivocal evidence of dark matter interactions in a particle detector is a major objective
of physics research. Liquid argon time projection chambers offer a path to probe Weakly Interacting
Massive Particles scattering cross sections on nucleus down to the so-called neutrino floor, in
a mass range from few GeV's to hundredths of TeV's. Based on the successful operation of the DarkSide-50
detector at LNGS, a new and more sensitive experiment, DarkSide-20k, has been designed and is now
under construction. A thorough understanding of the DarkSide-50 detector response and, therefore,
of all kind of observed events, is essential for an optimal design of the new experiment. In this paper,
we report on a particular set of events, which were not used for dark matter searches. Namely, standard
two-pulse scintillation-ionization signals accompanied by a small amplitude third pulse, originating
from single or few electrons, in a time window of less than a maximum drift time. We compare our findings
to those of a recent paper of the LUX Collaboration (D.S.Akerib et al. Phys.Rev.D 102, 092004). Indeed,
both experiments observe events related to photoionization of the cathode. From the measured rate
of these events, we estimate for the first time the quantum efficiency of the tetraphenyl butadiene
deposited on the DarkSide-50 cathode at wavelengths around 128 nm, in liquid argon. Also, both experiments
observe events likely related to photoionization of impurities in the liquid. The probability
of photoelectron emission per unit length turns out to be one order of magnitude smaller in DarkSide-50
than in LUX. This result, together with the much larger measured electron lifetime, coherently
hints toward a lower concentration of contaminants in DarkSide-50 than in LUX.

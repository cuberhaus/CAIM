This paper provides an accurate theoretical defect energy database for pure and Bi-containing
III-V (III-V:Bi) materials and investigates efficient methods for high-throughput defect calculations
based on corrections of results obtained with local and semi-local functionals. Point defects
as well as nearest-neighbor and second-nearest-neighbor pair defects were investigated in charge
states ranging from -5 to 5. Ga-V:Bi systems (GaP:Bi, GaAs:Bi, and GaSb:Bi) were thoroughly investigated
with significantly slower, higher fidelity hybrid Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) and significantly
faster, lower fidelity local density approximation (LDA) calculations. In both approaches spurious
electrostatic interactions were corrected with the Freysoldt correction. The results were verified
against available experimental results and used to assess the accuracy of a previous band alignment
correction. Here, a modified band alignment method is proposed in order to better predict the HSE
values from the LDA ones. The proposed method allows prediction of defect energies with values that
approximate those from the HSE functional at the computational cost of LDA (about 20x faster for
the systems studied here). Tests of selected point defects in In-V:Bi materials resulted in corrected
LDA values having a mean absolute error (MAE)=0.175 eV for defect levels vs. HSE. The method was further
verified on an external database of defects and impurities in CdX (X=S, Se, Te) systems, yielding
a MAE=0.194 eV. These tests demonstrate the correction to be sufficient for qualitative and semi-quantitative
predictions, and may suggest transferability to many semiconductor systems without significant
loss in accuracy. Properties of the remaining In-V:Bi defects and all Al-V:Bi defects were predicted
with the use of the modified band alignment method.

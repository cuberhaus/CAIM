The Flux Rope in 3D (FRi3D, Isavnin, 2016), a coronal mass ejection (CME) model with global three-dimensional
(3D) geometry, has been implemented in the space weather forecasting tool EUHFORIA (Pomoell and
Poedts, 2018). By incorporating this advanced flux rope model in EUHFORIA, we aim to improve the
modelling of CME flank encounters and, most importantly, the magnetic field predictions at Earth.
After using synthetic events to showcase FRi3D's capabilities of modelling CME flanks, we optimize
the model to run robust simulations of real events and test its predictive capabilities. We perform
observation-based modelling of the halo CME event that erupted on 12 July 2012. The geometrical
input parameters are constrained using the forward modelling tool included in FRi3D with additional
flux rope geometry flexibilities as compared to the pre-existing models. The magnetic field input
parameters are derived using the differential evolution algorithm to fit FRi3D parameters to the
in situ data at 1 AU. An observation-based approach to constrain the density of CMEs is adopted, in
order to achieve a better estimation of mass corresponding to the FRi3D geometry. The CME is evolved
in EUHFORIA's heliospheric domain and a comparison of FRi3D's predictive performance with the
previously implemented spheromak CME in EUHFORIA is presented. For this event, FRi3D improves
the modelling of the total magnetic field magnitude and Bz at Earth by ~30% and ~70%, respectively.
Moreover, we compute the expected geoeffectiveness of the storm at Earth using an empirical Dst
model and find that the FRi3D model improves the predictions of minimum Dst by ~20% as compared to
the spheromak CME model. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the current implementation of FRi3D
in EUHFORIA and propose possible improvements.

The M{\o}ller polarimeter in Hall A at Jefferson Lab in Newport News, VA, has provided reliable measurements
of electron beam polarization for the past two decades reaching the typically required $\pm$1\%
level of absolute uncertainty. However, the upcoming proposed experimental program including
MOLLER and SoLID have stringent requirements on beam polarimetry precision at the level of 0.4\%
\cite{MOLLER2014, SoLID2019}, requiring a systematic re-examination of all the contributing
uncertainties. M{\o}ller polarimetry uses the double polarized scattering asymmetry of a polarized
electron beam on a target with polarized atomic electrons. The target is a ferromagnetic material
magnetized to align the spins in a given direction. In Hall A, the target is a pure iron foil aligned
perpendicular to the beam and magnetized out of plane parallel or antiparallel to the beam direction.
The acceptance of the detector is engineered to collect scattered electrons close to 90$^{\circ}$
in the center of mass frame where the analyzing power is a maximum (-7/9). One of the leading systematic
errors comes from determination of the target foil polarization. Polarization of a magnetically
saturated target foil requires knowledge of both the saturation magnetization and $g^\prime$,
the electron $g$-factor which includes components from both spin and orbital angular momentum
from which the spin fraction of magnetization is determined. This paper utilizes the existing world
data to provide a best estimate for target polarization for both nickel and iron foils including
uncertainties in magnetization, high-field and temperature dependence, and fractional contribution
to magnetization from orbital effects. We determine the foil electron spin polarization at 294~K
to be 0.08020$\pm$0.00018 (@4~T applied field) for iron and 0.018845$\pm0.000053$ (@2~T applied
field) for nickel.

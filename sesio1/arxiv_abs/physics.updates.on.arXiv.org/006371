Fast noninvasive probing of spatially varying decorrelating events, such as cerebral blood flow
beneath the human skull, is an essential task in various scientific and clinical settings. One of
the primary optical techniques used is diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS), whose classical
implementation uses a single or few single-photon detectors, resulting in poor spatial localization
accuracy and relatively low temporal resolution. Here, we propose a technique termed Classifying
Rapid decorrelation Events via Parallelized single photon dEtection (CREPE)}, a new form of DCS
that can probe and classify different decorrelating movements hidden underneath turbid volume
with high sensitivity using parallelized speckle detection from a $32\times32$ pixel SPAD array.
We evaluate our setup by classifying different spatiotemporal-decorrelating patterns hidden
beneath a 5mm tissue-like phantom made with rapidly decorrelating dynamic scattering media. Twelve
multi-mode fibers are used to collect scattered light from different positions on the surface of
the tissue phantom. To validate our setup, we generate perturbed decorrelation patterns by both
a digital micromirror device (DMD) modulated at multi-kilo-hertz rates, as well as a vessel phantom
containing flowing fluid. Along with a deep contrastive learning algorithm that outperforms classic
unsupervised learning methods, we demonstrate our approach can accurately detect and classify
different transient decorrelation events (happening in 0.1-0.4s) underneath turbid scattering
media, without any data labeling. This has the potential to be applied to noninvasively monitor
deep tissue motion patterns, for example identifying normal or abnormal cerebral blood flow events,
at multi-Hertz rates within a compact and static detection probe.

The laser-induced alignment-and-orientation (A&O) dynamics of the prolate symmetric top CH$_3$X
(X = F, Cl, Br, I) molecules is investigated, with particular emphasis on the effect of halogen substitution
on the rotational constants, dipole moments, and polarizabilities of these species, as these quantities
determine the A&O dynamics. Insight into possible control schemes for preferred A&O dynamics of
halogenated molecules and best practices for A&O simulations are provided, as well. It is shown
that for accurate A&O-dynamics simulations it is necessary to employ large basis sets and high levels
of electron correlation when computing the rotational constants, dipole moments, and polarizabilities.
The benchmark-quality values of these molecular parameters, corresponding to the equilibrium,
as well as the vibrationally averaged structures are obtained with the help of the focal-point analysis
(FPA) technique and explicit electronic-structure computations utilizing the gold-standard
CCSD(T) approach, basis sets up to quintuple-zeta quality, core-correlation contributions and,
in particular, relativistic effects for CH$_3$Br and CH$_3$I. It is shown that the different A&O
behavior of the CH$_3$X molecules in the optical regime is mostly caused by the differences in their
polarizability anisotropy, in other terms, the size of the halogen atom. In contrast, the A&O dynamics
of the CH$_3$X series induced by an intense few-cycle THz pulse is mostly governed by changes in the
rotational constants, due to the similar dipole moments of the CH$_3$X molecules. The A&O dynamics
is most sensitive to the $B$ rotational constant: even the difference between its equilibrium and
vibrationally-averaged values results in noticeably different A&O dynamics. The contribution
of rotational states having different symmetry, weighted by nuclear-spin statistics, to the A&O
dynamics is also studied.

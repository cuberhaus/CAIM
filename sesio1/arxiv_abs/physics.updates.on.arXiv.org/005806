Self-organized pattern formation is vital for many biological processes. Mathematical modeling
using reaction-diffusion models has advanced our understanding of how biological systems develop
spatial structures, starting from homogeneity. However, biological processes inherently involve
multiple spatial and temporal scales and transition from one pattern to another over time, rather
than progressing from homogeneity to a pattern. One possibility to deal with multiscale systems
is to use coarse-graining methods that allow the dynamics to be reduced to the relevant degrees of
freedom at large scales. Unfortunately, these approaches have the major disadvantage that the
eliminated scales cannot be reconstructed from the large-scale dynamics and thus one loses the
information about the patterns. Here, we present an approach for mass-conserving reaction-diffusion
systems that overcomes this issue and allows one to reconstruct information about patterns from
the large-scale dynamics. We illustrate our approach by studying the Min protein system, a paradigmatic
model for protein pattern formation. By performing simulations, we first show that the Min system
produces multiscale patterns in a spatially heterogeneous geometry. This prediction is confirmed
experimentally by in vitro reconstitution of the Min system. On the basis of a recently developed
theoretical framework for mass-conserving reaction-diffusion systems, we show that the spatiotemporal
evolution of the total protein densities on large scales reliably predicts the pattern-forming
dynamics. Since conservation laws are inherent in many different physical systems, we believe
that our approach can be generalized and contribute to uncover underlying physical principles
in multiscale pattern-forming systems.

The residential buildings sector is one of the largest electricity consumers worldwide and contributes
disproportionally to peak electricity demand in many regions. Strongly driven by occupant activities
at home, household energy consumption is stochastic and heterogeneous in nature. However, most
residential building energy models applied by industry use homogeneous, deterministic occupant
activity schedules, which work well for predictions of annual energy consumption, but can result
in unrealistic hourly or sub-hourly electric load profiles, with exaggerated or muted peaks. This
mattered less in the past, but the increasing proportion of variable renewable energy generators
in power systems means that representing the heterogeneity and stochasticity of occupant behavior
is crucial for reliable energy planning. This is particularly true for systems that include distributed
energy resources, such as grid-interactive efficient buildings, solar photovoltaics, and battery
storage. This work presents a stochastic occupant behavior simulator that models the energy use
behavior of individual household members. It also presents an integration with a building stock
model to simulate residential building loads more accurately at community, city, state, and national
scales. More specifically, we first employ clustering techniques to identify distinct patterns
of occupant behavior. Then, we combine time-inhomogeneous Markov chain simulations with probabilistic
sampling of event durations to realistically simulate occupant behaviors. This stochastic simulator
is integrated with ResStock, a large-scale residential building stock simulation tool, to demonstrate
the capability of stochastic residential building load modeling at scale. The simulation results
were validated against both American Time Use Survey data and measured end-use electricity data
for accuracy and reliability.

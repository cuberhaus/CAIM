The paradigm of reservoir computing exploits the nonlinear dynamics of a physical reservoir to
perform complex time-series processing tasks such as speech recognition and forecasting. Unlike
other machine-learning approaches, reservoir computing relaxes the need for optimization of
intra-network parameters, and is thus particularly attractive for near-term hardware-efficient
quantum implementations. However, the complete description of practical quantum reservoir computers
requires accounting for their placement in a quantum measurement chain, and its conditional evolution
under measurement. Consequently, training and inference has to be performed using finite samples
from obtained measurement records. Here we describe a framework for reservoir computing with nonlinear
quantum reservoirs under continuous heterodyne measurement. Using an efficient truncated-cumulants
representation of the complete measurement chain enables us to sample stochastic measurement
trajectories from reservoirs of several coupled nonlinear bosonic modes under strong excitation.
This description also offers a mathematical basis to directly compare the computational capabilities
of a given physical reservoir operated across classical and quantum regimes. Applying this framework
to the classification of quantum states of systems that are part of the same measurement chain as
the quantum reservoir computer, we assess and explain measurement-contingent advantages and
disadvantages of reservoir processing in quantum regimes. Our results also identify the vicinity
of bifurcation points as presenting optimal nonlinear processing regimes of an oscillator-based
quantum reservoir. The considered models are directly realizable in modern circuit QED experiments,
while the framework is applicable to more general quantum nonlinear reservoirs.

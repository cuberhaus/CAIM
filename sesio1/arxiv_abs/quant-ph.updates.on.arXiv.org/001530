We consider a quasi-probability distribution of work for the energy-storage device given by the
quantum weight. Specifically, we analyze a trade-off between changes in average energy and changes
in weight's variance, where work is extracted from the coherent and incoherent ergotropy of the
system. Firstly, for non-classical states of a work reservoir, we reveal that extraction of a positive,
coherent ergotropy can be accompanied by a reduction of work fluctuations (quantified by a variance
loss). On the contrary, for semi-classical states (e.g., coherent Gaussian wave packets) or incoherent
operations, a variance gain is always non-negative and given by a quantum average of the work operator.
Secondly, based on the quantum uncertainty principle, we derive a fluctuation-decoherence relation
for a quantum weight, defining a lower bound of its energy dispersion via a dumping function of the
coherent contribution to the system's ergotropy. In particular, it reveals that unlocking ergotropy
from coherences results in high fluctuations, which diverge if a total coherent work is unlocked.
Our results show the qualitative difference between coherent and incoherent work extraction:
The former can decrease the variance, but its absolute value diverges if more and more energy is extracted,
whereas for the latter, the gain is always non-negative, but a total (incoherent) ergotropy can
be extracted with finite work fluctuations. Furthermore, we present our framework in terms of the
introduced quasi-probability distribution, which has a physical interpretation of its cumulants,
is free from the invasive nature of measurements, and reduces to the two-point measurement scheme
(TPM) for incoherent states. Finally, we analytically solve the work-variance trade-off for a
qubit, explicitly revealing all the above quantum and classical regimes.

Here, we study a minimal model, the three-level V system coupled to two heat baths, and investigate
the role of quantum coherences in heat transport in both the transient regime and in the nonequilibrium
steady-state. In our model, energy is exchanged between the baths through two parallel pathways,
which can be made distinct through the nondegeneracy of excited levels (energy splitting $\Delta$)
and a control parameter $\alpha$, which adjusts the strength of one of the arms. Using a nonsecular
quantum master equation of Redfield form, we succeed in deriving closed-form expressions for the
quantum coherences and the heat current in the steady state limit for closely degenerate excited
levels. By including three ingredients in our analysis: nonequilibrium baths, nondegeneracy
of levels, and asymmetry of pathways, we show that quantum coherences are generated and sustained
in the V model in the steady-state limit if three conditions, conjoining thermal and coherent effects
are simultaneously met: (i) The two baths are held at different temperatures. (ii) Bath-induced
pathways do not interfere destructively. (iii) Thermal rates do not mingle with the control parameter
$\alpha$ to destroy interferences through an effective local equilibrium condition. We find that
coherences are maximized when the heat current is suppressed. On the other hand, the secular Redfield
quantum master equation is shown to fail in a broad range of parameters. Although we mainly focus
on analytical results in the steady state limit, numerical simulations reveal that the transient
behavior of coherences contrasts the steady-state limit, suggesting that different mechanisms
are at play in these two regimes. Enhancing either the lifetime of transient coherences or their
magnitude at steady state thus requires the control and optimization of different physical parameters.

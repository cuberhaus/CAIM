Photons entangled in their position-momentum degrees of freedom (DoFs) serve as an elegant manifestation
of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox, while also enhancing quantum technologies for communication,
imaging, and computation. The multi-mode nature of photons generated in parametric downconversion
has inspired a new generation of experiments on high-dimensional entanglement, ranging from complete
quantum state teleportation to exotic multi-partite entanglement. However, precise characterisation
of the underlying position-momentum state is notoriously difficult due to limitations in detector
technology, resulting in a slow and inaccurate reconstruction riddled with noise. Furthermore,
theoretical models for the generated two-photon state often forgo the importance of the measurement
system, resulting in a discrepancy between theory and experiment. Here we formalise a description
of the two-photon wavefunction in the spatial domain, referred to as the collected joint-transverse-momentum-amplitude
(JTMA), which incorporates both the generation and measurement system involved. We go on to propose
and demonstrate a practical and efficient method to accurately reconstruct the collected JTMA
using a simple phase-step scan known as the $2D\pi$-measurement. Finally, we discuss how precise
knowledge of the collected JTMA enables us to generate tailored high-dimensional entangled states
that maximise discrete-variable entanglement measures such as entanglement-of-formation or
entanglement dimensionality, and optimise critical experimental parameters such as photon heralding
efficiency. By accurately and efficiently characterising photonic position-momentum entanglement,
our results unlock its full potential for discrete-variable quantum information science and lay
the groundwork for future quantum technologies based on multi-mode entanglement.

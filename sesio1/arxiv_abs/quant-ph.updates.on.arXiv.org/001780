Our near-term quantum computers have been built as intermediate-scale quantum devices and are
fragile against quantum noise effects, namely, NISQ devices. Traditional quantum-error-correcting
(QEC) codes are not implemented on such devices and to perform quantum computation in good accuracy
with these machines we need to develop alternative approaches for mitigating quantum computational
errors. In this work, we propose quantum error mitigation (QEM) scheme for quantum computational
errors which occur due to couplings with environments during gate operations, i.e., decoherence.
To establish our QEM scheme, first we estimate the quantum noise effects on single-qubit states
and represent them as groups of quantum circuits, namely, quantum-noise-effect circuit groups.
Then our QEM scheme is conducted by subtracting expectation values generated by the quantum-noise-effect
circuit groups from that obtained by the quantum circuit for the quantum algorithm under consideration.
As a result, the quantum noise effect is reduced, and we obtain approximately the ideal expectation
values via the quantum-noise-effect circuit group and the number of elementary quantum circuits
composing it scales polynomial with respect to the product of the depth of quantum algorithm and
the number of register bits. To numerically demonstrate the validity of our QEM scheme, we run noisy
quantum simulations of qubits under the amplitude damping (AD) effects for four types of quantum
algorithms. Our QEM scheme is solely composed of quantum-computational operations (quantum gates
and measurements), and thus, it can be conducted by any type of quantum device without having limitations
on the number of register bits and error rates of quantum gates. In addition, it can be applied to error
mitigation for many other types of quantum noise effects as well as noisy quantum computing of long-depth
quantum algorithms.

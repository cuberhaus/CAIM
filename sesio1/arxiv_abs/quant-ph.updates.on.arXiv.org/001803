We propose dynamical collapse models in which the stochastic collapse terms affect only photons
and/or gravitons. In principle, isolated systems comprising only massive particles could evolve
unitarily indefinitely in such models. In practice, since photons and gravitons are ubiquitous
and scatter from massive particles, dynamical collapses of the former will effectively induce
collapses of the latter. In non-relativistic models in which particle number is conserved and interactions
are modelled by classical potentials, massive systems can be modelled as collections of elementary
massive particles bound by potentials, interacting with an environment of photons and gravitons.
In this picture, although the photon and/or graviton collapse dynamics effectively localize massive
systems, these collapses take the effective form of approximate measurements on the environment
whose effect on the massive systems is indirect. We argue that these environmental collapse models,
like standard mass-dependent spontaneous localisation models, may be consistent with quantum
experiments on microscopic systems while predicting very rapid effective collapse of macroscopic
massive systems, and hence a potential solution to the quantum measurement problem. However, the
models considered here have different experimental signatures from standard mass-dependent
spontaneous localisation models. For example, they predict no deviations from standard quantum
interferometry for mesoscopic systems of massive particles isolated from a decohering environment,
nor do they predict anomalous spontaneous emission of radiation from isolated matter of the type
prediction by standard mass-dependent spontaneous localization models. New experiments and
analyses are required to obtain empirical bounds on the decoherence rate in our models.

Ultrashort laser pulses are widely used for transient field-free molecular orientation -- a phenomenon
important in chemical reaction dynamics, ultrafast molecular imaging, high harmonics generation,
and attosecond science. However, significant molecular orientation usually requires rotationally
cold molecules, like in rarified molecular beams, because chaotic thermal motion is detrimental
to the orientation process. Here we propose to use the mechanism of the echo phenomenon previously
observed in hadron accelerators, free-electron lasers, and laser-excited molecules to overcome
the destructive thermal effects and achieve efficient field-free molecular orientation at high
temperatures. In our scheme, a linearly polarized short laser pulse transforms a broad thermal
distribution in the molecular rotational phase space into many separated narrow filaments due
to the nonlinear phase mixing during the post-pulse free evolution. Molecular subgroups belonging
to individual filaments have much-reduced dispersion of angular velocities. They are rotationally
cold, and a subsequent moderate terahertz (THz) pulse can easily orient them. The overall enhanced
orientation of the molecular gas is achieved with some delay, in the course of the echo process combining
the contributions of different filaments. Our results demonstrate that the echo-enhanced orientation
is an order of magnitude higher than that of the THz pulse alone. The mechanism is robust -- it applies
to different types of molecules, and the degree of orientation is relatively insensitive to the
temperature. The laser and THz pulses used in the scheme are readily available, allowing quick experimental
demonstration and testing in various applications. Breaking the phase space to individual filaments
to overcome hindering thermal conditions may find a wide range of applications beyond molecular
orientation.

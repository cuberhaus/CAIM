Quantum complementarity and entanglement are fundamental features of Quantum Mechanics. The
purity of a bipartite quantum state $|\Psi\rangle_{AB}$ was shown to imply in complete complementarity
relations for the quanton $A$ or $B$. These triality equalities involve quantum coherence $C(\rho_{A})$,
the wave aspect of a quanton, and quantum predictability $P(\rho_{A})$ and quantum entanglement
$E(|\Psi\rangle_{AB})$, the particle aspect of a quanton. Recently, we reported a resource theory
for quantum predictability, which quantifies the "path" information from the knowledge of the
quanton's density matrix. In this article, we give an operational interpretation to predictability
in entanglement swapping from initially partially entangled states. Entanglement swapping is
an essential primitive for quantum communication where one starts with two pairs of entangled qubits
and makes a Bell-basis measurement (BBM) on one qubit from each pair, ending up maximally entangling
the other two qubits, that possibly have never interacted directly. Here we start by noticing that
there is a plethora of partially entangled states as well as maximally entangled states that can
be obtained after a BBM. Then, we show that the predictability of the pre-measurement one-qubit
density matrix is directly related to the probability of the partially entangled component of the
post-measurement state. Going even further, we analyze the entanglement swapping for partially
entangled states in the light of complementarity relations and show that, in the cases where the
entanglement increases after the BBM, the predictability is consumed when compared to the initially
prepared state. Moreover, the triality relations will always remain valid before and after the
BBM, which means the we have a interplay between predictability and entanglement before and after
the BBM.

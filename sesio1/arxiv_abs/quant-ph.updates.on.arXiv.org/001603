The spin-vortex-induced loop current (SVILC) is a nano-sized loop current predicted to exist in
the CuO$_2$ plane in the bulk of hole-doped cuprate superconductors. It is a persistent loop current
protected by the topological winding number associated with the wave function. It exists around
a spin-vortex created by the itinerant electrons with a doped hole at its center. The direction of
each SVILC can be either clockwise (winding number is -1) or counterclockwise (winding number is
+1) and the winding number with no current (winding number is zero) is forbidden by the singlevalued
requirement of the wave function with respect to the electron coordinates. Recently, it has been
demonstrated, theoretically, that this degree-of-freedom can be used for qubits. Coupling of
neighboring qubits by external current feeding is confirmed to be realizable. This means that nano-sized
couplers of SVILC qubits using feeding external currents are realizable. The size of couplers of
SVILC qubits can be conparable or smaller than that of trapped ion qubits. Couper size of SVILC qubits
is decided by the range of spin vortices in CuO$_2$ plane and current distribution, thus, this is
tunable by feeding external current and substituting Cu atoms in barrier atoms. That of trapped
ion qubits is limited by the distance that combined vibration occurs or laser range with respect
to the coordinates. In the present work, We demonstrated splitting energy levels by external feeding
current of three qubit system of SVILC qubits. This means that nano-sized qubit differentiator
can be realized, and noise by static magnetic field can be cut off, and this may enable the realizing
fully-fault tolerant quantum computers by SVILC qubits. Moreover, the possibility of downscaling
of them is shown.

In their recent paper, Lambare and Franco correctly claim that Bell deterministic model and inequalities
may be derived using only local causality, perfect correlations and measurement independence,
without talking about joint probabilities. However, measurement independence, as we explain,
should not be called no-conspiracy or freedom of choice. Measurement independence should be called
noncontextuality, because it allows implementing random variables, describing incompatible
random experiments, on a unique probability space, on which they are jointly distributed. Using
a precise terminology proposed by Dzhafarov and Kujala in the Contextuality by Default approach
, such implementation defines a probabilistic coupling, which we explain in this paper. The frequentists
proof of inequalities fails, if this probabilistic coupling and joint probabilities do not exist.
We construct also a probabilistic coupling for their counterexample to prove, that there is no contradiction
with Fine Theorem. Nobody questions Bell Theorem logical consistency and nobody claims that Fine
disproved Bell Theorem. Various metaphysical assumptions, such as local realism, classicality
or counterfactual definiteness may motivate a choice of a probabilistic model. However, once a
model is chosen, its meaning and its implications may only be discussed rigorously in a probabilistic
framework. Bell inequalities are violated in various Bell Tests; for us it proves that hidden variables
depend on settings confirming contextual character of quantum observables and an active role played
by measuring instruments. Bell was a realist, thus he thought that he had to choose between nonlocality
and super-determinism. From two bad choices he chose nonlocality. Today he would probably choose

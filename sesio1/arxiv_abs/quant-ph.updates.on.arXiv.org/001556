Portfolio optimization is an essential use case in Finance, but its computational complexity forces
financial institutions to resort to approximated solutions, which are still time consuming. Thus,
the scientific community is looking at how Quantum Computing can be used for efficient and accurate
portfolio optimization. Portfolio optimization can be formulated as a quadratic program, with
the cost function enforcing risk minimization for a targeted return. Of particular interest is
the mean-variance portfolio optimization problem. Using the method of Lagrange multipliers,
the program can be converted into a system of linear equations and potentially benefit from the exponential
speedup provided by the HHL quantum algorithm. However, multiple components in HHL are unsuitable
for execution on Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware. This paper introduces NISQ-HHL,
the first hybrid formulation of HHL suitable for the end-to-end execution of small-scale portfolio-optimization
problems on NISQ devices. NISQ-HHL extends the hybrid HHL variant with newly available quantum-hardware
features: mid-circuit measurement, Quantum Conditional Logic (QCL), and qubit reset and reuse.
To best of our knowledge, NISQ-HHL is the first algorithm incorporating a QCL-enhanced version
of Phase Estimation that was executed on real hardware. In addition, NISQ-HHL includes a novel method
for choosing the optimal evolution time for the Hamiltonian simulation. Although this paper focuses
on portfolio optimization, the techniques it proposes to make HHL more scalable are generally applicable
to any problem that can be solved via HHL in the NISQ era. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness
of NISQ-HHL by presenting the experimental results we obtained on a real quantum device, the trapped-ion
Honeywell System Model H1.

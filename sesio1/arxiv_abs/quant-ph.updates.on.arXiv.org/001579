Surface code error correction offers a highly promising pathway to achieve scalable fault-tolerant
quantum computing. When operated as stabiliser codes, surface code computations consist of a syndrome
decoding step where measured stabiliser operators are used to determine appropriate corrections
for errors in physical qubits. Decoding algorithms have undergone substantial development, with
recent work incorporating machine learning (ML) techniques. Despite promising initial results,
the ML-based syndrome decoders are still limited to small scale demonstrations with low latency
and are incapable of handling surface codes with boundary conditions and various shapes needed
for lattice surgery and braiding. Here, we report the development of an artificial neural network
(ANN) based scalable and fast syndrome decoder capable of decoding surface codes of arbitrary shape
and size with data qubits suffering from a variety of noise models including depolarising errors,
biased noise, and spatially inhomogeneous noise. Based on rigorous training over 50 million random
quantum error instances, our ANN decoder is shown to work with code distances exceeding 1000 (more
than 4 million physical qubits), which is the largest ML-based decoder demonstration to-date.
The established ANN decoder demonstrates an execution time in principle independent of code distance,
implying that its implementation on dedicated hardware could potentially offer surface code decoding
times of O($\mu$sec), commensurate with the experimentally realisable qubit coherence times.
With the anticipated scale-up of quantum processors within the next decade, their augmentation
with a fast and scalable syndrome decoder such as developed in our work is expected to play a decisive
role towards experimental implementation of fault-tolerant quantum information processing.

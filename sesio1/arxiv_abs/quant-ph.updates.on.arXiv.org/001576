We propose schemes to generate N-mode single photon perfect W-state and derive entanglement conditions
to detect the entanglement of all generalized N-mode single photon perfect W-states. These states
are suitable for perfect teleportation and superdense coding over other maximally entangled states
belonging to W-class. Based on the evolution of single photon wave function in scalable integrated
photonic lattices, we present schemes for the preparation of N-mode single photon perfect W-state
at desired propagation distance. The integrated waveguide structures can precisely be fabricated
and offer low photon propagation losses. We consider both planar and ring type waveguide structures
for generation of the N-mode single photon perfect W-state. We derive set of generalized entanglement
detection conditions using sum uncertainty relations of generalized su(2) algebra operators.
We show that any given genuinely entangled N-mode single photon state is a squeezed state of a specific
su(2) algebra operator and can be expressed as superposition of a pair of generalized N-mode single
photon perfect W-states which are eigenstates of that specific su(2) algebra operator. We further
prove that the squeezed states of an su(2) algebra operator satisfy the entanglement condition
obtained using that operator and hence the usefulness of the proposed set of entanglement conditions
to detect the entanglement of genuinely entangled single photon states. Finally, we propose an
experimental scheme to verify the entanglement of generalized N-mode single photon perfect W-states
using an integrated photonic circuit that consists of directional couplers and phase shifters
and show that the same photonic circuit can also be used to generate generalized N-mode single photon
perfect W-states.

After a brief summary of decoherence and quantum to classical transition in cosmology we focus on
the study of quantum decoherence of cosmological perturbations in inflationary universe, that
does not rely on any environment. This is what `intrinsic' in the title refers to -- a closed quantum
system. The question is, does its quantum perturbations decohere with an inflationary expansion
of the universe. A dominant view which had propagated for a quarter of a century asserts yes, based
on the belief that the large squeezing of a quantum state after a duration of inflation renders the
system effectively classical. This paper debunks this view by identifying the technical fault-lines
in its derivations and revealing the pitfalls in its arguments which drew earlier authors to this
wrong conclusion. We use a few simple quantum mechanical models to expound where the fallacy originated:
The highly squeezed ellipse quadrature in phase space cannot be simplified to a line, and the Wigner
function cannot be replaced by a delta function. These amount to taking only the leading order contributions
in seeking the semiclassical limit and ignoring the subdominant contributions where quantum features
reside. Doing so violates the bounds of the Wigner function, and its wave functions possess negative
eigenvalues. Moreover, the Robertson-Schrodinger uncertainty relation for a pure state is violated.
For inflationary cosmological perturbations, in addition to these features, entanglement exists
between the created pairs. This uniquely quantum feature cannot be easily argued away. Indeed it
could be our best hope to retroduce the quantum nature of cosmological perturbations and the trace
of an inflaton field. All this point to the fact that a closed quantum system, even when highly squeezed,
evolves unitarily without loss of coherence; quantum cosmological perturbations do not by itself
decohere.

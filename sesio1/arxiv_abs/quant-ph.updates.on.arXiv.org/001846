We propose a new, unifying framework that yields an array of cryptographic primitives with certified
deletion. These primitives enable a party in possession of a quantum ciphertext to generate a classical
certificate that the encrypted plaintext has been information-theoretically deleted, and cannot
be recovered even given unbounded computational resources. For any $X \in \{\mathsf{public}\text{-}\mathsf{key},\mathsf{attribute\text{-}based},\mathsf{fully\text{-}homomorphic},
\mathsf{witness},\mathsf{timed}\text{-}\mathsf{release}\}$, our compiler yields post-quantum
$X$ encryption with certified deletion, assuming post-quantum $X$ encryption. In addition, assuming
the existence of statistically binding commitments, our compiler yields statistically binding
commitments with certified everlasting hiding as well as statistically sound zero-knowledge
proofs for QMA with certified everlasting zero-knowledge. We also introduce and construct information-theoretic
secret sharing with certified deletion. Existing proposals~\cite{EC:Unruh14,10.1007/978-3-030-92062-3_21,cryptoeprint:2021:1315,cryptoeprint:2022:295}
for public-key primitives and commitments with certified deletion (1) have complex constructions
tailored to specific primitives and non-generic proofs, (2) are not known to satisfy everlasting
security after deletion in the plain model, and in many cases (3) resort to idealized models or stronger
cryptographic assumptions like obfuscation. We remedy this situation by developing a novel proof
technique to argue that a bit $b$ has been {\em information-theoretically deleted} from an adversary's
view once they produce a valid deletion certificate, despite having been previously {\em determined}
by the ciphertext they held in their view. This may be of independent interest.

In this paper we deal with the macroscopic electromagnetic response of a finite size dispersive
dielectric object, in unbounded space, in the framework of quantum electrodynamics using the Heisenberg
picture. We apply a Hopfield type scheme to account for the dispersion and dissipation of the matter.
We provide a general expression of the polarization density field operator as functions of the initial
conditions of the matter field operators and of the electromagnetic field operators. It is a linear
functional whose kernel is a linear expression of the impulse response of the dielectric object
that we obtain within the framework of classical electrodynamics. The electric field operator
is expressed as a function of the polarization density field operator by means of the dyadic Green's
function for the free space. The statistical functions of these operators are classical functionals
of the statistics of the initial conditions of the matter field operators and of the electromagnetic
field operators, whose kernels are linear or multilinear expressions of the impulse response of
the dielectric object. We keep the polarization and the electromagnetic field distinct to enable
the treatment of the polarization and electromagnetic fluctuations on equal footing. We expand
the polarization density field operator in terms of the static longitudinal and transverse modes
of the object to diagonalize the Coulomb and Ampere interaction energy terms of the Hamiltonian
in the Coulomb gauge. We expand the radiation fields in terms of the transverse plane wave modes of
free space. Few static longitudinal and transverse modes are needed to calculate each element of
the impulse response matrix for dielectric objects with sizes of the order up to $\min\limits_{\omega}\{c_0/[\omega
\sqrt{|{\chi}(\omega)|}]\}$ where ${\chi}(\omega)$ is the susceptibility of the dielectric.

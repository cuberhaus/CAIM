With the recent availability of cloud quantum computing services, the question of the verifiability
of quantum computations delegated by a weak quantum client to a powerful quantum server is becoming
of practical interest. Over the last two decades, Verifiable Blind Quantum Computing (VBQC) has
emerged as one of the key approaches to address this challenge. While many protocols have been proposed
in recent years, each optimising one aspect of such schemes, a systematic study of required building
blocks to achieve collectively the desired properties has been missing. We present a framework
that encompasses all known VBQC protocols and present sufficient conditions to obtain composable
security and noise robustness properties. We do this by providing a unified security proof within
the Abstract Cryptography formalism that can be used for existing protocols as well as new ones that
could be derived using the framework. While we choose Measurement-Based Quantum Computing (MBQC)
as the working model for the presentation of our results, one could expand the domain of applicability
of our framework via direct known translation between the circuit model and MBQC. On a theoretical
note, we uncover fundamental relations between verification and error detection and correction,
a folklore belief in the field that has never been mathematically proven: (i) verification can be
reduced to the task of error detection, and (ii) encoding of the target computation into an error-correcting
code is necessary for exponential soundness. These simple yet fundamental facts set the design
principles for further development towards practical VBQC protocols. Indeed, as a direct application
we demonstrate how the framework can systematize the search for new verification techniques. We
find completely new schemes that allow more efficient robust verification of BQP computations
than current state of the art.

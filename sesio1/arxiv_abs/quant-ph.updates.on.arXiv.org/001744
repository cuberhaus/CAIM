We develop a framework based on the covariant phase space formalism that identifies gravitational
edge modes as dynamical reference frames. Previously considered in gauge theory [arXiv:2109.06184],
this construction relies on a systematic post-selection procedure. Given a global variational
principle, it produces consistent dynamics for a spacetime subregion bounded by a codimension-one
timelike submanifold. By serving as dynamical reference frames for the gauge group, edge modes
enable the imposition of gauge-invariant boundary conditions. In generally covariant theories,
where the gauge group is a group of diffeomorphisms, such reference frames play an even more fundamental
role, as they allow one to identify the subregion in a gauge-invariant manner. This leads to the introduction
of a frame-dressed spacetime, that we call relational spacetime, and which serves as the primary
arena in which to perform post-selection. Just like in gauge theory, requiring the subregion presymplectic
structure to be conserved by the dynamics leads to an essentially unique prescription and unambiguous
Hamiltonian charges. Gauge diffeomorphisms are integrable, irrespective of how they behave in
the vicinity of the time-like boundary, and generate a first-class constraint algebra. By contrast,
diffeomorphisms acting on relational spacetime are in general physical, and those that are parallel
to the timelike boundary are integrable. Upon further restriction to relational diffeomorphisms
that preserve the boundary conditions, we obtain a subalgebra of conserved charges. Finally, we
explain how the boundary conditions and the conserved presymplectic structure can both be encoded
into suitable boundary actions. While our formalism applies to any generally covariant theory,
we illustrate it on vacuum general relativity, and conclude with a detailed comparison of our findings
to earlier works.

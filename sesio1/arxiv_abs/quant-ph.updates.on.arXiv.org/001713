Entanglement detection problem is one of the important problem in quantum information theory.
Gurvit showed that this problem is NP complete and thus this may be the possible reason that only one
criterion is not sufficient to detect all entangled states. There are some powerful entanglement
detection criterion such as partial transposition criterion, realignment criterion that it may
not be possible to implement them successfully in the experiment. But this situation can be avoided
if the entanglement is detected through the construction of witness operator method. The construction
of witness operator to detect entanglement is advantageous in two ways: (i) the entanglement can
be detected experimentally if we have prior partial information about the state which is under investigation
and (ii) It can detect both negative partial transpose entangled states (NPTES) and positive partial
transpose entangled states (PPTES). In this work, we take an analytical approach to construct a
witness operator. To achieve this task, we first construct a linear map using partial transposition
and realignment operation. Then we find some conditions on the parameters of the map for which the
map represent a positive map. Further, we have constructed a Choi matrix corresponding to the map
and have shown that the constructed map is not completely positive. We then construct an operator
and show that it can detect both NPTES and PPTES. Finally, we prove its efficiency by detecting several
bipartite bound entangled states which were previously undetected by some well-known separability
criteria. We also compared the detection power of our witness operator with three well-known powerful
entanglement detection criteria and find that our witness operator detect more entangled states
than these criterion.

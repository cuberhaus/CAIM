The hydrodynamic interpretation of quantum mechanics treats a system of particles in an effective
manner. In this work, we investigate squeezed coherent states within the hydrodynamic interpretation.
The Hamiltonian operator in question is time dependent, n-dimensional and in quadratic order.
We start with deriving a phase space Wigner probability distribution and an associated equilibrium
entropy for the squeezed coherent states. Then, we decompose the joint phase space distribution
into two portions: a marginal position distribution and a momentum distribution that is conditioned
on the post-selection of positions. Our conditionally averaged momenta is shown to be equal to the
Bohm's momenta whose connection to the weak measurements is already known. We also keep track of
the corresponding classical system evolution by identifying shear, magnification and rotation
components of the symplectic phase space dynamics. This allows us to pinpoint which portion of the
underlying classical motion appears in which quantum statistical concept. We show that our probability
distributions satisfy the Fokker-Planck equations exactly. They can be used to decompose the equilibrium
entropy into the missing information in positions and in momenta as in the Sackur-Tetrode entropy
of the classical kinetic theory. Eventually, we define a quantum pressure, a quantum temperature
and a quantum internal energy which are related to each other in the same fashion as in the classical
kinetic theory. We show that the quantum potential incorporates the kinetic part of the internal
energy and the fluctuations around it. This allows us to suggest a quantum conditional virial relation.
In the end, we show that the kinetic internal energy is linked to the fractional Fourier transformer
part of the underlying classical dynamics similar to the case where the energy of a quantum oscillator
is linked to its Maslov index.

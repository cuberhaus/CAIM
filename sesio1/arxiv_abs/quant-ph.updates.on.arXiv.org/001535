Despite progress in quantum Hamiltonian complexity, little is known about the computational complexity
of quantum physics at the thermodynamic limit. Even defining the problem is not straight forward.
We study the complexity of estimating the ground energy of a fixed, translationally invariant Hamiltonian
in the thermodynamic limit, to within a given precision; the number of bits $n$ for the precision
is the sole input to the problem. The complexity of this problem captures how difficult it is for the
physicist to measure or compute another digit in the approximation of a physical quantity in the
thermodynamic limit. We show that this problem is contained in $\mbox{FEXP}^{\mbox{QMA-EXP}}$
and is hard for $\mbox{FEXP}^{\mbox{NEXP}}$. This means that the problem is doubly exponentially
hard in the size of the input. As an ingredient in our construction, we study the problem of computing
the ground energy of translationally invariant finite 1D chains. A single Hamiltonian term, which
is a fixed parameter of the problem, is applied to every pair of particles in a finite chain. The length
of the chain is the sole input to the problem and the task is to compute an approximation of the ground
energy. No thresholds are provided as in the standard formulation of the local Hamiltonian problem.
We show that this problem is contained in $\mbox{FP}^{\mbox{QMA-EXP}}$ and is hard for $\mbox{FP}^{\mbox{NEXP}}$.
Our techniques employ a circular clock in which the ground energy is calibrated by the length of the
cycle. This requires more precise expressions for the ground states of the resulting matrices than
was required for previous QMA-completeness constructions and even exact analytical bounds for
the infinite case which we derive using techniques from spectral graph theory. To our knowledge,
this is the first use of the circuit-to-Hamiltonian construction which shows hardness for a function
class.

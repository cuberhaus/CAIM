Entanglement and quantum communication are paradigmatic resources in quantum information science
leading to correlations between systems that have no classical analogue. Correlations due to entanglement
when communication is absent have for long been studied in Bell scenarios. Correlations due to quantum
communication when entanglement is absent have been studied extensively in prepare-and-measure
scenarios in the last decade. Here, we set out to understand and investigate correlations in scenarios
that involve both entanglement and communication, focusing on entanglement-assisted prepare-and-measure
scenarios. In a recent companion paper [arXiv:2103.10748], we investigated correlations based
on unrestricted entanglement. Here, our focus is on scenarios with restricted entanglement. We
establish several elementary relations between standard classical and quantum communication
and their entanglement-assisted counterparts. In particular, while it was already known that
bits or qubits assisted by two-qubit entanglement between the sender and receiver constitute a
stronger resource than bare bits or qubits, we show that higher-dimensional entanglement further
enhance the power of bits or qubits. We also provide a characterisation of generalised dense coding
protocols, a natural subset of entanglement-assisted quantum communication protocols, finding
that they can be understood as standard quantum communication protocols in real-valued Hilbert
space. Though such dense coding protocols can convey up to two bits of information, we provide evidence,
perhaps counter-intuitively, that resources with a small information capacity, such as a bare
qutrits, can sometimes produce stronger correlations. Along the way we leave several conjectures
and conclude with a list of interesting open problems.

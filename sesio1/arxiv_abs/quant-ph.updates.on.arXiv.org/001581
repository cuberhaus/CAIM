In recent years, fermionic topological phases of quantum matter has attracted a lot of attention.
In a pioneer work by Gu, Wang and Wen, the concept of equivalence classes of fermionic local unitary(FLU)
transformations was proposed to systematically understand non-chiral topological phases in
2D fermion systems and an incomplete classification was obtained. On the other hand, the physical
picture of fermion condensation and its corresponding super pivotal categories give rise to a generic
mathematical framework to describe fermionic topological phases of quantum matter. In particular,
it has been pointed out that in certain fermionic topological phases, there exists the so-called
q-type anyon excitations, which have no analogues in bosonic theories. In this paper, we generalize
the Gu, Wang and Wen construction to include those fermionic topological phases with q-type anyon
excitations. We argue that all non-chiral fermionic topological phases in 2+1D are characterized
by a set of tensors $(N^{ij}_{k},F^{ij}_{k},F^{ijm,\alpha\beta}_{kln,\chi\delta},n_{i},d_{i})$,
which satisfy a set of nonlinear algebraic equations parameterized by phase factors $\Xi^{ijm,\alpha\beta}_{kl}$,
$\Xi^{ij}_{kln,\chi\delta}$, $\Omega^{kim,\alpha\beta}_{jl}$ and $\Omega^{ki}_{jln,\chi\delta}$.
Moreover, consistency conditions among algebraic equations give rise to additional constraints
on these phase factors which allow us to construct a topological invariant partition for an arbitrary
triangulation of 3D spin manifold. Finally, several examples with q-type anyon excitations are
discussed, including the Fermionic topological phase from Tambara-Yamagami category for $\mathbb{Z}_{2N}$,
which can be regarded as the $\mathbb{Z}_{2N}$ parafermion generalization of Ising fermionic
topological phase.

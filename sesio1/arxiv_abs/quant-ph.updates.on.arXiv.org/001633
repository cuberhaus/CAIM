In this work, we varied the number density of photo generated and bias driven excitons by changing
the applied bias voltage and photo excitation intensity. Phase coherent periodic oscillations
in photo generated capacitance as a function of the bias voltage and light intensity are measured
respectively over a macroscopically large area. We then argue that presence of coherent resonant
tunnelling in this well-dot heterostructure strongly restricts the available momentum space
of the charge carriers within this quantum well. Consequently, the measured average electric polarization
vector of the associated indirect excitons spontaneously increase below 100 K as excitonic dipoles
chooses a particular phase and collectively orients along the direction of applied bias. As a result,
these excitons continuously undergo Bose-Einstein condensation below a transition temperature
as the density threshold is approached at regular bias intervals. Moreover, periodic presence
and absence of splitting of excitonic peaks in the optical spectra based on photocapacitance confirm
such tunneling induced variations in quantum coupling of electrons between quantum well and quantum
dots. Observation of negative quantum capacitance due to screening of charge carriers by the quantum
well indicate periodic variation of Coulomb correlations of interacting excitons with increasing
bias as a precursor to condensation and vice versa. Generation of density dependent enhancement
of quantum interference beats in photocapacitance oscillation with bias even under incoherent
white light further confirm the presence of stable, long range spatial correlation among these
indirect excitons as well as the existence excitonic matter waves. We also detected collective
Rabi oscillations of these macroscopically large, multipartite, two-level, coupled and uncoupled
quantum states of excitonic condensate which can be used as qubits.

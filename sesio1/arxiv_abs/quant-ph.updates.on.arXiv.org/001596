Quantum entanglement, discord, and EPR-steering are properties which are considered as valuable
resources for fuelling quantum information-theoretic protocols. EPR-steering is a property
that is more general than Bell-nonlocality and yet more restrictive than entanglement. Quantum
discord on the other hand, captures non-classical behaviour beyond that of entanglement, and its
study has remained of active research interest during the past two decades. Exploring the behaviour
of these quantum properties in different physical scenarios, like those simulated by open quantum
systems, is therefore of crucial importance for understanding their viability for quantum technologies.
In this work, we analyse the behaviour of EPR-steering, entanglement, and quantum discord, for
two-qubit states under various quantum processes. First, we consider the three noisy channel scenarios
of; phase damping, generalised amplitude damping and stochastic dephasing channel. Second, we
explore the behaviour of these quantum properties in an entanglement swapping scenario. We quantify
EPR-steering by means of an inequality with three-input two-output measurement settings, and
address quantum discord as the interferometric power of quantum states. Our findings are the following.
First, we show that some of the relatively straightforward noisy channels here considered, can
induce non-trivial dynamics such as sudden death as well as death and revival of EPR-steering and
entanglement. Second, we find that although noisy channels in general reduce the amount of correlations
present in the system, the swapping protocol on the other hand displays scenarios where these quantum
correlations can be enhanced. These results therefore illustrate that quantum processes do not
exclusively affect the quantum properties of physical systems in a negative manner, but that they
can also have positive effects on such properties.

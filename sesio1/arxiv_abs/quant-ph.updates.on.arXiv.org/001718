We study the spin dynamics of diamond nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in an oscillating magnetic field
along the symmetry axis of the NV in the presence of transverse magnetic fields. It is well-known
that the coupling between the otherwise degenerate Zeeman levels $|M_S=\pm1\rangle$ due to strain
and electric fields is responsible for a Landau-Zener process near the pseudo-crossing of the adiabatic
energy levels when the axial component of the oscillating magnetic field changes sign. We derive
an effective two-level Hamiltonian for the NV system that includes coupling between the two levels
via virtual transitions into the third far-detuned level $|M_S=0\rangle$ induced by transverse
magnetic fields. This coupling adds to the coupling due to strain and electric fields, with a phase
that depends on the direction of the transverse field in the plane perpendicular to the NV axis. Hence,
the {\em total coupling} of the Zeeman levels can be tuned to control the adiabaticity of spin dynamics
by fully or partially compensating the effect of the strain and electric fields, or by enhancing
it. Moreover, by varying the strength and direction of the transverse magnetic fields, one can determine
the strength and direction of the local strain and electric fields at the position of the NV center,
and even the {\em external} stress and electric field. The nuclear spin hyperfine interaction is
shown to introduce a nuclear spin dependent offset of the axial magnetic field for which the pseudo-crossing
occurs, while the adiabaticity remains unaffected by the nuclear spin. If the NV center is coupled
to the environment, modeled by a bath with a Gaussian white noise spectrum, as appropriate for NVs
near the diamond surface, then the spin dynamics is accompanied by relaxation of the Zeeman level
populations and decoherence with a non-monotonic decrease of the purity of the system.

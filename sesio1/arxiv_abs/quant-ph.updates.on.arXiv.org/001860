Recent experimental studies have shown that the relaxation time ($T_1$) and the dephasing time
($T_2$) of superconducting qubits fluctuate considerably over time. To appropriately consider
this time-varying nature of the $T_1$ and $T_2$ parameters, a new class of quantum channels, known
as Time-Varying Quantum Channels (TVQCs), has been proposed. In previous works, realizations
of multi-qubit TVQCs have been assumed to be equal for all the qubits of an error correction block,
implying that the random variables that describe the fluctuations of $T_1$ and $T_2$ are block-to-block
uncorrelated, but qubit-wise perfectly correlated for the same block. Physically, the fluctuations
of these decoherence parameters are explained by the incoherent coupling of the qubits with unstable
near-resonant two-level-systems (TLS), which indicates that such variations may be local to each
of the qubits of the system. In this article, we perform a correlation analysis of the fluctuations
of the relaxation times of multi-qubit quantum processors ibmq\_quito, ibmq\_belem, ibmq\_lima,
ibmq\_santiago and ibmq\_bogota. Our results show that it is reasonable to assume that the fluctuations
of the relaxation and dephasing times of superconducting qubits are local to each of the qubits of
the system. Based on these results, we discuss the multi-qubit TVQCs when the fluctuations of the
decoherence parameters for an error correction block are qubit-wise uncorrelated (as well as from
block-to-block), a scenario we have named the Fast Time-Varying Quantum Channel (FTVQC). Furthermore,
we lower bound the quantum capacity of general FTVQCs based on a quantity we refer to as the ergodic
quantum capacity. Finally, we use numerical simulations to study the performance of quantum error
correction codes (QECC) when they operate over FTVQCs.

Recently, table-top experiments involving massive quantum systems have been proposed to test
the interface of quantum theory and gravity. In particular, the crucial point of the debate is whether
it is possible to conclude anything on the quantum nature of the gravitational field, provided that
two quantum systems become entangled due to solely the gravitational interaction. Typically,
this question has been addressed by assuming a specific physical theory to describe the gravitational
interaction, but no systematic approach to characterise the set of possible gravitational theories
which are compatible with the observation of entanglement has been proposed. Here, we remedy this
by introducing the framework of Generalised Probabilistic Theories (GPTs) to the study of the nature
of the gravitational field. This framework has the advantage that it only relies on the set of operationally
accessible states, transformations, and measurements, without pre-assuming a specific description
of gravity. Hence, it provides a framework to systematically study all theories compatible with
the detection of entanglement generated via the gravitational interaction between two non-classical
systems. We prove a no-go theorem stating that the following statements are incompatible: i) gravity
is able to generate entanglement; ii) gravity locally mediates the interaction between the non-classical
systems; iii) gravity is classical. Non-classicality, however, does not imply that the gravitational
field is quantum. To illustrate this we provide examples of non-classical and non-quantum theories
which are logically consistent with the other conditions. Moreover, we analyse alternative models
to quantum theory with gravitational interactions, such as the Schr\"odinger-Newton equation
and Collapse Models, in light of our our no-go theorem.

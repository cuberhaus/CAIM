It is well established that measurement-induced quantum back action (QBA) can be eliminated in
composite systems by engineering so-called quantum-mechanics-free subspaces (QMFSs) of commuting
variables, leading to a trajectory of a quantum system without quantum uncertainties. This situation
can be realized in a composite system that includes a negative-mass subsystem, which can be implemented
by, e.g., a polarized spin ensemble or a two-tone-driven optomechanical system. The realization
of a trajectory without quantum uncertainties implies entanglement between the subsystems, and
allows for measurements of motion, fields and forces with, in principle, unlimited precision.
To date, these principles have been developed theoretically and demonstrated experimentally
for a number of composite systems. However, the utility of the concept has been limited by the dominating
requirement of close proximity of the resonance frequencies of the system of interest and the negative-mass
reference system, and by the need to embed the subsystems in a narrowband cavity, which could be problematic
while at the same time achieving good overcoupling. Here we propose a general approach which overcomes
these limitations by employing periodic modulation of the driving fields (e.g., two-tone driving)
in combination with coherent or measurement-based anti-noise paths. This approach makes it possible
to engineer a QMFS of two systems with vastly different spectra and with arbitrary signs of their
masses, while dispensing with the need to embed the subsystems in a sideband-resolving cavity.
We discuss the advantages of this novel approach for applications such as QBA evasion in gravitational
wave detection, force sensing, and entanglement generation between disparate systems.

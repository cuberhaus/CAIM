The dynamical convergence of a system to the thermal distribution, or Gibbs state, is a standard
assumption across all of the physical sciences. The Gibbs state is determined just by temperature
and the system's energies alone. But at decreasing system sizes, i.e. for nanoscale and quantum
systems, the interaction with their environments is not negligible. The question then arises:
Is the system's steady state still the Gibbs state? And if not, how may the steady state depend on the
interaction details? Here we provide an overview of recent progress on answering these questions.
We expand on the state-of-the-art along two general avenues: First we take the static point-of-view
which postulates the so-called mean force Gibbs state. This view is commonly adopted in the field
of strong coupling thermodynamics, where modified laws of thermodynamics and non-equilibrium
fluctuation relations are established on the basis of this modified state. Second, we take the dynamical
point-of-view, originating from the field of open quantum systems, which examines the time-asymptotic
steady state within two paradigms. We describe the mathematical paradigm which proves return to
equilibrium, i.e. convergence to the mean force Gibbs state, and then discuss a number of microscopic
physical methods, particularly master equations. We conclude with a summary of established links
between statics and equilibration dynamics, and provide an extensive list of open problems. This
comprehensive overview will be of interest to researchers in the wider fields of quantum thermodynamics,
open quantum systems, mesoscopic physics, statistical physics and quantum optics, and will find
applications whenever energy is exchanged on the nanoscale, from quantum chemistry and biology,
to magnetism and nanoscale heat management.

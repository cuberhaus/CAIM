Machine learning techniques are increasingly being used in fundamental research to solve various
challenging problems. Here we explore one such technique to address an important problem in quantum
communication scenario. While transferring quantum information through a noisy quantum channel,
the utility of the channel is characterized by its quantum capacity. Quantum channels, however,
display an intriguing property called super-additivity of coherent information. This makes the
calculation of quantum capacity a hard computational problem involving optimization over an exponentially
increasing search space. In this work, we first utilize a neural network ansatz to represent quantum
states and then apply an evolutionary optimization scheme to address this problem. We find regions
in the three-parameter space of qubit Pauli channels where coherent information exhibits this
super-additivity feature. We characterised the quantum codes that achieves high coherent information,
finding several non-trivial quantum codes that outperforms the repetition codes for some Pauli
channels. For some Pauli channels, these codes displays very high super-additivity of the order
of 0.01, much higher than the observed values in other well studied quantum channels. We further
compared the learning performance of the Neural Network ansatz with the raw ansatz to find that in
the three-shot case, the neural network ansatz outperforms the raw representation in finding quantum
codes of high coherent information. We also compared the learning performance of the evolutionary
algorithm with a simple Particle Swarm Optimisation scheme and show empirical results indicating
comparable performance, suggesting that the Neural Network ansatz coupled with the evolutionary
scheme is indeed a promising approach to finding non-trivial quantum codes of high coherent information.

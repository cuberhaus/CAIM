This work addresses quantum adiabatic decoherence of many-body spin systems coupled with a boson
field in the framework of open quantum systems theory. We generalize the traditional spin-boson
model by considering a system-environment interaction Hamiltonian that represents a partition
of non-interacting subsystems and highlights the collective correlation that appears exclusively
due to the coupling with a common environment. Remarkably, this simple, exactly solvable model
encompasses relevant aspects of a many-body open quantum system and features the subtle quantum
effects that arise when the size scales up to a macroscopic level. We derive an analytical expression
for the time dependence of the density matrix without assuming coarse-graining. The resulting
decoherence function is eigen-selective and is a complex exponential whose exponent has a real
part that introduces a decay similar to that in the spin-boson model. On the contrary, the imaginary
part depends on the quantum numbers and geometry of the whole partition and does not reflect the system
temperature. Motivated by decoherence in solid-state NMR we apply the theoretical results to a
partition of dipole-coupled spin pairs in contact with a common phonon bath, using typical parameters
of hydrated salts. The proposal allows estimating the decoherence time scale in terms of the system
physical constants. As a significant novelty, the decoherence function phase depends on the eigenvalue
distribution throughout the sample. It plays the leading role, overshadowing the mechanism associated
with the bath thermal state. Finally, we apply the formalism to describe decoherence in the "magic
echo" NMR reversal experiment. We find that the system-environment correlation explains the origin
of irreversibility, and both the decoherence rate value and its dependence on the dipolar frequency,
are remarkably similar to the experiment.

We consider the hardness of computing additive approximations to output probabilities of random
quantum circuits. We consider three random circuit families, namely, Haar random, $p=1$ QAOA,
and random IQP circuits. Our results are as follows. For Haar random circuits with $m$ gates, we improve
on prior results by showing $\mathsf{coC_=P}$ hardness of average-case additive approximations
to an imprecision of $2^{-O(m)}$. Efficient classical simulation of such problems would imply
the collapse of the polynomial hierarchy. For constant depth circuits i.e., when $m=O(n)$, this
linear scaling in the exponent is within a constant of the scaling required to show hardness of sampling.
Prior to our work, such a result was shown only for Boson Sampling in Bouland et al (2021). We also use
recent results in polynomial interpolation to show $\mathsf{coC_=P}$ hardness under $\mathsf{BPP}$
reductions rather than $\mathsf{BPP}^{\mathsf{NP}}$ reductions. This improves the results
of prior work for Haar random circuits both in terms of the error scaling and the power of reductions.
Next, we consider random $p=1$ QAOA and IQP circuits and show that in the average-case, it is $\mathsf{coC_=P}$
hard to approximate the output probability to within an additive error of $2^{-O(n)}$. For $p=1$
QAOA circuits, this work constitutes the first average-case hardness result for the problem of
approximating output probabilities for random QAOA circuits, which include Sherrington-Kirkpatrick
and Erd\"{o}s-Renyi graphs. For IQP circuits, a consequence of our results is that approximating
the Ising partition function with imaginary couplings to an additive error of $2^{-O(n)}$ is hard
even in the average-case, which extends prior work on worst-case hardness of multiplicative approximation
to Ising partition functions.

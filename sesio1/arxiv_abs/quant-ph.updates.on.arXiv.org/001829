Recent work has demonstrated that quantum Fisher information (QFI), a witness of multipartite
entanglement, and magnetic Van Hove correlations $G(r,t)$, a probe of local real-space real-time
spin dynamics, can be successfully extracted from inelastic neutron scattering on spin systems
through accurate measurements of the dynamical spin structure factor $S(k,\omega)$. Here we apply
theoretically these ideas to the half-filled Hubbard chain with nearest-neighbor hopping, away
from the strong-coupling limit. This model has nontrivial redistribution of spectral weight in
$S(k,\omega)$ going from the non-interacting limit ($U=0$) to strong coupling ($U\rightarrow
\infty$), where it reduces to the Heisenberg quantum spin chain. We use the density matrix renormalization
group (DMRG) to find $S(k,\omega)$, from which QFI is then calculated. We find that QFI grows with
$U$. With realistic energy resolution it becomes capable of witnessing bipartite entanglement
above $U=2.5$ (in units of the hopping), where it also changes slope. This point is also proximate
to slope changes of the bandwidth $W(U)$ and the half-chain von Neumann entanglement entropy. We
compute $G(r,t)$ by Fourier-transforming $S(k,\omega)$. The results indicate a crossover in
the short-time short-distance dynamics at low $U$ characterized by ferromagnetic lightcone wavefronts,
to a Heisenberg-like behavior at large $U$ featuring antiferromagnetic lightcones and spatially
period-doubled antiferromagnetism. We find this crossover has largely been completed by $U=3$.
Our results thus provide evidence that, in several aspects, the strong-coupling limit of the Hubbard
chain is reached qualitatively already at a relatively modest interaction strength. We discuss
experimental candidates for observing the $G(r,t)$ dynamics found at low $U$.

Recent years have seen remarkable development in open quantum systems effectively described by
non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. A unique feature of non-Hermitian topological systems is the skin
effect, which is the anomalous localization of an extensive number of eigenstates driven by nonreciprocal
dissipation. Despite its significance for non-Hermitian topological phases, the relevance of
the skin effect to quantum entanglement and critical phenomena has remained unclear. Here, we find
that the skin effect induces a nonequilibrium quantum phase transition in the entanglement dynamics.
We show that the skin effect gives rise to a macroscopic flow of particles and suppresses the entanglement
propagation and thermalization, leading to the area law of the entanglement entropy in the nonequilibrium
steady state. Moreover, we reveal an entanglement phase transition induced by the competition
between the unitary dynamics and the skin effect even without disorder or interactions. This entanglement
phase transition accompanies nonequilibrium quantum criticality characterized by a nonunitary
conformal field theory whose effective central charge is extremely sensitive to the boundary conditions.
We also demonstrate that it originates from an exceptional point of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian
and the concomitant scale invariance of the skin modes localized according to the power law. Furthermore,
we show that the skin effect leads to the purification and the reduction of von Neumann entropy even
in Markovian open quantum systems described by the Lindblad master equation. Our work opens a way
to control the entanglement growth and establishes a fundamental understanding of phase transitions
and critical phenomena in open quantum systems far from thermal equilibrium.

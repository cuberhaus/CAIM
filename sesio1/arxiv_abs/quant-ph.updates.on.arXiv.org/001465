Causality is fundamental to science, but it appears in several different forms. One is relativistic
causality, which is tied to a space-time structure and forbids signalling outside the future. On
the other hand, causality can be defined operationally using causal models by considering the flow
of information within a network of physical systems and interventions on them. From both a foundational
and practical viewpoint, it is useful to establish the class of causal models that can coexist with
relativistic principles such as no superluminal signalling, noting that causation and signalling
are not equivalent. We develop such a general framework that allows these different notions of causality
to be independently defined and for connections between them to be established. The framework first
provides an operational way to model causation in the presence of cyclic, fine-tuned and non-classical
causal influences. We then consider how a causal model can be embedded in a space-time structure
and propose a mathematical condition (compatibility) for ensuring that the embedded causal model
does not allow signalling outside the space-time future. We identify several distinct classes
of causal loops that can arise in our framework, showing that compatibility with a space-time can
rule out only some of them. We then demonstrate the mathematical possibility of operationally detectable
causal loops embedded in Minkowski space-time that do not lead to superluminal signalling. Our
framework provides conditions for preventing superluminal signalling within arbitrary (possibly
cyclic) causal models and also allows us to model causation in post-quantum theories admitting
jamming correlations. Finally, this work introduces a new causal modelling concept of ``higher-order
affects relations'' and several related technical results, which have applications for causal
discovery in fined-tuned causal models.

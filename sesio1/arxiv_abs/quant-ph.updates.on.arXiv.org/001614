The aim of this thesis is to develop a theoretical framework to study parameter estimation of quantum
channels. We study the task of estimating unknown parameters encoded in a channel in the sequential
setting. A sequential strategy is the most general way to use a channel multiple times. Our goal is
to establish lower bounds (called Cramer-Rao bounds) on the estimation error. The bounds we develop
are universally applicable; i.e., they apply to all permissible quantum dynamics. We consider
the use of catalysts to enhance the power of a channel estimation strategy. This is termed amortization.
The power of a channel for a parameter estimation is determined by its Fisher information. Thus,
we study how much a catalyst quantum state can enhance the Fisher information of a channel by defining
the amortized Fisher information. We establish our bounds by proving that for certain Fisher information
quantities, catalyst states do not improve the performance of a sequential estimation protocol
compared to a parallel one. The technical term for this is an amortization collapse. We use this to
establish bounds when estimating one parameter, or multiple parameters simultaneously. Our bounds
apply universally and we also cast them as optimization problems. For the single parameter case,
we establish bounds for general quantum channels using both the symmetric logarithmic derivative
(SLD) Fisher information and the right logarithmic derivative (RLD) Fisher information. The task
of estimating multiple parameters simultaneously is more involved than the single parameter case,
because the Cramer-Rao bounds take the form of matrix inequalities. We establish a scalar Cramer-Rao
bound for multiparameter channel estimation using the RLD Fisher information. For both single
and multiparameter estimation, we provide a no-go condition for the so-called Heisenberg scaling
using our RLD-based bound.

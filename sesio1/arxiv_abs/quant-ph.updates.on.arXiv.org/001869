The Illinois Express Quantum Network (IEQNET) is a program to realize metropolitan scale quantum
networking over deployed optical fiber using currently available technology. IEQNET consists
of multiple sites that are geographically dispersed in the Chicago metropolitan area. Each site
has one or more quantum nodes (Q-nodes) representing the communication parties in a quantum network.
Q-nodes generate or measure quantum signals such as entangled photons and communicate the measurement
results via standard, classical signals and conventional networking processes. The entangled
photons in IEQNET nodes are generated at multiple wavelengths, and are selectively distributed
to the desired users via transparent optical switches. Here we describe the network architecture
of IEQNET, including the Internet-inspired layered hierarchy that leverages software-defined
networking (SDN) technology to perform traditional wavelength routing and assignment between
the Q-nodes. Specifically, SDN decouples the control and data planes, with the control plane being
entirely implemented in the classical domain. We also discuss the IEQNET processes that address
issues associated with synchronization, calibration, network monitoring, and scheduling. An
important goal of IEQNET is to demonstrate the extent to which the control plane classical signals
can co-propagate with the data plane quantum signals in the same fiber lines (quantum-classical
signal "coexistence"). This goal is furthered by the use of tunable narrow-band optical filtering
at the receivers and, at least in some cases, a wide wavelength separation between the quantum and
classical channels. We envision IEQNET to aid in developing robust and practical quantum networks
by demonstrating metro-scale quantum communication tasks such as entanglement distribution
and quantum-state teleportation.

We consider the problem of the variational quantum circuit synthesis into a gate set consisting
of the CNOT gate and arbitrary single-qubit (1q) gates with the primary target being the minimization
of the CNOT count. First we note that along with the discrete architecture search suffering from
the combinatorial explosion of complexity, optimization over 1q gates can also be a crucial roadblock
due to the omnipresence of local minimums (well known in the context of variational quantum algorithms
but apparently underappreciated in the context of the variational compiling). Taking the issue
seriously, we make an extensive search over the initial conditions an essential part of our approach.
Another key idea we propose is to use parametrized two-qubit (2q) controlled phase gates, which
can interpolate between the identity gate and the CNOT gate, and allow a continuous relaxation of
the discrete architecture search, which can be executed jointly with the optimization over 1q gates.
This coherent optimization of the architecture together with 1q gates appears to work surprisingly
well in practice, sometimes even outperforming optimization over 1q gates alone (for fixed optimal
architectures). As illustrative examples and applications we derive 8 CNOT and T depth 3 decomposition
of the 3q Toffoli gate on the nearest-neighbor topology, rediscover known best decompositions
of the 4q Toffoli gate on all 4q topologies including a 1 CNOT gate improvement on the star-shaped
topology, and propose decomposition of the 5q Toffoli gate on the nearest-neighbor topology with
48 CNOT gates. We also benchmark the performance of our approach on a number of 5q quantum circuits
from the ibm_qx_mapping database showing that it is highly competitive with the existing software.
The algorithm developed in this work is available as a Python package CPFlow.

Molecular vibronic spectra is an essential property of molecules, which is an important tool to
analyze chemical components and study molecular structures. Computing molecular vibronic spectra
has been a challenging task, and its best-known classical algorithm scales combinatorially in
the system size. Recently, a quantum simulator, specifically Gaussian boson sampling, has been
proposed to generate the spectra efficiently. Thus, molecular vibronic spectra is a candidate
of tasks for which a quantum device provides a computational advantage. In this work, we propose
a quantum-inspired classical algorithm for molecular vibronic spectra. We find an exact solution
of the Fourier components of molecular vibronic spectra at zero temperature using the positive
$P$-representation method. Thus, we can obtain the molecular vibronic spectra exactly by the inverse
Fourier transformation for the solution for a given resolution. We also show that the same method
applies to a finite temperature case. Therefore, computing molecular vibronic spectra, which
can be mapped to a Gaussian boson sampling, does not require a quantum device. We then generalize
the method beyond the Gaussian framework and find that the Fourier components are written as a loop
hafnian, the exact computation of which is known to be \#P-hard. It presents an interesting theoretical
separation between non-Gaussian boson sampling and Gaussian boson sampling. Meanwhile, since
running an actual boson sampling circuit would incur an $1/\text{poly}(N)$ additive error for
$N$ samples, we also study the possibility of achieving the same accuracy using a classical algorithm.
Interestingly, when there is no squeezing in the process, one may use Gurvits's algorithm to compute
the Fourier components within an additive error. We finally provide possible approaches to approximate
the Fourier components and discuss their limitations.

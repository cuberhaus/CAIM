In the problem of quantum channel discrimination, one distinguishes between a given number of quantum
channels, which is done by sending an input state through a channel and measuring the output state.
This work studies applications of variational quantum circuits and machine learning techniques
for discriminating such channels. In particular, we explore (i) the practical implementation
of embedding this task into the framework of variational quantum computing, (ii) training a quantum
classifier based on variational quantum circuits, and (iii) applying the quantum kernel estimation
technique. For testing these three channel discrimination approaches, we considered a pair of
entanglement-breaking channels and the depolarizing channel with two different depolarization
factors. For the approach (i), we address solving the quantum channel discrimination problem using
widely discussed parallel and sequential strategies. We show the advantage of the latter in terms
of better convergence with less quantum resources. Quantum channel discrimination with a variational
quantum classifier (ii) allows one to operate even with random and mixed input states and simple
variational circuits. The kernel-based classification approach (iii) is also found effective
as it allows one to discriminate depolarizing channels associated not with just fixed values of
the depolarization factor, but with ranges of it. Additionally, we discovered that a simple modification
of one of the commonly used kernels significantly increases the efficiency of this approach. Finally,
our numerical findings reveal that the performance of variational methods of channel discrimination
depends on the trace of the product of the output states. These findings demonstrate that quantum
machine learning can be used to discriminate channels, such as those representing physical noise
processes.

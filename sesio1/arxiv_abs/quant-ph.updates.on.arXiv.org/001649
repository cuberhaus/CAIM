We introduce the resource marginal problems, which concern the possibility of having a resource-free
target subsystem compatible with a given collection of marginal density matrices. By identifying
an appropriate choice of resource $R$ and target subsystem T, our problems reduce, respectively,
to the well-known marginal problems for quantum states and the problem of determining if a given
quantum system is a resource. More generally, we define a set of marginal states to be resource-free
incompatible with a target subsystem T if all global states compatible with this set must result
in a resourceful state in T. We show that this incompatibility induces a resource theory that can
be quantified by a monotone. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for this monotone to
be a finite conic program and further show, via the corresponding witnesses, that resource-free
incompatibility is equivalent to an operational advantage in some subchannel discrimination
task. Via our framework, a clear connection can be established between any marginal problem (that
involves some notion of incompatibility) for quantum states and a resource theory for quantum states.
In addition, the universality of our framework leads, for example, to an immediate, quantitative
understanding of the incompatibility associated with the recently-proposed entanglement marginal
problems. As further applications, we provide the first example showing a form of transitivity
of nonlocality (steerability) for quantum states. We discuss also the analogous framework in the
dynamical regime and establish a set of theoretical results that closely mirror those obtained
for a resource theory for quantum states. Again, they allow us to recover a wide variety of results
related to the studies of channel marginal problems, channel resource theories, etc.

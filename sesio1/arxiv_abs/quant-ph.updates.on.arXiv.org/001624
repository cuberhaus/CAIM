We present an operative approach to the macroscopic electromagnetic response of a finite size dispersive
dielectric object in unbounded space, in the framework of quantum electrodynamics using the Heisenberg
picture. The matter and the electromagnetic field are kept distinct and the polarization density
field operator is expanded in terms of the static longitudinal and transverse modes of the object.
These modes are a basis for the solenoidal vector fields defined on the region occupied by the object.
To account for the dispersion and dissipation of the matter, the polarization is described through
a Hopfield-type model. We apply the Coulomb gauge, we express the Coulomb electric field in terms
of the polarization field, and we expand the transverse electromagnetic field in terms of the transverse
plane wave modes of free space. We obtain the Heisenberg equations for the coordinate operators
of the polarization in a closed form. They are coupled due to the interaction of the polarization
with the radiation, through the transverse dyadic Green function for the vector potential in free
space. Few static longitudinal and transverse modes are needed for dielectric objects with sizes
of the order up to $\min\limits_{\omega}\{c_0/[\omega \sqrt{|{\chi}(\omega)|}]\}$ where ${\chi}(\omega)$
is the susceptibility of the dielectric. We express the coordinate operators of the polarization
as function of the free electric field operator and the free polarization field operator through
the transfer matrix in the Laplace domain and the impulse response matrix in the time domain of the
corresponding classical problem. The electric field operator has two contributions: the free
electric field operator and the induced electric field operator, which is expressed as function
of the polarization density field operator by means of the dyadic Green function in free space.

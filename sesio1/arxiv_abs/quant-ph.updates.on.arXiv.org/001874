Classically, for many computational problems one can conclude time lower bounds conditioned on
the hardness of one or more of key problems: k-SAT, 3SUM and APSP. More recently, similar results
have been derived in the quantum setting conditioned on the hardness of k-SAT and 3SUM. This is done
using fine-grained reductions, where the approach is to (1) select a key problem $X$ that, for some
function $T$, is conjectured to not be solvable by any $O(T(n)^{1-\epsilon})$ time algorithm for
any constant $\epsilon > 0$ (in a fixed model of computation), and (2) reduce $X$ in a fine-grained
way to these computational problems, thus giving (mostly) tight conditional time lower bounds
for them. Interestingly, for Delta-Matching Triangles and Triangle Collection, classical hardness
results have been derived conditioned on hardness of all three mentioned key problems. More precisely,
it is proven that an $n^{3-\epsilon}$ time classical algorithm for either of these two graph problems
would imply faster classical algorithms for k-SAT, 3SUM and APSP, which makes Delta-Matching Triangles
and Triangle Collection worthwhile to study. In this paper, we show that an $n^{1.5-\epsilon}$
time quantum algorithm for either of these two graph problems would imply faster quantum algorithms
for k-SAT, 3SUM, and APSP. We first formulate a quantum hardness conjecture for APSP and then present
quantum reductions from k-SAT, 3SUM, and APSP to Delta-Matching Triangles and Triangle Collection.
Additionally, based on the quantum APSP conjecture, we are also able to prove quantum lower bounds
for a matrix problem and many graph problems. The matching upper bounds follow trivially for most
of them, except for Delta-Matching Triangles and Triangle Collection for which we present quantum
algorithms that require careful use of data structures and Ambainis' variable time search.

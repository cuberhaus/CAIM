This dissertation presents and prove the viability of a non-standard method for controlling the
state of a quantum system by modifying its boundary conditions instead of relying on the action of
external fields. The standard approach to quantum control bases on the use of an external field to
manipulate the system. Some technological difficulties appear when controlling a quantum system
in this way, due to the complications of manipulating a system made of few particles while maintaining
the quantum correlations. As a consequence the systems need to be kept at very low temperatures and
the interactions have to be performed very fast. The Quantum Control at the Boundary approach is
radically different to the standard one. Instead of seeking the control of the quantum system by
directly interacting with it through an external field, the control is achieved by manipulating
the boundary conditions of the system. The spectrum of a quantum system, for instance an electron
moving in a box, depends on the boundary conditions imposed on it. Hence, a modification of such boundary
conditions modifies the state of the system allowing for its manipulation and, eventually, its
control. This kind of interaction is weaker, which makes one to expect that it may help maintaining
the quantum correlations. For showing the viability of the Quantum Control at the Boundary method,
a family of boundary control systems on Quantum Circuits (a generalization of quantum grahs) is
introduced. Before being able to address the problem of controllability, the problem of existence
of solutions for the Schr\"odinger equation with time-dependent boundary conditions is addressed.
The approximate controllability of the systems under study is proven using a controllability result
by T. Chambrion et al. (2009) and a stability result which constitutes another original contribution
of this dissertation.

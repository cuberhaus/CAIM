Present-day quantum communication predominantly depends on trusted relays (e.g., quantum repeaters,
low-Earth-orbit satellite) connected by optical fiber cables to transmit information. However,
recent evidence supports a decades-old concept that quantum entanglement, harnessed by current
quantum communication systems, does not necessarily rely on a physical relay medium. In modern
quantum communication networks, this trusted relay infrastructure is (1) susceptible to security
attacks, (2) limited by the channel capacity, (3) subject to decoherence loss, and (4) expensive
to set up. The instantaneous and faster-than-light activities of quantum entanglement occurring
in quantum communication have suggested guidance by some non-locality nature. On the contrary,
neither ground nor space-relays have shown or been demonstrated to embody it. It is proposed in this
paper that the non-locality nature of quantum theory governs quantum entanglement; elementary
particles, components of a universal quantum body, can achieve remote entanglement regardless
of a physical medium or spatial proximity. Evidence and theory supporting remote entanglement
in superconducting quantum systems (entanglement fidelities for communication in particular)
are presented. One such particle, the photon, representing a basic unit of quantum information,
qubit $|\psi\rangle = \alpha |0\rangle + \beta |1\rangle$, consists of real continuous values
in complex numbers $(\alpha, \beta)$ with infinite precision. These values $(\alpha, \beta)$
can account for the distinctiveness of qubits and result in an identity $QuID$ that possibly supports
remote entanglement. New approaches to medium-free secure quantum communication are suggested
by running simulations and actual quantum computations on a quantum circuit.

Quantum computers solve ever more complex tasks using steadily growing system sizes. Characterizing
these quantum systems is vital, yet becoming increasingly challenging. The gold-standard is quantum
state tomography (QST), capable of fully reconstructing a quantum state without prior knowledge.
Measurement and classical computing costs, however, increase exponentially in the system size
- a bottleneck given the scale of existing and near-term quantum devices. Here, we demonstrate a
scalable and practical QST approach that uses a single measurement setting, namely symmetric informationally
complete (SIC) positive operator-valued measures (POVM). We implement these nonorthogonal measurements
on an ion trap device by utilizing more energy levels in each ion - without ancilla qubits. More precisely,
we locally map the SIC POVM to orthogonal states embedded in a higher-dimensional system, which
we read out using repeated in-sequence detections, providing full tomographic information in
every shot. Combining this SIC tomography with the recently developed randomized measurement
toolbox ("classical shadows") proves to be a powerful combination. SIC tomography alleviates
the need for choosing measurement settings at random ("derandomization"), while classical shadows
enable the estimation of arbitrary polynomial functions of the density matrix orders of magnitudes
faster than standard methods. The latter enables in-depth entanglement studies, which we experimentally
showcase on a 5-qubit absolutely maximally entangled (AME) state. Moreover, the fact that the full
tomography information is available in every shot enables online QST in real time. We demonstrate
this on an 8-qubit entangled state, as well as for fast state identification. All in all, these features
single out SIC-based classical shadow estimation as a highly scalable and convenient tool for quantum
state characterization.

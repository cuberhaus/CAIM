In known constructions of classical zero-knowledge protocols for NP, either of zero-knowledge
or soundness holds only against computationally bounded adversaries. Indeed, achieving both
statistical zero-knowledge and statistical soundness at the same time with classical verifier
is impossible for NP unless the polynomial-time hierarchy collapses, and it is also believed to
be impossible even with a quantum verifier. In this work, we introduce a novel compromise, which
we call the certified everlasting zero-knowledge proof for QMA. It is a computational zero-knowledge
proof for QMA, but the verifier issues a classical certificate that shows that the verifier has deleted
its quantum information. If the certificate is valid, even unbounded malicious verifier can no
longer learn anything beyond the validity of the statement. We construct a certified everlasting
zero-knowledge proof for QMA. For the construction, we introduce a new quantum cryptographic primitive,
which we call commitment with statistical binding and certified everlasting hiding, where the
hiding property becomes statistical once the receiver has issued a valid certificate that shows
that the receiver has deleted the committed information. We construct commitment with statistical
binding and certified everlasting hiding from quantum encryption with certified deletion by Broadbent
and Islam [TCC 2020] (in a black box way), and then combine it with the quantum sigma-protocol for
QMA by Broadbent and Grilo [FOCS 2020] to construct the certified everlasting zero-knowledge proof
for QMA. Our constructions are secure in the quantum random oracle model. Commitment with statistical
binding and certified everlasting hiding itself is of independent interest, and there will be many
other useful applications beyond zero-knowledge.

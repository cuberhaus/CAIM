Quantum computing technology has grown rapidly in recent years, with new technologies being explored,
error rates being reduced, and quantum processors qubit capacity growing. However, near term quantum
algorithms are still unable to be induced without compounding consequential levels of noise, leading
to non trivial erroneous results. Quantum Error Correction (in situ error mitigation) and Quantum
Error Mitigation (post induction error mitigation) are promising fields of research within the
quantum algorithm scene, aiming to alleviate quantum errors, increasing the overall fidelity
and hence the overall quality of circuit induction. Earlier this year, a pioneering work, namely
HAMMER, published in ASPLOS 22 demonstrated the existence of a latent structure regarding post
circuit induction errors when mapping to the Hamming spectrum. However, they intuitively assumed
that errors occur in local clusters, and that at higher average Hamming distances this structure
falls away. In this work, we show that such a correlation structure is not only local but extends certain
non local clustering patterns which can be precisely described by a Poisson distribution model
taking the input circuit, the device run time status (i. e. calibration statistics), and qubit topology
into consideration. Using this quantum error characterizing model, we developed an iterative
algorithm over the generated Bayesian network state graph for post induction error mitigation.
Thanks to more precise modeling of the error distribution latent structure and the new iterative
method, our Q Beep approach provides state of the art performance and can boost circuit execution
fidelity by up to 234.6% on Bernstein Vazirani circuits and on average 71.0% on QAOA solution quality,
using 16 practical IBMQ quantum processors. For other benchmarks such as those in QASMBench, the
fidelity improvement is up to 17.8%.

Strong interactions between spins in many-body solid-state quantum system is a crucial resource
for exploring and applying non-classical states. In particular, electronic spins associated
with defects in diamond system are a leading platform for the study of collective quantum phenomena
and for quantum technology applications. While such solid-state quantum defect systems have the
advantage of scalability and operation under ambient conditions, they face the key challenge of
controlling interactions between the defects spins, since the defects are spatially fixed inside
the host lattice with relative positions that cannot be well controlled during fabrication. In
this work, we present a dressed-state approach to control the effective dipolar coupling between
solid-state spins; and then demonstrate this scheme experimentally using two strongly-coupled
nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. Including Rabi driving terms between the m$_s$ = 0 and
$\pm$1 states in the NV spin Hamiltonian allows us to turn on and off or tune the effective dipolar
coupling between two NV spins. Through Ramsey spectroscopy, we detect the change of the effective
dipolar field generated by the control NV spin prepared in different dressed states. To observe
the change of interaction dynamics, we then deploy spin-lock-based polarization transfer measurements
via a Hartmann-Hahn matching condition between two NV spins in different dressed states. We perform
simulations that indicate the promise for this robust scheme to control the distribution of interaction
strengths in strongly-interacting spin systems, including interaction strength homogenization
in a spin ensemble, which can be a valuable tool for studying non-equilibrium quantum phases and
generating high fidelity multi-spin correlated states for quantum-enhanced sensing.

In this paper we study the Platonic Bell inequalities for all possible dimensions. There are five
Platonic solids in three dimensions, but there are also solids with Platonic properties (also known
as regular polyhedra) in four and higher dimensions. The concept of Platonic Bell inequalities
in the three-dimensional Euclidean space was introduced by Tavakoli and Gisin [Quantum 4, 293 (2020)].
For any three-dimensional Platonic solid, an arrangement of projective measurements is associated
where the measurement directions point toward the vertices of the solids. For the higher dimensional
regular polyhedra, we use the correspondence of the vertices to the measurements in the abstract
Tsirelson space. We give a remarkably simple formula for the quantum violation of all the Platonic
Bell inequalities, which we prove to attain the maximum possible quantum violation of the Bell inequalities,
i.e. the Tsirelson bound. To construct Bell inequalities with a large number of settings, it is crucial
to compute the local bound efficiently. In general, the computation time required to compute the
local bound grows exponentially with the number of measurement settings. We find a method to compute
the local bound exactly for any bipartite two-outcome Bell inequality, where the dependence becomes
polynomial whose degree is the rank of the Bell matrix. To show that this algorithm can be used in practice,
we compute the local bound of a 300-setting Platonic Bell inequality based on the halved dodecaplex.
In addition, we use a diagonal modification of the original Platonic Bell matrix to increase the
ratio of quantum to local bound. In this way, we obtain a four-dimensional 60-setting Platonic Bell
inequality based on the halved tetraplex for which the quantum violation exceeds the $\sqrt 2$ ratio.

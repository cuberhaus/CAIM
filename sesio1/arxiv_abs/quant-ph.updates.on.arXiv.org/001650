Until quantum repeaters become mature, quantum networks remain restricted either to limited areas
of directly connected nodes or to nodes connected to a common node. We circumvent this limitation
by conceiving quantum networks using secure classical repeaters combined with the quantum secure
direct communication (QSDC) principle, which is a compelling form of quantum communication that
directly transmits information over quantum channel. The final component of this promising solution
is our classical quantum-resistant algorithm. Explicitly, in these networks, the ciphertext
gleaned from a quantum-resistant algorithm is transmitted using QSDC along the nodes, where it
is read out and then transmitted to the next node. At the repeaters, the information is protected
by our quantum-resistant algorithm, which is secure even in the face of a quantum computer. Hence,
our solution offers secure end-to-end communication across the entire network, since it is capable
of both eavesdropping detection and prevention in the emerging quantum internet. It is compatible
with operational networks, and will enjoy the compelling services of the popular Internet, including
authentication. Hence, it smoothens the transition from the classical Internet to the Quantum
Internet (Qinternet) by following a gradual evolutionary upgrade. It will act as an alternative
network in quantum computing networks in the future. We have presented the first experimental demonstration
of a secure classical repeater based hybrid quantum network constructed by a serial concatenation
of an optical fiber and free-space communication link. In conclusion, secure repeater networks
may indeed be constructed using existing technology and continue to support a seamless evolutionary
pathway to the future Qinternet of quantum computers.

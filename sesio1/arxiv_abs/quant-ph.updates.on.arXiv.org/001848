Hohenberg-Kohn (HK) theorem is a cornerstone of modern electronic structure calculations. For
interacting electrons, given that the internal part of the Hamiltonian ($\hat H_{int}$), containing
the kinetic energy and Couloumb interaction of electrons, has a fixed form, the theorem states that
when the electrons are subject to an external electrostatic field, the ground-state density can
inversely determine the field, and thus the full Hamiltonian completely. For a general quantum
system, a HK-type Hamiltonian in the form of $\hat H_{hk}\{g_i\}=\hat H_{int}+\sum_i g_i \hat
O_i$ can always be defined, by grouping those terms with fixed or preknown coefficients into $\hat
H_{int}$, and factorizing the remaining as superposition of a set of Hermitian operators $\{\hat
O_i\}$. We ask whether the HK theorem can be extended, so that the ground-state expectation values
of $\{\hat O_i\}$ as the generalized density can in principle be used as the fundamental variables
determining all the properties of the system. We show that the question can be addressed by introducing
the concept of generalized density correlation matrix (GDCM) defined with respect to the $\{\hat
O_i\}$ operators. The invertibility of the GDCM represents a mathematically rigorous and practically
useful criterion for the extension of HK theorem to be valid. We apply this criterion to several representative
systems, including the quantum Ising dimer, the frustration-free systems, N-level quantum systems
with fixed inter-level transition amplitude and tunable level energies, and a fermionic Hubbard
chain with inhomogeneous on-site interactions. We suggest that for a finite-size system, finding
an invertible GDCM under one single $\{g_i\}$ configuration is typically sufficient to establish
the generic extensibility of the HK theorem in the entire parameter space.

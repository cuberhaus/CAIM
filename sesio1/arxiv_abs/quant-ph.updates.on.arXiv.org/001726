Recording the moving MEGs of a person in which a person's head could move freely as we record the brain's
magnetic field is a hot topic in recent years. Traditionally, atomic magnetometers are utilized
for moving MEGs recording and a large compensation coil system is utilized for background magnetic
field compensation. Here we described a new potential candidate: an optically pumped atomic co-magnetometer(OPACM)
for moving MEGs recording. In the OPACM, hyper-polarized nuclear spins could produce a magnetic
field which will shield the background fluctuation low frequency magnetic field noise while the
the fast changing MEGs signal could be recorded. The nuclear spins look like an automatic magnetic
field shields and dynamically compensate the fluctuated background magnetic field noise. In this
article, the magnetic field compensation is studied theoretically and we find that the compensation
is closely related to several parameters such as the electron spin magnetic field, the nuclear spin
magnetic field and the holding magnetic field. Based on the model, the magnetic field compensation
could be optimized. We also experimentally studied the magnetic field compensation and the responses
of the OPACM to different frequencies of magnetic field are measured. We show that the OPACM owns
a clear suppression of low frequency magnetic field under 1Hz and response to magnetic field's frequencies
around the band of the MEGs. Magnetic field sensitivity of $3fT/Hz^{1/2}$ has been achieved. Finally,
we do a simulation for the OPACM as it is utilized for moving MEGs recording. For comparison, the traditional
compensation system for moving MEGs recording is based on a coil which is around 2m in dimension while
our compensation system is only 2mm in dimension. Moreover, our compensation system could work
in situ and will not affect each other.

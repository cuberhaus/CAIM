We present a unification of mixed-space quantum representations in Condensed Matter Physics (CMP)
and Quantum Field Theory (QFT). The unifying formalism is based on being able to expand any quantum
operator, for bosons, fermions, and spin systems, using a universal basis operator involving mixed
Hilbert spaces of P and Q, respectively, where P and Q are momentum and position operators in CMP (which
can be considered as a bozonization of free Bloch electrons which incorporates the Pauli exclusion
and Fermi-Dirac distribution), whereas these are related to the creation and annihilation operators
in QFT, where {\psi}^{{\dag}}=-iP and {\psi}=Q. The expansion coefficient is the Fourier transform
of the Wigner quantum distribution function (lattice Weyl transform) otherwise known as the characteristic
distribution function. Thus, in principle, bosonization, fermionization and Jordan-Wigner
fermionization for spin systems, as well as the Holstein--Primakoff transformation from boson
operators to the spin operators can be performed depending on the physical situations and ease in
the calculations. In quantum physics, unitary transformation on the creation and annihilation
operators themselves is also employed, as exemplified by the Bogoliubov transformation. Moreover,
whenever Y(u,v) is already expressed in matrix form, M_{ij}, the Jordan--Schwinger transformation
is a map from matrices to bilinear expressions of creation and annihilation operators which expedites
computation of representations. We show that the well-known coherent states formulation of quantum
physics is a special case of the present unification. The case of nonequilibrium quantum transport
physics, which not only involves non-Hermitian operators but also time-reversal symmetry breaking,
is discussed in the Appendix.

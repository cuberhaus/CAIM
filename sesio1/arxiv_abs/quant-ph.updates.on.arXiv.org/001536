Maintaining or even improving gate performance with growing numbers of parallel controlled qubits
is a vital requirement towards fault-tolerant quantum computing. For superconducting quantum
processors, though isolated one- or two-qubit gates have been demonstrated with high-fidelity,
implementing these gates in parallel commonly show worse performance. Generally, this degradation
is attributed to various crosstalks between qubits, such as quantum crosstalk due to residual inter-qubit
coupling. An understanding of the exact nature of these crosstalks is critical to figuring out respective
mitigation schemes and improved qubit architecture designs with low crosstalk. Here we give a theoretical
analysis of quantum crosstalk impact on simultaneous gate operations in a qubit architecture,
where fixed-frequency transmon qubits are coupled via a tunable bus, and sub-100-ns controlled-Z
(CZ) gates can be realized by applying a baseband flux pulse on the bus. Our analysis shows that for
microwave-driven single qubit gates, the dressing from qubit-qubit coupling can cause non-negligible
cross-driving errors when qubits operate near frequency collision regions. During CZ gate operations,
although unwanted near-neighbor interactions are nominally turned off, sub-MHz parasitic next-near-neighbor
interactions involving spectator qubits can still exist, causing considerable leakage or control
error when one operates qubit systems around these parasitic resonance points. To ensure high-fidelity
simultaneous operations, this could rise a request to figure out a better way to balance the gate
error from target qubit systems themselves and the error from non-participating spectator qubits.
Overall, our analysis suggests that towards useful quantum processors, the qubit architecture
should be examined carefully in the context of high-fidelity simultaneous gate operations in a
scalable qubit lattice.

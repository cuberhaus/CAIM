Quantum heat transport devices are currently intensively studied in theory. Experimental realization
of quantum heat transport devices is a challenging task. So far, they have been mostly investigated
in experiments with ultra-cold atoms and single atomic traps. Experiments with superconducting
qubits have also been carried out and heat transport and heat rectification has been studied in two
terminal devices. The structures with three independent terminals offer additional opportunities
for realization of heat transistors, heat switches, on-chip masers and even more complicated devices.
Here we report an experimental realization of a three-terminal photonic heat transport device
based on a superconducting quantum circuit. Its central element is a flux qubit made of a superconducting
loop containing three Josephson junctions, which is connected to three resonators terminated
by resistors. By heating one of the resistors and monitoring the temperatures of the other two, we
determine photonic heat currents in the system and demonstrate their tunability by magnetic field
at the level of 1 aW. We determine system parameters by performing microwave transmission measurements
on a separate nominally identical sample and, in this way, demonstrate clear correlation between
the level splitting of the qubit and the heat currents flowing through it. Our experiment is an important
step in the development of on-chip quantum heat transport devices. On the one hand, such devices
are of great interest for fundamental science because they allow one to investigate the effect of
quantum interference and entanglement on the transport of heat. On the other hand, they also have
great practical importance for the rapidly developing field of quantum computing, in which management
of heat generated by qubits is a problem.

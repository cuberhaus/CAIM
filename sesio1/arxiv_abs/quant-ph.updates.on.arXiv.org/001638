Quantum technologies require methods for preparing and manipulating entangled multiparticle
states. However, the problem of determining whether a given quantum state is entangled or separable
is known to be an NP-hard problem in general, and even the task of detecting entanglement breakdown
for a given class of quantum states is difficult. In this work, we develop an approach for revealing
entanglement breakdown using a machine learning technique, which is known as 'learning by confusion'.
We consider a family of quantum states, which is parameterized such that there is a single critical
value dividing states within this family on separate and entangled. We demonstrate the 'learning
by confusion' scheme allows determining the critical value. Specifically, we study the performance
of the method for the two-qubit, two-qutrit, and two-ququart entangled state, where the standard
entanglement measures do not work efficiently. In addition, we investigate the properties of the
local depolarization and the generalized amplitude damping channel in the framework of the confusion
scheme. Within our approach and setting the parameterization of special trajectories to construct
W shapes, we obtain an entanglement-breakdown 'phase diagram' of a quantum channel, which indicates
regions of entangled (separable) states and the entanglement-breakdown region. Then we extend
the way of using the 'learning by confusion' scheme for recognizing whether an arbitrary given state
is entangled or separable. We show that the developed method provides correct answers for a variety
of states, including entangled states with positive partial transpose (PPT). We also present a
more practical version of the method, which is suitable for studying entanglement breakdown in
noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. We demonstrate its performance using an available
cloud-based IBM quantum processor.

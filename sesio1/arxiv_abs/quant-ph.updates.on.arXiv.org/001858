Entangled photon sources (EPS), the major building block for a variety of quantum communication
protocols, are commonly developed by utilizing the spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC)
in $\chi^{2}$ nonlinear bulk optical materials. While high nonlinearity and long interaction
length have established the superiority of the periodically poled crystals for EPSs, the phase-matching
condition of such crystals is very sensitive to the fluctuation of the crystal temperature and the
laser wavelength. As a result, deploying such sources outside the laboratory, for example, satellite-based
applications, demands a stringent mass and power budget, thus enhancing the mission complexity
and cost. We report a bright, stable entangled photon source with a relaxed requirement of crystal
temperature and laser wavelength stabilization. Using a periodically poled KTP crystal inside
a polarization Sagnac interferometer producing degenerate, type-0 phase-matched entangled
photon pairs at 810 nm in an annular ring, we have transformed the SPDC ring into a "perfect" ring with
the help of two common optical elements, axicon, and lens. Despite the variation of the SPDC ring
size from Gaussian to annular of different diameters due to the change of crystal temperature over
$7^{o}$C, and laser wavelength over 300 GHz, we observe the size of the "perfect" ring to be constant.
The new EPS, having a spectral brightness as high as 22.58 $\pm$ 0.15 kHz/mW collected using single-mode
fiber with a Bell's parameter, S = 2.64 $\pm$ 0.05, and quantum state fidelity of 0.95 $\pm$ 0.02,
requires a crystal temperature stability of $\pm$ $0.8^{o}$C, almost five times relaxation as
compared to the previous EPS. The generic scheme can be used for non-collinear SPDC photons in all
crystals to develop EPS at any wavelength and timescales for resource-constrained applications.

Our goal in this article is to elucidate the rapport of work and information in the context of a minimal
quantum mechanical setup: A converter of heat input to work output, the input consisting of a single
oscillator mode prepared in a hot thermal state along with few much colder oscillator modes. We wish
to achieve heat to work conversion in the setup while avoiding the use of a working substance (medium)
or macroscopic heat baths. The core issues we consider, taking account of the quantum nature of the
setup, are: (i) How and to what extent can information act as work resource or, conversely, be redundant
for work extraction? (ii) What is the optimal way of extracting work via information acquired by
measurements? (iii) What is the bearing of information on the efficiency-power tradeoff achievable
in such setups? We compare the efficiency of work extraction and the limitations of power in our minimal
setup by unitary (reversible) manipulations and by different, generic, measurement strategies
of the hot and cold modes. For each strategy the rapport of work and information extraction is found
and the cost of information erasure is allowed for. The possibilities of work extraction without
information acquisition, via non-selective measurements, are also analyzed. Overall, we present,
by generalizing a method based on optimized homodyning that we have recently proposed, the following
insight: extraction of work by observation and feedforward (WOF) that only measures a small fraction
of the input, is clearly advantageous to the conceivable alternatives. Our results may become a
basis of a practical strategy of converting thermal noise to useful work in optical setups, such
as coherent amplifiers of thermal light, as well as in their optomechanical and photovoltaic counterparts.

Continuum limits are a powerful tool in the study of many-body systems, yet their validity is often
unclear when long-range interactions are present. In this work, we rigorously address this issue
and put forth an exact representation of long-range interacting lattices that separates the model
into a term describing its continuous analogue, the integral contribution, and a term that fully
resolves the microstructure, the lattice contribution. For any system dimension, any lattice,
any power-law interaction and for linear, nonlinear, and multi-atomic lattices, we show that the
lattice contribution can be described by a differential operator based on the multidimensional
generalization of the Riemann zeta function, namely the Epstein zeta function. We determine the
conditions under which this contribution becomes particularly relevant, demonstrating the existence
of quasi scale-invariant lattice contributions in a wide range of fundamental physical phenomena.
Our representation provides a broad set of tools for studying the analytical properties of the system
and it yields an efficient numerical method for the evaluation of the arising lattice sums. We benchmark
its performance by computing classical forces and energies in three important physical examples,
in which the standard continuum approximation fails: Skyrmions in a two-dimensional long-range
interacting spin lattice, defects in ion chains, and spin waves in a three-dimensional pyrochlore
lattice with dipolar interactions. We demonstrate that our method exhibits the accuracy of exact
summation at the numerical cost of an integral approximation, allowing for precise simulations
of long-range interacting systems even at macroscopic scales. We apply our analytical tool set
to the study of quantum spin lattices and derive anomalous quantum spin wave dispersion relations
due to long-range interactions in arbitrary dimensions.

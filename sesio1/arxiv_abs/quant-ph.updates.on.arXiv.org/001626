We propose, formulate and investigate novel closed quantum systems whose unitary time evolutions,
and internal interactions, emerge out of their interlinking quantum memories. In a closed system
of the kind, the unitary evolution operator is updated, moment by moment, upon using the state history
as a compositional resource. The `Quantum Memory Made' Hamiltonians (QMM-Hs) generating these
unitary evolutions are Hermitian operators made of arbitrarily-chosen past-or-present density
operators of the closed system, or its arbitrary subsystems. The dynamics is described by novel
nonlocal-in-time nonlinear von Neumann and Schr\"odinger equations. We establish that all nontrivial
Purely-QMM unitary evolutions are `Robustly Non-Markovian', in the sense that the largest temporal
distance between the compositional quantum memories admit finite lower bounds set by their interaction
couplings. After general formulation and considerations, we take on the sufficiently-complex
task of classifying the phases of one-qubit pure-state evolutions generated by specific choices
of QMM-Hs, combining analytical methods with extensive numerical simulations, and using QMM two-point
functions as natural signature probes. Analyzing Hamiltonians which are purely QMM, and those
combined with the conventional Hamiltonians, we obtain and characterize specific families of
analytical solutions, and then classify generic numerical solutions. We establish that QMM phase
diagrams are outstandingly rich, containing wide classes of novel unitary evolutions with physically
remarkable behaviours. Moreover, we show that QMM interactions give rise to novel purely internal
dynamical phase transitions. We suggest several independent fundamental and applied domains
and disciplines where QMM-UEs can be utilized advantageously.

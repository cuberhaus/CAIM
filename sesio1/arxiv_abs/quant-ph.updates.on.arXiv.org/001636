Spontaneous structural rearrangements play a central role in the organization and function of
complex biomolecular systems. In principle, physics-based computer simulations like Molecular
Dynamics (MD) enable us to investigate these thermally activated processes with an atomic level
of resolution. However, rare conformational transitions are intrinsically hard to investigate
with MD, because an exponentially large fraction of computational resources must be invested to
simulate thermal fluctuations in metastable states. Path sampling methods like Transition Path
Sampling hold the great promise of focusing the available computational power on sampling the rare
stochastic transition between metastable states. In these approaches, one of the outstanding
limitations is to generate paths that visit significantly different regions of the conformational
space at a low computational cost. To overcome these problems we introduce a rigorous approach that
integrates a machine learning algorithm and MD simulations implemented on a classical computer
with adiabatic quantum computing. First, using functional integral methods, we derive a rigorous
low-resolution representation of the system's dynamics, based on a small set of molecular configurations
generated with machine learning. Then, a quantum annealing machine is employed to explore the transition
path ensemble of this low-resolution theory, without introducing un-physical biasing forces
to steer the system's dynamics. Using the D-Wave quantum computer, we validate our scheme by simulating
a benchmark conformational transition in a state-of-the-art atomistic description. We show that
the quantum computing step generates uncorrelated trajectories, thus facilitating the sampling
of the transition region in configuration space. Our results provide a new paradigm for MD simulations
to integrate machine learning and quantum computing.

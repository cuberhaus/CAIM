Quantum information theorists have created axiomatic reconstructions of quantum mechanics (QM)
that are very successful at identifying precisely what distinguishes quantum probability theory
from classical and more general probability theories in terms of information-theoretic principles.
Herein, we show how one such principle, Information Invariance & Continuity, at the foundation
of those axiomatic reconstructions maps to "no preferred reference frame" (NPRF, aka "the relativity
principle") as it pertains to the invariant measurement of Planck's constant h for Stern-Gerlach
(SG) spin measurements. This is in exact analogy to the relativity principle as it pertains to the
invariant measurement of the speed of light c at the foundation of special relativity (SR). Essentially,
quantum information theorists have extended Einstein's use of NPRF from the boost invariance of
measurements of c to include the SO(3) invariance of measurements of h between different reference
frames of mutually complementary spin measurements via the principle of Information Invariance
& Continuity. Consequently, the "mystery" of the Bell states that is responsible for the Tsirelson
bound and the exclusion of the no-signalling, "superquantum" Popescu-Rohrlich joint probabilities
is understood to result from conservation per Information Invariance & Continuity between different
reference frames of mutually complementary qubit measurements, and this maps to conservation
per NPRF in spacetime. If one falsely conflates the relativity principle with the classical theory
of SR, then it may seem impossible that the relativity principle resides at the foundation of non-relativisitic
QM. In fact, there is nothing inherently classical or quantum about NPRF. Thus, the axiomatic reconstructions
of QM have succeeded in producing a principle account of QM that reveals as much about Nature as the
postulates of SR.

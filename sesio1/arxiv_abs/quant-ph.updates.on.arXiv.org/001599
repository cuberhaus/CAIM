In previous research, we showed that 'texts that tell a story' exhibit a statistical structure that
is not Maxwell-Boltzmann but Bose-Einstein. Our explanation is that this is due to the presence
of 'indistinguishability' in human language as a result of the same words in different parts of the
story being indistinguishable from one another. In the current article, we set out to provide an
explanation for this Bose-Einstein statistics. We show that it is the presence of 'meaning' in 'stories'
that gives rise to the lack of independence characteristic of Bose-Einstein, and provides conclusive
evidence that 'words can be considered the quanta of human language', structurally similar to how
'photons are the quanta of light'. Using several studies on entanglement from our Brussels research
group, we also show that it is also the presence of 'meaning' in texts that makes the von Neumann entropy
of a total text smaller relative to the entropy of the words composing it. We explain how the new insights
in this article fit in with the research domain called 'quantum cognition', where quantum probability
models and quantum vector spaces are used in human cognition, and are also relevant to the use of quantum
structures in information retrieval and natural language processing, and how they introduce 'quantization'
and 'Bose-Einstein statistics' as relevant quantum effects there. Inspired by the conceptuality
interpretation of quantum mechanics, and relying on the new insights, we put forward hypotheses
about the nature of physical reality. In doing so, we note how this new type of decrease in entropy,
and its explanation, may be important for the development of quantum thermodynamics. We likewise
note how it can also give rise to an original explanatory picture of the nature of physical reality
on the surface of planet Earth, in which human culture emerges as a reinforcing continuation of life.

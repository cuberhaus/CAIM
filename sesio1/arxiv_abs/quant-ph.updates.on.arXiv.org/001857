The semi-classical gravity sourced by the quantum expectation value of the matter's energy-momentum
tensor will change the evolution of the quantum state of matter. This effect can be described by the
Schroedinger-Newton (SN) equation, where the semi-classical gravity contributes a gravitational
potential term depending on the matter quantum state. This state-dependent potential introduces
the complexity of the quantum state evolution and measurement in SN theory, which is different for
different quantum measurement prescriptions. Previous theoretical investigations on the SN-theory
phenomenology in the optomechanical experimental platform were carried out under the so-called
post/pre-selection prescription. This work will focus on the phenomenology of SN theory under
the causal-conditional prescription, which fits the standard intuition on the continuous quantum
measurement process. Under the causal-conditional prescription, the quantum state of the test
mass mirrors is conditionally and continuously prepared by the projection of the outgoing light
field in the optomechanical system. Therefore a gravitational potential depends on the quantum
trajectory is created and further affects the system evolution. In this work, we will systematically
study various experimentally measurable signatures of SN theory under the causal-conditional
prescription in an optomechanical system, for both the self-gravity and the mutual gravity scenarios.
Comparisons between the SN phenomenology under three different prescriptions will also be carefully
made. Moreover, we find that quantum measurement can induce a classical correlation between two
different optical fields via classical gravity, which is difficult to be distinguished from the
quantum correlation of light fields mediated by quantum gravity.

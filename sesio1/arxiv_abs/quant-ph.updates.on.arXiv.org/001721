We present a generalized echo squeezing protocol (GESP) as a generalization of the Schr\"odinger
cat state protocol (SCSP) with the value of the squeezing parameter being an arbitrary number rather
than pi/2. We show analytically that over a broad range of the squeezing parameter the sensitivity
reaches the Heisenberg limit within a factor of root-2. For a large number of particles, N, this plateau
interval is almost the whole range from zero to pi/2, and the sensitivity is independent of the parity
of N. Therefore, it is possible to operate a sensor over wide interval of the squeezing parameter
without changing the sensitivity. This is to be contrasted with the conventional echo squeezing
protocol (CESP) which only works for a very small interval of the squeezing parameter. We also show
that, in contrast to the CESP, the sensitivity of the GESP is close to the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound
over the whole range of the squeezing parameter, indicating that the phase shift information is
near-optimally extracted. We find that the enhancement in sensitivity in the case of the GESP is
due to a combination of two parameters: the phase magnification (PMF) and the noise amplification
factor (NAF). As the value of the squeezing parameter increases, both PMF and NAF increase, while
keeping the ratio of PMF/NAF essentially constant, yielding a net enhancement of sensitivity that
at the Heisenberg limit within a factor of root-2 over the whole plateau interval. An important consequence
of this behavior is that the robustness of the GESP against excess noise easily exceeds that of the
CESP for a broad range of values of the squeezing parameter. As such, in the context of an experimental
study, it should be possible to achieve a net enhancement in sensitivity higher than that for the
CESP, under typical conditions where the excess noise exceeds the unsqueezed quantum projection
noise.

In the histories formulation of quantum theory, sets of coarse-grained histories, that are called
consistent, obey classical probability rules. It has been argued that these sets can describe the
semi-classical behaviour of closed quantum systems. Most physical scenarios admit multiple different
consistent sets and one can view each consistent set as a separate context. Using propositions from
different consistent sets to make inferences leads to paradoxes such as the contrary inferences
first noted by Kent [Physical Review Letters, 78(15):2874, 1997]. Proponents of the consistent
histories formulation argue that one should not mix propositions coming from different consistent
sets in making logical arguments, and that paradoxes such as the aforementioned contrary inferences
are nothing else than the usual microscopic paradoxes of quantum contextuality as first demonstrated
by Kochen and Specker theorem. In this contribution we use the consistent histories to describe
a macroscopic (semi-classical) system to show that paradoxes involving contextuality (mixing
different consistent sets) persist even in the semi-classical limit. This is distinctively different
from the contextuality of standard quantum theory, where the contextuality paradoxes do not persist
in the semi-classical limit. Specifically, we consider different consistent sets for the arrival
time of a semi-classical wave packet in an infinite square well. Surprisingly, we get consistent
sets that disagree on whether the motion of the semi-classical system, that started within a subregion,
ever left that subregion or not. Our results point to the need for constraints, additional to the
consistency condition, to recover the correct semi-classical limit in this formalism and lead
to the motto `all consistent sets are equal', but `some consistent sets are more equal than others'.

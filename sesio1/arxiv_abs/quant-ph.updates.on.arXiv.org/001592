Quantum walks function as essential means to implement quantum simulators, allowing one to study
complex and often directly inaccessible quantum processes in controllable systems. In this contribution,
the new notion of a driven Gaussian quantum walk is introduced. In contrast to typically considered
quantum walks in optical settings, we describe the operation of the walk in terms of a nonlinear map
rather than a unitary operation, e.g., by replacing a beam-splitter-type coin with a two-mode squeezer,
being a process that is controlled and driven by a pump field. This opens previously unattainable
possibilities for kinds of quantum walks that include nonlinear elements as core components of
their operation, vastly extending the range of applications of quantum simulators. A full framework
for driven Gaussian quantum walks is developed, including methods to characterize nonlinear,
quantum, and quantum-nonlinear effects in measurements. Moreover, driven Gaussian quantum walks
are compared with their classically interfering and linear counterparts, which are based on classical
coherence of light rather than quantum superpositions of states. In particular, the generation
and amplification of highly multimode entanglement, squeezing, and other quantum effects are
studied over the duration of the nonlinear walk. Importantly, we prove the quantumness of the dynamics
itself, regardless of the input state. Furthermore, nonlinear properties of driven Gaussian quantum
walks are explored, such as amplification that leads to an ever increasing number of correlated
quantum particles, constituting a source of new walkers during a walk. Therefore, the concept for
quantum walks is proposed that leads to directly accessible quantum phenomena and renders the quantum
simulation of nonlinear processes possible.

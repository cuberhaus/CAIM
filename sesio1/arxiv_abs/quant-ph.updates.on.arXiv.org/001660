It is well known that the quantum switch is an example of the indefinite causal order. Recently, the
applications of the quantum switch on quantum channels have become a hot topic of discussion. It
has been observed that it is possible to achieve significant improvement in communication when
a quantum switch is applied on quantum channels. Although, while the above-said improvement is
not possible for all quantum channels, for some quantum channels, the improvement can be very high.
One such example has been discussed in [New J. of Phys. \textbf{23}, 033039 (2021)] where perfect
communication through an entanglement-breaking channel has been achieved with the help of the
switch. But incidentally, such a channel is unique up to unitary transformations. Therefore, it
is important to study the applications of a quantum switch on other quantum channels where improvement
may not be ultimate but significant. Here, we study the applications of the quantum switch on various
quantum channels. In particular, we show that if it is not possible to achieve improvement deterministically,
it may be possible to achieve improvement probabilistically. It is known that if a quantum channel
is useless for an information-theoretic task, concatenation generally does not provide any advantage.
We have shown that if a quantum channel is useless even after the use of the quantum switch, concatenation
of quantum channels can make it useful. We also show that the quantum switch can help to get the quantum
advantage in quantum random access code as well as it can help in demonstrating quantum steering
even when only useless channels are available for communication. We demonstrate that the quantum
switch can also be useful in preventing the loss of coherence in a quantum system. Finally, we also
discuss the fact that if noise is introduced in the switch, then the improvement can be significantly
decreased.

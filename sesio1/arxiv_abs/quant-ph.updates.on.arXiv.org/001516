The effect of instantaneous spectral diffusion (ISD) on gate operations in rare-earth-ion-doped
crystals is an important question to answer for the future of rare-earth quantum computing. ISD
has previously been extensively studied for ensemble systems, where it is observed as a dephasing
that depends on the degree of excitation. However, for applications that use single ions, a microscopic
modeling that highlights the stochastic nature of the ISD phenomena is necessary. Here we present
such a model and use it to investigate ISD errors on single-qubit gate operations. However, directly
simulating how the qubit is affected by all non-qubit ions is intractable since the size of the system
grows exponentially with the number of ions. To circumvent this problem, we present a method to estimate
the error of the full system by examining smaller subsystems, each evaluating the rotation and shrinkage
of the qubit Bloch vector due to only one error source. In the case of ISD, the different error sources
are individual ions causing ISD, but the method is general and thus applicable to other systems as
long as the errors are largely independent. After studying ISD due to the ions surrounding a qubit,
we conclude that transmission windows (prepared by optical pumping) are necessary to suppress
the ISD errors. Despite using such windows, there remains a roughly $0.3\%$ risk that a qubit has
an ISD error larger than the error from other sources. However, in those cases the qubit can be discarded
and its frequency channel can be reused by another qubit. In most cases the ISD errors are significantly
smaller than other errors, thus opening up the possibility to perform noisy intermediate-scale
quantum (NISQ) algorithms despite ISD being present. Finally, the approach presented here creates
a foundation that can be used to study how ISD affects even more complicated gate operations.

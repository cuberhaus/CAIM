Thermodynamics provides a universal means to study physical systems from an energetic perspective.
In recent years, the notions of thermodynamics have been generalized to small fluctuating systems,
establishing the field of stochastic and quantum thermodynamics. Independently developed in
mathematics and statistics, optimal transport theory concerns how to optimally transport a source
distribution to a target distribution, deriving a useful metric between probability distributions
called the Wasserstein distance. Despite their seemingly unrelated nature, an intimate connection
between these fields has been unveiled in the context of continuous-state Langevin dynamics, providing
many important implications for nonequilibrium systems. In this study, we elucidate an analogous
connection for the discrete case by developing a thermodynamic framework for discrete optimal
transport. We first introduce a novel quantity named the dynamical state mobility, which significantly
improves the thermodynamic uncertainty relation and provides insight into the precision of currents
in nonequilibrium Markov jump processes. We then derive variational formulas that connect the
discrete Wasserstein distances to stochastic and quantum thermodynamics of discrete Markovian
dynamics described by the master equations. Specifically, we rigorously prove that the Wasserstein
distance equals the minimum product of the irreversible entropy production and dynamical state
mobility over all admissible Markovian dynamics. These formulas not only unify the relationship
between thermodynamics and the optimal transport theory for the discrete and continuous cases
but also generalize it to the quantum case. In addition, we show that the obtained variational formulas
lead to remarkable applications in stochastic and quantum thermodynamics, such as stringent thermodynamic
speed limits and the finite-time Landauer principle.

Recent electron spin resonance experiments on CaWO$_4$:Gd$^{3+}$ and on other magnetic impurities
have demonstrated that sustained Rabi oscillations can be created by driving a magnetic moment
with a microwave field frequency slightly larger than the Larmor frequency and tuned to the Floquet
resonance together with another microwave field (image drive). These observations are confirmed
by the new experimental results reported in this paper. We investigate several mechanisms of decoherence
and dissipation by using a combination of numerical and analytical techniques. The first microscopic
model describes a magnetic moment in external magnetic fields, interacting with a bath of two-level
systems acting as a source of decoherence and dissipation. The second model describes a collection
of the identical, interacting magnetics moments, all subject to the same magnetic fields. In this
case, the many-body interactions causes a decay of the Rabi oscillations. In addition, we also study
the effect of the inhomogeneity of the microwave radiation on the decay of the Rabi oscillations.
Our simulation results show that the dynamics of a magnetic moment subject to the two microwave fields
with different frequencies and in contact with an environment is highly nontrivial. We show that
under appropriate conditions, and in particular at the Floquet resonance, the magnetization exhibits
sustained Rabi oscillations, in some cases with additional beatings. Although these two microscopic
models separately describe the experimental data well, a simulation study that simultaneously
accounts for both types of interactions is currently prohibitively costly. To gain further insight
into the microscopic dynamics of these two different models, we study the time dependence of the
bath and system energy and of the correlations of the spins, data that is not readily accessible experimentally.

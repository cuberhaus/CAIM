Bell inequality tests where the detection efficiency is below a certain threshold $\eta$ can be
simulated with local hidden-variable models. For the CHSH Bell inequality and maximally entangled
states, $\eta = 0.828$. Massar noticed that $\eta$ can tend to zero as the dimension $d$ grows, but
found no advantage except for $d>1600$. V\'ertesi et al. lowered $\eta$ down to $0.770$ using $d=4$.
M\'arton et al. obtained an upper bound of $0.693$ for $d=16$. Recently, Miklin et al. have presented
a strategy that allows us to reduce $\eta$ down to $0.469$ for $d=512$. Here, we introduce a method
to identify Bell tests requiring low $\eta$ and relatively low $d$. The method has two steps. First,
we show a family of bipartite Bell inequalities for which $\eta$ is a function of some invariants
of a certain type of graphs, and use it to identify correlations that require small $\eta$ for maximally
entangled states. We present examples in which $\eta = 0.421$ for $d=16$, $\eta = 0.285$ for $d=28$,
and $\eta = 0.192$ for $d=32$. We also show evidence that $\eta$ can be lowered down to $0.294$ for
$d=16$ and present a method to make $\eta$ arbitrarily small by increasing the dimension and the
number of settings. The second step is based on the observation that, using the initial state and
measurement settings identified in the first step, we can construct Bell inequalities with smaller
$\eta$ and better noise robustness. For that, we use a modified version of Gilbert's algorithm that
takes advantage of the automorphisms of the graphs used in the first step. We illustrate its power
by explicitly developing an example in which $\eta$ is $12\%$ lower and the required visibility
is $14.6\%$ lower than the ones required after the first step. The tools presented here pave the way
for high-dimensional loophole-free Bell tests and loophole-free Bell nonlocality over long distances.

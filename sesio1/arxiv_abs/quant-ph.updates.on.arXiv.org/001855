Simulating fermionic systems on a quantum computer requires a high-performing mapping of fermionic
states to qubits. The key characteristic of an efficient mapping is its ability to translate local
fermionic interactions into local qubit interactions, leading to easy-to-simulate qubit Hamiltonians.
Improvements in the locality of fermion-qubit mappings have traditionally come at higher resource
costs elsewhere, such as in the form of a significant number of additional qubits. We present a new
way to design fermion-qubit mappings by making use of the extra degree of freedom: the choice of numbering
scheme for the fermionic modes, a feature all mappings must have. This allows us to minimse the average
Pauli weight of a qubit Hamiltonian -- its average number of Pauli matrices per term. Our approach
leads to a rigorous notion of optimality by viewing fermion-qubit mappings as functions of their
enumeration schemes. Furthermore, finding the best enumeration scheme allows one to increase
the locality of the target qubit Hamiltonian without expending any additional resources. Minimising
the average Pauli weight of a mapping is an NP-complete problem in general. We show how one solution,
Mitchison and Durbin's enumeration pattern, leads to a qubit Hamiltonian for simulating the square
fermionic lattice consisting of terms with an average Pauli weight 13.9% shorter than previously
any previously known. Adding just two ancilla qubits, we can reduce the average Pauli weight of Hamiltonian
terms by 37.9% on square lattices compared to previous methods. Lastly, we demonstrate the potential
of our techniques to polynomially reduce the average Pauli weight by exhibiting $n$-mode fermionic
systems where optimisation yields patterns that achieve $n^{\frac{1}{4}}$ improvement in average
Pauli weight over na\"ive enumeration schemes.

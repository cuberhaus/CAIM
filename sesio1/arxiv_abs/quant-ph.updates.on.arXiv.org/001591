Local realism has been superseded by recent theoretical and experimental developments in quantum
physics which show a synchronic connection between the parts. In contrast to the principle of local
realism, which is the basis of classical reductionism, I have called the principle of non-locality
at the basis of a new method of scientific investigation "synchronic principle". The synchronic
principle introduces a new element in the approach to reality, which with anthropomorphic terms
we could call "conscious choice". In a synchronic paradigm, evolution does not occur in a deterministic
way, but is characterized by a certain intrinsic freedom of choice that we associate with awareness.
Considerations based on the evolution of the universe towards the emergence of life lead us to think
that this "awareness" also exists in the vacuum state: in the model I proposed a definition of the
agents of consciousness in terms of arrays of correlated qu-bit, from the simplest consisting of
6 qu-bits of the quantum vacuum (which result as a superposition of 64 base states), up to the most
complex organisms consisting of a very large number of correlated quantum bits. Some of the fundamental
vacuum states of consciousness can be related to known elementary particles (leptons and quarks)
and to fundamental interactions. The rest constitute purely non-local elements of consciousness
with no counterpart in terms of wave or particle within the local observation limit. In this model,
consciousness processes quantum information through logic gates and collapses as a result of observations,
like a quantum computer does. Synchronicity does not in deny the conclusions reached by traditional
science can be used at the local level, but opens scientific knowledge to new possibilities, and
invites us to look at the world through a different, not local awareness.

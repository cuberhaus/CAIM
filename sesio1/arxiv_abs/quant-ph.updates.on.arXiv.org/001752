In the quantum computation verification problem, a quantum server wants to convince a client that
the output of evaluating a quantum circuit $C$ is some result that it claims. This problem is considered
very important both theoretically and practically in quantum computation [arXiv:1709.06984],
[arXiv:1704.04487], [arXiv:1209.0449]. The client is considered to be limited in computational
power, and one desirable property is that the client can be completely classical, which leads to
the classical verification of quantum computation (CVQC) problem. In terms of the total time complexity,
the fastest single-server CVQC protocol so far has complexity $O(poly(\kappa)|C|^3)$ where $|C|$
is the size of the circuit to be verified and $\kappa$ is the security parameter, given by Mahadev
[arXiv:1804.01082]. In this work, by developing new techniques, we give a new CVQC protocol with
complexity $O(poly(\kappa)|C|)$, which is significantly faster than existing protocols. Our
protocol is secure in the quantum random oracle model [arXiv:1008.0931] assuming the existence
of noisy trapdoor claw-free functions [arXiv:1804.00640], which are both extensively used assumptions
in quantum cryptography. Along the way, we also give a new classical channel remote state preparation
protocol for states in $\{|+_\theta\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle+e^{i\theta\pi/4}|1\rangle):\theta\in
\{0,1\cdots 7\}\}$, another basic primitive in quantum cryptography. Our protocol allows for
parallel verifiable preparation of $L$ independently random states in this form (up to a constant
overall error and a possibly unbounded server-side isometry), and runs in only $O(poly(\kappa)L)$
time and constant rounds; for comparison, existing works (even for possibly simpler state families)
all require very large or unestimated time and round complexities [arXiv:1904.06320][arXiv:1904.06303][arXiv:2201.13445][arXiv:2201.13430].

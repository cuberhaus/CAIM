There has been significant progress in the development of quantum algorithms for solving linear
systems of equations with a growing body of applications to Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
and CFD-like problems. This work extends previous work by developing a non-linear hybrid quantum-classical
CFD solver and using it to generate fully converged solutions. The hybrid solver uses the SIMPLE
CFD algorithm, which is common in many industrial CFD codes, and applies it to the 2-dimensional
lid driven cavity test case. A theme of this work is the classical processing time needed to prepare
the quantum circuit with a focus on the decomposition of the CFD matrix into a linear combination
of unitaries (LCU). CFD meshes with up to 65x65 nodes are considered with the largest producing a
LCU containing 32,767 Pauli strings. A new method for rapidly re-computing the coefficients in
a LCU is proposed, although this reduces, rather than eliminates, the classical scaling issues.
The quantum linear equation solver uses the Harrow, Hassidim, Lloyd (HHL) algorithm via a state-vector
emulator. Test matrices are sampled from the classical CFD solver to investigate the solution accuracy
that can be achieved with HHL. For the smallest 5x5 and 9x9 CFD meshes, full non-linear hybrid CFD
calculations are performed. The impacts of approximating the LCU and the varying the number of ancilla
rotations in the eigenvalue inversion circuit are studied. Preliminary timing results indicate
that the classical computer preparation time needed for a hybrid solver is just as important to the
achievement of quantum advantage in CFD as the time on the quantum computer. The reported HHL solutions
and LCU decompositions provide a benchmark for future research. The CFD test matrices used in this
study are available upon request.

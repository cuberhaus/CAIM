Macrorealism (MR) is the world-view that at all moments of time, a system is definitely in one of the
observable states available to it, irrespective of past or future measurements. The Leggett-Garg
(LG) inequalities were introduced to test MR and assess for the presence of macroscopic quantum
coherence. Since such effects could plausibly be found in various types of macroscopic oscillators,
we apply the LG approach to the quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) and more general bound systems,
using a single dichotomic variable Q given by the sign of the oscillator position. We present a simple
method to calculate the relevant temporal correlators for any bound system for which the energy
eigenspectrum is (exactly or numerically) known. We then apply this result to the QHO for a variety
of experimentally accessible states, namely energy eigenstates, and superpositions thereof.
For the subspace of states spanned by only the ground state and first excited state, we readily find
substantial regions of parameter space in which the two and three-time LG inequalities can each
be independently violated or satisfied. We find violations persist (although are reduced) when
the sign function defining Q is smeared to reflect experimental imprecision. We also find that LG
violations diminish at high energies, showing the expected classicalization. With a Q defined
as an arbitrary position coarse graining, we find two-time LG violations even in the ground state,
a simple example of a feature recently noted by Bose et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 210402 (2018)].
We also show that two-time LG violations in a gaussian state are readily found if the dichotomic variable
at one of the times is taken to be the parity operator. To demonstrate the versatility of the technique
we developed, we perform an LG analysis for the Morse potential, where we find significant violations
for the first excited state.

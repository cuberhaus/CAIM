The feasibility of coexisting a quantum channel with carrier-grade classical optical channels
over Hollow Core Nested Antiresonant Nodeless Fibre (HC-NANF) is experimentally explored for
the first time in terms of achievable quantum bit error rate (QBER), secret key rate (SKR) as well
as classical signal bit error rates (BER). A coexistence transmission of 1.6 Tbps is achieved for
the classical channels simultaneously with a quantum channel over a 2 km-long HC-NANF with a total
coexistence power of 0 dBm. To find the best and worst wavelength position for the classical channels,
we simulated different classical channels bands with different spacing between the quantum and
classical channels considering the crosstalk generated from both Raman scattering and four-wave-mixing
(FWM) on the quantum channel. Following our simulation, we numerically estimate the best (Raman
spectrum dip) and worst locations (Raman spectrum peak) of the classical channel with respect to
its impact on the performance on the quantum channel in terms of SKR and QBER. We further implemented
a testbed to experimentally test both single mode fibre (SMF) and HC-NANF in the best and worst-case
scenarios. In the best-case scenario, the spacing between quantum and classical is 200 GHz (1.6
nm) with 50 GHz (0.4 nm) spacing between each classical channel. The SKR was preserved without any
noticeable changes when coexisting the quantum channel with eight classical channels at 0 dBm total
coexistence power in HC-NANF compared to a significant drop of 73% when using SMF at -24 dBm total
coexistence power which is 250 times lower than the power used in HC-NANF. In the worst-case scenario
using the same powers, and with 1 THz (8 nm) spacing between quantum and classical channels, the SKR
dropped 10% using the HC-NANF, whereas in the SMF the SKR plummeted to zero.

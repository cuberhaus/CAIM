The variational quantum eigensolver (or VQE) uses the variational principle to compute the ground
state energy of a Hamiltonian, a problem that is central to quantum chemistry and condensed matter
physics. Conventional computing methods are constrained in their accuracy due to the computational
limits. The VQE may be used to model complex wavefunctions in polynomial time, making it one of the
most promising near-term applications for quantum computing. Finding a path to navigate the relevant
literature has rapidly become an overwhelming task, with many methods promising to improve different
parts of the algorithm. Despite strong theoretical underpinnings suggesting excellent scaling
of individual VQE components, studies have pointed out that their various pre-factors could be
too large to reach a quantum computing advantage over conventional methods. This review aims to
provide an overview of the progress that has been made on the different parts of the algorithm. All
the different components of the algorithm are reviewed in detail including representation of Hamiltonians
and wavefunctions on a quantum computer, the optimization process, the post-processing mitigation
of errors, and best practices are suggested. We identify four main areas of future research:(1)
optimal measurement schemes for reduction of circuit repetitions; (2) large scale parallelization
across many quantum computers;(3) ways to overcome the potential appearance of vanishing gradients
in the optimization process, and how the number of iterations required for the optimization scales
with system size; (4) the extent to which VQE suffers for quantum noise, and whether this noise can
be mitigated. The answers to these open research questions will determine the routes for the VQE
to achieve quantum advantage as the quantum computing hardware scales up and as the noise levels
are reduced.

Quantum Neural Network (QNN) is a promising application towards quantum advantage on near-term
quantum hardware. However, due to the large quantum noises (errors), the performance of QNN models
has a severe degradation on real quantum devices. For example, the accuracy gap between noise-free
simulation and noisy results on IBMQ-Yorktown for MNIST-4 classification is over 60%. Existing
noise mitigation methods are general ones without leveraging unique characteristics of QNN and
are only applicable to inference; on the other hand, existing QNN work does not consider noise effect.
To this end, we present RoQNN, a QNN-specific framework to perform noise-aware optimizations in
both training and inference stages to improve robustness. We analytically deduct and experimentally
observe that the effect of quantum noise to QNN measurement outcome is a linear map from noise-free
outcome with a scaling and a shift factor. Motivated by that, we propose post-measurement normalization
to mitigate the feature distribution differences between noise-free and noisy scenarios. Furthermore,
to improve the robustness against noise, we propose noise injection to the training process by inserting
quantum error gates to QNN according to realistic noise models of quantum hardware. Finally, post-measurement
quantization is introduced to quantize the measurement outcomes to discrete values, achieving
the denoising effect. Extensive experiments on 8 classification tasks using 6 quantum devices
demonstrate that RoQNN improves accuracy by up to 43%, and achieves over 94% 2-class, 80% 4-class,
and 34% 10-class MNIST classification accuracy measured on real quantum computers. We also open-source
our PyTorch library for construction and noise-aware training of QNN at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/pytorch-quantum

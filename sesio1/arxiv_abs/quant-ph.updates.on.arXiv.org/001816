Zitterbewegung of massless particles with an arbitrary spin is analyzed in various representations.
Dynamics of the group velocity of a massless particle as a whole and of the corresponding radius vector
is determined. This radius vector defines any fixed point of the envelope of the moving wave packet
characterizing the particle and its group velocity differs from the group velocities of any points
of the wavefront. We consider free massless scalar and Dirac particles, the photon, and massive
and massless particles with an arbitrary spin and describe them in different representations.
For particles with an arbitrary spin, the generalized Feshbach-Villars representation and the
Foldy-Wouthuysen one are used. Zitterbewegung takes place in any representation except for the
Foldy-Wouthuysen one. Formulas describing the motion of a "trembling" free particle are the same
in any representation. In the Foldy-Wouthuysen representation, the operators of the velocity
and momentum of a free particle are proportional and Zitterbewegung does not take place. Since the
radius vector (position) and velocity operators are the quantum-mechanical counterparts of the
classical position and velocity just in the Foldy-Wouthuysen representation, Zitterbewegung
is not observable. The same conclusion has been previously made for free massive particles. For
relativistic massive particles with spins 0, 1/2, 1 and massless particles with spins 0, 1/2 in arbitrarily
strong electromagnetic fields, independent of the external fields Zitterbewegung does not appear
in the Foldy-Wouthuysen representation either. This conclusion is made for leading terms in the
Hamiltonian proportional to the zero and first powers of the Planck constant and for such terms proportional
to $\hbar^2$ which describe contact interactions.

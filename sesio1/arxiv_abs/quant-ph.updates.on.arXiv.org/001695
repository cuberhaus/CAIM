A quantum computer can perform exponentially faster than its classical counterpart. It works on
the principle of superposition. But due to the decoherence effect, the superposition of a quantum
state gets destroyed by the interaction with the environment. It is a real challenge to completely
isolate a quantum system to make it free of decoherence. This problem can be circumvented by the use
of topological quantum phases of matter. These phases have quasiparticles excitations called
anyons. The anyons are charge-flux composites and show exotic fractional statistics. When the
order of exchange matters, then the anyons are called non-Abelian anyons. Majorana fermions in
topological superconductors and quasiparticles in some quantum Hall states are non-Abelian anyons.
Such topological phases of matter have a ground state degeneracy. The fusion of two or more non-Abelian
anyons can result in a superposition of several anyons. The topological quantum gates are implemented
by braiding and fusion of the non-Abelian anyons. The fault-tolerance is achieved through the topological
degrees of freedom of anyons. Such degrees of freedom are non-local, hence inaccessible to the local
perturbations. In this paper, the Hilbert space for a topological qubit is discussed. The Ising
and Fibonacci anyonic models for binary gates are briefly given. Ternary logic gates are more compact
than their binary counterparts and naturally arise in a type of anyonic model called the metaplectic
anyons. The mathematical model, for the fusion and braiding matrices of metaplectic anyons, is
the quantum deformation of the recoupling theory. We proposed that the existing quantum ternary
arithmetic gates can be realized by braiding and topological charge measurement of the metaplectic
anyons.

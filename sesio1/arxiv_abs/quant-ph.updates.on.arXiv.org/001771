It is well-known that in a Bell experiment, the observed correlation between measurement outcomes
-- as predicted by quantum theory -- can be stronger than that allowed by local causality, yet not
fully constrained by the principle of relativistic causality. In practice, the characterization
of the set $Q$ of quantum correlations is carried out, often, through a converging hierarchy of outer
approximations. On the other hand, some subsets of $Q$ arising from additional constraints [e.g.,
originating from quantum states having positive-partial-transposition (PPT) or being finite-dimensional
maximally entangled (MES)] turn out to be also amenable to similar numerical characterizations.
How, then, at a quantitative level, are all these naturally restricted subsets of nonsignaling
correlations different? Here, we consider several bipartite Bell scenarios and numerically estimate
their volume relative to that of the set of nonsignaling correlations. Within the number of cases
investigated, we have observed that (1) for a given number of inputs $n_s$ (outputs $n_o$), the fraction
of both the Bell-local set and the quantum set increases (decreases) rapidly with increasing $n_o$
($n_s$) (2) although the so-called macroscopically local set $Q_1$ may approximate $Q$ well in
the two-input scenarios, it can be a very poor approximation of the quantum set when $n_s>n_o$ (3)
the almost-quantum set $\tilde{Q}_1$ is an exceptionally-good approximation to the quantum set
(4) the difference between $Q$ and the set of correlations originating from MES is most significant
when $n_o=2$, whereas (5) the difference between the Bell-local set and the PPT set generally becomes
more significant with increasing $n_o$. This last comparison, in particular, allows us to identify
Bell scenarios where there is little hope of realizing the Bell violation by PPT states and those
that deserve further exploration.

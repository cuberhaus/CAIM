Condensed matter physics and quantum electrodynamics (QED) have been long considered as distinct
disciplines. This situation is changing by the progress in cavity QED materials. Motivated by these
advances we aim to bridge these fields by merging fundamental concepts coming from both sides. In
the first part of the thesis we present how non-relativistic QED can be constructed and we discuss
the light-matter interaction in different gauges and that neglecting particular quadratic terms
can lead to instabilities. In the second part, we revisit the Sommerfeld model of the free electron
gas in cavity QED and provide the analytic solution for this paradigmatic system coupled to the cavity.
We show that the cavity field modifies the optical conductivity of the electron gas and suppresses
its Drude peak. Further, by constructing an effective field theory in the continuum of photon modes
we show how the photon field leads to a many-body renormalization of the electron mass, which modifies
the fermionic quasiparticle excitations of the Fermi liquid. In the last part, we show that translational
symmetry for periodic materials in homogeneous magnetic fields can be restored by embedding the
problem into QED. This leads to a generalization of Bloch's theory for electron-photon systems,
that we named as QED-Bloch theory, which can be applied for the description of periodic materials
in homogeneous magnetic fields and strongly coupled to the quantized cavity field. As a first application
we consider Landau levels coupled to a cavity and we show that quasiparticle excitations between
Landau levels and photons appear, called Landau polaritons. Further, for periodic materials in
such setups, QED-Bloch theory predicts the emergence of novel fractal polaritonic energy spectra,
which we name as fractal polaritons. The fractal polaritons are a polaritonic, QED analogue of the
Hofstadter butterfly.

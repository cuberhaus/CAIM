It is well-known that the precision of a phase measurement with a Mach-Zehnder interferometer employing
strong (macroscopic) classic light can be greatly enhanced with the addition of a weak (microscopic)
light field in a non-classical state. The resulting precision is much greater than that possible
with either the macroscopic classical or microscopic quantum states alone. In the context of quantifying
non-classicality, the amount by which a non-classical state can enhance precision in this way has
been termed its "metrological power". Given the technological difficulty of producing high-amplitude
non-classical states of light, this use of non-classical light is likely to provide a technological
advantage much sooner than the Heisenberg scaling employing much stronger non-classical states.
To date, the enhancement provided by weak nonclassical states has been calculated only for specific
measurement configurations. Here we are able to optimize over all measurement configurations
to obtain the maximum enhancement that can be achieved by any single or multi-mode nonclassical
state together with strong classical states, for local and distributed quantum metrology employing
any linear or nonlinear single-mode unitary transformation. Our analysis reveals that the quantum
Fisher information for \textit{quadrature displacement sensing} is the sole property that determines
the maximum achievable enhancement in all of these different scenarios, providing a unified quantification
of the metrological power. It also reveals that the Mach-Zehnder interferometer is an optimal network
for phase sensing for an arbitrary single-mode nonclassical input state, and how the Mach-Zehnder
interferometer can be extended to make optimal use of any multi-mode nonclassical state for metrology.

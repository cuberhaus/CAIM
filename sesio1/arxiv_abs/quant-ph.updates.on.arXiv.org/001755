Noisy, Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers have reached the point where they can show the
potential for quantum advantage over classical computing. Unfortunately, NISQ machines introduce
sufficient noise that even for moderate size quantum circuits the results can be unreliable. We
propose a collaboratively designed superconducting quantum computer using a Superconducting
Nonlinear Asymmetric Inductive eLement (SNAIL) modulator. The SNAIL modulator is designed by
considering both the ideal fundamental qubit gate operation while maximizing the qubit coupling
capabilities. We and others have demonstrated that the $\texttt{iSWAP}$ family, and particularly
$\sqrt{\texttt{iSWAP}}$, provides an advantage over $\texttt{CNOT}$ as a basis gate. In this
work, we show how the SNAIL natively implements $\sqrt[n]{\texttt{iSWAP}}$ functions with high-degree
couplings and implementation of gates realized through proportionally scaled pulse lengths.
Based on our previously demonstrated SNAIL-based quantum state router we present preliminary
data extending the SNAIL-based modulator to four qubit modules. Furthermore, in this work, we co-design
future SNAIL-based quantum computers that utilize the construction of richer interconnections
based on classical 4-ary tree and hypercubes and compare their advantage to the traditional lattice
and heavy-hex lattice for a suite of common quantum algorithms. To make our results more general,
we consider both scenarios in which the total circuit time, for implementations dominated by decoherence,
or total gate count, for implementations dominated by control imperfections. We demonstrate the
co-design advantage based on real hardware SNAIL implementations and extrapolate to larger system
sizes characterized from our real multi $\sqrt[n]{\texttt{iSWAP}}$ qubit system with 4-ary tree
and hypercube inspired interconnects.

Doubly-parametric quantum transducers, such as electro-opto-mechanical devices, are quickly
approaching quantum operation as decoherence mechanisms such as thermal noise, loss, and limited
cooperativities are improved. These devices show potential as the critical link between quantum
information contained at frequencies as disparate as those in the optical and microwave domains,
thus enabling applications such as long distance networking of superconducting quantum computers.
However, the requirements on the operating parameters of the transducers necessary to achieve
quantum operation have yet to be characterized. In this work we find simple, explicit expressions
for the necessary and sufficient conditions under which doubly-parametric transducers in the
resolved-sideband, steady-state limit are capable of entangling optical and microwave modes.
Our analysis treats the transducer as a two-mode bosonic Gaussian channel capable of both beamsplitter-type
and two-mode squeezing-type interactions between optical and microwave modes. For the beamsplitter-type
interaction, we find parameter thresholds which distinguish regions of the channel's separability,
capacity for bound entanglement, and capacity for distillable entanglement. By contrast, the
two-mode squeezing-type interaction always produces distillable entanglement with no restrictions
on temperature, cooperativities, or losses. Finally, we find the entanglement breaking conditions
on the reduced one-mode upconversion and downconversion channels obtained by initializing the
unused input with vacuum while ignoring the unused output. These differences between the entanglement
thresholds of the beamsplitter-type and two-mode squeezing-type interactions are then important
considerations in the construction of larger quantum networks that integrate multiple transducers.

In 2011, Nair published a no-go theorem for quantum radar target detection [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 84},
032312 (2011)]. He showed, under fairly general assumptions, that a coherent-state radar's error
probability was within a factor of two of the best possible quantum performance for the pure-loss
(no background radiation) channel whose roundtrip radar-to-target-to-radar transmissivity
$\kappa$ satisfies $\kappa \ll 1$. We introduce first-photon radars (FPRs) to circumvent and beat
Nair's performance limit. FPRs transmit a periodic sequence of pulses, each containing $N_S$ photons
on average, and perform ideal direct detection (photon counting at unit quantum efficiency and
no dark counts) on the returned radiation from each transmission until at least one photon has been
detected or a pre-set maximum of $M$ pulses has been transmitted. They decide a target is present
if and only if they detect one or more photons. We consider both quantum (each transmitted pulse is
a number state) and classical (each transmitted pulse is a coherent state) FPRs, and we show that
their error-probability exponents are nearly identical when $\kappa \ll 1$. With the additional
assumption that $\kappa N_S \ll 1$, we find that their advantage in error-probability exponent
over Nair's performance limit grows without bound as $M \rightarrow \infty$. However, because
FPRs' pulse-repetition period must exceed the radar-to-target-to-radar propagation delay,
their use in standoff sensing of moving targets will likely provide only $\sim$10\,dB advantage,
which is achieved when $\kappa N_S \sim 1$ and $M \sim 10$. Our work constitutes a new no-go theorem
for quantum radar target detection. More importantly, it offers the possibility of significantly
improved classical-radar target detection when background-radiation brightness is low enough
that the pure-loss channel model is applicable.

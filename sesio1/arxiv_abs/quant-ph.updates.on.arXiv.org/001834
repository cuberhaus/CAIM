State-of-the-art transmon qubits rely on large capacitors which systematically improves their
coherence due to reduced surface loss participation. However, this approach increases both the
footprint and the parasitic cross-coupling and is ultimately limited by radiation losses - a potential
roadblock for scaling up quantum processors to millions of qubits. In this work we present transmon
qubits with sizes as low as 36$\,\times\,$39$\,\mu$m$^2$ with $\gtrsim$100\,nm wide vacuum gap
capacitors that are micro-machined from commercial silicon-on-insulator wafers and shadow evaporated
with aluminum. After the release in HF vapor we achieve a vacuum participation ratio up to 99.6\%
in an in-plane design that is compatible with standard coplanar circuits. Qubit relaxation time
measurements for small gaps with high vacuum electric fields of up to 22\,V/m reveal a double exponential
decay indicating comparably strong coupling to long-lived two-level-systems (TLS). %We also
show that the fast 'initial' and slow 'residual' decay strongly correlates with the measured sub-single-photon
and high-drive-power quality factors of lumped element vacuum gap resonators, respectively.
The exceptionally high selectivity of $>$20\,dB to the superconductor-vacuum surface allows
to precisely back out the sub-single-photon dielectric loss tangent of aluminum oxide exposed
to ambient conditions of $\tan{\delta}=1.5\times10^{-4}$ for a thickness of 3\,nm. %assuming
3\,nm thick. %the widely used aluminum oxide exposed to ambient conditions. In terms of future scaling
potential we achieve a qubit quality factor by footprint area of $20\,\mu \mathrm{s}^{-2}$, which
is on par with the highest T$_1$ devices relying on larger geometries and expected to improve substantially
for lower loss superconductors like NbTiN, TiN or Ta.

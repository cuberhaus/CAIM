As a typical quantum many body problem, we consider the time evolution of density matrix elements
in the Bose-Hubbard model. For an arbitrary initial state, these quantities can be obtained from
an SDE or stochastic differential equation system. To this SDE system, a Girsanov transformation
can be applied. This has the effect that all the information from the initial state moves into the
drift part, into the mean field part, of the transformed system. In the large N limit with g=UN fixed,
the diffusive part of the transformed system vanishes and as a result, the exact quantum dynamics
is given by an ODE system which turns out to be the time dependent discrete Gross Pitaevskii equation.
For the two site Bose-Hubbard model, the GP equation reduces to the mathematical pendulum and the
particle imbalance is equal to the velocity of that pendulum which is either oscillatory or it can
have rollovers which then corresponds to the self trapping or insulating phase. As a by-product,
we also find an equivalence of the mathematical pendulum with a quartic double well potential. Collapse
and revivals are a more subtle phenomenom, in order to see these the diffusive part of the SDE system
or quantum corrections have to be taken into account. This can be done with an approximation and collapse
and revivals can be reproduced, numerically and also through an analytic calculation. Since expectation
values of Fresnel or Wiener diffusion processes, we write the density matrix elements exactly in
this way, can be obtained from parabolic second order PDEs, we also obtain various exact PDE representations.
The paper has been written with the goal to come up with an efficient calculation scheme for quantum
many body systems and as such the formalism is generic and applies to arbitrary dimension, arbitrary
hopping matrices and, with suitable adjustments, to fermionic models.

Quantum circuit simulation is used to verify and test large quantum circuits before constructing
them physically. Improving simulation saves time and resources for designing circuits. Here we
study three different aspects of simulation. Initially, we explore the method of using graph states
augmented with local Clifford operations to simulate stabilizer circuit computations, which
we call graph state simulation. By deriving new transformation rules on graph states, we improve
upon the current widely adopted graph state simulation algorithm. At the same time, we prove that
in the worst case, at least $\Omega(n^2)$ edge toggles must be performed in order to update the graph
corresponding to the stabilizer state upon application of a controlled-Pauli $Z$ gate. Our results
suggest that graph state simulation is advantageous over other methods of simulation for some but
not all classes of circuits. Then, stabilizer simulation can be used to simulate arbitrary quantum
circuits by representing quantum states as linear combinations of stabilizer states. To better
represent stabilizer states, we discover a unique and elegant canonical form for stabilizer states
based on graph states and also show how to efficiently simplify stabilizer states to canonical form.
Also, we derive a simpler formula for combining two Pauli-related stabilizer states into one and
characterize all linearly dependent triplets of stabilizer states, revealing three cases, the
first with two Pauli-related stabilizer states and the other two with pairwise equal inner products.
We present an algorithm for computing the inner product between stabilizer states, which receives
graph states augmented with Clifford operations as inputs. Our algorithm's runtime is $O(nd^2)$
where $d$ is the maximum degree of the graph, which improves upon the previous algorithm's runtime
of $O(n^3)$.

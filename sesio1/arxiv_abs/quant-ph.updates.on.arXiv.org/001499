Quantum annealing aims at finding optimal solutions to complex optimization problems using a suitable
quantum many body Hamiltonian encoding the solution in its ground state. To find the solution one
typically evolves the ground state of a soluble initial Hamiltonian adiabatically to the ground
state of the designated final Hamiltonian. Here we explore whether and when a full quantum representation
of the dynamics leads to higher probability to end up in the desired ground when compared to a classical
mean field approximation. As simple, nontrivial example we target the ground state of interacting
bosons trapped in a tight binding lattice with small local defect by turning on long range interactions.
Already two atoms in four sites interacting via two cavity modes prove complex enough to exhibit
significant differences between the full quantum model and a mean field approximation for the cavity
fields mediating the interactions. We find a large parameter region of highly successful quantum
annealing where the semi-classical approach largely fails. Here we see strong evidence for the
importance of entanglement to end close to the optimal solution. The quantum model also reduces
the minimal time for a high target occupation probability. In contrast to naive expectations that
enlarging the Hilbert space is beneficial, different numerical cut-offs of the Hilbert space reveal
an improved performance for lower cut-offs, i.e. an nonphysical reduced Hilbert space, for short
simulation times. Hence a less faithful representation of the full quantum dynamics sometimes
creates a higher numerical success probability in shorter time. However, a sufficiently high cut-off
proves relevant to obtain near perfect fidelity for long simulations times in a single run. Overall
our results exhibit a clear improvement based on a quantum model versus simulations based on a classical
field approximation.

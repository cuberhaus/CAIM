The quantum internet is one of the frontiers of quantum information science research. It will revolutionize
the way we communicate and do other tasks, and it will allow for tasks that are not possible using the
current, classical internet. The backbone of a quantum internet is entanglement distributed globally
in order to allow for such novel applications to be performed over long distances. Experimental
progress is currently being made to realize quantum networks on a small scale, but much theoretical
work is still needed in order to understand how best to distribute entanglement, especially with
the limitations of near-term quantum technologies taken into account. This work provides an initial
step towards this goal. In this work, we lay out a theory of near-term quantum networks based on Markov
decision processes (MDPs), and we show that MDPs provide a precise and systematic mathematical
framework to model protocols for near-term quantum networks that is agnostic to the specific implementation
platform. We start by simplifying the MDP for elementary links introduced in prior work, and by providing
new results on policies for elementary links in the steady-state (infinite-time) limit. In particular,
we show that the well-known memory-cutoff policy is optimal in the steady-state limit. Then we show
how the elementary link MDP can be used to analyze a quantum network protocol in which we wait for all
elementary links to be active before creating end-to-end links. We then provide an extension of
the MDP formalism to two elementary links, which is useful for analyzing more sophisticated quantum
network protocols. Here, as new results, we derive linear programming relaxations that allow us
to obtain optimal steady-state policies with respect to the expected fidelity and waiting time
of the end-to-end link.

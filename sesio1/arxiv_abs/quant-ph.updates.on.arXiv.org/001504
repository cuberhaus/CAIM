A generic qubit unitary operator affected by quantum noise is duplicated and inserted in a coherently
superposed channel, superposing two paths offered to a probe qubit across the noisy unitary, and
driven by a control qubit. A characterization is performed of the transformation realized by the
superposed channel on the joint state of the probe-control qubit pair. The superposed channel is
then specifically analyzed for the fundamental metrological task of phase estimation on the noisy
unitary, with the performance assessed by the Fisher information, classical or quantum. A comparison
is made with conventional estimation techniques and also with a quantum switched channel with indefinite
causal order recently investigated for a similar task of phase estimation. In the analysis here,
a first important observation is that the control qubit of the superposed channel, although it never
directly interacts with the unitary being estimated, can nevertheless be measured alone for effective
estimation, while discarding the probe qubit that interacts with the unitary. This property is
also present with the switched channel but is inaccessible with conventional techniques. The optimal
measurement of the control qubit here is characterized in general conditions. A second important
observation is that the noise plays an essential role in coupling the control qubit to the unitary,
and that the control qubit remains operative for phase estimation at very strong noise, even with
a fully depolarizing noise, whereas conventional estimation and the switched channel become inoperative
in these conditions. The results extend the analysis of the capabilities of coherently controlled
channels which represent novel devices exploitable for quantum signal and information processing.

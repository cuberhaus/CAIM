We numerically investigate the ground state of the extended $t$-$J$ Hamiltonian with periodic
local modulations in one dimension by using the density-matrix renormalization group method.
Examining charge and spin excitation gaps, as well as the pair binding energy, with extrapolated
results to the thermodynamic limit, we obtain a rich ground-state phase diagram consisting of the
metallic state, the superconducting state, the phase separation, and insulating states at commensurate
fillings. Compared to the homogeneous 1D $t$-$J$ model, the superconductivity is greatly enhanced
and stabilized by the flat-band structure. This superconducting state in quasi-periodic chains
shares similar properties with ladder systems: significant negative pair binding energy occurs,
and the singlet pairing correlation function dominates with the algebraic decay while the single-particle
Green's function and spin correlation function decay exponentially. On the other hand, quasi-periodicity
leads to nontrivial topological nature in insulating states, characterized by different integer
Chern numbers at different fillings. Due to the interplay among the topology, the interaction,
and the 1D confinement, gapless edge modes show strong spin-charge separation and in different
regions can relate to different collective modes, which are the charge of a single fermion, the magnon,
and the singlet-pair. We also find two interaction driven topological transitions: i) at particle
filling $\rho=1/2$, the low-energy edge excitations change from the magnon to singlet-pair, accompanied
with pair formation in bulk; and ii) at $\rho=3/4$, while the gapless edge mode remains the charge
of a single fermion, there is a gap-closing point and a $\pi$-phase shift in the quasi-particle spectrum.

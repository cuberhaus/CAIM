We study the overscreened multi-channel Kondo (MCK) model using the recently developed unitary
renormalization group (URG) technique. Our results display the importance of ground state degeneracy
in explaining various important properties like the breakdown of screening and the presence of
local non-Fermi liquids. The impurity susceptibility of the intermediate coupling fixed point
Hamiltonian in the zero-bandwidth (or star graph) limit shows a power-law divergence at low temperature,
signalling its critical nature. Despite the absence of inter-channel coupling in the MCK fixed
point Hamiltonian, the study of mutual information between any two channels shows non-zero correlation
between them. A spectral flow analysis of the star graph reveals that the degenerate ground state
manifold possesses topological quantum numbers. The low energy effective Hamiltonian obtained
upon adding a finite non-zero conduction bath dispersion to the star graph Hamiltonian for both
the two and three-channel cases displays the presence of local non-Fermi liquids arising from inter-channel
quantum fluctuations. Discontinuous behaviour is observed in several measures of ground state
entanglement, signalling the underlying orthogonality catastrophe associated with the degenerate
ground state manifold. We extend our results to underscreened and perfectly screened MCK models
through duality arguments. A study of channel anisotropy under renormalisation flow reveals a
series of quantum phase transitions due to the change in ground state degeneracy. Our work thus presents
a template for the study of how a degenerate ground state manifold arising from symmetry and duality
properties in a multichannel quantum impurity model can lead to novel multicritical phases at intermediate
coupling.

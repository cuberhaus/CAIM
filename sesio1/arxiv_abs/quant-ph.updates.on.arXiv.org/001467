We propose delayed choice experiments carried out with macroscopic qubits, realised as macroscopically-distinct
coherent states $|\alpha\rangle$ and $|-\alpha\rangle$. Quantum superpositions of $|\alpha\rangle$
and $|-\alpha\rangle$ are created via a unitary interaction $U(\theta)$ based on a nonlinear Hamiltonian.
Macroscopic delayed-choice experiments give a compelling reason to develop interpretations
not allowing macroscopic retrocausality (MrC). We therefore consider weak macroscopic realism
(wMR), which specifies a hidden variable $\lambda_{\theta}$ to determine the macroscopic qubit
value (analogous to 'which-way' information), independent of any future measurement setting
$\phi$. Using entangled states, we demonstrate a quantum eraser where the choice to measure a which-way
or wave-type property is delayed. Consistency with wMR is possible, if we interpret the macroscopic
qubit value to be determined by $\lambda_{\theta}$ without specification of the state at the level
of $\hbar$, where fringes manifest. We then demonstrate violations of a delayed-choice Leggett-Garg
inequality, and of the dimension witness inequality applied to the Wheeler-Chaves-Lemos-Pienaar
experiment, where measurements need only distinguish the macroscopic qubit states. This negates
all two-dimensional non-retrocausal models, thereby suggesting MrC. However, one can interpret
consistently with wMR, thus avoiding MrC, by noting extra dimensions, and by noting that the violations
require further unitary dynamics $U$ for each system. The violations are then explained as failure
of deterministic macroscopic realism (dMR), which specifies validity of $\lambda_{\theta}$
prior to the dynamics $U(\theta)$ determining the measurement setting $\theta$. Finally, although
there is consistency with wMR for macroscopic observations, we demonstrate EPR paradoxes at a microscopic
level.

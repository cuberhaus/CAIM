The main purpose of this work is to identify invariant quadratic operators associated with Linear
Canonical Transformations (LCTs) which could play important roles in physics. LCTs are considered
in many fields. In quantum theory, they can be identified with linear transformations which keep
invariant the Canonical Commutation Relations (CCRs). In this work, LCTs corresponding to a general
pseudo-Euclidian space are considered and related to a phase space representation of quantum theory.
Explicit calculations are firstly performed for the monodimensional case to identify the corresponding
LCT-invariant quadratic operators then multidimensional generalizations of the obtained results
are deduced. The eigenstates of these operators are also identified. A first kind of LCT-invariant
operator is a second order polynomial of the coordinates and momenta operators and is a generalization
of reduced momentum dispersion operator. The coefficients of this polynomial depend on the mean
values and the statistical variances-covariances of the coordinates and momenta operators themselves.
It is shown that these statistical variances-covariances can be related with thermodynamic variables.
Two other LCT-invariant quadratic operators, which can be considered as the number operators of
some quasipartciles, are also identified: the first one is a number operator of bosonic type quasiparticles
and the second one corresponds to fermionic type. This fermionic LCT-invariant quadratic operator
is directly related to a spin representation of LCTs. It is shown explicitly, in the case of a pentadimensional
theory, that the eigenstates of this operator can be considered as basic quantum states of elementary
fermions. A classification of the fundamental fermions, compatible with the Standard model of
particle physics, is established from a classification of these states.

The quantum Fourier transform (QFT) is one of the most important quantum operations with wide range
of application from integer factoring, quantum simulation, quantum Monte Carlo simulation for
the option pricing to relatively new topic such as quantum algorithm for solving Navier-Stokes
equation of the turbulent flow, to name a few. Major obstacle to the implementation of the QFT is the
large number of elemental quantum gates needed to build the QFT. Of these resources needed for the
implementation, the T-count and the T-depth are the major costs. So far, the existing best implementation
of approximate quantum Fourier transform (AQFT) shows the T-count of 8nlog2(n/\varepsilon) and
the T-depth of 2nlog2(n/\varepsilon) where n is the number of qubits and \varepsilon is the approximate
error. Here, we propose the new approximation scheme of the QFT which halves both the T-count and
the T-depth of the QFT of the best existing implementation. Our approach relies on the manipulation
of Rz gates after the QFT decomposition and the application of the quantum Karnaugh map for systematic
reduction. We report the detailed quantum circuits and the experimental verification of the proposed
scheme using IonQ quantum computer though Amazon Braket cloud service. The quantum amplitude estimation
algorithm (QAEA) which plays an essential role in solving nonlinear partial differential equations
employs a QFT and an inverse QFT. This QAEA would be an exemplary quantum algorithm that can get the
most benefit from our proposed scheme and can be applied not only to financial engineering but also
to solving Navier-Stokes equations for turbulent hyper sonic flow and numerical weather prediction
that may have disruptive socio-economic impact, for which little attention is given.

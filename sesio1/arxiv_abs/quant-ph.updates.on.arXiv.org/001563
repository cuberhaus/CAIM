Variational quantum algorithm (VQA), which is comprised of a classical optimizer and a parameterized
quantum circuit, emerges as one of the most promising approaches for harvesting the power of quantum
computers in the noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era. However, the deployment of VQAs on
contemporary NISQ devices often faces considerable system and time-dependant noise and prohibitively
slow training speeds. On the other hand, the expensive supporting resources and infrastructure
make quantum computers extremely keen on high utilization. In this paper, we propose a virtualized
way of building up a quantum backend for variational quantum algorithms: rather than relying on
a single physical device which tends to introduce temporal-dependant device-specific noise with
worsening performance as time-since-calibration grows, we propose to constitute a quantum ensemble,
which dynamically distributes quantum tasks asynchronously across a set of physical devices,
and adjusting the ensemble configuration with respect to machine status. In addition to reduced
machine-dependant noise, the ensemble can provide significant speedups for VQA training. With
this idea, we build a novel VQA training framework called EQC that comprises: (i) a system architecture
for asynchronous parallel VQA cooperative training; (ii) an analytic model for assessing the quality
of the returned VQA gradient over a particular device concerning its architecture, transpilation,
and runtime conditions; (iii) a weighting mechanism to adjust the quantum ensemble's computational
contribution according to the systems' current performance. Evaluations comprising 500K circuit
evaluations across 10 IBMQ devices using a VQE and a QAOA applications demonstrate that EQC can attain
error rates close to the most performant device of the ensemble, while boosting the training speed
by 10.5x on average (up to 86x and at least 5.2x).

Impossibilities that are unique to quantum mechanics, such as cloning, can deepen our physics understanding
and lead to numerous applications. One of the most elementary classical operations is the addition
of bit strings. As its quantum version we can take the task of creating a superposition $\alpha e^{i\phi(\left|u\right>,\left|v\right>)}
\left|u\right>+\beta\left|v\right>$ from two unknown states $\left|u\right>,\left|v\right>\in\mathcal{H}$,
where $\phi$ is some real function and $\alpha,\beta\in\mathbb{C}\setminus\{0\}$. Oszmaniec,
Grudka, Horodecki and W{\'o}jcik [Phys. Rev. Lett. 116(11):110403, 2016] showed that a quantum
circuit cannot create a superposition from a single copy of each state. But how many input copies
suffice? Due to quantum tomography, the sample complexity seems at most exponential. Surprisingly,
we prove that quantum circuits of any sample complexity cannot output a superposition for all input
state-pairs $\left|u\right>,\left|v\right>\in\mathcal{H}$ - not even when postselection
and approximations are allowed. We show explicitly the limitation on state tomography that precludes
its use for superposition. Our result is an application of the topological "lower bound" method
[arXiv:2011.10031], which matches any quantum circuit to a continuous function. We find topological
arguments showing that no continuous function can output a superposition. This new use of the method
offers further understanding of its applicability. Considering state tomography we suggest circumventing
our impossibility by relaxing to random superposition or entangled superposition. Random superposition
reveals a separation between two types of measurement. Entangled superposition could still be
useful as a subroutine. However, both relaxations are inspired by the inefficient state tomography.
Whether efficient implementations exist remains open.

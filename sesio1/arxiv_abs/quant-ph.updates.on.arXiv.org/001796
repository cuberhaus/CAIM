The Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect was convincingly demonstrated using a micro-sized toroidal magnet
but it is almost always explained using an infinitely-long solenoid or an infinitely-long flux
line. The main reason for this is that the formal treatment of the AB effect considering a toroidal
configuration is too cumbersome. But if the micro-sized toroidal magnet is modelled by a closed
flux line of arbitrary shape and size then the formal treatment of the AB effect is exact, considerably
simplified, and well-justified. Here we present such a treatment that covers in detail the electromagnetic,
topological, and quantum-mechanical aspects of this effect. We demonstrate that the AB phase in
a closed flux line is determined by a linking number and has the same form as the AB phase in an infinitely-long
flux line which is determined by a winding number. We explicitly show that the two-slit interference
shift associated with the AB effect in a closed flux line is the same as that associated with an infinitely-long
flux line. We emphasise the topological nature of the AB phase in a closed flux line by demonstrating
that this phase is invariant under deformations of the charge path, deformations of the closed flux
line, simultaneous deformations of the charge path and the closed flux line, and the interchange
between the charge path and the closed flux line. We also discuss the local and nonlocal interpretations
of the AB effect in a closed flux line and introduce a non-singular gauge in which the vector potential
vanishes in all space except on the surface surrounded by the closed flux line, implying that this
potential is zero along the path of the charged particle except on the crossing point where this path
intersects the surface bounded by the closed flux line, a result that questions the alleged physical
significance of the vector potential and the local interpretation of the AB effect.

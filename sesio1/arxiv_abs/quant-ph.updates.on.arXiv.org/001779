Quantum algorithms allow to outperform their classical counterparts in various tasks, most prominent
example being Shor's algorithm for efficient prime factorization on a quantum computer. It is clear
that one of the reasons for the speedup is the superposition principle of quantum mechanics, which
allows a quantum processor to be in a superposition of different states at the same time. While such
superposition can lead to entanglement across different qubits of the processors, there also exists
quantum algorithms which outperform classical ones using superpositions of individual qubits
without entangling them. As an example, the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm allows one to determine
a bit string encoded into an oracle. While the classical version of the algorithm requires multiple
calls of the oracle to learn the bit string, a single query of the oracle is enough in the quantum case.
In this Letter, we analyze in detail the quantum resources in the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm.
For this, we introduce and study its probabilistic version, where the goal is to guess the bit string
after a single call of the oracle. We show that in the absence of entanglement, the performance of
the algorithm is directly related to the amount of quantum coherence in the initial state. We further
demonstrate that a large amount of entanglement in the initial state prevents the algorithm from
achieving optimal performance. We also apply our methods to quantum computation with mixed states,
proving that pseudopure states achieve optimal performance for a given purity in the Bernstein-Vazirani
algorithm. We further investigate quantum resources in the one clean qubit model, showing that
the model can exhibit speedup over any known classical algorithm even with arbitrary little amount
of multipartite entanglement, general quantum correlations, and coherence.

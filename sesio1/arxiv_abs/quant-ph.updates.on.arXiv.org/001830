We analyze the robustness of Grover's quantum search algorithm performed by a quantum register
under a possibly time-correlated noise acting locally on the qubits. We model the noise as originating
from arbitrary but fixed unitary evolution by $U$ of some noisy qubits. The noise occurs with some
probability in the interval between every consecutive noiseless Grover evolutions. This general
noise reproduces some well-known decoherence models when the time-correlations are absent. We
derive a set of $U$'s, called the 'good noises,' for which the success probability of the algorithm
remains unchanged with respect to varying the non-trivial total number ($m$) of noisy qubits in
the register. The result holds irrespective of the presence of any time-correlations in the noise.
We show that only when $U$ is either of the Pauli matrices $\sigma_x$ and $\sigma_z$ (which give rise
to $m$-qubit bit-flip and phase-damping channels respectively in the memory-less case), the algorithm's
success probability stays unchanged when increasing or decreasing $m$. In contrast, when $U$ is
the third Pauli matrix $\sigma_y$ (giving rise to $m$-qubit bit-phase flip channel in the memory-less
case), the success probability at all times stays unaltered as long as the parity (even or odd) of
the total number $m$ remains the same. This asymmetry between the Pauli operators stems from the
inherent symmetry-breaking existing within the Grover circuit. We further show that the positions
of the noisy sites are irrelevant in the case of any of the Pauli matrices as noise. The results are
illustrated in case of both types of noise: with and without time-correlations. We find that the
former case leads to a better performance of the noisy algorithm. In this paper, the time-correlations
have been restricted to be Markovian.

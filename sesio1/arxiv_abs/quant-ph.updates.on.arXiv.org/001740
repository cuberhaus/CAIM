Localized electronic spins in solid-state environments form versatile and robust platforms for
quantum sensing, metrology and quantum information processing. With optically detected magnetic
resonance (ODMR), it is possible to prepare and readout highly coherent spin systems, up to room
temperature, with orders of magnitude enhanced sensitivities and spatial resolutions compared
to induction-based techniques, allowing single spin manipulations. While ODMR was first observed
in organic molecules, many other systems are nowadays intensively being searched for, discovered
and studied. Among them is the nitrogen-vacany (NV) center in diamond. Beyond ODMR it is notably
already widely and successfully used both both as a high-resolution high-sensitivity quantum
sensors for external fields and as a qubit. Others are rare earth ions used as quantum memories and
many other color centers trapped in bulk or 2-dimensional materials. In order to allow the broadest
possible community of researchers and engineers to investigate and develop novel ODMR-based materials
and applications, we overview here the setting up of ODMR experiments using commercially available
hardware. We also present in detail a dedicated collaborative open-source interface named Qudi
and describe the original features we have added to speed-up data acquisition, relax instrumental
requirements and widen its applicability to individual and ensemble ODMR systems. Associating
hardware and software discussions, this article aims to steepen the learning curve of newcomers
in ODMR from a variety of scientific backgrounds, to optimize the experimental development time,
preempt the common measurement pitfalls, and to provide an efficient, portable and collaborative
interface to explore innovative experiments.

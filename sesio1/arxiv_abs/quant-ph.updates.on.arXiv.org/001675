This work introduces the so-called synchrosqueezed wavelet transform, to shed light on the dipolar
fluctuations of a thermal ensemble of nuclear spins in a diamond crystal structure, hyperfine-coupled
to a central spin. The raw time series of the nuclear spin bath coherent dynamics is acquired through
the two-point correlation function computed using the cluster correlation expansion method.
The dynamics can be conveniently analyzed according to zero-, single-, and double-quantum transitions
derived from the dipolar pairwise spin flips. We show that in the early-time behavior when the coherence
is preserved in the spin ensemble, the Overhauser field fluctuations are modulated by dipole-dipole-induced
small inhomogeneous detunings of nearly resonant transitions within the bath. The resulting beating
extending over relatively longer time intervals is featured on the scalograms where both temporal
and spectral behaviors of nuclear spin noise are unveiled simultaneously. Moreover, a second kind
of beating that affects faster dynamics is readily discernible, originating from the inhomogeneous
spread of the hyperfine coupling of each nucleus with the central spin. Additionally, any quadrupolar
nuclei within the bath imprint as beating residing in the zero-quantum channel. The nuclear spin
environment can be directionally probed by orienting the hyperfine axis. Thereby, crucial spatial
information about the closely separated spin clusters surrounding the central spin are accessible.
Thus, a wavelet-based post processing can facilitate the identification of proximal nuclear spins
as revealed by their unique beating patterns on the scalograms. Finally, when these features are
overwhelmed by either weakly or strongly coupled classical noise sources, we demonstrate the efficacy
of thresholding techniques in the wavelet domain in denoising contaminated scalograms.

Fault-tolerant measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) with recent progress on quantum
technologies leads to a promising scalable platform for realizing quantum computation, conducted
by preparing a large-scale graph state over many qubits and performing single-qubit measurements
on the state. With fault-tolerant MBQC, even if the graph-state preparation suffers from errors
occurring at an unknown physical error rate, we can suppress the effect of the errors. Verifying
graph states is vital to test whether we can conduct MBQC as desired even with such errors. However,
problematically, existing state-of-the-art protocols for graph-state verification by fidelity
estimation have required measurements on many copies of the entire graph state and hence have been
prohibitively costly in terms of the number of qubits and the runtime. We here construct an efficient
alternative framework for testing graph states for fault-tolerant MBQC based on the theory of property
testing. Our test protocol accepts with high probability when the physical error rate is small enough
to make fault-tolerant MBQC feasible and rejects when the rate is above the threshold of fault-tolerant
MBQC. The novelty of our protocol is that we use only a single copy of the $N$-qubit graph state and
single-qubit Pauli measurements only on a constant-sized subset of the qubits; thus, the protocol
has a constant runtime independently of $N$. Furthermore, we can immediately use the rest of the
graph state for fault-tolerant MBQC if the protocol accepts. These results achieve a significant
advantage over prior art for graph-state verification in the number of qubits and the total runtime.
Consequently, our work offers a new route to a fast and practical framework for benchmarking large-scale
quantum state preparation.

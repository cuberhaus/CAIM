In this work we establish lower bounds on the size of Clifford circuits that measure a family of commuting
Pauli operators. Our bounds depend on the interplay between a pair of graphs: the Tanner graph of
the set of measured Pauli operators, and the connectivity graph which represents the qubit connections
required to implement the circuit. For local-expander quantum codes, which are promising for low-overhead
quantum error correction, we prove that any syndrome extraction circuit implemented with local
Clifford gates in a 2D square patch of $N$ qubits has depth at least $\Omega(n/\sqrt{N})$ where $n$
is the code length. Then, we propose two families of quantum circuits saturating this bound. First,
we construct 2D local syndrome extraction circuits for quantum LDPC codes with bounded depth using
only $O(n^2)$ ancilla qubits. Second, we design a family of 2D local syndrome extraction circuits
for hypergraph product codes using $O(n)$ ancilla qubits with depth $O(\sqrt{n})$. Finally, we
use circuit noise simulations to compare the performance of a family of hypergraph product codes
using this last family of 2D syndrome extraction circuits with a syndrome extraction circuit implemented
with fully connected qubits. While there is a threshold of about $10^{-3}$ for a fully connected
implementation, we observe no threshold for the 2D local implementation despite simulating error
rates of as low as $10^{-6}$. This suggests that quantum LDPC codes are impractical with 2D local
quantum hardware. We believe that our proof technique is of independent interest and could find
other applications. Our bounds on circuit sizes are derived from a lower bound on the amount of correlations
between two subsets of qubits of the circuit and an upper bound on the amount of correlations introduced
by each circuit gate, which together provide a lower bound on the circuit size.

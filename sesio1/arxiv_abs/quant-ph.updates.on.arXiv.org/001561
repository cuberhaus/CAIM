We study the distribution over measurement outcomes of noisy random quantum circuits in the low-fidelity
regime. We show that, for local noise that is sufficiently weak and unital, correlations (measured
by the linear cross-entropy benchmark) between the output distribution $p_{\text{noisy}}$ of
a generic noisy circuit instance and the output distribution $p_{\text{ideal}}$ of the corresponding
noiseless instance shrink exponentially with the expected number of gate-level errors, as $F=\text{exp}(-2s\epsilon
\pm O(s\epsilon^2))$, where $\epsilon$ is the probability of error per circuit location and $s$
is the number of two-qubit gates. Furthermore, if the noise is incoherent, the output distribution
approaches the uniform distribution $p_{\text{unif}}$ at precisely the same rate and can be approximated
as $p_{\text{noisy}} \approx Fp_{\text{ideal}} + (1-F)p_{\text{unif}}$, that is, local errors
are scrambled by the random quantum circuit and contribute only white noise (uniform output). Importantly,
we upper bound the total variation error (averaged over random circuit instance) in this approximation
as $O(F\epsilon \sqrt{s})$, so the "white-noise approximation" is meaningful when $\epsilon
\sqrt{s} \ll 1$, a quadratically weaker condition than the $\epsilon s\ll 1$ requirement to maintain
high fidelity. The bound applies when the circuit size satisfies $s \geq \Omega(n\log(n))$ and
the inverse error rate satisfies $\epsilon^{-1} \geq \tilde{\Omega}(n)$. The white-noise approximation
is useful for salvaging the signal from a noisy quantum computation; it was an underlying assumption
in complexity-theoretic arguments that low-fidelity random quantum circuits cannot be efficiently
sampled classically. Our method is based on a map from second-moment quantities in random quantum
circuits to expectation values of certain stochastic processes for which we compute upper and lower
bounds.

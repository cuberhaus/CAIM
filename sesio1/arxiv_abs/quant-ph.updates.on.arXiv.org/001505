Progress in the development of techniques for the construction of multiuser quantum communications
networks is reviewed in light of the plans for an EU quantum communications infrastructure (EU QCI).
Quantum key distribution networks may be classified as trusted node; quantum repeater-entanglement-swapping
based; point-to-multipoint based on passive beam splitters, active optical switchers or WDM;
high dimensional-multipartite entanglement and flexible reconfigurable multipartite networks.
Both satellite and terrestrial implementations are possible and ore both planned for EU QCI; their
relative merits are discussed. Current technology falls short in several respects of what is required
to address use cases well. Bit rates as a function of distance are currently limited by the characteristics
of available devices and are an order of magnitude or more below the theoretical bounds. Non-ideal
device behaviour can open loopholes for side-channel attacks. Limited range constrains network
geometry. New techniques are being developed to overcome these problems. The more sophisticated
schemes depend on ongoing advances in the generation and distribution of entanglement. Particularly
promising are the measurement device independent protocol, which eliminates photon-detector
related security weaknesses, and the twin-field protocol, which uses similar techniques to extend
range, in principle even beyond previously accepted theoretical bounds. Agreement of keys between
more than two users can be accomplished classically after pairwise quantum key exchange but direct
quantum multipartite agreement using may offer advantages. The same applies to secret sharing.
Practical quantum repeaters, to eliminate the need for trusted nodes, are closer to being realised
due to recent progress in optical memories.

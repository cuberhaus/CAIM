In this paper, we generalize the quantum Brownian motion to include momentum-dependent system-environment
couplings. The conventional QBM model corresponds to the spacial case $W_k = V_k$. The generalized
QBM is more complicated but the generalization is necessary. This is because the particle transition
and the pair production between the system and the environment represent two very different physical
processes, and usually cannot have the same coupling strengths. Thus, the conventional QBM model,
which is well-defined at classical level, is hardly realized in real quantum physical world. We
discuss the physical realizations of the generalized QBM in different physical systems, and derive
its exact master equation for both the initial decoupled states and initial correlated states.
The Hu-Paz-Zhang master equation of the conventional QBM model is reproduced as a special case.
We find that the renormalized Brownian particle Hamiltonian after traced out all the environmental
states induced naturally a momentum-dependent potential, which also shows the necessity of including
the momentum-dependent coupling in the QBM Hamiltonian. In the Hu-Paz-Zhang master equation,
such a renormalized potential is misplaced so that the correct renormalization Hamiltonian has
not been found. With the exact master equation for both the initial decoupled and and initial correlated
states, the issues about the initial jolt which is a long-stand problem in the Hu-Paz-Zhang master
equation is also re-examined. We find that the so-called "initial jolt", which has been thought
to be an artificial effect due to the use of the initial decoupled system-environment states, has
nothing do to with the initial decoupled state. The new exact master equation for the generalized
QBM also has the potential applications to photonics quantum computing.

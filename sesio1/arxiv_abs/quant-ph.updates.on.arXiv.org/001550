Optical atomic clocks are our most precise tools to measure time and frequency. They enable precision
frequency comparisons between atoms in separate locations to probe the space-time variation of
fundamental constants, the properties of dark matter, and for geodesy. Measurements on independent
systems are limited by the standard quantum limit (SQL); measurements on entangled systems, in
contrast, can surpass the SQL to reach the ultimate precision allowed by quantum theory - the so-called
Heisenberg limit. While local entangling operations have been used to demonstrate this enhancement
at microscopic distances, frequency comparisons between remote atomic clocks require rapid high-fidelity
entanglement between separate systems that have no intrinsic interactions. We demonstrate the
first quantum network of entangled optical clocks using two $^{88}$Sr$^+$ ions separated by a macroscopic
distance (2 m), that are entangled using a photonic link. We characterise the entanglement enhancement
for frequency comparisons between the ions. We find that entanglement reduces the measurement
uncertainty by a factor close to $\sqrt{2}$, as predicted for the Heisenberg limit, thus halving
the number of measurements required to reach a given precision. Practically, today's optical clocks
are typically limited by laser dephasing; in this regime, we find that using entangled clocks confers
an even greater benefit, yielding a factor 4 reduction in the number of measurements compared to
conventional correlation spectroscopy techniques. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate this
enhancement for measuring a frequency shift applied to one of the clocks. Our results show that quantum
networks have now attained sufficient maturity for enhanced metrology. This two-node network
could be extended to additional nodes, to other species of trapped particles, or to larger entangled
systems via local operations.

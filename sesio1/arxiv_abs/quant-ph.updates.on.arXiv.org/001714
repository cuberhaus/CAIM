We show that the topology of the Fermi sea of a $D$-dimensional Fermi gas is reflected in the multipartite
entanglement characterizing $D+1$ regions that meet at a point. For odd $D$ we introduce the multipartite
mutual information, and show that it exhibits a $\log^D L$ divergence as a function of system size
$L$ with a universal coefficient that is proportional to the Euler characteristic $\chi_F$ of the
Fermi sea. This generalizes the well known result for $D=1$ that expresses the $\log L$ divergence
of the bipartite entanglement entropy in terms of the central charge $c$ characterizing a conformal
field theory. For even $D$ we introduce a charge-weighted entanglement entropy that is manifestly
odd under a particle-hole transformation. We show that the corresponding charge-weighted mutual
information exhibits a similar $\log^D L$ divergence proportional to $\chi_F$. Our analysis relates
the universal behavior of the multipartite mutual information in the absence of interactions to
the $D+1$'th order equal-time density correlation function, which we show exhibits a universal
behavior in the long wavelength limit proportional to $\chi_F$. Our analytic results are based
on the replica method. In addition we perform a numerical study of the charge-weighted mutual information
for $D=2$ that confirms several aspects of the analytic theory. Finally, we consider the effect
of interactions perturbatively within the replica theory. We show that for $D=3$ the $\log^3 L$
divergence of the topological mutual information is not perturbed by weak short-ranged interactions,
though for $D=2$ the charge-weighted mutual information is perturbed. Thus, for $D=3$ the multipartite
mutual information provides a robust classification that distinguishes distinct topological
Fermi liquid phases.

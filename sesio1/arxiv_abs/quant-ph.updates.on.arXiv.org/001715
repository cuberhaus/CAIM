Significant challenges remain with the development of macroscopic quantum computing, hardware
problems of noise, decoherence, and scaling, software problems of error correction, and, most
important, algorithm construction. Finding truly quantum algorithms is quite difficult, and
many quantum algorithms, like Shor prime factoring or phase estimation, require extremely long
circuit depth for any practical application, necessitating error correction. Machine learning
can be used as a systematic method to nonalgorithmically program quantum computers. Quantum machine
learning enables us to perform computations without breaking down an algorithm into its gate building
blocks, eliminating that difficult step and potentially reducing unnecessary complexity. In
addition, we have shown that our machine learning approach is robust to both noise and to decoherence,
which is ideal for running on inherently noisy NISQ devices which are limited in the number of qubits
available for error correction. We demonstrated this using a fundamentally non classical calculation,
experimentally estimating the entanglement of an unknown quantum state. Results from this have
been successfully ported to the IBM hardware and trained using a powerful hybrid reinforcement
learning technique which is a modified Levenberg Marquardt LM method. The LM method is ideally suited
to quantum machine learning as it only requires knowledge of the final measured output of the quantum
computation, not intermediate quantum states which are generally not accessible. Since it processes
all the learning data simultaneously, it also requires significantly fewer hits on the quantum
hardware. Machine learning is demonstrated with results from simulations and runs on the IBM Qiskit
hardware interface.

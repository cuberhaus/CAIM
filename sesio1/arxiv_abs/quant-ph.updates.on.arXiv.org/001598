Local excitations as carriers of quantum information spread out in the system in ways governed by
the underlying interaction and symmetry. Understanding this phenomenon, also called quantum
scrambling, is a prerequisite for employing interacting systems for quantum information processing.
The character and direction dependence of quantum scrambling can be inferred from the out-of-time-ordered
commutators (OTOCs) containing information on correlation buildup and entanglement spreading.
Employing OTOC, we study and quantify the directionality of quantum information propagation in
oxide-based helical spin systems hosting a spin-driven ferroelectric order. In these systems,
magnetoelectricity permits the spin dynamics and associated information content to be controlled
by an electric field coupled to the emergent ferroelectric order. We show that topologically nontrivial
quantum phases, such as chiral or helical spin ordering, allows for electric-field controlled
anisotropic scrambling and a direction-dependent buildup of quantum correlations. Based on general
symmetry considerations, we find that starting from a pure state (e.g., the ground state) or a finite
temperature state is essential for observing directional asymmetry in scrambling. In the systematic
numerical studies of OTOC, we quantify the directional asymmetry of the scrambling and verify the
conjectured form of the OTOC around the ballistic wavefront. The obtained direction-dependent
butterfly velocity $v_{\mathrm{B}}(\mathbf{n})$ provides information on the speed of the ballistic
wavefront. In general, our calculations show an early-time power-law behavior of OTOC, as expected
from an analytic expansion for small times. The long-time behavior of OTOC reveals the importance
of (non-)integrability of the underlying Hamiltonian as well as the implications of conserved
quantities such as the $z$-projection of the total spin.

Quantum interference phenomena are widely viewed as posing a challenge to the classical worldview.
Feynman even went so far as to proclaim that they are the only mystery and the basic peculiarity of
quantum mechanics. Many have also argued that such phenomena force us to accept a number of radical
interpretational conclusions, including: that a photon is neither a particle nor a wave but rather
a Jekyll-and-Hyde sort of entity that toggles between the two possibilities, that reality is observer-dependent,
and that systems either do not have properties prior to measurements or else have properties that
are subject to nonlocal or backwards-in-time causal influences. In this work, we show that such
conclusions are not, in fact, forced on us by the phenomena. We do so by describing an alternative
to quantum theory, a statistical theory of a classical discrete field (the `toy field theory') that
reproduces the relevant phenomenology of quantum interference while rejecting these radical
interpretational claims. It also reproduces a number of related interference experiments that
are thought to support these interpretational claims, such as the Elitzur-Vaidman bomb tester,
Wheeler's delayed-choice experiment, and the quantum eraser experiment. The systems in the toy
field theory are field modes, each of which possesses, at all times, both a particle-like property
(a discrete occupation number) and a wave-like property (a discrete phase). Although these two
properties are jointly possessed, the theory stipulates that they cannot be jointly known. The
phenomenology that is generally cited in favour of nonlocal or backwards-in-time causal influences
ends up being explained in terms of inferences about distant or past systems, and all that is observer-dependent
is the observer's knowledge of reality, not reality itself.

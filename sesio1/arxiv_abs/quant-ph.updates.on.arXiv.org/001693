Present protocols of criticality-enhanced sensing with open quantum sensors assume direct measurement
of the sensor and omit the radiation quanta emitted to the environment, thereby potentially missing
valuable information. Here we propose a protocol for criticality-enhanced sensing via continuous
observation of the emitted radiation quanta. Under general assumptions, we establish a scaling
theory for the global quantum Fisher information of the joint system and environment state at dissipative
critical points. We derive universal scaling laws featuring transient and long-time behavior
governed by the underlying critical exponents. Importantly, such scaling laws exceed the standard
quantum limit and can in principle saturate the Heisenberg limit. To harness such advantageous
scaling, we propose a practical sensing scheme based on continuous detection of the emitted quanta
as realized experimentally in various quantum-optical setups. In such a scheme a single interrogation
corresponds to a (stochastic) quantum trajectory of the open system evolving under the nonunitary
dynamics dependent on the parameter to be sensed and the backaction of the continuous measurement.
Remarkably, we demonstrate that the associated precision scaling significantly exceeds that
based on direct measurement of the critical steady state, thereby establishing the metrological
value of the continuous detection of the emitted quanta at dissipative criticality. We illustrate
our protocol via counting the photons emitted by the open Rabi model, a paradigmatic model for the
study of dissipative phase transition with finite components. Our protocol is applicable to generic
quantum-optical open sensors permitting continuous readout, and may find applications at the
frontier of quantum sensing, such as the human-machine interface, magnetic diagnosis of heart
disease, and zero-field nuclear magnetic resonance.

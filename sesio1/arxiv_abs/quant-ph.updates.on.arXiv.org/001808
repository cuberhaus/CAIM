We propose, formulate and analyze novel quantum systems and behavioral phases in which the momentary
choices of quantum memories interact in order to source the system's internal interactions and
unitary time evolutions. In a closed system of the kind, the unitary evolution operator is updated,
moment by moment, by being remade out of the system's 'experience', that is, its developed quantum-state-history.
The 'Quantum Memory Made' Hamiltonians (QMM-Hs) which generate these unitary evolutions are Hermitian
nonlocal-in-time operators composed of the arbitrarily-chosen past-until-present density
operators of the closed system, or its arbitrary subsystems. The time evolutions in correspondence
are described by novel nonlinear and nonlocal von Neumann and Schr\"odinger equations. We establish
that nontrivial Purely-QMM unitary evolutions are 'Robustly Non-Markovian', meaning that the
maximum temporal distances between the chosen quantum memories must exceed finite lower bounds
which are set by the interaction couplings. After general formulation and considerations, we take
on the sufficiently-involved task of obtaining and classifying behavioral phases of one-qubit
pure-state evolutions generated by first-to-third order polynomial QMM-Hs made out of one, two
and three quantum memories. The behavioral attractors which are resulted from QMM-Hs are characterized
and classified using QMM two-point-function observables as the natural probes, upon combining
analytical methods with extensive numerical analyses. We establish that QMM phase diagrams are
outstandingly rich, having diverse classes of unprecedented unitary evolutions with physically
remarkable behaviours. Moreover, we show that QMM interactions give rise to novel purely-internal
dynamical phase transitions. Finally, we suggest independent fundamental and applied domains
and disciplines where QMM-Hs can be used advantageously.

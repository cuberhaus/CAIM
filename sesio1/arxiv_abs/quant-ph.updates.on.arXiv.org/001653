The characterization of open quantum systems is a central and recurring problem for the development
of quantum technologies. For time-independent systems, an (often unique) steady state describes
the average physics once all the transient processes have faded out, but interesting quantum properties
can emerge at intermediate timescales. Given a Lindblad master equation, these properties are
encoded in the spectrum of the Liouvillian whose diagonalization, however, is a challenge even
for small-size quantum systems. Here, we propose a new method to efficiently provide the Liouvillian
spectral decomposition. We call this method an Arnoldi-Lindblad time evolution, because it exploits
the algebraic properties of the Liouvillian superoperator to efficiently construct a basis for
the Arnoldi iteration problem. The advantage of our method is double: (i) It provides a faster-than-the-clock
method to efficiently obtain the steady state, meaning that it produces the steady state through
time evolution shorter than needed for the system to reach stationarity. (ii) It retrieves the low-lying
spectral properties of the Liouvillian with a minimal overhead, allowing to determine both which
quantum properties emerge and for how long they can be observed in a system. This method is general
and model-independent, and lends itself to the study of large systems where the determination of
the Liouvillian spectrum can be numerically demanding but the time evolution of the density matrix
is still doable. Our results can be extended to time evolution with a time-dependent Liouvillian.
In particular, our method works for Floquet (i.e., periodically driven) systems, where it allows
not only to construct the Floquet map for the slow-decaying processes, but also to retrieve the stroboscopic
steady state and the eigenspectrum of the Floquet map. We apply our method to several examples.

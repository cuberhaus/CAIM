The performance of the entanglement transmission task, i.e., distributing entanglement between
two arbitrarily distant nodes in a large-scale quantum network (QN), is notably benchmarked by
the classical entanglement percolation (CEP) scheme. Improvement of entanglement transmission
beyond CEP can only be achieved, with great loss of generality, by nonscalable strategies and/or
on restricted QN topologies. The possibility of finding a better scheme than CEP that remains scalable
and adaptable arises eventually from a new concurrence percolation theory (ConPT), essentially
an alternative and more effective mapping of QN than classical percolation, that roots not in probability
but in concurrence -- a fundamental measure of bipartite entanglement. ConPT suggests using not
generically probabilistic but deterministic protocols to produce a single highly entangled state
between two nodes. In light of the ConPT mapping, here we formalize a specific deterministic entanglement
transmission (DET) scheme that is fully analogous to resistor circuit analysis, implementing
the corresponding series and parallel rules by deterministic entanglement swapping and purification
protocols, respectively. The DET is designed for general $d$-dimensional information carriers
and is scalable and adaptable for any series-parallel QN, as it reduces the entanglement transmission
task to a purely topological problem of calculating path connectivity. Unlike CEP, different levels
of optimality in terms of $k$-concurrences can be observed in DET, depending on specific QN topologies.
More interestingly, our results suggest that the nesting feature of the well-known repeater protocol
for qubits is not helpful for optimizing the final concurrence, the proof of which necessarily relies
on a special reverse arithmetic mean--geometric mean (AM--GM) inequality.

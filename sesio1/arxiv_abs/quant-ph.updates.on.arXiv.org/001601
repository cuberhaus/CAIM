We study a model consisting of a central $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric trimer with non-Hermitian strength
parameter $\gamma$ coupled to two semi-infinite Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) leads. We show the
existence of two zero-energy modes, one of which is localized while the other is anti-localized.
For the remaining eigenvalues, we demonstrate two qualitatively distinct types of $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry
breaking. Within a subset of the parameter space corresponding to the topologically non-trivial
phase of the SSH chains, a gap opens within the broken $\mathcal{PT}$ regime of the discrete eigenvalue
spectrum. For relatively smaller values of $\gamma$, the eigenvalues are embedded in the two SSH
bands and hence become destabilized primarily due to the resonance interaction with the continuum.
We refer to this as reservoir-assisted $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking. As the value of $\gamma$
is increased, the eigenvalues exit the SSH bands and the discrete eigenstates become more strongly
localized in the central trimer region. This approximate decoupling results in the discrete spectrum
behaving more like the independent trimer, including both a region in which the $\mathcal{PT}$
symmetry is restored (the gap) and a second region in which it is broken again. At the exceptional
point (EP) marking the boundary between the gap and the second $\mathcal{PT}$-broken region, two
of the eigenstates coalesce with the localized zero-energy mode, resulting in a third-order exceptional
point (EP3). At the other boundaries of the parameter space at which the gap vanishes, similar higher-order
EPs can form as pairs of the discrete eigenstates coalesce with either of the two zero-energy states.
The EPs of order $N$ formed of the localized zero-energy state give rise to a characteristic $\sim
t^{2N-2}$ evolution in the survival probability dynamics, which we propose to measure in a photonic
lattice experiment.

The max-relative entropy and the conditional min-entropy it induces have become central to one-shot
information theory. Both may be expressed in terms of a conic program over the positive semidefinite
cone. Recently, it was shown that the same conic program altered to be over the separable cone admits
an operational interpretation in terms of communicating classical information over a quantum
channel. In this work, we generalize this framework of replacing the cone to determine which results
in quantum information theory rely upon the positive semidefinite cone and which can be generalized.
We show the fully quantum Stein's lemma and asymptotic equipartition property break down if the
cone exponentially increases in resourcefulness but never approximates the positive semidefinite
cone. However, we show for CQ states, the separable cone is sufficient to recover the asymptotic
theory, thereby drawing a strong distinction between the fully and partial quantum settings. We
present parallel results for the extended conditional min-entropy. In doing so, we extend the notion
of k-superpositive channels to superchannels. We also present operational uses of this framework.
We first show the cone restricted min-entropy of a Choi operator captures a measure of entanglement-assisted
noiseless classical communication using restricted measurements. We show that quantum majorization
results naturally generalize to other cones. As a novel example, we introduce a new min-entropy-like
quantity that captures the quantum majorization of quantum channels in terms of bistochastic pre-processing.
Lastly, we relate this framework to general conic norms and their non-additivity. Throughout this
work we emphasize the introduced measures' relationship to general convex resource theories.
In particular, we look at both resource theories that capture locality and resource theories of
coherence/Abelian symmetries.

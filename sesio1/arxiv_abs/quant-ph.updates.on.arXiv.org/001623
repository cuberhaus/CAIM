Hypothetical short-range interactions could be detected by measuring the wavefunctions of ultracold
neutrons (UCNs) on a mirror bounded by the Earth's gravitational field. The Searches require detectors
with higher spatial resolution. We are developing a UCN detector for the with a high spatial resolution,
which consists of a Si substrate, a thin converter layer including $^{10}$B$_{4}$C, and a layer
of fine-grained nuclear emulsion. Its resolution was estimated to be less than 100 nm by fitting
tracks of either $^{7}$Li nuclei or $\alpha$-particles, which were created when neutrons interacted
with the $^{10}$B$_{4}$C layer. For actual measurements of the spatial distributions, the following
two improvements were made: The first was to establish a method to align microscopic images with
high accuracy within a wide region of 65 mm $\times$ 0.2 mm. We created reference marks of 1 $\mu$m
and 5 $\mu$m diameter with an interval of 50 $\mu$m and 500 $\mu$m, respectively, on the Si substrate
by electron beam lithography and realized a position accuracy of less than 30 nm. The second was to
build a holder that could maintain the atmospheric pressure around the nuclear emulsion to utilize
it under vacuum during exposure to UCNs. The intrinsic resolution of the improved detector was estimated
by evaluating the blur of a transmission image of a gadolinium grating taken by cold neutrons as better
than 0.56 $\pm$ 0.08 $\mu$m, which included the grating accuracy. A test exposure to UCNs was conducted
to obtain the spatial distribution of UCNs in the Earth's gravitational field. Although the test
was successful, a blurring of 6.9 $\mu$m was found in the measurements, compared with a theoretical
curve. We identified the blurring caused by the refraction of UCNs due to the roughness of the upstream
surface of the substrate. Polishing of the surface makes the resolution less than 100 nm.

Sampling from the stationary distribution is one of the fundamental tasks of Markov chain-based
algorithms and has important applications in machine learning, combinatorial optimization and
network science. For the quantum case, qsampling from Markov chains can be constructed as preparing
quantum states with amplitudes arbitrarily close to the square root of a stationary distribution
instead of classical sampling from a stationary distribution. In this paper, a new qsampling algorithm
for all reversible Markov chains is constructed by discrete-time quantum walks and works without
any limit compared with existing results. In detail, we build a qsampling algorithm that not only
accelerates non-regular graphs but also keeps the speed-up of existing quantum algorithms for
regular graphs. In non-regular graphs, the invocation of the quantum fast-forward algorithm accelerates
existing state-of-the-art qsampling algorithms for both discrete-time and continuous-time
cases, especially on sparse graphs. Compared to existing algorithms we reduce log n, where n is the
number of graph vertices. In regular graphs, our result matches other quantum algorithms, and our
reliance on the gap of Markov chains achieves quadratic speedup compared with classical cases.
For both cases, we reduce the number of ancilla qubits required compared to the existing results.
In some widely used graphs and a series of sparse graphs where stationary distributions are difficult
to reach quickly, our algorithm is the first algorithm to achieve complete quadratic acceleration
(without log factor) over the classical case without any limit. To enlarge success probability
amplitude amplification is introduced. We construct a new reflection on stationary state with
fewer ancilla qubits and think it may have independent application.

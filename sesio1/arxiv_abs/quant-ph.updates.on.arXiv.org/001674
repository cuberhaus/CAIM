An active electrical network contains a voltage or current source that creates electromagnetic
energy through a method of transduction that enables the separation of opposite polarity charges
from an external source. The end result is the creation of an active dipole with a permanent polarisation
and a non-zero electric vector curl. The external energy input impresses a force per unit charge
within the voltage source, to form an active physical dipole in the static case, or an active Hertzian
dipole in the time dependent case. This system is the dual of an electromagnet or permanent magnet
excited by a circulating electrical current or fictitious bound current respectively, which supplies
a magnetomotive force described by a magnetic vector potential with a magnetic geometric phase
proportional to the enclosed magnetic flux. In contrast, the active electric dipole may be described
macroscopically by a circulating fictitious magnetic current boundary source described by an
electric vector potential with an electric geometric phase proportional to the enclosed electric
flux density. This macroscopic description of an active dipole is an average description of some
underlying microscopic description exhibiting emergent nonconservative behaviour not found
in classical conservative laws of electrodynamics. We show that the electromotive force produced
by an active dipole must have both electric scalar and vector potential components to account for
the magnitude of the voltage it produces. Following this we analyse an active cylindrical dipole
in terms of scalar and vector potential and confirm that the electromotive force produced, and hence
potential difference across the terminals is a combination of vector and scalar potential difference
depending on aspect ratio of the dipole.

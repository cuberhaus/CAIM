Speed of state transitions in macroscopic systems is a crucial concept for foundations of nonequilibrium
statistical mechanics as well as various applications represented by optimal quantum control.
While extensive studies have made efforts to obtain rigorous constraints on dynamical processes
since Mandelstam and Tamm, speed limits that provide tight bounds for macroscopic transitions
have remained elusive. Here, by employing the continuity equation of probability, the fundamental
principle in physics, we develop a general framework for deriving much tighter speed limits for
macroscopic systems than many conventional speed limits. We show that the speed of the expectation
value of an observable defined on a general graph is bounded by the "smoothness" of the observable
and the local probability current. As a primary application for our framework, we derive quantum
speed limits for macroscopic unitary dynamics. Unlike previous bounds, the speed limit includes
the expectation value of the transition Hamiltonian, which can decrease the speed because of the
suppression of the quantum phase difference of the state. We also find for the first time that, beyond
expectation values of macroscopic observables, the speed of macroscopic quantum coherence can
be bounded from above by our general approach. The newly obtained bounds are verified in transport
phenomena in particle systems and relaxation dynamics in many-body spin systems. We also demonstrate
that our strategy can be applied for finding speed limits for macroscopic transitions in classical
and quantum stochastic systems, where the bounds are expressed by the standard or Hatano-Sasa entropy
production rate. Our work paves the way toward discovering novel speed limits on the basis of continuity
equations, which can provide unprecedented fundamental limits to various nonequilibrium macroscopic
phenomena.

We introduce operational quantum tasks based on betting with risk-aversion -- or quantum betting
tasks for short -- inspired by standard quantum state discrimination and classical horse betting
with risk-aversion and side information. In particular, we introduce the operational tasks of
quantum state betting (QSB), noisy quantum state betting (nQSB), and quantum channel betting (QCB)
played by gamblers with different risk tendencies. We prove that the advantage that informative
measurements (non-constant channels) provide in QSB (nQSB) is exactly characterised by Arimoto's
$\alpha$-mutual information, with the order $\alpha$ determining the risk aversion of the gambler.
More generally, we show that Arimoto-type information-theoretic quantities characterise the
advantage that resourceful objects offer at playing quantum betting tasks when compared to resourceless
objects, for general quantum resource theories (QRTs) of measurements, channels, states, and
state-measurement pairs, with arbitrary resources. In limiting cases, we show that QSB (QCB) recovers
the known tasks of quantum state (channel) discrimination when $\alpha \rightarrow \infty$, and
quantum state (channel) exclusion when $\alpha \rightarrow -\infty$. Inspired by these connections,
we also introduce new quantum R\'enyi divergences for measurements, and derive a new family of resource
monotones for the QRT of measurement informativeness. This family of resource monotones recovers
in the same limiting cases as above, the generalised robustness and the weight of informativeness.
Altogether, these results establish a broad and continuous family of four-way correspondences
between operational tasks, mutual information measures, quantum R\'enyi divergences, and resource
monotones, that can be seen to generalise two limiting correspondences that were recently discovered
for the QRT of measurement informativeness.

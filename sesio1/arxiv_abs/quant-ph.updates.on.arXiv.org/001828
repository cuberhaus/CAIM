We generalize the theory of catalytic quantum randomness to delocalized and dynamical settings.
First, we expand the resource theory of randomness (RTR) by calculating the amount of entropy catalytically
extractable from a correlated or dynamical randomness source. In doing so, we show that no entropy
can be catalytically extracted when one cannot implement local projective measurement on randomness
source without altering its state. The RTR, as an archetype of the `concave' resource theory, is
complementary to the convex resource theories in which the amount of randomness required to erase
the resource is a resource measure. As an application, we prove that quantum operation cannot be
hidden in correlation between two parties without using randomness, which is the dynamical generalization
of the no-hiding theorem. Second, we study the physical properties of information flow. Popularized
quotes like "information is physical" or "it from bit" suggest the matter-like picture of information
that can travel with the definite direction while leaving detectable traces on its region of departure.
To examine the validity of this picture, we focus on that catalysis of randomness models directional
flow of information with the distinguished source and recipient. We show that classical information
can always spread from its source without altering its source or its surrounding context, like an
immaterial entity, while quantum information cannot. We suggest an approach to formal definition
of semantic quantum information and claim that utilizing semantic information is equivalent to
using a partially depleted information source. By doing so, we unify the utilization of semantic
and non-semantic quantum information and conclude that one can always extract more information
from an incompletely depleted classical randomness source, but it is not possible for quantum randomness
sources.

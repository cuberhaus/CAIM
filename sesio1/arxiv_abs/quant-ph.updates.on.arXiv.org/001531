As small quantum computers are becoming available on different physical platforms, a benchmarking
task known as cross-platform verification has been proposed that aims to estimate the fidelity
of states prepared on two quantum computers. This task is fundamentally distributed, as no quantum
communication can be performed between the two physical platforms due to hardware constraints,
which prohibits a joint SWAP test. In this paper we settle the sample complexity of this task across
all measurement and communication settings. The essence of the task, which we call distributed
quantum inner product estimation, involves two players Alice and Bob who have $k$ copies of unknown
states $\rho,\sigma$ (acting on $\mathbb{C}^{d}$) respectively. Their goal is to estimate $\mathrm{Tr}(\rho\sigma)$
up to additive error $\varepsilon\in(0,1)$, using local quantum operations and classical communication.
In the weakest setting where only non-adaptive single-copy measurements and simultaneous message
passing are allowed, we show that $k=O(\max\{1/\varepsilon^2,\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon\})$ copies
suffice. This achieves a savings compared to full tomography which takes $\Omega(d^3)$ copies
with single-copy measurements. Surprisingly, we also show that the sample complexity must be at
least $\Omega(\max\{1/\varepsilon^2,\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon\})$, even in the strongest setting
where adaptive multi-copy measurements and arbitrary rounds of communication are allowed. This
shows that the success achieved by shadow tomography, for sample-efficiently learning the properties
of a single system, cannot be generalized to the distributed setting. Furthermore, the fact that
the sample complexity remains the same with single and multi-copy measurements contrasts with
single system quantum property testing, which often demonstrate exponential separations in sample
complexity with single and multi-copy measurements.

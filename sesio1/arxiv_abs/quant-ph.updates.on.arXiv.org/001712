We systematically study the fundamental competition between quantum error correction (QEC) and
continuous symmetries, two key notions in quantum information and physics, in a quantitative manner.
Three meaningful measures of approximate symmetries in quantum channels and in particular QEC
codes, respectively based on the violation of covariance conditions over the entire symmetry group
or at a local point, and the violation of charge conservation, are introduced and studied. Each measure
induces a corresponding characterization of approximately covariant codes. We explicate a host
of different ideas and techniques that enable us to derive various forms of trade-off relations
between the QEC inaccuracy and all symmetry violation measures. More specifically, we introduce
two frameworks for understanding and establishing the trade-offs respectively based on the notions
of charge fluctuation and gate implementation error, and employ methods including the Knill--Laflamme
conditions as well as quantum metrology and quantum resource theory for the derivation. From the
perspective of fault-tolerant quantum computing, our bounds on symmetry violation indicate limitations
on the precision or density of transversally implementable logical gates for general QEC codes,
refining the Eastin--Knill theorem. To exemplify nontrivial approximately covariant codes and
understand the achievability of the above fundamental limits, we analyze the behaviors of two explicit
types of codes: a parametrized extension of the thermodynamic code (which gives a construction
of a code family that continuously interpolates between exact QEC and exact symmetry), and the quantum
Reed--Muller codes. We show that both codes can saturate the scaling of the bounds for group-global
covariance and charge conservation asymptotically, indicating the near-optimality of these
bounds and codes.

The significance of negative quantum conditional entropy is underscored by its ubiquity in information
processing tasks like dense coding, state merging and one-way entanglement distillation. Mere
presence of entanglement is not sufficient for these tasks, a fact underpinned by the existence
of entangled quantum states with non-negative conditional entropy. This stimulates one to go beyond
the paradigm of entanglement theory and probe the hitherto unexplored area of operations influencing
quantum conditional entropy. To this end, we introduce the class of A-unital channels. We characterize
them and demonstrate that A-unital channels are to states having non-negative conditional entropy
what separable channels are to separable states. We also show that A-unital channels form the largest
class of channels that do not decrease the conditional entropy of any state, a relation analogous
to unital channels and entropy. A comparative study between A-unital and other channels crucial
to the resource theory of entanglement is done to further exemplify the distinction with entanglement
theory. Non-local unitary operations can decrease conditional entropy to sub-zero levels. However,
there exist states whose conditional entropy remains non-negative even under this action. Termed
as states having absolute conditional entropy, they prove to be robust against non-local unitary
action. In this work, the completely free operations for such states are also characterized. Finally,
since von Neumann entropy is the mainspring of these discussions, the bounds on the conditional
entropy of states having a given entropy are derived. The definition of A-unital channels naturally
lends itself to a procedure for determining membership of channels in this class. Thus, we not only
characterize completely free channels for quantum conditional entropy, but also show how resourceful
channels can be detected.

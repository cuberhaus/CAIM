Experiments in spintronics and magnonics operate with macroscopically large number of localized
spins within ferromagnetic (F) or antiferromagnetic (AF) materials, so that their nonequilibrium
dynamics is standardly described by the Landau-Lifshitz (LL) equation treating localized spins
as classical vectors of fixed length. However, spin is a genuine quantum degree of freedom, and even
though quantum effects become progressively less important for spin value $S>1$, they exist for
all $S < \infty$. While this has motivated exploration of limitations/breakdown of the LL equation,
by using examples of F insulators, analogous comparison of fully quantum many-body vs. quantum
(for electrons)-classical (for localized spins) dynamics in systems where nonequilibrium conduction
electrons are present is lacking. Here we employ quantum Heisenberg F or AF chains of $N=4$ sites,
whose localized spins interact with conduction electrons via $sd$ exchange interaction, to perform
such comparison by starting from unentangled pure (at zero temperature) or mixed (at finite temperature)
quantum state of localized spins as the initial condition. This reveals that quantum-classical
dynamics can faithfully reproduce fully quantum dynamics in the F metallic case, but only when spin
$S$, Heisenberg exchange between localized spins and $sd$ exchange are sufficiently small. Increasing
any of these three parameters can lead to substantial deviations, which are explained by the dynamical
buildup of entanglement between localized spins and/or between them and electrons. In the AF metallic
case, substantial deviations appear even at early times, despite starting from unentangled N\'{e}el
state, which therefore poses a challenge on how to rigorously justify wide usage of the LL equation
in phenomenological modeling of antiferromagnetic spintronics experiments.

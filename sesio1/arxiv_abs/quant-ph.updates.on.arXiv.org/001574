The strong light-matter interaction in microcavities gives rise to intriguing phenomena, such
as cavity-mediated transport that can potentially overcome the Anderson localization. Yet, an
accurate theoretical treatment is challenging as the matter (e.g.,molecules) are subject to large
energetic disorder. In this article, we develop the Green's function solution to the Fano-Anderson
model and use the exact analytical solution to quantify the effects of energetic disorder on the
spectral and transport properties in microcavities. Starting from microscopic equation of motions,
we derive an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and predict a set of scaling laws: (i) The complex
eigen-energies of the effective Hamiltonian exhibit an exceptional point, which leads to underdamped
coherent dynamics in the weak disorder regime, where the decay rate increases with disorder, and
overdamped incoherent dynamics in the strong disorder regime, where the slow decay rate decreases
with disorder. (ii) The total density of states of disordered ensembles can be exactly partitioned
into the cavity, bright-state and dark-state local density of states, which are determined by the
complex eigen solutions and can be measured via spectroscopy. (iii) The cavity-mediated relaxation
and transport dynamics are intimately related such that the energy-resolved relaxation and transport
rates are proportional to the cavity local density of states. The ratio of the disorder averaged
relaxation and transport rates equals the molecule number, which can be interpreted as a result
of a quantum random walk. (iv) A turnover in the rates as a function of disorder or molecule density
can be explained in terms of the overlap of the disorder distribution function and the cavity local
density of states. These findings reveal the significant impact of the dark states on the transport
properties of disordered ensembles in cavities.

We use the idea of the Wigner probability distribution (WPD) in a reduced scattering phase space
(RPS) for the elastic scattering cross-section, with the help of a Tight-Binding (TB) numerical
procedure allowing us to consider the anisotropic quantum effects, to phenomenologically predict
several phases in these two novel unconventional superconductors. Unlike our previous works with
pieces of evidence that these two compounds are in the unitary strong scattering regime and that
superconductivity is suppressed by the atoms of strontium in both materials, several phases are
built. In the case of the strontium-substituted lanthanum cuprate, it was found three phases from
one family of Wigner probabilistic distributions, one corresponding to the antiferromagnetic
compound La2CuO4 another one which consists of a coalescing metallic phase for very lightly doped
La2-xSrxCuO4, and finally a strong self-consistent dependent strange metal phase with optimal
levels of doping. In the case of a triplet superconductor strontium ruthenate, three phases can
be differentiated from two families of Wigner distribution probabilities, one family of WDP with
point nodes where Cooper pairs and dressed scattered normal quasiparticles are mixed for the whole
range of frequencies and which correspond to an FS $\gamma$ flat-sheet in the ground metallic state,
and two phases from another WPD family, where, in one of then, the Miyake-Narikiyo quasinodal tiny
gap model allows the unique presence of Cooper pairs in a tiny interval of frequencies near the superconducting
transition TC, the other phase corresponds to the mixed-phase with Cooper pairs and dressed by stoichiometric
strontium non-magnetic atoms, where strong self-consistent effects are noticeable. This approach
allows comparing experimental results for samples in both compounds with numerical analysis studies.

A modern computer system, based on the von Neumann architecture, is a complicated system with several
interactive modular parts. Quantum computing, as the most generic usage of quantum information,
follows a hybrid architecture so far, namely, quantum algorithms are stored and controlled classically,
and mainly the executions of them are quantum, leading to the so-called quantum processing units.
Such a quantum-classical hybrid is constrained by its classical ingredients, and cannot reveal
the computational power of a fully quantum computer system as conceived from the beginning of the
field. Recently, the nature of quantum information has been further recognized, such as the no-programming
and no-control theorems, and the unifying understandings of quantum algorithms and computing
models. As a result, in this work we propose a model of universal quantum computer system, the quantum
version of the von Neumann architecture. It uses ebits (i.e., Bell states) as elements of the quantum
memory unit, and qubits as elements of the quantum control unit and processing unit. As a digital
quantum system, its global configurations can be viewed as tensor-network states. Its universality
is proved by the capability to execute quantum algorithms based on a program composition scheme
via a universal quantum gate teleportation. It is also protected by the uncertainty principle,
the fundamental law of quantum information, making it quantum-secure distinct from the classical
case. In particular, we introduce a few variants of quantum circuits, including the tailed, nested,
and topological ones, to characterize the roles of quantum memory and control, which could also
be of independent interest in other contexts. In all, our primary study demonstrates the manifold
power of quantum information and paves the way for the creation of quantum computer systems in the
near future.

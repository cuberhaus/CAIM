We present a quantum circuit synthesis algorithm for implementing universal fault-tolerant quantum
computing based on concatenated codes. To realize fault-tolerant quantum computing, the fault-tolerant
quantum protocols should be transformed into executable quantum circuits based on the nearest-neighbor
interaction. Unlike topological codes that are defined based on local operations fundamentally,
for the concatenated codes, it is possible to obtain the circuits composed of the local operations
by applying the quantum circuit synthesis. However, by the existing quantum circuit synthesis
developed for ordinary quantum computational algorithms, the fault-tolerant of the protocol
may not be preserved in the resulting circuit. Besides, we have to consider something more to implement
the quantum circuit of universal fault-tolerant quantum computing. First, we have not to propagate
quantum errors on data qubits when selecting a qubit move path (a sequence of \emph{SWAP} gates)
to satisfy the geometric locality constraint. Second, the circuit should be self-contained so
that it is possible to act independently regardless of the situation. Third, for universal fault-tolerant
quantum computing, we require multiple fault-tolerant quantum circuits of multiple fault-tolerant
quantum protocols acting on the same input, a logical data qubit. Last, we need to recall fault-tolerant
protocols such as syndrome measure and encoder implicitly include classical control processing
conditioned on the measurement outcomes, and therefore have to partition the quantum circuits
in time flow to execute the classical control as the architect intended. We propose the circuit synthesis
method resolving the requirements and show how to synthesize the set of universal fault-tolerant
protocols for $[[7,1,3]]$ Steane code and the syndrome measurement protocol of $[[23, 1, 7]]$ Golay
code.

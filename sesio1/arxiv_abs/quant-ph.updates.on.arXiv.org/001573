This thesis deals with the problematics of scalability of fault tolerant quantum computing. This
question is studied under the angle of estimating the resources needed to set up such computers.
What we call resource is in principle very general, it could be the power, the energy, the total bandwidth
allocated to the different qubits... However, we mainly focus on the energetic cost of quantum computing.
In particular, we develop a multi-disciplinary approach that allows to minimize the resources
required to implement algorithms on quantum computers. By asking to find the minimum amount of resources
required to perform a computation under the constraint that the algorithm provides a correct answer
with a targeted accuracy, it is possible to optimize the full computer in order to minimize the resources
spent, while being certain to have a correct answer with a high probability. We apply this approach
to a complete model fault-tolerant quantum computer based on superconducting qubits. Our results
indicate that for algorithms implemented on thousands of logical qubits, our method makes possible
to reduce the energetic cost by orders of magnitudes in regimes where, without optimizing, the power
consumption could be close to the gigawatt. This work illustrates the fact that the energetic cost
of quantum computing should be a criterion in itself allowing to evaluate the scaling potential
of a given quantum computer technology. It also illustrates that the optimization of the architecture
of a quantum computer, via transverse methods, including algorithms, error correction, qubit
physics, engineering aspects, such as the ones that we propose, can prove to be a powerful tool, clearly
improving the scaling potential of quantum computers. Finally, we provide general hints about
how to make fault-tolerant quantum computers energy efficient.

Quantum network protocols offer new functionalities such as enhanced security to communication
and computational systems. Despite the rapid progress in quantum hardware, it has not yet reached
a level of maturity that enables execution of many quantum protocols in practical settings. To develop
quantum protocols in real world, it is necessary to examine their performance considering the imperfections
in their practical implementation using simulation platforms. In this paper, we consider several
quantum protocols that enable promising functionalities and services in near-future quantum
networks. The protocols are chosen from both areas of quantum communication and quantum computation
as follows: quantum money, W-state based anonymous transmission, verifiable blind quantum computation,
and quantum digital signature. We use NetSquid simulation platform to evaluate the effect of various
sources of noise on the performance of these protocols, considering different figures of merit.
We find that to enable quantum money protocol, the decoherence time constant of the quantum memory
must be at least three times the storage time of qubits. Furthermore, our simulation results for
the w-state based anonymous transmission protocol show that to achieve an average fidelity above
0.8 in this protocol, the storage time of sender's and receiver's particles in the quantum memory
must be less than half of the decoherence time constant of the quantum memory. We have also investigated
the effect of gate imperfections on the performance of verifiable blind quantum computation. We
find that with our chosen parameters, if the depolarizing probability of quantum gates is equal
to or greater than 0.05, the security of the protocol cannot be guaranteed. Lastly, our simulation
results for quantum digital signature protocol show that channel loss has a significant effect
on the probability of repudiation.

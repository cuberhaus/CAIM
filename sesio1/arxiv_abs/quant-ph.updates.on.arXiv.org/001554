Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) offer a promising path towards using near-term quantum
hardware for applications in academic and industrial research. These algorithms aim to find approximate
solutions to quantum problems by optimizing a parametrized quantum circuit using a classical optimization
algorithm. A successful VQA requires fast and reliable classical optimization algorithms. Understanding
and optimizing how off-the-shelf optimization methods perform in this context is important for
the future of the field. In this work we study the performance of four commonly used gradient-free
optimization methods: SLSQP, COBYLA, CMA-ES, and SPSA, at finding ground-state energies of a range
of small chemistry and material science problems. We test a telescoping sampling scheme (where
the accuracy of the cost-function estimate provided to the optimizer is increased as the optimization
converges) on all methods, demonstrating mixed results across our range of optimizers and problems
chosen. We further hyperparameter tune two of the four optimizers (CMA-ES and SPSA) across a large
range of models, and demonstrate that with appropriate hyperparameter tuning, CMA-ES is competitive
with and sometimes outperforms SPSA (which is not observed in the absence of hyperparameter tuning).
Finally, we investigate the ability of an optimizer to beat the `sampling noise floor', given by
the sampling noise on each cost-function estimate provided to the optimizer. Our results demonstrate
the necessity for tailoring and hyperparameter-tuning known optimization techniques for inherently-noisy
variational quantum algorithms, and that the variational landscape that one finds in a VQA is highly
problem- and system-dependent. This provides guidance for future implementations of these algorithms
in experiment.

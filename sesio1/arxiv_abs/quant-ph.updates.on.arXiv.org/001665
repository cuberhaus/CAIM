Quantum gravity is likely the deepest problem facing current physics. While traditionally associated
with short distance nonrenormalizability, it is evident that the long distance problem of unitarity,
arising at high energies with black hole formation, is more profound. This reveals a conflict between
foundational principles of quantum field theory: those of quantum mechanics, relativity, and
locality. Difficulties modifying quantum mechanics suggest a "quantum-first" approach, with
other principles as mathematical properties of a quantum space of states. A challenge is how to describe
locality, in terms of Hilbert space structure. Perturbative gravity gives clues, with structure
apparently different than in field theory. The mathematical structure of subsystems plausibly
supplants conventional locality and plays a foundational role in the theory. This view differs
from one of spacetime "emerging" from another quantum system. If a black hole behaves as a subsystem,
a "black hole theorem" says that unitarity requires interactions with its environment depending
on its state, or more drastic phenomena. Minimal interactions can be parameterized, in an effective
approach; they could arise from wormholes or other fundamental dynamics. These or other near-horizon
modifications potentially alter electromagnetic or gravitational signatures of this strong
gravity region, now being probed in a new era of observation; it is important to seek observational
clues for or constraints on such scenarios. One may also investigate quantum gravity via its S-matrix.
New perturbative structure has been discovered there, but the harder question again goes beyond
to the nonperturbative regime. Long-distance behavior of amplitudes indicates novel analytic
behavior; further exploration may provide important clues. Other key questions regard quantum
description of cosmologies, and of associated observables.

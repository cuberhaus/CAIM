Pricing financial derivatives, in particular European-style options at different time-maturities
and strikes, means a relevant problem in finance. The dynamics describing the price of vanilla options
when constant volatilities and interest rates are assumed, is governed by the Black-Scholes model,
a linear parabolic partial differential equation with terminal value given by the pay-off of the
option contract and no additional boundary conditions. Here, we present a digital quantum algorithm
to solve Black-Scholes equation on a quantum computer by mapping it to the Schr\"odinger equation.
The non-Hermitian nature of the resulting Hamiltonian is solved by embedding its propagator into
an enlarged Hilbert space by using only one additional ancillary qubit. Moreover, due to the election
of periodic boundary conditions, which are needed for an efficient diagonalization of the discretized
momentum operator, we duplicate the initial condition, which substantially improves the stability
and performance of the protocol. The algorithm shows a feasible approach for using Hamiltonian
simulation techniques to solve the price dynamics of financial derivatives on a digital quantum
computer. Our approach differs from those based on Monte Carlo integration, exclusively focused
on sampling the solution assuming the dynamics is known. Assuming a bounded truncation error, our
algorithm remarkably provides an exponential speedup with respect to classical numerical methods
when simulating the dynamics, reducing the complexity from $\mathcal{O}(2^{n})$ to $\mathcal{O}(\text{poly}(n))$.
We report expected accuracy levels comparable to classical numerical algorithms by using 10 qubits
and 94 entangling gates to simulate its dynamics on a fault-tolerant quantum computer, and an expected
success probability of the post-selection procedure due to the embedding protocol above 60%.

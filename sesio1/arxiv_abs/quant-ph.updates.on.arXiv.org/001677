We propose an extended version of the symmetry-adapted variational-quantum-eigensolver (VQE)
and apply it to a two-component Fermi-Hubbard model on a bipartite lattice. In the extended symmetry-adapted
VQE method, the Rayleigh quotient for the Hamiltonian and a parametrized quantum state in a properly
chosen subspace is minimized within the subspace and is optimized among the variational parameters
implemented on a quantum circuit to obtain variationally the ground state and the ground-state
energy. The corresponding energy derivative with respect to a variational parameter is expressed
as a Hellmann-Feynman-type formula of a generalized eigenvalue problem in the subspace, which
thus allows us to use the parameter-shift rules for its evaluation. The natural-gradient-descent
method is also generalized to optimize variational parameters in a quantum-subspace-expansion
approach. As a subspace for approximating the ground state of the Hamiltonian, we consider a Krylov
subspace generated by the Hamiltonian and a symmetry-projected variational state, and therefore
the approximated ground state can restore the Hamiltonian symmetry that is broken in the parametrized
variational state prepared on a quantum circuit. We show that spatial symmetry operations for fermions
in an occupation basis can be expressed as a product of the nearest-neighbor fermionic swap operations
on a quantum circuit. We also describe how the spin and charge symmetry operations, i.e., rotations,
can be implemented on a quantum circuit. By numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the spatial,
spin, and charge symmetry projections can improve the accuracy of the parametrized variational
state, which can be further improved systematically by expanding the Krylov subspace without increasing
the number of variational parameters.

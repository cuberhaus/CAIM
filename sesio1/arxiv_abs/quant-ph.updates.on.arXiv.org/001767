This PhD thesis combines two of the most exciting research areas of the last decades: quantum computing
and machine learning. We introduce dissipative quantum neural networks (DQNNs), which are designed
for fully quantum learning tasks, are capable of universal quantum computation and have low memory
requirements while training. These networks are optimised with training data pairs in form of input
and desired output states and therefore can be used for characterising unknown or untrusted quantum
devices. We not only demonstrate the generalisation behaviour of DQNNs using classical simulations,
but also implement them successfully on actual quantum computers. To understand the ultimate limits
for such quantum machine learning methods, we discuss the quantum no free lunch theorem, which describes
a bound on the probability that a quantum device, which can be modelled as a unitary process and is
optimised with quantum examples, gives an incorrect output for a random input. Moreover we expand
the area of applications of DQNNs in two directions. In the first case, we include additional information
beyond just the training data pairs: since quantum devices are always structured, the resulting
data is always structured as well. We modify the DQNN's training algorithm such that knowledge about
the graph-structure of the training data pairs is included in the training process and show that
this can lead to better generalisation behaviour. Both the original DQNN and the DQNN including
graph structure are trained with data pairs in order to characterise an underlying relation. However,
in the second extension of the algorithm we aim to learn characteristics of a set of quantum states
in order to extend it to quantum states which have similar properties. Therefore we build a generative
adversarial model where two DQNNs, called the generator and discriminator, are trained in a competitive
way.

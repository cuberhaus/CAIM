Quantum Information Networks (QIN) currently represent a major goal in the field quantum communication
technologies. Such QINs will allow connecting quantum devices (computers, sensors, communication
stations, etc) over long distances, thus improving significantly their intrinsic processing,
sensing, and security capabilities. The core mechanism of a QIN is quantum state teleportation,
demonstrated more than two decades ago, that consumes quantum entanglement which can be seen in
this context as a new kind of network resource. This paper is the result of the collaboration under
the auspices of the French Space agency (CNES) of academic research and a Space telecom industry
actor that has defined and now executes a long term roadmap towards operational QINs. Here, we address
the key elements of this roadmap and describe the stage we have reached in its execution. First, we
identify and quantitatively describe use cases per activity sector as a reference for the requirements
on the QINs, including key performance targets. Second, we define a high-level architecture of
a generic QIN so as to introduce structuring elements such as resource, layers, governance, etc.
We then focus on the architecture on the Space part to identify its main design drivers and critical
elements. A survey of the state-of-the-art of these critical elements, as well as issues related
to standardisation is then presented. Based on these elements, we explain our 3-stage roadmap.
Finally, we detail the already concluded first step of this roadmap, that is the design of a Space-to-ground
entanglement distribution demonstrator, which relies on detailed simulations so as to allocate
efficiently the performance requirements on each subsystems. We invite relevant entities to join
our roadmap to progress together towards the ambitious goal of operational QINs in the next decade.

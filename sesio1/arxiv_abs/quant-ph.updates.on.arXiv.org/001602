Logical gates are the building blocks of fault-tolerant quantum computation. While quantum error-corrected
memories have been extensively studied in the literature, detailed analyses of thresholds and
resource overheads of universal logical gate sets have so far been limited. In this paper, we present
a comprehensive framework for universal fault-tolerant logic motivated by the combined need for
(i) platform-independent logical gate definitions, (ii) flexible and scalable tools for numerical
analysis, and (iii) exploration of novel schemes for universal logic that improve resource overheads.
We first introduce the theory of fault-tolerant channels for describing logical gates holistically
in space-time. Focusing on channels based on surface codes, we introduce explicit, platform-independent
representations of topological logic gates -- called logical blocks -- and generate new, overhead-efficient
methods for universal quantum computation. As a specific example, we propose fault-tolerant schemes
based on surface codes concatenated with more general low-density parity check (LDPC) codes. The
logical blocks framework enables a convenient mapping from an abstract description of the logical
gate to a precise set of physical instructions for both circuit-based and fusion-based quantum
computation (FBQC). Using this, we numerically simulate a surface-code-based universal gate
set implemented with FBQC, and verify that the threshold for fault-tolerant gates is consistent
with the bulk memory threshold. We find that boundaries, defects, and twists, can significantly
impact the logical error rate scaling, with periodic boundary conditions potentially halving
the memory resource requirements. Motivated by the favorable logical error rate suppression for
boundaryless computation, we introduce a novel computational scheme based on the teleportation
of twists that may offer further resource reductions.

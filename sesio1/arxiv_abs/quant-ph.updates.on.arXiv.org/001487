One of the most challenging problems for the realization of a scalable quantum computer is to design
a physical device that keeps the error rate for each quantum processing operation low. These errors
can originate from the accuracy of quantum manipulation, such as the sweeping of a gate voltage in
solid state qubits or the duration of a laser pulse in optical schemes. Errors also result from decoherence,
which is often regarded as more crucial in the sense that it is inherent to the quantum system, being
fundamentally a consequence of the coupling to the external environment. Grouping small collections
of qubits into clusters with symmetries can protect parts of the calculation from decoherence.
We use 4-level cores with a straightforward generalization of discrete rotational symmetry, omega-rotation
invariance, to encode pairs of coupled qubits and universal 2-qubit logical gates. We include quantum
errors as a main source of decoherence, and show that symmetry makes logical operations particularly
resilient to untimely anisotropic qubit rotations. We propose a scalable scheme for universal
quantum computation where cores play the role of quantum-computational transistors, quansistors.
Initialization and readout are achieved by coupling to leads. The external leads are explicitly
considered and are assumed to be the other main source of decoherence. We show that quansistors can
be dynamically decoupled from the leads by tuning their internal parameters, giving them the versatility
required to act as controllable quantum memory units. With this dynamical decoupling, logical
operations within quansistors are also symmetry-protected from unbiased noise in their parameters.
We identify technologies that could implement omega-rotation invariance. Many of our results
can be generalized to higher-level omega-rotation-invariant systems, or adapted to clusters
with other symmetries.

Causal modelling is a tool for generating causal explanations of observed correlations and has
led to a deeper understanding of correlations in quantum networks. Existing frameworks for quantum
causality tend to focus on acyclic causal structures that are not fine-tuned i.e., where causal
connections between variables necessarily create correlations between them. However, fine-tuned
causal models which permit causation without correlation, play a crucial role in cryptography,
and cyclic causal models can be used to model physical processes involving feedback and may also
be relevant in exotic solutions of general relativity. Here we develop a causal modelling framework
capable of modelling causation in these general scenarios. The key feature of our framework is that
it allows operational and relativistic notions of causality to be independently defined and for
connections between them to be established. The framework first gives an operational way to study
causation that allows for cyclic, fine-tuned and non-classical causal influences. We then consider
how a causal model can be embedded in a space-time structure (modelled as a partial order) and propose
a compatibility condition for ensuring that the embedded causal model does not allow signalling
outside the space-time future. We identify several distinct classes of causal loops that can arise
in our framework, showing that compatibility with a space-time can rule out only some of them. We
discuss conditions for preventing superluminal signalling within arbitrary (and possibly cyclic)
causal structures and consider models of causation in post-quantum theories admitting so-called
jamming correlations. Finally, this work introduces the concept of a ``higher-order affects relation'',
which is useful for causal discovery in fined-tuned causal models.

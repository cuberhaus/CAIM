It has been conjectured that the Pauli exclusion principle alone may be responsible for a particular
geometric arrangement of confined systems of identical fermions even when there is no interaction
between them. These geometric structures, called Pauli crystals, are predicted for a two-dimensional
system of free fermions under harmonic confinement. It is assumed that the system consists of neutral
fermionic atoms with their spins frozen (spin-polarized) in order to avoid any form of electromagnetic
interaction. These crystalline patterns emerge as the most frequent configurations seen in a large
collection of single-shot pictures of the system. In this work, we pursue the possibility of this
outcome and consider a theoretical model that may capture both qualitatively and quantitatively
key features of the above mentioned setup. Our approach treats a quantum system of non-interacting
fermions as an effective classical system of particles that interact with an effective statistical
interaction potential that mimics the quantum statistics. For this model, we consider two-dimensional
few-body systems of harmonically confined particles that interact with a statistical potential
and calculate analytically the minimum energy configuration for specific values of relevant parameters.
The results for N=3 and 6 particles show that the minimum energy configuration corresponds to and
is in good quantitative agreement with the reported values of Pauli crystals seen in single-shot
imaging data obtained via the configuration density technique. Numerical results for larger systems
of N=15 and 30 particles show that the crystalline configurations observed are not the same as the
classical Wigner crystal structures that emerge should the confined charged particles interact
with a Coulomb potential. An important question floated is whether such structures do really exist
in a quantum system.

The spin degree of freedom of an electron or a nucleus is one of the most basic properties of nature
and functions as an excellent qubit, as it provides a natural two-level system that is insensitive
to electric fields, leading to long quantum coherence times. We review the physics of semiconductor
spin qubits, focusing not only on the early achievements of spin initialization, control, and readout
in GaAs quantum dots, but also on recent advances in Si and Ge spin qubits, including improved charge
control and readout, coupling to other quantum degrees of freedom, and scaling to larger system
sizes. We begin by introducing the four major types of spin qubits: single spin qubits, donor spin
qubits, singlet-triplet spin qubits, and exchange-only spin qubits. We then review the mesoscopic
physics of quantum dots, including single-electron charging, valleys, and spin-orbit coupling.
We next give a comprehensive overview of the physics of exchange interactions, a crucial resource
for single- and two-qubit control in spin qubits. The bulk of this review is centered on the presentation
of results from each major spin qubit type, the present limits of fidelity, and a brief overview of
alternative spin qubit platforms. We then give a physical description of the impact of noise on semiconductor
spin qubits, aided in large part by an introduction to the filter function formalism. Lastly, we
review recent efforts to hybridize spin qubits with superconducting systems, including charge-photon
coupling, spin-photon coupling, and long-range cavity-mediated spin-spin interactions. Cavity-based
readout approaches are also discussed. This review is intended to give an appreciation for the future
prospects of semiconductor spin qubits, while highlighting the key advances in mesoscopic physics
over the past two decades that underlie the operation of modern quantum-dot and donor spin qubits.

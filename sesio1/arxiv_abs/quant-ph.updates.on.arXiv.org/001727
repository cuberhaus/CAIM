Floquet driven systems represent an extremely interesting arena to study out-of-equilibrium
phenomena. For instance, they provide realizations of discrete time crystals, where the discrete
time translation symmetry of the periodic Hamiltonian is spontaneously broken by a subharmonic
response of the system. However, the continuous presence of an external periodic driving is required
within the current Floquet paradigm. We propose here the concept of spontaneous many-body Floquet
state. This is a state that, in the absence of external periodic driving, self-oscillates like in
the presence of a periodic Hamiltonian, this behavior being spontaneously induced by many-body
interactions. In addition, its quantum fluctuations are described by regular Floquet theory.
Furthermore, it is also a time crystal, presenting long-range time-periodic order. However, this
crystalline behavior is very different to that of conventional Floquet discrete time crystals:
here, there is no external periodic driving, energy is conserved, and the nature of the spontaneous
symmetry breaking is continuous instead of discrete. We demonstrate that spontaneous many-body
Floquet states can emerge in a variety of canonical many-body problems, ranging from interacting
fermions to Bose-Hubbard models. We specifically show that a spontaneous many-body Floquet state
is a universal intrinsic state of a one-dimensional flowing atom condensate, both subsonic and
supersonic, resulting from a dynamical phase transition and robust against external perturbations
and quantum fluctuations, proposing also realistic experimental scenarios for its observation.
A spontaneous many-body Floquet state not only represents a realization of a continuous time crystal,
but also a novel paradigm in Floquet physics.

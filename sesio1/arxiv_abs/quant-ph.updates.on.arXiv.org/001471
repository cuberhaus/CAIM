The challenge of quantum computing is to combine error resilience with universal computation.
Diagonal gates such as the transversal $T$ gate play an important role in implementing a universal
set of quantum operations. This paper introduces a framework that describes the process of preparing
a code state, applying a diagonal physical gate, measuring a code syndrome, and applying a Pauli
correction that may depend on the measured syndrome (the average logical channel induced by an arbitrary
diagonal gate). It focuses on CSS codes, and describes the interaction of code states and physical
gates in terms of generator coefficients determined by the induced logical operator. The interaction
of code states and diagonal gates depends very strongly on the signs of $Z$-stabilizers in the CSS
code, and the proposed generator coefficient framework explicitly includes this degree of freedom.
The paper derives necessary and sufficient conditions for an arbitrary diagonal gate to preserve
the code space of a stabilizer code, and provides an explicit expression of the induced logical operator.
When the diagonal gate is a quadratic form diagonal gate (introduced by Rengaswamy et al.), the conditions
can be expressed in terms of divisibility of weights in the two classical codes that determine the
CSS code. These codes find application in magic state distillation and elsewhere. When all the signs
are positive, the paper characterizes all possible CSS codes, invariant under transversal $Z$-rotation
through $\pi/2^l$, that are constructed from classical Reed-Muller codes by deriving the necessary
and sufficient constraints on $l$. The generator coefficient framework extends to arbitrary stabilizer
codes but there is nothing to be gained by considering the more general class of non-degenerate stabilizer
codes.

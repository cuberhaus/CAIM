We are in the midst of quantum hype with some excessive claims of quantum computing potential, many
vendors' and even some research organizations' exaggerations, and a funding frenzy for very low
technology readiness level startups. Governments are contributing to this hype with their large
quantum initiatives and their technology sovereignty aspirations. Technology hypes are not bad
per se since they create emulation, drive innovations and also contribute to attracting new talents.
It works as scientists and vendors deliver progress and innovation on a continuous basis after a
so-called peak of expectations. It fails with exaggerated overpromises and underdeliveries that
last too long. It could cut short research and innovation funding, creating some sort of quantum
winter. After looking at the shape and form of technology and science hypes and driving some lessons
from past hypes, we investigate the current quantum hype and its specifics. We find that, although
there is some significant uncertainty on the potential to create real scalable quantum computers,
the scientific and vendor fields are relatively sane and solid compared to other technology hypes.
The vendors hype has some profound and disruptive impact on the organization of fundamental research.
Also, quantum technologies comprise other fields like quantum telecommunications and quantum
sensing with a higher technology readiness level, which are less prone to hype. We then make some
proposals to mitigate the potential negative effects of the current quantum hype including recommendations
on scientific communication to strengthen the trust in quantum science, vendor behavior improvements,
benchmarking methodologies, public education and putting in place a responsible research and
innovation approach.

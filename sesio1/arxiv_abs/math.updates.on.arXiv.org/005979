In the past 20 years, the enumeration of plane lattice walks confined to a convex cone -- normalized
into the first quadrant -- has received a lot of attention, stimulated the development of several
original approaches, and led to a rich collection of results. Most of them deal with the nature of
the associated generating function: for which models is it algebraic, D-finite, D-algebraic?
By model, what we mean is a finite collection of allowed steps. More recently, similar questions
have been raised for non-convex cones, typically the three-quadrant cone $C = \{ (i,j) : i \geq 0 \text{
or } j \geq 0 \}$. They turn out to be more difficult than their quadrant counterparts. In this paper,
we investigate a collection of eight models in $C$. This collection consists of diagonally symmetric
models in $\{-1, 0,1\}^2\setminus\{(-1,1), (1,-1)\}$. Three of them are known not to be D-algebraic.
We show that the remaining five can be solved in a uniform fashion using Tutte's notion of \emph{invariants},
which has already proved useful for some quadrant models. Three models are found to be algebraic,
one is (only) D-finite, and the last one is (only) D-algebraic. We also solve in the same fashion the
diagonal model $\{ \nearrow, \nwarrow, \swarrow, \searrow\}$, which is D-finite. The three algebraic
models are those of the Kreweras trilogy, $S=\{\nearrow, \leftarrow, \downarrow\}$, $S'=\{\rightarrow,
\uparrow, \swarrow\}$, and $S\cup S'$. Our solutions take similar forms for all six models. Roughly
speaking, the square of the generating function of three-quadrant walks with steps in $S$ is an explicit
rational function in the quadrant generating function with steps in $\{(j-i,j): (i,j) \in S\}$.
We derive various corollaries, including an explicit algebraic description of the positive harmonic
function in $C$ for the five models that are at least D-finite.

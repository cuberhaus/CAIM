In 1985, V. Scheffer discussed partial regularity results for what he called solutions to the "Navier-Stokes
inequality". These maps essentially satisfy the incompressibility condition as well as the local
and global energy inequalities and the pressure equation which may be derived formally from the
Navier-Stokes system of equations, but they are not required to satisfy the Navier-Stokes system
itself. One may extend this notion to a system considered by Fang-Hua Lin and Chun Liu in the mid 1990s
related to models of the flow of nematic liquid crystals, which include the Navier-Stokes system
when the "director field" $d$ is taken to be zero. In addition to an extended Navier-Stokes system,
the Lin-Liu model includes a further parabolic system which implies an a priori maximum principle
for $d$, which is lost when one considers the analogous 'inequality'. In 2018, Qiao Liu proved a partial
regularity result for certain solutions to the Lin-Liu model in terms of the parabolic fractal dimension
$\textrm{dim}_{\textrm{pf}}$, relying on the boundedness of $d$ coming from the maximum principle.
Specifically, Q. Liu proves $\textrm{dim}_{\textrm{pf}}(\Sigma_{-} \cap \mathcal{K}) \leq
\tfrac{95}{63}$ for any compact $\mathcal{K}$, where $\Sigma_{-}$ is the set of "forward-singular"
space-time points, near which the solution blows up forwards in time. For solutions to the corresponding
"inequality", we prove that, without any compensation for the lack of maximum principle, one has
$\textrm{dim}_{\textrm{pf}}(\Sigma_{-} \cap \mathcal{K}) \leq \tfrac {55}{13}$. We also provide
a range of criteria, including as just one example the boundedness of $d$, any one of which would furthermore
imply that $\textrm{dim}_{\textrm{pf}}(\Sigma_{-} \cap \mathcal{K}) \leq \tfrac{95}{63}$
for solutions to the inequality, just as Q. Liu proved for solutions to the Lin-Liu system itself.

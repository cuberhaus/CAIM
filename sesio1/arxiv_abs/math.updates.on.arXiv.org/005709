Models used for many important engineering and natural systems are imperfect. The discrepancy
between the mathematical representations of a true physical system and its imperfect model is called
the model error. These model errors can lead to substantial difference between the numerical solutions
of the model and the observations of the system, particularly in those involving nonlinear, multi-scale
phenomena. Thus, there is substantial interest in reducing model errors, particularly through
understanding their physics and sources and leveraging the rapid growth of observational data.
Here we introduce a framework named MEDIDA: Model Error Discovery with Interpretability and Data
Assimilation. MEDIDA only requires a working numerical solver of the model and a small number of
noise-free or noisy sporadic observations of the system. In MEDIDA, first the model error is estimated
from differences between the observed states and model-predicted states (the latter are obtained
from a number of one-time-step numerical integrations from the previous observed states). If observations
are noisy, a data assimilation (DA) technique such as ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is first used
to provide a noise-free analysis state of the system, which is then used in estimating the model error.
Finally, an equation-discovery technique, such as the relevance vector machine (RVM), a sparsity-promoting
Bayesian method, is used to identify an interpretable, parsimonious, closed-form representation
of the model error. Using the chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) system as the test case, we demonstrate
the excellent performance of MEDIDA in discovering different types of structural/parametric
model errors, representing different types of missing physics, using noise-free and noisy observations.

We deal with a long-standing problem about how to design an energy-stable numerical scheme for solving
the motion of a closed curve under {\sl anisotropic surface diffusion} with a general anisotropic
surface energy $\gamma(\boldsymbol{n})$ in two dimensions, where $\boldsymbol{n}$ is the outward
unit normal vector. By introducing a novel symmetric positive definite surface energy matrix $Z_k(\boldsymbol{n})$
depending on the Cahn-Hoffman $\boldsymbol{\xi}$-vector and a stabilizing function $k(\boldsymbol{n})$,
we first reformulate the anisotropic surface diffusion into a conservative form and then derive
a new symmetrized variational formulation for the anisotropic surface diffusion with both weakly
and strongly anisotropic surface energies. A semi-discretization in space for the symmetrized
variational formulation is proposed and its area (or mass) conservation and energy dissipation
are proved. The semi-discretization is then discretized in time by either an implicit structural-preserving
scheme (SP-PFEM) which preserves the area in the discretized level or a semi-implicit energy-stable
method (ES-PFEM) which needs only solve a linear system at each time step. Under a relatively simple
and mild condition on $\gamma(\boldsymbol{n})$, we show that both SP-PFEM and ES-PFEM are energy
dissipative and thus are unconditionally energy-stable for almost all anisotropic surface energies
$\gamma(\boldsymbol{n})$ arising in practical applications. Specifically, for several commonly-used
anisotropic surface energies, we construct $Z_k(\boldsymbol{n})$ explicitly. Finally, extensive
numerical results are reported to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy as well as the unconditional
energy-stability of the proposed symmetrized parametric finite element method.

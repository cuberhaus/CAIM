The performance of Emergency Departments (EDs) is of great importance for any health care system,
as they serve as the entry point for many patients. However, among other factors, the variability
of patient acuity levels and corresponding treatment requirements of patients visiting EDs imposes
significant challenges on decision makers. Balancing waiting times of patients to be first seen
by a physician with the overall length of stay over all acuity levels is crucial to maintain an acceptable
level of operational performance for all patients. To address those requirements when assigning
idle resources to patients, several methods have been proposed in the past, including the Accumulated
Priority Queuing (APQ) method. The APQ method linearly assigns priority scores to patients with
respect to their time in the system and acuity level. Hence, selection decisions are based on a simple
system representation that is used as an input for a selection function. This paper investigates
the potential of an Machine Learning (ML) based patient selection method. It assumes that for a large
set of training data, including a multitude of different system states, (near) optimal assignments
can be computed by a (heuristic) optimizer, with respect to a chosen performance metric, and aims
to imitate such optimal behavior when applied to new situations. Thereby, it incorporates a comprehensive
state representation of the system and a complex non-linear selection function. The motivation
for the proposed approach is that high quality selection decisions may depend on a variety of factors
describing the current state of the ED, not limited to waiting times, which can be captured and utilized
by the ML model. Results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the APQ method
for a majority of evaluated settings

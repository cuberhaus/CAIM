The well-known conditions for a simplicial set to be the nerve of a small category generalize with
respect to two parameters: the dimension n of the things which compose, and the position i of the thing
which is the result of the composition. In the nerve of a small category, the dimension of the things
which compose (maps) is n=1. Compositions are 2-simplices (commutative triangles) in which the
position of the composite is the 1-simplex opposite vertex i=1. These conditions generalize to
all n>1 and i in {0 , ... , n+1}. We call such a simplicial set an (n,i)-composer. This paper explores
two aspects of composers: models and the algebra of such generalized composition. Models: we develop
a family of set-based models for composers analogous to sets-and-functions models for ordinary
categories. The key to obtaining set-based models of (n,i)-composers is to observe that in the nerve
of a category of sets-and-functions, a 1-simplex is a binary relation with certain properties on
its two faces, that is, its codomain and domain. In a model of an (n,i)-composer, each k-simplex is
a (k+1)-ary relation on its faces having certain properties, with special attention to k=n (things
which compose) and k=n+1 (a composition of things). The development of these models is guided by
requiring: (i) the usual sets-and-functions model, i.e. when n=1 and i=1, belongs to the family;
(ii) the things which compose have properties which resemble and generalize properties possessed
by ordinary functions. Algebra: we explore some notions which are inspired by the algebra of ordinary
composition. These include "comma-composers" generalizing comma categories, a composer structure
for function complexes, representables, and a generalization of universal map. In its current
form, this part of the paper is provisional in content and organization.

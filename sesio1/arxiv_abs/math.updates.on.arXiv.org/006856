The $SU(2)$ unitary matrix $U$ has the equivalent representations, $U = \exp [ i \boldsymbol{\tau}
\cdot \hat{\boldsymbol{\pi}} \theta ] = \cos\theta + i \boldsymbol{\tau} \cdot \hat{\boldsymbol{\pi}}
\sin\theta$, where $\boldsymbol{\pi} = (\pi_1, \pi_2,\pi_3) $. One extends this result to the
$SU(3)$ unitary matrix and has $ U= \exp[ i \boldsymbol{v} \cdot \boldsymbol{\lambda} ] = [ ( F + \tfrac{2}{3}
G ) I + ( H \hat{\boldsymbol{v}} + \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{3}} G \hat{\boldsymbol{b}} ) \cdot \boldsymbol{\lambda}
] + i [ ( Y + \tfrac{2}{3} Z ) I + ( X \hat{\boldsymbol{v}} + \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{3}} Z \hat{\boldsymbol{b}}
) \cdot \boldsymbol{\lambda} ]$, with $v_i=[v_1, \cdots v_8]$, $ b_i = d_{ijk} v_j v_k $, and $F,
\cdots Z$ written in terms of elementary functions depending on $v=|\boldsymbol{v}|$ and $\eta
= 2 d_{ijk} \hat{v}_i \hat{v}_j \hat{v}_k /3 $, independently of the meaning attached to $\boldsymbol{v}$.
Unitarity constrains the factors $F, \cdots Z$ to the surface of a four-dimensional sphere and,
in the classical limit, corresponding to $\eta \rightarrow 0$, one gets the cyclic structure $U
= [ \tfrac{1}{3} ( 1 + 2 \cos v ) I + \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{3}} ( -1 + \cos v ) \hat{\boldsymbol{b}} \cdot \boldsymbol{\lambda}
] +i ( \sin v ) \hat{\boldsymbol{v}} \cdot \boldsymbol{\lambda}$, which describes a tilted circumference
with radius $\sqrt{2/3}$. The analytic expression for $U$ yields the corresponding left and right
forms. One associates $\boldsymbol{v}$ with pseudoscalar meson fields, evaluates the axial transformations
of the matrix $U$ and constructs a non-linear $SU(3)\times SU(3)$ version of the $\sigma$-model
based on a generalization of the classical $U$ matrix relying on 17 fields, instead of the usual 18
of the linear case. Basic equations and predictions are similar in both approaches.

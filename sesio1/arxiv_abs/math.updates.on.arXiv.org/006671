Associated to every complex reflection group, we construct a lattice of quotients of its braid monoid-algebra,
which we term nil-Hecke algebras, and which are obtained by killing all braid words that are "sufficiently
long", as well as some integer power of each generator. These include usual nil-Coxeter algebras,
nil-Temperley-Lieb algebras, and their variants, and lead to symmetric semigroup module categories
which necessarily cannot be monoidal. Motivated by classical work of Coxeter (1957) and the Broue-Malle-Rouquier
freeness conjecture [Crelle 1998], and continuing beyond work of the second author [Trans. Amer.
Math. Soc. 2018], we obtain a complete classification of the finite-dimensional nil-Hecke algebras
for all complex reflection groups $W$. These comprise the usual nil-Coxeter algebras for $W$ of
finite type, their "fully commutative" analogues for $W$ of FC-finite type, three exceptional
algebras (of types $F_4,H_3,H_4$), and three exceptional series (of types $B_n$ and $A_n$, two
of them novel). In particular, we find the first - and only two - finite-dimensional nil-Hecke algebras
over discrete complex reflection groups; this breaks from the nil-Coxeter case (where no braid
words are further killed, and) where Marin [J. Pure Appl. Alg. 2014] and Khare [Trans. Amer. Math.
Soc. 2018] showed that such algebras do not exist. In addition to these algebras, and also algebraic
connections (to PBW deformations and non-monoidal tensor categories), we further uncover combinatorial
bases of algebras, both known (fully commutative elements) and novel ($\bar{12}$-avoiding signed
permutations). Our classification draws from and brings together results of Popov [Comm. Math.
Inst. Utrecht 1982], Stembridge [J. Alg. Combin. 1996, 1998], Malle [Transform. Groups} 1996],
Postnikov via Gowravaram-Khovanova (2015), Hart [J. Group Th. 2017], and Khare [Trans. Amer. Math.
Soc. 2018].

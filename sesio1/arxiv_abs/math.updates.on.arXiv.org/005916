An adjunction is a pair of functors related by a pair of natural transformations, and relating a pair
of categories. It displays how a structure, or a concept, projects from each category to the other,
and back. Adjunctions are the common denominator of Galois connections, representation theories,
spectra, and generalized quantifiers. We call an adjunction nuclear when its categories determine
each other. We show that every adjunction can be resolved into a nuclear adjunction. This resolution
is idempotent in a strong sense. The nucleus of an adjunction displays its conceptual core, just
as the singular value decomposition of an adjoint pair of linear operators displays their canonical
bases. The two composites of an adjoint pair of functors induce a monad and a comonad. Monads and comonads
generalize the closure and the interior operators from topology, or modalities from logic, while
providing a saturated view of algebraic structures and compositions on one side, and of coalgebraic
dynamics and decompositions on the other. They are resolved back into adjunctions over the induced
categories of algebras and of coalgebras. The nucleus of an adjunction is an adjunction between
the induced categories of algebras and coalgebras. It provides new presentations for both, revealing
the meaning of constructing algebras for a comonad and coalgebras for a monad. In his seminal early
work, Ross Street described an adjunction between monads and comonads in 2-categories. Lifting
the nucleus construction, we show that the resulting Street monad on monads is strongly idempotent,
and extracts the nucleus of a monad. A dual treatment achieves the same for comonads. Applying a notable
fragment of pure 2-category theory on an acute practical problem of data analysis thus led to new
theoretical result.

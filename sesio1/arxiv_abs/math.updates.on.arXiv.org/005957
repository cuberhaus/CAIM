Effective management of perishable inventory systems is often strewn with challenges, especially
when a strong trade-off relationship exists between shortage and wastage of perishables: A smaller
inventory increases the chance to lose sales (leading to higher expected shortage cost), while
a larger inventory increases the chance to waste perishables (leading to higher expected wastage
cost). The root cause of this strong trade-off relationship is high product demand variability.
To mitigate the issue and reduce the cost of operating perishable inventory systems, some grocery
stores utilize an opaque selling scheme: selling an anonymous product whose brand or exact specification
is shielded from customers at the time of sale. The use of opaque products has now become a popular
means to reduce shortage/wastage at grocery stores. However, there has been little discussion
of the effectiveness of opaque schemes applied to perishable inventory systems. In this paper,
we propose an opaque scheme based on the balancing policy on demand, which tries to average out orders
for products. We confirm both analytically and numerically that this opaque scheme effectively
reduces product demand variability, thereby reducing both shortage and wastage for perishable
inventory systems under a base-stock policy. We also present an analytical formula that reveals
insights into the opaque scheme: The ratio between the opaque proportion and the coefficient of
variation of product demands plays a key role to determine the effectiveness of our opaque scheme.
Furthermore, we provide a rule of thumb to find the threshold opaque scheme parameters needed to
achieve the maximum total cost savings for perishable inventory systems. We hope that many retailers
selling perishables (e.g., fresh produce and baked goods) find the opaque scheme useful, implement
it, and contribute to the reduction of the food wastage.

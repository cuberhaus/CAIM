Complex Chern-Simons bundles are line bundles with connection, originating in the study of quantization
of moduli spaces of flat connections with complex gauge groups. In this paper we introduce and study
these bundles in the families setting. The central object is a functorial direct image of characteristic
classes of vector bundles with connections, for which we develop a formalism. Our strategy elaborates
on Deligne-Elkik's intersection bundles, and a refined Chern-Simons theory which parallels the
use of Bott-Chern classes in Arakelov geometry. In the context of moduli spaces, we are confronted
with flat relative connections on families of Riemann surfaces. To be able to rely on the functorial
approach, we prove canonical extension results to global connections, inspired by the deformation
theory of harmonic maps in non-abelian Hodge theory. The relative complex Chern-Simons bundle
$\mathcal{L}_{CS}$ is then defined as a functorial direct image of the second Chern class on the
relative moduli space of flat vector bundles. We establish the crystalline nature of $\mathcal{L}_{CS}$,
and the existence of a holomorphic extension of natural metrics from Arakelov geometry. The curvature
of $\mathcal{L}_{CS}$ can be expressed in terms of the Atiyah-Bott-Goldman form, in agreement
with the classical topological approach. To highlight a few applications, we first mention a characterization
of projective structures of Riemann surfaces in terms of connections on intersection bundles.
In particular, we settle a conjecture of Bertola-Korotkin-Norton on the comparison between the
Bergman and the Bers projective structures. This is the problem of determining the accessory parameters
of quasi-Fuchsian uniformizations. A conjecture of Cappell-Miller is also established, to the
effect that their holomorphic torsion satisfies a Riemann-Roch formula.

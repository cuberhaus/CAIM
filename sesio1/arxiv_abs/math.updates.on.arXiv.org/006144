We demonstrate how many classes of Smoluchowski-type coagulation models can be realised as Grassmannian
or nonlinear graph flows and are therefore linearisable, and/or integrable in this sense. We first
prove that a general Smoluchowski-type equation with a constant frequency kernel, that encompasses
a large class of such models, is realisable as a multiplicative Grassmannian flow, and then go on
to establish that several other related constant kernel models can be realised as such. These include:
the Gallay--Mielke coarsening model; the Derrida--Retaux depinning transition model and a general
multiple merger coagulation model. We then introduce and explore the notion of nonlinear graph
flows, which are related to the notion of characteristics for partial differential equations.
These generalise flows on a Grassmann manifold from sets of graphs of linear maps to sets of graphs
of nonlinear maps. We demonstrate that Smoluchowski's coagulation equation in the additive and
multiplicative frequency kernel cases, are realisable as nonlinear graph flows, and are thus integrable
provided we can uniquely retrace the initial data map along characteristics. The additive and multiplicative
frequency kernel cases correspond to inviscid Burgers flow. We explore further applications of
such nonlinear graph flows, for example, to the stochastic viscous Burgers equation. Lastly we
consider an example stochastic partial differential equation with a nonlocal nonlinearity that
generalises the convolution form associated with nonlinear coagulation interaction, and demonstrate
it can be realised as an infinite dimensional Grassmannian flow. In our companion paper, Doikou
et al. [DMSW-integrable], we consider the application of such infinite dimensional Grassmannian
flows to classical non-commutative integrable systems such as the Korteweg--de Vries and nonlinear
Schrodinger equations.

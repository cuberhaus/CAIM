It is declared that the aim of simplifying representations of coefficients of power series of classical
statistical mechanics is to simplify a process of obtaining estimates of the coefficients using
their simplified representations. The aim of the article is: to formulate criteria for the complexity
(from the above point of view) of these representations and to demonstrate their application by
examples of comparing Ree-Hoover representations of virial coefficients and such representations
of power series coefficients that are based on the conception of the frame classification of labeled
graphs. To solve these problems, mathematical notions were introduced (such as a base product,
a base integral, a base linear combination of integrals, a base linear combination of integrals
with coefficients of negligible complexity, a base set of base linear combinations of integrals
with coefficients of negligible complexity); and a classification of representations of coefficients
of power series of classical statistical mechanics is proposed. In this classification the class
of base linear combinations of integrals with coefficients of negligible complexity is the most
important class. It includes the most well-known representations of the coefficients of power
series of classical statistical mechanics. Three criteria are formulated to estimate the comparative
complexity of base linear combinations of integrals with coefficients of negligible complexity
and their extensions to the totality of base sets of base linear combinations of integrals with coefficients
of negligible complexity are constructed. The application of all the constructed criteria is demonstrated
by examples of comparing with each other of the above power series coefficients representations.
The obtained results are presented in the tables and commented.

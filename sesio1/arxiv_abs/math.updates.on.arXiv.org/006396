Motivated by cutting-edge applications like cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), the Multi-Reference
Alignment (MRA) model entails the learning of an unknown signal from repeated measurements of its
images under the latent action of a group of isometries and additive noise of magnitude $\sigma$.
Despite significant interest, a clear picture for understanding rates of estimation in this model
has emerged only recently, particularly in the high-noise regime $\sigma \gg 1$ that is highly relevant
in applications. Recent investigations have revealed a remarkable asymptotic sample complexity
of order $\sigma^6$ for certain signals whose Fourier transforms have full support, in stark contrast
to the traditional $\sigma^2$ that arise in regular models. Often prohibitively large in practice,
these results have prompted the investigation of variations around the MRA model where better sample
complexity may be achieved. In this paper, we show that sparse signals exhibit an intermediate $\sigma^4$
sample complexity even in the classical MRA model. Further, we characterise the dependence of the
estimation rate on the support size $s$ as $O_p(1)$ and $O_p(s^{3.5})$ in the dilute and moderate
regimes of sparsity respectively. Our techniques have implications for the problem of crystallographic
phase retrieval, indicating a certain local uniqueness for the recovery of sparse signals from
their power spectrum. Our results explore and exploit connections of the MRA estimation problem
with two classical topics in applied mathematics: the beltway problem from combinatorial optimization,
and uniform uncertainty principles from harmonic analysis. Our techniques include a certain enhanced
form of the probabilistic method, which might be of general interest in its own right.

In the brain, coherent neuronal activities often appear simultaneously in multiple frequency
bands, e.g., as combinations of alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (12.5-30 Hz), gamma (30-120 Hz) oscillations,
among others. These rhythms are believed to underlie information processing and cognitive functions
and have been subjected to intense experimental and theoretical scrutiny. Computational modeling
has provided a framework for the emergence of network-level oscillatory behavior from the interaction
of spiking neurons. However, due to the strong nonlinear interactions between highly recurrent
spiking populations, the interplay between cortical rhythms in multiple frequency bands has rarely
been theoretically investigated. Many studies invoke multiple physiological timescales or oscillatory
inputs to produce rhythms in multi-bands. Here we demonstrate the emergence of multi-band oscillations
in a simple network consisting of one excitatory and one inhibitory neuronal population driven
by constant input. First, we construct a data-driven, Poincar\'e section theory for robust numerical
observations of single-frequency oscillations bifurcating into multiple bands. Then we develop
model reductions of the stochastic, nonlinear, high-dimensional neuronal network to capture
the appearance of multi-band dynamics and the underlying bifurcations theoretically. Furthermore,
when viewed within the reduced state space, our analysis reveals conserved geometrical features
of the bifurcations on low-dimensional dynamical manifolds. These results suggest a simple geometric
mechanism behind the emergence of multi-band oscillations without appealing to oscillatory inputs
or multiple synaptic or neuronal timescales. Thus our work points to unexplored regimes of stochastic
competition between excitation and inhibition behind the generation of dynamic, patterned neuronal
activities.

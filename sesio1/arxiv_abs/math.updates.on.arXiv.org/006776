In this article, we introduce the annihilator graph of the ring $C_\mathscr{P}(X)$, denoted by
$AG(C_\mathscr{P}(X))$ and observe the effect of the underlying Tychonoff space $X$ on various
graph properties of $AG(C_\mathscr{P}(X))$. $AG(C_\mathscr{P}(X))$, in general, lies between
the zero divisor graph and weakly zero divisor graph of $C_\mathscr{P}(X)$ and it is proved that
these three graphs coincide if and only if the cardinality of the set of all $\mathscr{P}$-points,
$X_\mathscr{P}$ is $\leq 2$. Identifying a suitable induced subgraph of $AG(C_\mathscr{P}(X))$,
called $G(C_\mathscr{P}(X))$, we establish that both $AG(C_\mathscr{P}(X))$ and $G(C_\mathscr{P}(X))$
share similar graph theoretic properties and have the same values for the parameters, e.g., diameter,
eccentricity, girth, radius, chromatic number and clique number. By choosing the ring $C_\mathscr{P}(X)$
where $\mathscr{P}$ is the ideal of all finite subsets of $X$ such that $X_\mathscr{P}$ is finite,
we formulate an algorithm for coloring the vertices of $G(C_\mathscr{P}(X))$ and thereby get the
chromatic number of $AG(C_\mathscr{P}(X))$. This exhibits an instance of coloring infinite graphs
by just a finite number of colors. We show that any graph isomorphism $\psi : AG(C_\mathscr{P}(X))
\rightarrow AG(C_\mathscr{Q}(Y))$ maps $G(C_\mathscr{P}(X))$ isomorphically onto $G(C_\mathscr{Q}(Y))$
as a graph and a graph isomorphism $\phi : G(C_\mathscr{P}(X)) \rightarrow G(C_\mathscr{Q}(Y))$
can be extended to a graph isomorphism $\psi : AG(C_\mathscr{P}(X)) \rightarrow AG(C_\mathscr{Q}(Y))$
under a mild restriction on the function $\phi$. Finally, we show that atleast for the rings $C_\mathscr{P}(X)$
with finitely many $\mathscr{P}$-points, so far as the graph properties are concerned, the induced
subgraph $G(C_\mathscr{P}(X))$ is a good substitute for $AG(C_\mathscr{P}(X)$.

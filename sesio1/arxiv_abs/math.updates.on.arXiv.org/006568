The aim of this paper is to investigate the theory of subspace designs, which have been originally
introduced by Guruswami and Xing in 2013 to give the first construction of positive rate rank-metric
codes list decodable beyond half the distance. However, sets of subspaces with special pattern
of intersections with other subspaces have been already studied, such as spreads, generalised
arcs and caps, and Cameron-Liebler sets. In this paper we provide bounds involving the dimension
of the subspaces forming a subspace design and the parameters of the ambient space, showing constructions
satisfying the equality in such bounds. Then we also introduce two dualities relations among them.
Among subspace designs, those that we call s-designs are central in this paper, as they generalize
the notion of s-scattered subspace to subspace design and for their special properties. Indeed,
we prove that, for certain values of s, they correspond to the optimal subspace designs, that is those
subspace designs that are associated with linear maximum sum-rank metric codes. Special attention
has been paid for the case s=1 for which we provide several examples, yielding surprising to families
of two-intersection sets with respect to hyperplanes (and hence two-weight linear codes). Moreover,
s-designs can be used to construct explicit lossless dimension expanders (a linear-algebraic
analogue of expander graphs), without any restriction on the order of the field. Another class of
subspace designs we study is those of cutting designs, since they extend the notion of cutting blocking
set recently introduced by Bonini and Borello. These designs turn out to be very interesting as they
in one-to-one correspondence with minimal sum-rank metric codes. The latter codes have been introduced
in this paper and they naturally extend the notions of minimal codes in both Hamming and rank metrics.

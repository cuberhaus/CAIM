We introduce the categories of quasi-measurable spaces, which are slight generalizations of the
category of quasi-Borel spaces, where we now allow for general sample spaces and less restrictive
random variables, spaces and maps. We show that each category of quasi-measurable spaces is bi-complete
and cartesian closed. We also introduce several different strong probability monads. Together
these constructions provide convenient categories for higher probability theory that also support
semantics of higher-order probabilistic programming languages in the same way as the category
of quasi-Borel spaces does. An important special case is the category of quasi-universal spaces,
where the sample space is the set of the real numbers together with the sigma-algebra of all universally
measurable subsets. The induced sigma-algebras on those quasi-universal spaces then have explicit
descriptions in terms of intersections of Lebesgue-complete sigma-algebras. A central role is
then played by countably separated and universal quasi-universal spaces, which replace the role
of standard Borel spaces. We prove in this setting a Fubini theorem, a disintegration theorem for
Markov kernels, a Kolmogorov extension theorem and a conditional de Finetti theorem. We also translate
our findings into properties of the corresponding Markov category of Markov kernels between universal
quasi-universal spaces. Furthermore, we formalize causal Bayesian networks in terms of quasi-universal
spaces and prove a global Markov property. For this we translate the notion of transitional conditional
independence into this setting and study its (asymmetric) separoid rules. Altogether we are now
able to reason about conditional independence relations between variables and causal mechanisms
on equal footing. Finally, we also highlight how one can use exponential objects and random functions
for counterfactual reasoning.

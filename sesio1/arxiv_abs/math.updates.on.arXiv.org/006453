Finsler metrics are direct generalizations of Riemannian metrics such that the quadratic Riemannian
indicatrices in the tangent spaces of a manifold are replaced by more general convex bodies as unit
spheres. A linear connection on the base manifold is called compatible with the Finsler metric if
the induced parallel transports preserve the Finslerian length of tangent vectors. Finsler manifolds
admitting compatible linear connections are called generalized Berwald manifolds. Compatible
linear connections are the solutions of the so-called compatibility equations containing the
torsion components as unknowns. Although there are some theoretical results for the solvability
of the compatibility equations (monochromatic Finsler metrics \cite{BM}, extremal compatible
linear connections, algorithmic solutions \cite{V14}), it is very hard to solve in general because
compatible linear connections may or may not exist on a Finsler manifold and may or may not be unique.
Therefore special cases are of special interest. One of them is the case of the so-called semi-symmetric
compatible linear connection with decomposable torsion tensor. It is proved \cite{V10} (see also
\cite{V11}) that such a compatible linear connection must be uniquely determined. The original
proof is based on averaging in the sense that the 1-form in the decomposition of the torsion tensor
can be expressed by integrating differential forms on the tangent manifold over the Finslerian
indicatrices. The integral formulas are very difficult to compute in practice. We present a new
proof for the unicity result by using linear algebra and some basic facts about convex bodies and
an explicit formula for the solution without integration. Necessary conditions of the solvability
are also formulated in terms of intrinsic equations without unknown quantities. They are sufficient
if and only if the solution depends only on the position.

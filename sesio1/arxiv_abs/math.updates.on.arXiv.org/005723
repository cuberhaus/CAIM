Cell-free massive MIMO systems have promising data rate and uniform coverage gains. These systems,
however, typically rely on optical fiber based fronthaul for the communication between the central
processing unit (CPU) and the distributed access points (APs), which increases the infrastructure
cost, leads to high installation time, and limits the deployment flexibility and adaptability.
To address these challenges, this paper proposes two architectures for cell-free massive MIMO
systems based on wireless fronthaul that is operating at a \textit{higher-band} compared to the
access links: (i) A wireless-only fronthaul architecture where the CPU has a wireless fronthaul
link to each AP, and (ii) a mixed-fronthaul architecture where the CPU has a wireless link to each
cluster of APs that are connected together via optical fibers. These dual-band architectures ensure
high-data rate fronthaul and provide high capability to synchronize the distributed APs. Further,
the wireless fronthaul reduces the infrastructure cost and installation time, and enhances the
flexibility, adaptability, and scalability of the network deployment. To investigate the achievable
data rates with the proposed architectures, we formulate the end-to-end data rate optimization
problem accounting for the various practical aspects of the fronthaul and access links. Then, we
develop a low-complexity yet efficient joint beamforming and resource allocation solution for
the proposed architectures based on user-centric AP grouping. With this solution, we show that
the proposed architectures can achieve comparable data rates to those obtained with optical fiber-based
fronthaul under realistic assumptions on the fronthaul bandwidth, hardware constraints, and
deployment scenarios. This highlights a promising path for realizing the cell-free massive MIMO
gains in practice while reducing the infrastructure and deployment overhead.

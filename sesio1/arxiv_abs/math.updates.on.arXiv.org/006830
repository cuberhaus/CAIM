This work develops a dynamic homogenization approach for metamaterials. It finds an approximate
macroscopic homogenized equation with constant coefficients posed in space and time; however,
the resulting homogenized equation is higher order in space and time. The homogenized equation
can be used to solve initial-boundary-value problems posed on arbitrary non-periodic macroscale
geometries with macroscopic heterogeneity, such as bodies composed of several different metamaterials
or with external boundaries. First, considering a single band, the higher-order space derivatives
lead to additional continuity conditions at the boundary between a homogeneous material and a metamaterial.
These provide predictions of wave scattering in 1-d and 2-d that match well with the exact fine-scale
solution; compared to alternative approaches, they provide a single equation that is valid over
a broad range of frequencies, are easy to apply, and are much faster to compute. Next, the setting
of two bands with a bandgap is considered. The homogenized equation has also higher-order time derivatives.
Notably, the homogenized model provides a single equation that is valid over both bands and the bandgap.
The continuity conditions are applied to wave scattering at a boundary, and show good agreement
with the exact fine-scale solution. Using that the order of the highest time derivative is proportional
to the number of bands considered, a nonlocal-in-time structure is conjectured for the homogenized
equation in the limit of infinite bands. This suggests that homogenizing over finer length and time
scales -- with the temporal homogenization being carried out through the consideration of higher
bands in the dispersion relation -- is a mechanism for the emergence of macroscopic spatial and temporal
nonlocality, with the extent of temporal nonlocality being related to the number of bands considered.

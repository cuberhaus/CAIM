With deployment of 6G technology, it is envisioned that competitive edge of wireless networks will
be sustained and next decade's communication requirements will be stratified. Also 6G will aim
to aid development of a human society which is ubiquitous and mobile, simultaneously providing
solutions to key challenges such as, coverage, capacity, etc. In addition, 6G will focus on providing
intelligent use-cases and applications using higher data-rates over mill-meter waves and Tera-Hertz
frequency. However, at higher frequencies multiple non-desired phenomena such as atmospheric
absorption, blocking, etc., occur which create a bottleneck owing to resource (spectrum and energy)
scarcity. Hence, following same trend of making efforts towards reproducing at receiver, exact
information which was sent by transmitter, will result in a never ending need for higher bandwidth.
A possible solution to such a challenge lies in semantic communications which focuses on meaning
(context) of received data as opposed to only reproducing correct transmitted data. This in turn
will require less bandwidth, and will reduce bottleneck due to various undesired phenomenon. In
this respect, current article presents a detailed survey on recent technological trends in regard
to semantic communications for intelligent wireless networks. We focus on semantic communications
architecture including model, and source and channel coding. Next, we detail cross-layer interaction,
and various goal-oriented communication applications. We also present overall semantic communications
trends in detail, and identify challenges which need timely solutions before practical implementation
of semantic communications within 6G wireless technology. Our survey article is an attempt to significantly
contribute towards initiating future research directions in area of semantic communications
for intelligent 6G wireless networks.

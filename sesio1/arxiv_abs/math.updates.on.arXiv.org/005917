We introduce the homogeneous and piecewise multilinear extensions and the eigenvalue problem
for locally Lipschitz function pairs, in order to develop a systematic framework for relating discrete
and continuous min-max problems. This also enables us to investigate spectral properties for pairs
of $p$-homogeneous functions and to propose a critical point theory for zero-homogeneous functions.
The main contributions are: (1) We provide several min-max relations between an original discrete
formulation and its piecewise multilinear extension. We introduce the concept of perfect domain
pairs to view comonotonicity on vectors as an extension of inclusion chains on sets. The piecewise
multi-linear extension is (slice-)rank preserving, which closely relates to Tao's lemma on diagonal
tensors. More discrete-to-continuous equalities are obtained, including a general form involving
log-concave polynomials. And by employing these fundamental correspondences, we get further
results and applications on tensors, Tur\'an's problem, signed (hyper-)graphs, etc. (2) We derive
the mountain pass characterization, linking theorems, nodal domain inequalities, inertia bounds,
duality theorems and distribution of eigenvalues for pairs of $p$-homogeneous functions. We establish
a new property on the subderivative of a convex function which relates to the Gauss map of the graph
of the convex function. Based on these fundamental results, we can analyze the structure of eigenspaces
in depth. For example, we show a simple one-to-one correspondence between the nonzero eigenvalues
of the vertex p-Laplacian and the edge $p^*$-Laplacian of a graph. We also apply the theory to Cheeger
inequalities and $p$-Laplacians on oriented hypergraphs and simplicial complexes. Also, the
first nonlinear analog of Huang's approach for hypergraphs is provided.

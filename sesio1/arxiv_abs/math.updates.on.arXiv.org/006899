The object of this paper is to provide a new and systematic tauberian approach to quantitative long
time behaviour of $C_{0}$-semigroups $\left(\mathcal{V}(t)\right)_{t \geq0}$ in $L^{1}(\T^{d}\times
\R^{d})$ governing conservative linear kinetic equations on the torus with general scattering
kernel $\bm{k}(v,v')$ and degenerate (i.e. not bounded away from zero) collision frequency $\sigma(v)=\int_{\R^{d}}\bm{k}(v',v)\bm{m}(\d
v')$, (with $\bm{m}(\d v)$ being absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure).
We show in particular that if $N_{0}$ is the maximal integer $s \geq0$ such that $$\frac{1}{\sigma(\cdot)}\int_{\R^{d}}\bm{k}(\cdot,v)\sigma^{-s}(v)\bm{m}(\d
v) \in L^{\infty}(\R^{d})$$ then, for initial datum $f$ such that $\ds\int_{\T^{d}\times \R^{d}}|f(x,v)|\sigma^{-N_{0}}(v)\d
x\bm{m}(\d v) <\infty$ it holds $$\left\|\mathcal{V}(t)f-\varrho_{f}\Psi\right\|_{L^{1}(\T^{d}\times
\R^{d})}=\dfrac{{\epsilon}_{f}(t)}{(1+t)^{N_{0}-1}}, \qquad \varrho_{f}:= \int_{\R^{d}}f(x,v)\d
x\bm{m}(\d v)$$ where $\Psi$ is the unique invariant density of $\left(\mathcal{V}(t)\right)_{t
\geq0}$ and $\lim_{t\to\infty}{\epsilon}_{f}(t)=0$. {We in particular provide a new criteria
of the existence of invariant density.} The proof relies on the explicit computation of the time
decay of each term of the Dyson-Phillips expansion of $\left(\mathcal{V}(t)\right)_{t \geq0}$
and on suitable smoothness and integrability properties of the trace on the imaginary axis of Laplace
transform of remainders of large order of this Dyson-Phillips expansion. Our construction resorts
also on collective compactness arguments and provides various technical results of independent
interest. Finally, as a by-product of our analysis, we derive essentially sharp ``subgeometric''
convergence rate for Markov semigroups associated to general transition kernels.

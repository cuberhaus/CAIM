The approximate uniform sampling of graphs with a given degree sequence is a well-known, extensively
studied problem in theoretical computer science and has significant applications, e.g., in the
analysis of social networks. In this work we study an extension of the problem, where degree intervals
are specified rather than a single degree sequence. We are interested in sampling and counting graphs
whose degree sequences satisfy the degree interval constraints. A natural scenario where this
problem arises is in hypothesis testing on social networks that are only partially observed. In
this work, we provide the first fully polynomial almost uniform sampler (FPAUS) as well as the first
fully polynomial randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS) for sampling and counting, respectively,
graphs with near-regular degree intervals, in which every node $i$ has a degree from an interval
not too far away from a given $d \in \N$. In order to design our FPAUS, we rely on various state-of-the-art
tools from Markov chain theory and combinatorics. In particular, we provide the first non-trivial
algorithmic application of a breakthrough result of Liebenau and Wormald (2017) regarding an asymptotic
formula for the number of graphs with a given near-regular degree sequence. Furthermore, we also
make use of the recent breakthrough of Anari et al. (2019) on sampling a base of a matroid under a strongly
log-concave probability distribution. As a more direct approach, we also study a natural Markov
chain recently introduced by Rechner, Strowick and M\"uller-Hannemann (2018), based on three
simple local operations: Switches, hinge flips, and additions/deletions of a single edge. We obtain
the first theoretical results for this Markov chain by showing it is rapidly mixing for the case of
near-regular degree intervals of size at most one.

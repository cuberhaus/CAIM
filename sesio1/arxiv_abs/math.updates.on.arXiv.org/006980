Consider the Poincar\'e-Sobolev inequality on the hyperbolic space: for every $n \geq 3$ and $1
< p \leq \frac{n+2}{n-2},$ there exists a best constant $S_{n,p, \lambda}(\mathbb{B}^{n})>0$
such that $$S_{n, p, \lambda}(\mathbb{B}^{n})\left(~\int \limits_{\mathbb{B}^{n}}|u|^{{p+1}}
\, {\rm d}v_{\mathbb{B}^n} \right)^{\frac{2}{p+1}} \leq\int \limits_{\mathbb{B}^{n}}\left(|\nabla_{\mathbb{B}^{n}}u|^{2}-\lambda
u^{2}\right) \, {\rm d}v_{\mathbb{B}^n},$$ holds for all $u\in C_c^{\infty}(\mathbb{B}^n),$
and $\lambda \leq \frac{(n-1)^2}{4},$ where $\frac{(n-1)^2}{4}$ is the bottom of the $L^2$-spectrum
of $-\Delta_{\mathbb{B}^n}.$ It is known from the results of Mancini and Sandeep [Ann. Sc. Norm.
Super. Pisa Cl. Sci. 7 (2008)] that under appropriate assumptions on $n,p$ and $\lambda$ there exists
an optimizer, unique up to the hyperbolic isometries, attaining the best constant $S_{n,p,\lambda}(\mathbb{B}^n).$
In this article, we investigate the quantitative gradient stability of the above inequality and
the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equation locally around a bubble. Our result generalizes the
sharp quantitative stability of Sobolev inequality in $\mathbb{R}^n$ of Bianchi-Egnell [J. Funct.
Anal. 100 (1991)] and Ciraolo-Figalli-Maggi [Int. Math. Res. Not. IMRN 2018] to the Poincar\'{e}-Sobolev
inequality on the hyperbolic space. Furthermore, combining our stability results and implementing
a refined smoothing estimates, we prove a quantitative extinction rate towards its basin of attraction
of the solutions of the sub-critical fast diffusion flow for radial initial data. In another application,
we derive sharp quantitative stability of the Hardy-Sobolev-Maz'ya inequalities for the class
of functions which are symmetric in the component of singularity.

We give here results on the existence of nonclassical solutions of the Hilbert boundary value problem
in terms of the so-called angular limits (along nontangent curves to the boundary) for Beltrami
equations with sources in Jordan domains satisfying the quasihyperbolic boundary condition by
Gehring-Martio, generally speaking, without $(A)-$condition by Ladyzhenskaya-Ural'tseva
and, in particular, without the known outer cone condition that were standard for boundary value
problems in the PDE theory. Assuming that the coefficients of the problem are functions of countable
bounded variation and the boundary data are measurable with respect to the logarithmic capacity,
we prove the existence of locally H\"older continuous solutions of the problem. Moreover, we prove
similar results on the Hilbert boundary value problem with its arbitrary measurable boundary data
as well as coefficients in finitely connected Jordan domains along the so-called general Bagemihl-Seidel
systems of Jordan arcs to their boundaries. In the same terms, we formulate theorems on the existence
of regular solutions of the known Riemann boundary value problems, including nonlinear, with arbitrary
measurable coefficients for the nonhomogeneous Beltrami equations. We give also the representation
of obtained solutions through the so-called generalized analytic functions with sources. Finally,
we formulate similar results on Poincare and Neumann problems for the Poisson type equations that
are main in hydromechanics (mechanics of incompressible fluids) in anisotropic and inhomogeneous
media. We give here the representation of their solutions through the so-called generalized harmonic
functions with sources that describe the corresponding physical processes in iso\-tro\-pic and
homogeneous media.

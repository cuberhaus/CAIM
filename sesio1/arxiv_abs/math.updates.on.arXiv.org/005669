We examine the interplay of symmetry and topological order in $2+1$ dimensional fermionic topological
phases of matter. We define fermionic topological symmetries acting on the emergent topological
effective theory described using braided tensor category theory. Connecting this to the ${\cal
G}^{\rm f}$ fermionic symmetry of the microscopic physical system, we characterize and classify
symmetry fractionalization in fermionic topological phases. We find that the physical fermion
provides constraints that result in a tiered structure of obstructions and classification of fractionalization
with respect to the physical fermions, the quasiparticles, and the vortices. The fractionalization
of the (bosonic) symmetry $G= {\cal G}^{\rm f}/\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm f}$ on the physical fermions
is essentially the central extension of $G$ by the $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm f}$ fermion parity conservation
that yields the fermionic symmetry ${\cal G}^{\rm f}$. We develop an algebraic theory of ${\cal
G}^{\rm f}$ symmetry defects for fermionic topological phases using $G$-crossed braided tensor
category theory. This formalism allows us to fully characterize and classify $2+1$ dimensional
fermionic symmetry enriched topological phases with on-site unitary fermionic symmetry group
${\cal G}^{\rm f}$. We first apply this formalism to extract the minimal data specifying a general
fermionic symmetry protected topological phase, and demonstrate that such phases with fixed ${\cal
G}^{\rm f}$ form a group under fermionic stacking. Then we analyze general fermionic symmetry enriched
topological phases and find their classification is given torsorially by the classification of
the symmetry fractionalization of quasiparticles combined with the classification of fermionic
symmetry protected topological phases. We illustrate our results by detailing a number of examples,
including all the invertible fermionic topological phases.

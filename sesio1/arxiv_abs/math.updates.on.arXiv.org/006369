Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a promising solution to enhance the performance of
wireless communications via reconfiguring the wireless propagation environment. In this paper,
we investigate the joint design of RIS passive beamforming and subcarrier matching in RIS-assisted
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) dual-hop relaying systems under two cases,
depending on the presence of the RIS reflected link from the source to the destination in the first
hop. Accordingly, we formulate a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINIP) problem to maximize
the sum achievable rate over all subcarriers by jointly optimizing the RIS passive beamforming
and subcarrier matching. To solve this challenging problem, we first develop a branch-and-bound
(BnB)-based alternating optimization algorithm to obtain a near-optimal solution by alternatively
optimizing the subcarrier matching by the BnB method and the RIS passive beamforming by using semidefinite
relaxation techniques. Then, a low-complexity difference-of-convex penalty-based algorithm
is proposed to reduce the computation complexity in the BnB method. To further reduce the computational
complexity, we utilize the learning-to-optimize approach to learn the joint design obtained from
optimization techniques, which is more amenable to practical implementations. Lastly, computer
simulations are presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms in the two cases.
Simulation results demonstrate that the RIS-assisted OFDM relaying system achieves sustainable
achievable rate gain as compared to that without RIS, and that with random passive beamforming,
since RIS passive beamforming can be leveraged to recast the subcarrier matching among different
subcarriers and balance the signal-to-noise ratio within each subcarrier pair.

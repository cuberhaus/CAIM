Immersive video, such as virtual reality (VR) and multi-view videos, is growing in popularity.
Its wireless streaming is an instance of general multicast, extending conventional unicast and
multicast, whose effective design is still open. This paper investigates general rate splitting
for general multicast. Specifically, we consider a multi-carrier single-cell wireless network
where a multi-antenna base station (BS) communicates to multiple single-antenna users via general
multicast. We consider linear beamforming at the BS and joint decoding at each user in the slow fading
and fast fading scenarios. In the slow fading scenario, we consider the maximization of the weighted
sum average rate, which is a challenging nonconvex stochastic problem with numerous variables.
To reduce computational complexity, we decouple the original nonconvex stochastic problem into
multiple nonconvex deterministic problems, one for each system channel state. Then, we propose
an iterative algorithm for each deterministic problem to obtain a KKT point using the concave-convex
procedure (CCCP). In the fast fading scenario, we consider the maximization of the weighted sum
ergodic rate. This problem is more challenging than the one for the slow fading scenario, as it is
not separable. First, we propose a stochastic iterative algorithm to obtain a KKT point using stochastic
successive convex approximation (SSCA) and the exact penalty method. Then, we propose two low-complexity
iterative algorithms to obtain feasible points with promising performance for two cases of channel
distributions using approximation and CCCP. The proposed optimization framework generalizes
the existing ones for rate splitting for various types of services. Finally, we numerically show
substantial gains of the proposed solutions over existing schemes in both scenarios.

Expressing a matrix as the sum of a low-rank matrix plus a sparse matrix is a flexible model capturing
global and local features in data popularized as Robust PCA (Candes et al., 2011; Chandrasekaran
et al., 2009). Compressed sensing, matrix completion, and their variants (Eldar and Kutyniok,
2012; Foucart and Rauhut, 2013) have established that data satisfying low complexity models can
be efficiently measured and recovered from a number of measurements proportional to the model complexity
rather than the ambient dimension. This manuscript develops similar guarantees showing that $m\times
n$ matrices that can be expressed as the sum of a rank-$r$ matrix and a $s$-sparse matrix can be recovered
by computationally tractable methods from $\mathcal{O}(r(m+n-r)+s)\log(mn/s)$ linear measurements.
More specifically, we establish that the low-rank plus sparse matrix set is closed provided the
incoherence of the low-rank component is upper bounded as $\mu<\sqrt{mn}/(r\sqrt{s})$, and subsequently,
the restricted isometry constants for the aforementioned matrices remain bounded independent
of problem size provided $p/mn$, $s/p$, and $r(m+n-r)/p$ remain fixed. Additionally, we show that
semidefinite programming and two hard threshold gradient descent algorithms, NIHT and NAHT, converge
to the measured matrix provided the measurement operator's RIC's are sufficiently small. These
results also provably solve convex and non-convex formulation of Robust PCA with the asymptotically
optimal fraction of corruptions $\alpha=\mathcal{O}\left(1/(\mu r) \right)$, where $s = \alpha^2
mn$, and improve the previously best known guarantees by not requiring that the fraction of corruptions
is spread in every column and row by being upper bounded by $\alpha$. Numerical experiments illustrating
these results are shown for synthetic problems, dynamic-foreground/static-background separation,
and multispectral imaging.

In 1973, Erd\H{o}s conjectured the existence of high girth $(n,3,2)$-Steiner systems. Recently,
Glock, K\"{u}hn, Lo, and Osthus and independently Bohman and Warnke proved the approximate version
of Erd\H{o}s' conjecture. Just this year, Kwan, Sah, Sawhney, and Simkin proved Erd\H{o}s' conjecture.
As for Steiner systems with more general parameters, Glock, K\"{u}hn, Lo, and Osthus conjectured
the existence of high girth $(n,q,r)$-Steiner systems. We prove the approximate version of their
conjecture. This result follows from our general main results which concern finding perfect or
almost perfect matchings in a hypergraph $G$ avoiding a given set of submatchings (which we view
as a hypergraph $H$ where $V(H)=E(G)$). Our first main result is a common generalization of the classical
theorems of Pippenger (for finding an almost perfect matching) and Ajtai, Koml\'os, Pintz, Spencer,
and Szemer\'edi (for finding an independent set in girth five hypergraphs). More generally, we
prove this for coloring and even list coloring, and also generalize this further to when $H$ is a hypergraph
with small codegrees (for which high girth designs is a specific instance). Indeed, the coloring
version of our result even yields an almost partition of $K_n^r$ into approximate high girth $(n,q,r)$-Steiner
systems. Our main results also imply the existence of a perfect matching in a bipartite hypergraph
where the parts have slightly unbalanced degrees. This has a number of applications; for example,
it proves the existence of $\Delta$ pairwise disjoint list colorings in the setting of Kahn's theorem;
it also proves asymptotic versions of various rainbow matching results in the sparse setting (where
the number of times a color appears could be much smaller than the number of colors) and even the existence
of many pairwise disjoint rainbow matchings in such circumstances.

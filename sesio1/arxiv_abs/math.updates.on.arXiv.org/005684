Given a permutational wreath product sequence of cyclic groups we investigate its minimal generating
set, minimal generating set for its commutator and some properties of its commutator subgroup.
We strengthen the result of author \cite{SkVC, SkMal, SkAr} and construct minimal generating set
for wreath product of finite and infinite cyclic groups and direct product of such groups. We generalize
results of Meldrum about commutator subgroup of wreath product \cite{Meld} because we take in consideration
as regular wreath product as well as no regular (where active group $\mathcal{A}$ can acts not faithfully).
Also commutator of such group and its minimal generating set. Also center of such products was investigated.
Also fundamental group of orbits of a Morse function $f:M\to \mathbb{R}$ defined on a Mebius band
$M$ with respect to the right action of the group of diffeomorphisms $\mathcal{D}(M)$ is investigated
by us. The paper describes precise algebraic structure of the group $\pi_1 O(f)$. A minimal set of
generators for the group of orbits of functions ${{\pi }_{1}}({{O}_{f}},f)$ arising under the
action of diffeomorphisms group stabilizing the function $f$ and stabilizing $\partial M$ is found.
The the Morse function $f$ has critical sets with one saddle point. The quotient group of restricted
wreath products by its commutator was found. The generic sets of commutator of wreath product were
investigated. Minimal generating set for this group and for commutator of group are found. This
paper after previous Arxiv versions from 2019 \cite{SkArM, SkArM3} with previous title "Minimal
generating set and structure of wreath product of groups with non-faithful action, comutator subgroup
of wreath product and the fundamental group of orbit of Morse function $\pi_1 O(f)$" was published
\cite{SkRendi}.

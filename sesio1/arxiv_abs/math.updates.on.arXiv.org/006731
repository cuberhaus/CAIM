The study of statistical models of network structure, pursued across numerous disciplines and
contexts, is fundamentally challenging because of (often high-order) dependence between connections.
A common approach assigns each person in the graph to a position on a low-dimensional manifold. Distance
between individuals in this (latent) space is inversely proportional to the likelihood of forming
a connection. The choice of the latent geometry (the manifold class, dimension, and curvature)
has consequential impacts on the substantive conclusions drawn from the model. More positive curvature
in the manifold, for example, encourages more and tighter communities; negative curvature induces
repulsion among nodes. Currently, however, the choice of the latent geometry is an a priori modeling
assumption and there is limited guidance about how to make these choices in a data-driven way. In
this work, we present a method to consistently estimate the manifold type, dimension, and curvature
from an empirically relevant class of latent spaces: simply connected, complete Riemannian manifolds
of constant curvature. Our core insight comes by representing the graph as a noisy distance matrix
based on the ties between groups of nodes: either cliques, or in the case where the researcher observes
traits, trait-groups. Leveraging results from statistical geometry, we develop hypothesis tests
to determine whether the observed distances could plausibly be embedded isometrically in each
of the candidate geometries. The method applies when the researcher observes the full graph and
also to empirically relevant cases where only partial data is observed. We explore the accuracy
of our approach with simulations and then apply our approach to data-sets from economics and sociology
as well as neuroscience.

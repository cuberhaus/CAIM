All intuitionistic fuzzy TOPSIS methods contain two key elements: (1) the order structure, which
can affect the choices of positive ideal-points and negative ideal-points, and construction of
admissible distance/similarity measures; (2) the distance/similarity measure, which is closely
related to the values of the relative closeness degrees and determines the accuracy and rationality
of decision-making. For the order structure, many efforts are devoted to constructing some score
functions, which can strictly distinguish different intuitionistic fuzzy values (IFVs) and preserve
the natural partial order for IFVs. This paper proves that such a score function does not exist, namely
the application of a single monotonous and continuous function does not distinguish all IFVs. For
the distance or similarity measure, some examples are given to show that classical similarity measures
based on the normalized Euclidean distance and normalized Minkowski distance do not meet the axiomatic
definition of intuitionistic fuzzy similarity measures. Moreover,some illustrative examples
are given to show that classical intuitionistic fuzzy TOPSIS methods do not ensure the monotonicity
with the natural partial order or linear orders, because they may yield counter-intuitive results.
To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel intuitionistic fuzzy TOPSIS method, using two new
admissible distances with the linear orders measured by a score degree/similarity function and
accuracy degree, and prove that they are monotonous under these two linear orders. This is the first
result with a strict mathematical proof on the monotonicity with the linear orders for the intuitionistic
fuzzy TOPSIS method. Finally, we show two practical examples and comparative analysis with other
decision-making methods to illustrate the efficiency of the developed TOPSIS method.

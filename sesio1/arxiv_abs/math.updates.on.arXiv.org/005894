The split property of a pure state for a certain cut of a quantum spin system can be understood as the
entanglement between the two subsystems being weak. From this point of view, we may say that if it
is not possible to transform a state $\omega$ via sufficiently local automorphisms (in a sense that
we will make precise) into a state satisfying the split property, then the state $\omega$ has a long-range
entanglement. It is well known that in 1D, gapped ground states have the split property with respect
to cutting the system into left and right half-chains. In 2D, however, the split property fails to
hold for interesting models such as Kitaev's toric code. In fact, we will show that this failure is
the reason that anyons can exist in that model. There is a folklore saying that the existence of anyons,
like in the toric code model, implies long-range entanglement of the state. In this paper, we prove
this folklore in an infinite dimensional setting. More precisely, we show that long-range entanglement,
in a way that we will define precisely, is a necessary condition to have non-trivial superselection
sectors. Anyons in particular give rise to such non-trivial sectors. States with the split property
for cones, on the other hand, do not admit non-trivial sectors. A key technical ingredient of our
proof is that under suitable assumptions on locality, the automorphisms generated by local interactions
can be 'approximately factorized': they can be written as the tensor product of automorphisms localized
in a cone and its complement respectively, followed by an automorphism acting near the 'boundary'
of $\Lambda$, and conjugation with a unitary. This result may be of independent interest. This technique
also allows us to prove that the approximate split property, a weaker version of the split property
that is satisfied in e.g. the toric code, is stable under applying such automorphisms.

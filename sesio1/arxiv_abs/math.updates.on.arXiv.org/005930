We analyze the optimal partition and assignment strategy for an uncapacitated FCFS queueing system
with multiple types of customers. Each type of customers is associated with a certain arrival and
service rate. The decision maker can partition the server into sub-queues, each with a smaller service
capacity, and can route different types of customers to different sub-queues (deterministically
or randomly). The objective is to minimize the overall expected waiting time. First, we show that
by properly partitioning the queue, it is possible to reduce the expected waiting time of customers,
and there exist a series of instances such that the reduction can be arbitrarily large. Then we consider
four settings of this problem, depending on whether the partition is given (thus only assignment
decision is to be made) or not and whether each type of customers can only be assigned to a unique queue
or can be assigned to multiple queues in a probabilistic manner. When the partition is given, we show
that this problem is NP-hard in general if each type of customers must be assigned to a unique queue.
When the customers can be assigned to multiple queues in a probabilistic manner, we identify a structure
of the optimal assignment and develop an efficient algorithm to find the optimal assignment. When
the decision maker can also optimize the partition, we show that the optimal decision must be to segment
customers deterministically based on their service rates, and to assign customers with consecutive
service rates into the same queue. Efficient algorithms are also proposed in this case. Overall,
our work is the first to comprehensively study the queue partition problem based on customer types,
which has the potential to increase the efficiency of queueing system.

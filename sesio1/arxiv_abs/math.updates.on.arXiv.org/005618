A $k$-matching $M$ of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a subset $M\subseteq E$ such that each connected component
in the subgraph $F = (V,M)$ of $G$ is either a single-vertex graph or $k$-regular, i.e., each vertex
has degree $k$. In this contribution, we are interested in $k$-matchings within the four standard
graph products: the Cartesian, strong, direct and lexicographic product. As we shall see, the problem
of finding non-empty $k$-matchings ($k\geq 3$) in graph products is NP-complete. Due to the general
intractability of this problem, we focus on distinct polynomial-time constructions of $k$-matchings
in a graph product $G\star H$ that are based on $k_G$-matchings $M_G$ and $k_H$-matchings $M_H$
of its factors $G$ and $H$, respectively. In particular, we are interested in properties of the factors
that have to be satisfied such that these constructions yield a maximum $k$-matching in the respective
products. Such constructions are also called "well-behaved" and we provide several characterizations
for this type of $k$-matchings. Our specific constructions of $k$-matchings in graph products
satisfy the property of being weak-homomorphism preserving, i.e., constructed matched edges
in the product are never "projected" to unmatched edges in the factors. This leads to the concept
of weak-homomorphism preserving $k$-matchings. Although the specific $k$-matchings constructed
here are not always maximum $k$-matchings of the products, they have always maximum size among all
weak-homomorphism preserving $k$-matchings. Not all weak-homomorphism preserving $k$-matchings,
however, can be constructed in our manner. We will, therefore, determine the size of maximum-sized
elements among all weak-homomorphims preserving $k$-matching within the respective graph products,
provided that the matchings in the factors satisfy some general assumptions.

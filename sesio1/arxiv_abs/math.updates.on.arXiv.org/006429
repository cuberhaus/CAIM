The article deals with the problem of synthesis of an adaptive observer of state variables of a linear
time-varying SISO dynamic system. It is assumed that the control signal and the output variable
are measurable. It is assumed that the state matrix of the plant contains known variables and unknown
constant parameters, and the control matrix (vector) is unknown. The synthesis of the observer
is based on the GPEBO method (generalized parameter based observer) proposed in $[1]$. Synthesis
of adaptive provides for preliminary parametrization of the initial system and its transformation
to a linear regression model with further identification of unknown parameters. To identify unknown
constant parameters a classical estimation algorithm was used (the least squares method with a
forgetting factor). This approach has proven itself well in cases where the known regressor is frequency
poor (that is, the spectral composition of the regressor contains less than $r/2$ harmonics, where
r is the number of unknown parameters) or does not satisfy the so-called undamped excitation condition.
To illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method an example is presented in the article. A time-varying
second-order object with four unknown parameters was considered. Parameterization of the initial
dynamic model was performed and a linear static regression containing six unknowns parameters
was obtained (including the vector of unknown initial conditions of system state variables). An
adaptive observer was synthesized and the results of computer modeling illustrating the achievement
of a given goal were presented. The main difference from the results published earlier in $[2]$ is
the new assumption that the linear a time-varing system contains not only unknown parameters in
the state matrix, but also the matrix (vector) for control contains unknown constant coefficients.

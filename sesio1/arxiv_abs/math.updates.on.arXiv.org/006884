This study presents a Lagrange-Galerkin scheme of second order in time for the shallow water equations
with a transmission boundary condition, which maintains the two advantages of the Lagrange-Galerkin
methods, i.e., the CFL-free robustness for convection-dominated problems and the symmetry of
the resulting coefficient matrices for the system of linear equations. The two material derivatives
in non-conservative and conservative forms are discretized based on the ideas of the two-step backward
difference formula of degree two along the trajectory of the fluid particle. Numerical results
by the scheme are presented. Firstly, the experimental order of convergence of the scheme is shown
to see the second-order accuracy in time. Secondly, the effect of the transmission boundary condition
on a simple domain is discussed; the artificial reflections are kept from the Dirichlet boundaries
and removed significantly from the transmission boundaries. Thirdly, the scheme is applied to
a complex practical domain, i.e., the Bay of Bengal region, which is non-convex and includes islands.
The effect of the transmission boundary condition is discussed again for the complex domain; the
artificial reflections are removed significantly from transmission boundaries, which are set
on open sea boundaries. Based on the numerical results, it is revealed that the scheme has the following
properties; (i) the same advantages of Lagrange-Galerkin methods (the CFL-free robustness and
the symmetry of the matrices); (ii) second-order accuracy in time; (iii) mass preservation of the
function for the water level from the reference height (until the contact with the transmission
boundaries of the wave); and (iv) no significant artificial reflection from the transmission boundaries.

This thesis is devoted to the construction of theories describing the consistent propagation of
(super)conformal higher-spin fields on curved three- and four-dimensional (super)spaces. In
the first half of this thesis we systematically derive models for conformal fields of arbitrary
rank on various types of curved spacetimes. On generic conformally-flat backgrounds in three $(3d)$
and four $(4d)$ dimensions, we obtain closed-form expressions for the actions which are manifestly
gauge and Weyl invariant. Similar results are provided for generalised conformal fields, which
have higher-depth gauge transformations. In three dimensions, conformally-flat spacetimes
are the most general backgrounds allowing consistent propagation. In four dimensions, it is widely
expected that gauge invariance can be extended to Bach-flat backgrounds, although no complete
models for spin greater than two exist. We confirm these expectations for the first time by constructing
a number of complete gauge-invariant models for conformal fields with higher spin. In the second
half of this thesis we employ superspace techniques to extend the above results to conformal higher-spin
theories possessing off-shell supersymmetry. Several novel applications of our results are also
provided. In particular, transverse projection operators are constructed in $4d$ anti-de Sitter
(AdS$_4$) space, and their poles are shown to be associated with partially-massless fields. This
allows us to demonstrate that on such backgrounds, the (super)conformal higher-spin kinetic operator
factorises into products of second order operators. Similar conclusions are drawn in AdS$_3$ (super)space.
Finally, we make use of the (super)conformal higher-spin models in $3d$ Minkowski and AdS (super)space
to build topologically massive gauge theories.

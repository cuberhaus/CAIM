Mathematical modelling of the macroscopic electrical activity of the brain is highly non-trivial
and requires a detailed understanding of not only the associated mathematical techniques, but
also the underlying physiology and anatomy. Neural field theory is a population-level approach
to modelling the non-linear dynamics of large populations of neurons, while maintaining a degree
of mathematical tractability. This class of models provides a solid theoretical perspective on
fundamental processes of neural tissue such as state transitions between different brain activities
as observed during epilepsy or sleep. Various anatomical, physiological, and mathematical assumptions
are essential for deriving a minimal set of equations that strike a balance between biophysical
realism and mathematical tractability. However, these assumptions are not always made explicit
throughout the literature. Even though neural field models (NFMs) first appeared in the literature
in the early 1970's, the relationships between them have not been systematically addressed. This
may partially be explained by the fact that the inter-dependencies between these models are often
implicit and non-trivial. Herein we provide a review of key stages of the history and development
of neural field theory and contemporary uses of this branch of mathematical neuroscience. First,
the principles of the theory are summarised throughout a discussion of the pioneering models by
Wilson and Cowan, Amari and Nunez. Upon thorough review of these models, we then present a unified
mathematical framework in which all neural field models can be derived by applying different assumptions.
We then use this framework to i) derive contemporary models by Robinson, Jansen and Rit, Wendling,
Liley, and Steyn-Ross, and ii) make explicit the many significant inherited assumptions that exist
in the current literature.

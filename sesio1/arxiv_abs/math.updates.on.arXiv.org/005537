Fundamental limits and optimal mechanisms of privacy-preserving data release that aim to minimize
the privacy leakage under utility constraints of non-specific tasks are investigated. While the
private feature is typically determined and known by the users who release their data, the specific
task in which the released data is utilized is usually unknown. To address the lack of information
of the specific task, utility constraints laid on a set of possible tasks are considered. The mechanism
protects the privacy while satisfying utility of all possible tasks in the set. First, the single-letter
characterization of the rate-leakage-distortion region is derived. Characterization of the
minimum leakage under log-loss distortion and unconstrained released rate turns out to be a non-convex
problem. Second, focusing on the case where the raw data consists of independent components, we
show that the above problem can be decomposed into multiple parallel privacy funnel (PF) problems
with different weightings. We explicitly derive the solution to each PF problem when the private
feature is a deterministic function of a data component. The solution is characterized by a leakage-free
threshold, and the minimum leakage is zero while the utility constraint is below the threshold.
Finally, we show that the optimal weighting of each PF problem can be found by solving a linear program
(LP). A sufficient released rate to achieve the minimum leakage is also derived. Numerical results
are shown to illustrate the robustness of our approach against the task non-specificity. Our results
can also be extended to the differential privacy metric. We show that the problem with multiple constraints
can also be decomposed into multiple single-constraint problems. However, the solution to each
single-constraint problem remains open and can only be solved by numerical methods.

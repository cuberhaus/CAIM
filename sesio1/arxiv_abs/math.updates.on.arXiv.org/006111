We study bosonic systems on spacetime lattice defined by path integrals of commuting fields. We
introduce a branch-independent bosonic system, whose path integral is independent of the branch
structure of the spacetime simplicial complex, even for a spacetime with boundaries. In contrast,
a generic lattice bosonic system's path integral may depend on the branch structure. We find the
4+1d invertible topological order characterized by the Stiefel-Whitney cocycle w$_2$w$_3$ to
be non-trivial for branch-independent bosonic systems, but this w$_2$w$_3$ order and a trivial
gapped tensor product state belong to the same phase for generic lattice bosonic systems. The invertible
topological orders in generic bosonic systems on spacetime lattice are not classified by oriented
cobordism. The branch dependence on the lattice may relate to the orthonormal frame of smooth manifolds
and the framing anomaly of continuum field theories. We construct branch-independent bosonic
systems to realize the w$_2$w$_3$ order, as well as its 3+1d gapped or gapless boundaries. One of
the gapped boundaries is a 3+1d $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory with (1) fermionic $\mathbb{Z}_2$
gauge charge particle which trivializes w$_2$ and (2) fermionic $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge flux line
which trivializes w$_3$. In particular, if the flux loop's worldsheet is unorientable, then orientation-reversal
1d worldline must correspond to a fermion worldline that does not carry the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge
charge. We also explain why Spin and Spin$^c$ structures trivialize the w$_2$w$_3$ global gravitational
anomaly to zero (which helps to construct the 3+1d gapped $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and gapless all-fermion
U(1) gauge theories), but the Spin$^h$ and Spin$\times_{\mathbb{Z}_2}$Spin$(n\geq 3)$ structures
modify the w$_2$w$_3$ into a mixed gauge-gravitational anomaly, which helps to constrain Grand
Unifications (e.g, $n=10,18$) or construct new models.

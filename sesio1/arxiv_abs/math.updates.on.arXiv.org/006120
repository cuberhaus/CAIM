We propose in this thesis a new deformation process of Kac-Moody algebras and their representations.
The direction of deformation is given by a collection of numbers, called a colouring. The natural
numbers lead for example to the classical algebras, while the quantum numbers lead to the associated
quantum algebras. We first establish sufficient and necessary conditions on colourings to allow
the process depend polynomially on a formal parameter and to provide the generalised quantum enveloping
(GQE) algebras. We then lift the restrictions and show that the process still exists via the coloured
Kac Moody algebras. We formulate the GQE conjecture which predicts that every representation in
the category Oint of a Kac-Moody algebra can be deformed into a representation of an associated GQE
algebra. We give various evidences for this conjecture and make a first step towards its resolution
by proving that Kac-Moody algebras without Serre relations can be deformed into GQE algebras without
Serre relations. In case the conjecture holds, we establish an analog result for coloured Kac-Moody
algebras, we prove that the deformed representation theories are parallel to the classical one,
we explicit a deformed Serre presentation for GQE algebras, we prove that the latter are the representatives
of a natural class of formal deformations of Kac-Moody algebras and are h-trivial in finite type.
As an application, we explain in terms of interpolation both classical and quantum Langlands dualities
between representations of Lie algebras, and we propose a new approach which aims at proving a conjecture
of Frenkel-Hernandez. In general, we prove that representations of two isogenic coloured Kac-Moody
algebras can be interpolated by representations of a third one. Observing that standard quantum
algebras satisfy the GQE conjecture, we give a new proof of the previously mentioned classical Langlands
duality.

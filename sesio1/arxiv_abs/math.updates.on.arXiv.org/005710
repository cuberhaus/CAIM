During the COVID-19 pandemic, the collapse of the public transit ridership led to significant budget
deficits due to dramatic decreases in fare revenues. Additionally, public transit agencies are
facing challenges of reduced vehicle capacity due to social distancing requirements, additional
costs of cleaning and protective equipment, and increased downtime for vehicle cleaning. Due to
these constraints on resources and budgets, many transit agencies have adopted essential service
plans with reduced service hours, number of routes, or frequencies. This paper studies the resiliency
during a pandemic of On-Demand Multimodal Transit Systems (ODMTS), a new generation of transit
systems that combine a network of high-frequency trains and buses with on-demand shuttles to serve
the first and last miles and act as feeders to the fixed network. It presents a case study for the city
of Atlanta and evaluates ODMTS for multiple scenarios of depressed demand and social distancing
representing various stages of the pandemic. The case study relies on an optimization pipeline
that provides an end-to-end ODMTS solution by bringing together methods for demand estimation,
network design, fleet sizing, and real-time dispatching. These methods are adapted to work in a
multimodal setting and to satisfy practical constraints. In particular, a limit is imposed on the
number of passenger transfers, and a new network design model is introduced to avoid the computational
burden stemming from this constraint. Real data from the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority
(MARTA) is used to conduct the case study, and the results are evaluated with a high-fidelity simulation.
The case study demonstrates how ODMTS provide a resilient solution in terms of cost, convenience,
and accessibility for this wide range of scenarios.

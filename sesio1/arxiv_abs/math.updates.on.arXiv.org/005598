In this paper we deepen, in the setting of coherence, some results obtained in recent papers on the
notion of p-entailment of Adams and its relationship with conjoined and iterated conditionals.
We recall that conjoined and iterated conditionals are suitably defined in the framework of conditional
random quantities. Given a family $\mathcal{F}$ of $n$ conditional events $\{E_1|H_1,\ldots,
E_n|H_n\}$ we denote by $\mathscr{C}(\mathcal{F})=(E_1|H_1)\wedge \cdots \wedge (E_n|H_n)$
the conjunction of the conditional events in $\mathcal{F}$. We introduce the iterated conditional
$\mathscr{C}(\mathcal{F}_2)|\mathscr{C}(\mathcal{F}_1)$, where $\mathcal{F}_1$ and $\mathcal{F}_2$
are two finite families of conditional events, by showing that the prevision of $\mathscr{C}(\mathcal{F}_2)\wedge
\mathscr{C}(\mathcal{F}_1)$ is the product of the prevision of $\mathscr{C}(\mathcal{F}_2)|\mathscr{C}(\mathcal{F}_1)$
and the prevision of $\mathscr{C}(\mathcal{F}_1)$. Likewise the well known equality $(A\wedge
H)|H=A|H$, we show that $ (\mathscr{C}(\mathcal{F}_2)\wedge \mathscr{C}(\mathcal{F}_1))|\mathscr{C}(\mathcal{F}_1)=
\mathscr{C}(\mathcal{F}_2)|\mathscr{C}(\mathcal{F}_1)$. Then, we consider the case $\mathcal{F}_1=\mathcal{F}_2=\mathcal{F}$
and we verify for the prevision $\mu$ of $\mathscr{C}(\mathcal{F})|\mathscr{C}(\mathcal{F})$
that the unique coherent assessment is $\mu=1$ and, as a consequence, $\mathscr{C}(\mathcal{F})|\mathscr{C}(\mathcal{F})$
coincides with the constant 1. Finally, by assuming $\mathcal{F}$ p-consistent, we deepen some
previous characterizations of p-entailment by showing that $\mathcal{F}$ p-entails a conditional
event $E_{n+1}|H_{n+1}$ if and only if the iterated conditional $(E_{n+1}|H_{n+1})\,|\,\mathscr{C}(\mathcal{F})$
is constant and equal to 1. We illustrate this characterization by an example related with weak transitivity.

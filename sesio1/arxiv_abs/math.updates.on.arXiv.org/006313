A noteworthy aspect in blood flow modeling is the definition of the mechanical interaction between
the fluid flow and the biological structure that contains it, namely the vessel wall. It has been
demonstrated that the addition of a viscous contribution to the mechanical characterization of
vessels brings positive results when compared to in-vivo measurements. In this context, the numerical
implementation of boundary conditions able to keep memory of the viscoelastic contribution of
vessel walls assumes an important role, especially when dealing with large circulatory systems.
In this work, viscoelasticity is taken into account in entire networks via the Standard Linear Solid
Model. The implementation of the viscoelastic contribution at boundaries (inlet, outlet and junctions),
is carried out considering the hyperbolic nature of the mathematical model. A non-linear system
is established based on the definition of the Riemann Problem at junctions, characterized by rarefaction
waves separated by contact discontinuities, among which the mass and the total energy are conserved.
Basic junction tests are analyzed, such as a trivial 2-vessels junction, for both a generic artery
and vein, and a simple 3-vessels junction, considering an aortic bifurcation scenario. The chosen
asymptotic-preserving IMEX Runge-Kutta Finite Volume scheme is demonstrated to be second-order
accurate in the whole domain and well-balanced, even when including junctions. Two different benchmark
models of the arterial network are implemented, differing in number of vessels and in viscoelastic
parameters. Comparison of the results obtained in the two networks underlines the high sensitivity
of the model to the chosen viscoelastic parameters. The conservation of the contribution provided
by the viscoelastic characterization of vessel walls is assessed in the whole network, including
junctions and boundary conditions.

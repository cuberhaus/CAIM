This paper deals with Hensel minimal, non-trivially valued fields $K$ of equicharacteristic zero,
whose axiomatic theory was introduced in a recent article by Cluckers-Halupczok-Rideau. We additionally
require that the standard algebraic language be induced (up to interdefinability) for the imaginary
sort $RV$. This condition is satisfied by the majority of classical tame structures on Henselian
fields, including Henselian fields with analytic structure. The main purpose is to carry over many
results of our previous papers to the above general axiomatic settings including, among others,
the theorem on existence of the limit, curve selection, the closedness theorem, several non-Archimedean
versions of the Lojasiewicz inequalities as well as the theorems on extending continuous definable
functions and on existence of definable retractions. We establish an embedding theorem for regular
definable spaces and the definable ultranormality of definable Hausdorff LC-spaces. Also given
are examples that curve selection and the closedness theorem, key results for numerous applications,
may be no longer true after expanding the language for the leading term structure $RV$. In the case
of Henselian fields with analytic structure, a more precise version of the theorem on existence
of the limit (a version of Puiseux's theorem) is provided. Further, we establish definable versions
of resolution of singularities (hypersurface case) and transformation to normal crossings by
blowing up, on arbitrary strong analytic manifolds in Hensel minimal expansions of analytic structures.
Also introduced are meromorphous functions, i.e. continuous quotients of strong analytic functions
on strong analytic manifolds. Finally, we prove a finitary meromorphous version of the Nullstellensatz.

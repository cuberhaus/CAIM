A quasi-metric antipodal space $(Z, \rho_0)$ is a compact space $Z$ with a continuous quasi-metric
$\rho_0$ which is of diameter one, and which is antipodal, i.e. for any $\xi \in Z$ there exists $\eta
\in Z$ such that $\rho_0(\xi, \eta) = 1$. The quasi-metric $\rho_0$ defines a positive cross-ratio
function on the space of quadruples of distinct points in $Z$, and a homeomorphism between quasi-metric
antipodal spaces is said to be Moebius if it preserves cross-ratios. A proper, geodesically complete
Gromov hyperbolic space $X$ is said to be boundary continuous if the Gromov inner product extends
continuously to the boundary. Then the boundary $\partial X$ equipped with a visual quasi-metric
is a quasi-metric antipodal space. The space $X$ is said to be maximal if for any proper, geodesically
complete, boundary continuous Gromov hyperbolic space $Y$, if there is a Moebius homeomorphism
$f : \partial Y \to \partial X$, then $f$ extends to an isometric embedding $F : Y \to X$. We call such
spaces maximal Gromov hyperbolic spaces. We show that any proper, geodesically complete, boundary
continuous Gromov hyperbolic space embeds isometrically into a maximal Gromov hyperbolic space
which is unique up to isometry, and the image of the embedding is cobounded. We prove an equivalence
of categories between quasi-metric antipodal spaces and maximal Gromov hyperbolic spaces, namely:
any quasi-metric antipodal space is Moebius homeomorphic to the boundary of a maximal Gromov hyperbolic
space, and any Moebius homeomorphism $f : \partial X \to \partial Y$ between boundaries of maximal
Gromov hyperbolic spaces $X, Y$ extends to a surjective isometry $F : X \to Y$. This is part of a more
general equivalence between certain compact spaces called antipodal spaces and their associated
metric spaces called Moebius spaces.

An influential result of McDuff and Schlenk asserts that the function that encodes when a four-dimensional
symplectic ellipsoid can be embedded into a four-dimensional ball has a remarkable structure:
the function has infinitely many corners, determined by the odd-index Fibonacci numbers, that
fit together to form an infinite staircase. This work has recently led to considerable interest
in understanding when the ellipsoid embedding function for other symplectic 4-manifolds is partly
described by an infinite staircase. We provide a general framework for analyzing this question
for a large family of targets, called finite type convex toric domains, which we prove generalizes
the class of closed toric symplectic 4-manifolds. When the target is of finite type, we prove that
any infinite staircase must have a unique accumulation point a_0, given as the solution to an explicit
quadratic equation. Moreover, we prove that the embedding function at a_0 must be equal to the classical
volume lower bound. In particular, our result gives an obstruction to the existence of infinite
staircases that we show is strong. In the special case of rational convex toric domains, we can say
more. We conjecture a complete answer to the question of existence of infinite staircases, in terms
of six families that are distinguished by the fact that their moment polygon is reflexive. We then
provide a uniform proof of the existence of infinite staircases for our six families, using two tools.
For the first, we use recursive families of almost toric fibrations to find symplectic embeddings.
For the second tool, we find recursive families of convex lattice paths that provide obstructions
to embeddings. We conclude by reducing our conjecture that these are the only infinite staircases
among rational convex toric domains to a question in number theory related to a classic work of Hardy
and Littlewood.

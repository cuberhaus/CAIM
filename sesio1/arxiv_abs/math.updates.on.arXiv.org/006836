To capture inherent geometric features of many community detection problems, we propose to use
a new random graph model of communities that we call a \emph{Geometric Block Model}. The geometric
block model builds on the \emph{random geometric graphs} (Gilbert, 1961), one of the basic models
of random graphs for spatial networks, in the same way that the well-studied stochastic block model
builds on the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{en}yi random graphs. It is also a natural extension of random community
models inspired by the recent theoretical and practical advancements in community detection.
To analyze the geometric block model, we first provide new connectivity results for \emph{random
annulus graphs} which are generalizations of random geometric graphs. The connectivity properties
of geometric graphs have been studied since their introduction, and analyzing them has been difficult
due to correlated edge formation. We then use the connectivity results of random annulus graphs
to provide necessary and sufficient conditions for efficient recovery of communities for the geometric
block model. We show that a simple triangle-counting algorithm to detect communities in the geometric
block model is near-optimal. For this we consider two regimes of graph density. In the regime where
the average degree of the graph grows logarithmically with number of vertices, we show that our algorithm
performs extremely well, both theoretically and practically. In contrast, the triangle-counting
algorithm is far from being optimum for the stochastic block model in the logarithmic degree regime.
We also look at the regime where the average degree of the graph grows linearly with the number of vertices
$n$, and hence to store the graph one needs $\Theta(n^2)$ memory. We show that our algorithm needs
to store only $O(n \log n)$ edges in this regime to recover the latent communities.

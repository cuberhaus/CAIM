In this paper we show the existence of traveling waves $w: [0,+\infty) \times \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^k$
($k \geq 2$) for the parabolic Allen-Cahn system \begin{equation} \partial_t w - \Delta w = -\nabla_u
V(w) \mbox{ in } [0,+\infty) \times \mathbb{R}^2, \end{equation} satisfying some \textit{heteroclinic}
conditions at infinity. The potential $V$ is a non-negative and smooth multi-well potential, which
means that its null set is finite and contains at least two elements. The traveling wave $w$ propagates
along the horizontal axis according to a speed $c^\star>0$ and a profile $\mathfrak{U}$. The profile
$\mathfrak{U}$ joins at infinity (in a suitable sense) two locally minimizing 1D heteroclinics
which have \textit{different} energies and the speed $c^\star$ satisfies certain uniqueness
properties. While the stationary waves with analogous heteroclinic behavior (that is, which join
two different globally minimizing 1D heteroclinics at infinity) are known to exist since the work
of Alama, Bronsard and Gui \cite{alama-bronsard-gui}, the existence of heteroclinic 2D traveling
waves had not been established before. Our proof, which is variational, is limited to potentials
$V$ for which the difference between the energies of the 1D heteroclinics is bounded above by a constant
depending on $V$. In particular, our proof works for potentials which are obtained by perturbing
in a suitable fashion the ones considered in \cite{alama-bronsard-gui}. Our strategy consists
on adapting a result by Alikakos and Katzourakis \cite{alikakos-katzourakis} for curves which
take values in a possibly infinite-dimensional Hilbert space and showing that this applies to our
initial setting. An analogous strategy for proving the existence of the heteroclinic stationary
wave was used by Monteil and Santambrogio \cite{monteil-santambrogio} and Smyrnelis \cite{smyrnelis}.

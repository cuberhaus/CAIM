We study the conservation properties of the Hermite-discontinuous Galerkin (Hermite-DG) approximation
of the Vlasov-Maxwell equations. In this semi-discrete formulation, the total mass is preserved
independently for every plasma species. Further, an energy invariant exists if central numerical
fluxes are used in the DG approximation of Maxwell's equations, while a dissipative term is present
when upwind fluxes are employed. In general, traditional temporal integrators might fail to preserve
invariants associated with conservation laws (at the continuous or semi-discrete level) during
the time evolution. Hence, we analyze the capability of explicit and implicit Runge-Kutta (RK)
temporal integrators to preserve such invariants. Since explicit RK methods can only ensure preservation
of linear invariants but do not provide any control on the system energy, we consider modified explicit
RK methods in the family of relaxation Runge-Kutta methods (RRK). These methods can be tuned to preserve
the energy invariant at the continuous or semi-discrete level, a distinction that is important
when upwind fluxes are used in the discretization of Maxwell's equations since upwind provides
a numerical source of energy dissipation that is not present when central fluxes are used. We prove
that the proposed methods are able to preserve the energy invariant and to maintain the semi-discrete
energy dissipation (if present) according to the discretization of Maxwell's equations. An extensive
set of numerical experiments corroborates the theoretical findings. It also suggests that maintaining
the semi-discrete energy dissipation when upwind fluxes are used leads to an overall better accuracy
of the method relative to using upwind fluxes while forcing exact energy conservation.

We construct a new family of random permutons, called skew Brownian permuton, which describes the
limits of various models of random constrained permutations. This family is parametrized by two
real parameters. For a specific choice of the parameters, the skew Brownian permuton coincides
with the Baxter permuton, i.e. the permuton limit of Baxter permutations. We prove that for another
specific choice of the parameters, the skew Brownian permuton coincides with the biased Brownian
separable permuton, a one-parameter family of permutons previously studied in the literature
as limit of uniform permutations in substitution-closed classes. This brings two different limiting
objects under the same roof, identifying a new larger universality class. The skew Brownian permuton
is constructed in terms of some stochastic differential equations (SDEs) driven by two-dimensional
correlated Brownian excursions in the non-negative quadrant. We call these SDEs skew perturbed
Tanaka equations because they are a mixture of the perturbed Tanaka equations and the equations
encoding skew Brownian motions. We prove existence and uniqueness of (strong) solutions for these
new SDEs. In addition, we show that some natural permutons arising from SLE-decorated Liouville
quantum spheres are skew Brownian permutons and such permutons cover almost the whole range of possible
parameters. The connection between models of constrained permutations and models of decorated
planar maps has been intensively investigated in the literature at the discrete level; this paper
establishes this connection directly at the continuum level. Proving the latter result, we also
give an SDE interpretation of some quantities related to SLE-decorated Liouville quantum spheres.
We finally collect a series of intriguing open-questions on these new limiting permutons.

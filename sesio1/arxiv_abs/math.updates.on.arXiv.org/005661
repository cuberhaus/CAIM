We extend the tropical intersection theory to tropicalizations of germs of analytic sets. In particular,
we construct a (not entirely obvious) local version of the ring of tropical fans with a nondegenerate
intersection pairing. As an application, we study nearby monodromy eigenvalues -- the eigenvalues
of the monodromy operators of singularities, adjacent to a given singularity of a holomorphic function
$f$. More precisely, we express some of such values in terms of certain resolutions of $f$. The expression
is given it terms of the exceptional divisor strata of arbitrary codimension, generalizing the
classical A'Campo formula that consumes only codimension 1 strata and produces only monodromy
eigenvalues at the origin. For this purpose, we introduce tropical characteristic classes of germs
of analytic sets, and use this calculus to detect some of the nearby monodromy eigenvalues, which
we call tropical. The study is motivated by the monodromy conjectures by Igusa, Denef and Loeser:
every pole of an appropriate local zeta function of $f$ induces a nearby monodromy eigenvalue. We
propose a presumably stronger version of this conjecture: all poles of the local zeta function induce
tropical nearby monodromy eigenvalues. In particular, if the singularity is non-degenerate with
respect to its Newton polyhedron $N$, then the tropical monodromy eigenvalues can be expressed
in terms of fiber polytopes of certain faces of $N$, so our conjecture (unlike the original ones)
becomes a purely combinatorial statement about a polyhedron. This statement is confirmed for the
topological zeta function in dimension up to 4 in a joint work with A. Lemahieu and K. Takeuchi, which,
in particular, supports our conjecture and proves the original one for non-degenerate singularities
in 4 variables.

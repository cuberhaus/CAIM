Nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) are used to model dynamical processes in a large
number of scientific fields, ranging from finance to biology. In many applications standard local
models are not sufficient to accurately account for certain non-local phenomena such as, e.g.,
interactions at a distance. In order to properly capture these phenomena non-local nonlinear PDE
models are frequently employed in the literature. In this article we propose two numerical methods
based on machine learning and on Picard iterations, respectively, to approximately solve non-local
nonlinear PDEs. The proposed machine learning-based method is an extended variant of a deep learning-based
splitting-up type approximation method previously introduced in the literature and utilizes
neural networks to provide approximate solutions on a subset of the spatial domain of the solution.
The Picard iterations-based method is an extended variant of the so-called full history recursive
multilevel Picard approximation scheme previously introduced in the literature and provides
an approximate solution for a single point of the domain. Both methods are mesh-free and allow non-local
nonlinear PDEs with Neumann boundary conditions to be solved in high dimensions. In the two methods,
the numerical difficulties arising due to the dimensionality of the PDEs are avoided by (i) using
the correspondence between the expected trajectory of reflected stochastic processes and the
solution of PDEs (given by the Feynman-Kac formula) and by (ii) using a plain vanilla Monte Carlo
integration to handle the non-local term. We evaluate the performance of the two methods on five
different PDEs arising in physics and biology. In all cases, the methods yield good results in up
to 10 dimensions with short run times. Our work extends recently developed methods to overcome the
curse of dimensionality in solving PDEs.

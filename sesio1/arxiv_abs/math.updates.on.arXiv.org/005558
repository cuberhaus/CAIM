The Covid-19 pandemic has taken millions of lives, demonstrating the tragedy and disruption of
respiratory diseases, and how difficult they can be to manage. However, there is still significant
debate in the scientific community as to which transmission pathways are most significant and how
settings and behaviour affect risk of infection, which all have implications for which mitigation
strategies are most effective. This study presents a general model to estimate the rate of viral
transfer between individuals, objects, and the air. The risk of infection to individuals in a setting
is then computed considering the behaviour and interactions of individuals between themselves
and the environment in the setting, survival times of the virus on different surface types and in
the air, and mitigating interventions (ventilation, hand disinfection, surface cleaning, etc.).
The model includes discrete events such as touch events, individuals entering/leaving the setting,
and cleaning events. We demonstrate the model capabilities on three case studies to quantify and
understand the relative risk associated with the different transmission pathways and the effectiveness
of mitigation strategies in different settings. The results show the importance of considering
all transmission pathways and their interactions, with each scenario displaying different dominant
pathways depending on the setting and behaviours of individuals therein. The flexible model, which
is freely available, can be used to quickly simulate the spread of any respiratory virus via the modelled
transmission pathways and the efficacy of potential mitigation strategies in any enclosed setting
by making reasonable assumptions regarding the behaviour of its occupants. It is hoped that the
model can be used to inform sensible decision-making regarding viral infection mitigations that
are targeted to specific settings and pathogens.

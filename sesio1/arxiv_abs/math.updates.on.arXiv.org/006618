Partial Integral Equations (PIEs) are an alternative way to model systems governed by Partial Differential
Equations (PDEs). PIEs have certain advantages over PDEs in that they are defined by integral (not
differential) operators and do not include boundary conditions or continuity constraints on the
solution -- a convenience when computing system properties, designing controllers, or performing
simulation. In prior work, PIE representations were proposed for a limited class of $2^{nd}$-order
PDEs in a single spatial variable. In this paper, we extend the PIE representation to a more general
class of PDE systems including, e.g., higher-order spatial derivatives ($N^{th}$-order), PDEs
with inputs and outputs, PDEs coupled with ODEs, PDEs with distributed input and boundary effects,
and boundary conditions which combine boundary values with inputs and integrals of the state. These
extensions are presented in a unified way by first proposing a unified parameterization of PDE systems,
which we refer to as a Generalized PDE (GPDE). Given a PDE system in GPDE form, we next propose formulae
that takes the GPDE parameters and constructs the Partial Integral (PI) operators that are used
to define a PIE system. This formula includes a unitary (and hence invertible) map that converts
solutions of the PIE to solutions of the GPDE. This unitary map is then used to show that the original
GPDE and PIE have equivalent system properties, including well-posedness and stability. These
representations, conversions, and mappings are illustrated through several diverse examples,
including beams, mixing problems, entropy modeling, wave equations, etc. Finally, we illustrate
the significance of the PIE representation by solving analysis, simulation, and control problems
for several representative PDE systems.

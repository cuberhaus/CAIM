The classical Fourier Analysis has been developed in an almost unbelieved way from the first fundamental
discoveries by name Fourier. Especially a number of wonderful results have been proved and new directions
of such research has been developed e.g. concerning Wavelets Theory, Gabor theory, Time-Frequency
Analysis, Fast Fourier Transform, Abstract Harmonic Analysis, etc. One important reason for this
is that this development is not only important for improving the "State of the art", but also for its
importance in other areas of mathematics and also for several applications (e.g. theory of signal
transmission, multiplexing, filtering, image enhancement, coding theory, digital signal processing
and pattern recognition). The classical theory of Fourier series deals with decomposition of a
function into sinusoidal waves. Unlike these continuous waves the Vilenkin (Walsh) functions
are rectangular waves. The development of the theory of Vilenkin-Fourier series has been strongly
influenced by the classical theory of trigonometric series. Because of this it is inevitable to
compare results of Vilenkin series to those on trigonometric series. There are many similarities
between these theories, but there exist differences also. Much of these can be explained by modern
abstract harmonic analysis, which studies orthonormal systems from the point of view of the structure
of a topological group. The aim of my master thesis is to discuss, develop and apply the newest developments
of this fascinating theory connected to modern harmonic analysis. In particular, we investigate
$T$ means but only in the case when their coefficients are monotone and prove convergence in Lebesgue
and Vilenkin-Lebesgue points. Since almost everywhere points are Lebesgue and Vilenkin-Lebesgue
points for any integrable functions we obtain almost everywhere convergence of such summability
methods.

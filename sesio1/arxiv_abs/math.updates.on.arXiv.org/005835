The interplay between 1D traveling pulses with oscillatory tails (TPO) and heterogeneities of
bump type is studied for a generalized three-component FitzHugh-Nagumo equation. First, we present
that stationary pulses with oscillatory tails (SPO) form a ``snaky'' structure in homogeneous
spaces, after which TPO branches form a ``figure-eight-like stack of isolas'' located adjacent
to the snaky structure of SPO. Herein, we adopted input resources as a bifurcation parameter. A drift
bifurcation from SPO to TPO was observed by introducing another parameter at which these two solution
sheets merged. In contrast to the monotone tail case, a nonlocal interaction appeared in the heterogeneous
problem between the TPO and heterogeneity, which created infinitely many saddle solutions and
finitely many stable stationary solutions distributed across the entire line. TPO displayed a
variety of dynamics including pinning and depinning processes along with penetration (PEN) and
rebound (REB). The stable/unstable manifolds of these saddles interacted with the TPO in a complex
manner, which created a subtle dependence on the initial condition, and a difficulty to predict
the behavior after collision. A systematic global exploration of solution branches induced by
heterogeneities enabled us to find all the asymptotic states after collision to predict the solution
results without solving the PDEs. The reduction method of finite-dimensional ODE system allowed
us to clarify the detailed mechanism of the transitions from PEN to pinning and pinning to REB based
on a dynamical system perspective. Consequently, the basin boundary between two distinct outputs
against the heterogeneities yielded an infinitely many successive reconnection of heteroclinic
orbits among those saddles, because the strength of heterogeneity increased and caused the aforementioned
subtle dependence of initial condition.

Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, $n\geq 2$, be a bounded open and connected set satisfying
the corkscrew condition. Assume also that its boundary $\partial \Omega$ is uniformly $n$-rectifiable
and its measure theoretic boundary agrees with its topological boundary up to a set of $n$-dimensional
Hausdorff measure zero. In this paper we study the equivalence between the solvability of $(D_{p'})$,
the Dirichlet problem for the Laplacian with boundary data in $L^{p'}(\partial \Omega)$, and $(R_{p})$
(resp. $(\tilde R_{p})$), the regularity problem for the Laplacian with boundary data in the Hajlasz
Sobolev space $W^{1,p}(\partial \Omega)$ (resp. $\tilde W^{1,p}(\partial \Omega)$, the usual
Sobolev space in terms of the tangential derivative), where $p \in (1,2+\varepsilon)$ and $1/p+1/p'=1$.
In particular, we show that if $(D_{p'})$ is solvable then so is $(R_{p})$, while in the opposite
direction, solvability of $(\tilde R_{p})$ implies solvability of $(D_{p})$. Under additional
geometric assumptions (two-sided local John condition or weak Poincare inequality on the boundary),
we show that $(D_{p'}) \Rightarrow (\tilde R_{p})$ and $(R_{p})\Rightarrow (D_{p})$. In particular,
our results show that in chord-arc domains (resp. two-sided chord-arc domains), there exists $p_0
\in (1,2+\varepsilon)$ so that $(R_{p_0})$ (resp. $(\tilde R_{p_0})$) is solvable. We also extend
the results to unbounded domains with compact boundary and show that in two-sided corkscrew domains
with $n$-Ahlfors-David regular boundaries, the single layer potential operator is invertible
from $L^p(\partial\Omega)$ to the inhomogeneous Sobolev space $W^{1,p}(\partial\Omega)$.
Finally, we provide a counterexample of a chord-arc domain $\Omega_0 \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$,
$n \geq 3$, so that $(\tilde R_p)$ is not solvable for any $p\in [1, \infty)$.

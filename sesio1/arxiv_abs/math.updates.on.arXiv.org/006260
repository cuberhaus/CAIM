For unipolar hydrodynamic model of semiconductor device represented by Euler-Poisson equations,
when the doping profile is supersonic, the existence of steady transonic shock solutions and C-smooth
steady transonic solutions for Euler-Poisson Equations were established in [27] and [41], respectively.
In this paper we further study the nonlinear structural stability and the linear dynamic instability
of these steady transonic solutions. When the C^1-smooth transonic steady-states pass through
the sonic line, they produce singularities for the system, and cause some essential difficulty
in the proof of structural stability. For any relaxation time, by means of elaborate singularity
analysis, we first investigate the structural stability of the C^1-smooth transonic steady-states,
once the perturbations of the initial data and the doping profiles are small enough. Moreover, when
the relaxation time is large enough, under the condition that the electric field is positive at the
shock location, we prove that the transonic shock steady-states are structurally stable with respect
to small perturbations of the supersonic doping profile. Furthermore, we show the linearly dynamic
instability for these transonic shock steady-states provided that the electric field is suitable
negative. The proofs for the structural stability results are based on singularity analysis, a
monotonicity argument on the shock position and the downstream density, and the stability analysis
of supersonic and subsonic solutions. The linear dynamic instability of the steady transonic shock
for Euler-Poisson equations can be transformed to the ill-posedness of a free boundary problem
for the Klein-Gordon equation. By using a nontrivial transformation and the shooting method, we
prove that the linearized problem has a transonic shock solution with exponential growths. These
results enrich and develop the existing studies.

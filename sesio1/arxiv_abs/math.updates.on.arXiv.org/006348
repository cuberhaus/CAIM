The Johnson--Kadison--Ringrose theorem states that the Aron--Berner extension of a multilinear
map from $C^*$-algebras to second dual spaces is unique and separately weak$^*$-weak$^*$-continuous.
We show that every positive multilinear map between $C^*$-algebras is jointly weak$^*$-weak$^*$-continuous.
Utilizing this fact, we obtain joint weak$^*$-weak$^*$-continuity of the Aron--Berner extension
in the case of positive maps.This result allows us to prove that every tracial positive multilinear
map and every tracial completely positive (not necessarily linear or multilinear) map $\Phi$ between
$C^*$-algebras, enjoy a decomposition $\Phi=\varphi_2 \circ \varphi_1$, in which $\varphi_1$
is a tracial positive linear map with the commutative range and $\varphi_2$ is a tracial completely
positive map with commutative domain. As a first result, tracial positive multilinear maps are
completely positive. As an application, we investigate the generalized variance and covariance
in quantum mechanics via arbitrary positive maps. Among others, an uncertainty relation type inequality
for commuting observables in a composite physical system has been presented: if $ \Phi: \mathscr{A}\bigotimes
\mathscr{B} \to \mathscr{C}$ is a unital positive linear map between unital $C^*$-algebras and
$A\otimes I_\mathscr{B}$ and $ I_ \mathscr{A} \otimes B$ are compatible observables in the composite
system, then \[ {\rm Var}_\Phi(A\otimes I_\mathscr{B}) {\rm Var}_\Phi(I_\mathscr{A}\otimes
B) \geq \frac{1}{16} \frac{ \left|\Phi([{\textbf{A}}, {\textbf{C}}]) \Phi([{\textbf{B}},{\textbf{D}}])\right|^2}{(\|C-\alpha
I_\mathscr{A}\| \|D-\beta I_\mathscr{B}\|)^2 }\] for all self-adjoint elements $ C\in \mathscr{A}$
and $D\in\mathscr{B}$ and every $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{C}$ with nonzero $ \|C-\alpha I_\mathscr{A}\|$
and $\|D-\beta I_\mathscr{B}\|$.

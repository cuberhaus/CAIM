We establish the local existence and uniqueness of multi-dimensional contact discontinuities
for the ideal compressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in Sobolev spaces, which are most typical
interfacial waves for astrophysical plasmas and prototypical fundamental waves for hyperbolic
systems of conservation laws. Such waves are characteristic discontinuities for which there is
no flow across the discontinuity surface while the magnetic field crosses transversely, which
lead to a two-phase free boundary problem where the pressure, velocity and magnetic field are continuous
across the interface whereas the entropy and density may have jumps. To overcome the difficulties
of possible nonlinear Rayleigh--Taylor instability and loss of derivatives, here we use crucially
the Lagrangian formulation and Cauchy's celebrated integral (1815) for the magnetic field. These
motivate us to define two special good unknowns; one enables us to capture the boundary regularizing
effect of the transversal magnetic field on the flow map, and the other one allows us to get around
the troublesome boundary integrals due to the transversality of the magnetic field. In particular,
our result removes the additional assumption of the Rayleigh--Taylor sign condition required
by Morando, Tarkhinin and Trebeschi (\emph{J. Differential Equations} \textbf{258} (2015),
no. 7, 2531--2571; \emph{Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal.} \textbf{228} (2018), no. 2, 697--742) and
holds for both 2D and 3D and hence gives a complete answer to the two open questions raised therein.
Moreover, there is {\it no loss of derivatives} in our well-posedness theory. The solution is constructed
as {\it the inviscid limit} of solutions to some suitably-chosen nonlinear approximate problems
for the two-phase compressible viscous non-resistive MHD.

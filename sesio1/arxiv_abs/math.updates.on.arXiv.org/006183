Katz and Sarnak conjectured a correspondence between the $n$-level density statistics of zeros
from families of $L$-functions with eigenvalues from random matrix ensembles. In many cases the
sums of smooth test functions, whose Fourier transforms are finitely supported, over scaled zeros
in a family converge to an integral of the test function against a density $W_{n, G}$ depending on
the symmetry $G$ of the family (unitary, symplectic or orthogonal). This integral bounds the average
order of vanishing at the central point of the corresponding family of $L$-functions. We can obtain
better estimates on this vanishing by finding better test functions to minimize the integral. We
pursue this problem when $n=2$, minimizing \[ \frac{1}{\Phi(0, 0)} \int_{{\mathbb R}^2} W_{2,G}
(x, y) \Phi(x, y) dx dy \] over test functions $\Phi \colon {\mathbb R}^2 \to [0, \infty)$ with compactly
supported Fourier transform. We study a restricted version of this optimization problem, imposing
that our test functions take the form $\phi(x) \psi(y)$ for some fixed admissible $\psi(y)$ and
$\mathrm{supp}({\widehat \phi}) \subseteq [-1, 1]$. Extending results from the $1$-level case,
namely the functional analytic arguments of Iwaniec, Luo and Sarnak and the differential equations
method introduced by Freeman and Miller, we explicitly solve for the optimal $\phi$ for appropriately
chosen fixed test function $\psi$. The solution allows us to deduce strong estimates for the proportion
of newforms of rank $0$ or $2$ in the case of $\mathrm{SO}(\mathrm{even})$, rank $1$ or $3$ in the
case of $\mathrm{SO}(\mathrm{odd})$, and rank at most $2$ for $\mathrm{O}$, $\mathrm{Sp}$, and
$\mathrm{U}$; our estimates are a significant strengthening of the best known estimates obtained
with the $1$-level density. We conclude by discussing further improvements on estimates by the
method of iteration.

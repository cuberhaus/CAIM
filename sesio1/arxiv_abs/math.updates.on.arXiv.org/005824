After a general introduction about the regularization by noise phenomenon in the degenerate setting,
the first part of this PhD thesis focuses at establishing the Schauder estimates, a useful analytical
tool to prove also the well-posedness of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), for two different
classes of Kolmogorov equations under a weak H\"ormander-like condition, whose coefficients
lie in suitable anisotropic H\"older spaces with multi-indices of regularity. The first class
considers a nonlinear system controlled by a symmetric stable operator acting only on some components.
Our method of proof relies on a perturbative approach based on forward parametrix expansions through
Duhamel-type formulas. Due to the low regularizing properties given by the degenerate setting,
we also exploit some controls on Besov norms, in order to deal with the non-linear perturbation.
As an extension of the first one, we also present Schauder estimates associated with a degenerate
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator driven by a larger class of stable-like operators, like the relativistic
or the Lamperti stable one. Exploiting a backward parametrix approach, the second part of this work
aims at establishing the weak well-posedness for a degenerate chain of SDEs driven by the same class
of stable-like processes, under the assumptions of the minimal H\"older regularity on the coefficients.
As a by-product of our method, we also present Krylov-type estimates of independent interest for
the associated canonical process. Finally, we show through suitable counter-examples the existence
of an (almost) sharp threshold on the regularity exponents ensuring the weak well-posedness for
the SDE. In connection with some possible applications to kinetic dynamics with friction, we conclude
by investigating the stability of second-order perturbations for degenerate Kolmogorov operators
in Lp and H\"older norms.

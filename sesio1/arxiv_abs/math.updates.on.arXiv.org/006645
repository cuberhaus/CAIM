We prove the existence of global in time, finite energy, weak solutions to a quantum magnetohydrodynamic
system (QMHD) with large data, modeling a charged quantum fluid interacting with a self-generated
electromagnetic field. The analysis of QMHD relies upon the use of Madelung transformations. The
rigorous derivation requires non-trivial smoothing estimates, which are obtained by assuming
slightly higher regularity for the electromagnetic potential. These assumptions are motivated
by the nonlinear dependence of the hydrodynamic system in terms of the underlying wave function
dynamics, which is supercritical with respect to the bare energy bounds. Due to quantum effects
on the dispersive properties of QMHD, our approach requires neither smallness nor high regularity,
unlike a large amount of existing literature for Euler-Maxwell's classical system. For quantum
MHD system the irrotationality and the presence of a highly nonlinear quantum stress tensor induce
much stronger dispersive properties, as a byproduct of a close relationship with the classical
Maxwell-Schr\"odinger system. Therefore the core argument is shifted to the analysis of the nonlinearities
related to the formulation of the hydrodynamic variables through the Madelung transformations.
The analysis carried out in section 4 shows that it is necessary to go through non-trivial smoothing
estimates and these require us to assume regularity conditions, just above the energy norms, for
the initial data of the Maxwellian electromagnetic potential. In the same regime of regularity,
with the help of suitable local smoothing estimates, we also prove stability of both the hydrodynamic
variables and the Lorentz force associated with the electromagnetic field. (Abbreviated version,

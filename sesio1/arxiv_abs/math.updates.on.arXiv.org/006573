Fix a unital $C^*$-algebra $\mathcal{A}$. If $f : \mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{C}$ is a continuous function,
then we write $f_{\mathcal{A}} : \mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{sa}}\to\mathcal{A}$ for the operator
function $a \mapsto f(a)$ defined via functional calculus. In this paper, we introduce and study
a space $NC^k(\mathbb{R})$ of $C^k$ functions $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{C}$ such that, no matter
the choice of $\mathcal{A}$, the operator function $f_{\mathcal{A}} : \mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{sa}}\to\mathcal{A}$
is $k$-times continuously Fr\'{e}chet differentiable. In other words, if $f \in NC^k(\mathbb{R})$,
then $f$ "lifts" to a $C^k$ map $f_{\mathcal{A}} : \mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{sa}} \to \mathcal{A}$,
for any (possibly noncommutative) unital $C^*$-algebra $\mathcal{A}$. For this reason, we call
$NC^k(\mathbb{R})$ the space of noncommutative $C^k$ functions. Our proof that $f_{\mathcal{A}}
\in C^k(\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{sa}};\mathcal{A})$, which requires only knowledge of the Fr\'{e}chet
derivatives of polynomials and operator norm estimates for "multiple operator integrals" (MOIs),
is more elementary than the standard approach; nevertheless, $NC^k(\mathbb{R})$ contains all
functions for which comparable results are known. Specifically, we prove that $NC^k(\mathbb{R})$
contains the homogeneous Besov space $\dot{B}_1^{k,\infty}(\mathbb{R})$ and the H\"{o}lder
space $C_{loc}^{k,\varepsilon}(\mathbb{R})$. We highlight, however, that the results in this
paper are the first of their type to be proven for arbitrary unital $C^*$-algebras, and that the extension
to such a general setting makes use of the author's recent resolution of certain "separability issues"
with the definition of MOIs. Finally, we prove by exhibiting specific examples that $W_k(\mathbb{R})_{loc}
\subsetneq NC^k(\mathbb{R}) \subsetneq C^k(\mathbb{R})$, where $W_k(\mathbb{R})_{loc}$
is the "localized" $k^{\text{th}}$ Wiener space.

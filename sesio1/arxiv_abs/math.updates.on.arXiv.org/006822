Motivated by emerging applications in online matching platforms and marketplaces, we study a matching
queue. Customers and servers that arrive into a matching queue depart as soon as they are matched.
It is known that a state-dependent control is needed to ensure the stability of a matching queue.
However, analytically studying the steady-state behaviour of a matching queue, in general, is
challenging. Therefore, inspired by the heavy-traffic regime in classical queueing theory, we
study a matching queue in an asymptotic regime where the state-dependent control decreases to zero.
It turns out that there are two different ways the control can be sent to zero, and we model these using
two parameters viz., $\epsilon$ is the magnitude scaling parameter that goes to zero and $\tau$
is the time scaling parameter that goes to infinity. Intuitively, $\epsilon$ scales the magnitude
of the state-dependent control, and $\tau$ is the threshold after which we modulate the control.
We show that depending on the relative rates of $\epsilon$ and $\tau$, there is a phase transition
in the limiting regime. We christen the regime when $\epsilon \tau \to 0$, the time dominates magnitude
(TDM) regime, and the limiting behaviour is a Laplace distribution. The phase transition starts
in the regime when, $\epsilon \tau $ goes to a nonzero constant when the limiting distribution is
a Gibbs distribution, and so we call it the hybrid regime. When $\epsilon \tau \to \infty$, the limiting
distribution converges to a uniform distribution and we call this the magnitude dominates time
(MDT) regime. These results are established using two related proof techniques. Both the proof
techniques generalizes the characteristic function method. The first one exploits the underlying
structure by engineering complex exponential Lyapunov functions, and the second is a novel inverse
Fourier transform method.

We consider the spatially inhomogeneous Moran model with seed-banks introduced in den Hollander
and Nandan (2021). Populations comprising $active$ and $dormant$ individuals are structured
in colonies labelled by $\mathbb{Z}^d,~d\geq 1$. The population sizes are drawn from an ergodic,
translation-invariant, uniformly elliptic field that form a random environment. Individuals
carry one of two types: $\heartsuit$, $\spadesuit$. Dormant individual resides in what is called
a seed-bank. Active individuals exchange type from seed-bank of their own colony and resample type
by choosing parent from the active populations according to a symmetric migration kernel. In den
Hollander and Nandan (2021) by using a dual (an interacting coalescing particle system), we showed
that the spatial system exhibits a dichotomy between $clustering$ (mono-type equilibrium) and
$coexistence$ (multi-type equilibrium). In this paper we identify the domain of attraction for
each mono-type equilibrium in clustering regime for a $fixed$ environment. We also show that when
the migration kernel is $recurrent$, for a.e. realization of the environment, the system with an
initially $consistent$ type distribution converges weakly to a mono-type equilibrium in which
the fixation probability to type-$\heartsuit$ configuration does not depend on the environment.
A formula for the fixation probability is given in terms of an annealed average of type-$\heartsuit$
densities in dormant and active population biased by ratio of the two population sizes at the target
colony. For the proofs, we use duality and environment seen by particle introduced in Dolgopyat
and Goldshield (2019) for RWRE on a strip. A spectral analysis of Markov operator yields quenched
weak convergence of the environment process associated with single-particle dual to a reversible
ergodic distribution which we transfer to the spatial system by using duality.

We construct a canonical differential structure on the configuration space $\boldsymbol\Upsilon$
over a singular base space $X$ and with a general invariant measure $\mu$ on $\boldsymbol\Upsilon$.
We present an analytic structure on $\boldsymbol\Upsilon$, constructing a strongly local Dirichlet
form $\mathcal E$ on $L^2(\boldsymbol\Upsilon, \mu)$ for $\mu$ in a large class of probability
measures. We then investigate the geometric structure of the extended metric measure space $\boldsymbol\Upsilon$
endowed with the $L^2$-transportation extended distance $\mathsf{d}_{\boldsymbol\Upsilon}$
and with the measure $\mu$. By establishing Rademacher- and Sobolev-to-Lipschitz-type properties
for $\mathcal E$, we finally provide a complete identification of the analytic and the geometric
structure -- the canonical differential structure induced on $\boldsymbol\Upsilon$ by $X$ and
$\mu$ -- showing that $\mathcal E$ coincides with the Cheeger energy of $(\boldsymbol\Upsilon,\mathsf{d}_{\boldsymbol\Upsilon},\mu)$
and that the intrinsic distance of $\mathcal E$ coincides with $\mathsf{d}_{\boldsymbol\Upsilon}$.
The class of base spaces to which our results apply includes sub-Riemannian manifolds, RCD spaces,
and path/loop spaces over Riemannian manifolds; as for $\mu$ our results include quasi-Gibbs measures,
in particular: Poisson measures, canonical Gibbs measures, as well as some determinantal/permanental
point processes (sine$_\beta$, Airy$_\beta$, Bessel$_{\alpha,\beta}$, Ginibre). A number
of applications to interacting particle systems and infinite-dimensional metric measure geometry
are also discussed. In particular, we prove the universality of the $L^2$-transportation distance
$\mathsf{d}_{\boldsymbol\Upsilon}$ for the Varadhan short-time asymptotics for diffusions
on $\boldsymbol\Upsilon$, regardless of the choice of $\mu$. Many of our results are new even in
the case of Euclidean spaces.

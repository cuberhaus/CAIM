Boolean valued models for a signature $\mathcal{L}$ are generalizations of $\mathcal{L}$-structures
in which we allow the $\mathcal{L}$-relation symbols to be interpreted by boolean truth values.
For example, for elements $a,b\in\mathcal{M}$ with $\mathcal{M}$ a $\mathsf{B}$-valued $\mathcal{L}$-structure
for some boolean algebra $\mathsf{B}$, $(a=b)$ may be neither true nor false, but get an intermediate
truth value in $\mathsf{B}$. In this paper we introduce a topological characterization of the sheafification
process for presheaves on topological spaces induced by the dense Grothendieck topology. On the
way to produce our characterization, we also relate the notion of open continuous mapping between
topological spaces to that of complete homomorphism between complete boolean algebras, and to
that of adjoint homomorphism between boolean algebras (e.g. an homomorphism which has a left adjoint,
if seen as a functor between partial orders/categories). Next we link these topological/category
theoretic results to the theory of boolean valued models. We give a different proof of a result by
Monro identifying topological presheaves on Stone spaces with boolean valued models, and sheaves
(according to the dense Grothendieck topology) with boolean valued models having the mixing property.
We also give an exact topological characterization (the so called fullness property) of which boolean
valued models satisfy Lo\'s Theorem (i.e. the general form of the Forcing Theorem which Cohen --
Scott, Solovay, Vopenka -- established for the special case given by the forcing method in set theory).
Then we separate the fullness property from the mixing property, by showing that the latter is strictly
stronger. Finally we give an exact categorical characterization of which presheaves correspond
to full boolean valued models in terms of the structure of global sections of their associated \'etal\'e
space

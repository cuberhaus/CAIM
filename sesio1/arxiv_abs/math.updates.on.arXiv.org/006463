Generalized scattering amplitudes $m^{(k)}_n$, discovered by Cachazo, Early, Guevara and Mizera
(CEGM), form a symmetric hierarchy which is essentially recursive in nature. In the Generalized
Feynman Diagrams framework, $m^{(k)}_n$ becomes an \textit{interpolation} of $n$ copies of $m^{(k-1)}_{n-1}$
which can be reconstituted from compatible combinatorial data on the facets of the hypersimplex
$\Delta_{k,n}$. The interpolation, solved by CEGM generalized amplitudes, is tightly constrained:
the combinatorial data on the $n$ facets of $\Delta_{k,n}$ must extend into its interior to a particular
kind of subdivision that is matroidal and \textit{regular}: the internal faces of the subdivision
should be projections of the bends of a piecewise linear surface over $\Delta_{k,n}$. Numerous
physical and combinatorial questions have been raised; one of these was to determine if and how the
standard biadjoint scalar amplitude $m^{(2)}_n$ itself exists systematically "inside" $m^{(k)}_n$.
In this paper we find an entire forest of identifications of $m^{(2)}_n$ with multi-dimensional
residues of $m^{(3)}_n$, where the kinematic space for each $m^{(2)}_n$ maps into a twisted chart
in the bulk kinematic space. We find $n\cdot C^{(2)}_{n-5}$ such identifications, where $C^{(2)}_p$
are the Catalan numbers. We show that after a suitable one-parameter deformation which we call a
\textit{parallel hard limit}, these residues aggregate to produce $n$ distinct, cyclically permuted
copies of a product $m^{(2)}_n \cdot m^{(2)}_{n-3}$. We propose a generalization which would give
rise to identifications of $m^{(2)}_n$ inside $m^{(k)}_n$ for $k\ge 4$, via $(k-2)(n-k-2)$-dimensional
residues. Our proof for $k=3$ uses the CEGM formula for $m^{(3)}_n$; it predicts a new Minkowski
sum realization of the associahedron in terms of certain positroid polytopes in the second hypersimplex
$\Delta_{2,n}$.

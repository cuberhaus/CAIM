We propose the first general and scalable framework to design certifiable algorithms for robust
geometric perception in the presence of outliers. Our first contribution is to show that estimation
using common robust costs, such as truncated least squares (TLS), maximum consensus, Geman-McClure,
Tukey's biweight, among others, can be reformulated as polynomial optimization problems (POPs).
By focusing on the TLS cost, our second contribution is to exploit sparsity in the POP and propose
a sparse semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation that is much smaller than the standard Lasserre's
hierarchy while preserving empirical exactness, i.e., the SDP recovers the optimizer of the nonconvex
POP with an optimality certificate. Our third contribution is to solve the SDP relaxations at an
unprecedented scale and accuracy by presenting STRIDE, a solver that blends global descent on the
convex SDP with fast local search on the nonconvex POP. Our fourth contribution is an evaluation
of the proposed framework on six geometric perception problems including single and multiple rotation
averaging, point cloud and mesh registration, absolute pose estimation, and category-level object
pose and shape estimation. Our experiments demonstrate that (i) our sparse SDP relaxation is empirically
exact with up to 60%-90% outliers across applications; (ii) while still being far from real-time,
STRIDE is up to 100 times faster than existing SDP solvers on medium-scale problems, and is the only
solver that can solve large-scale SDPs with hundreds of thousands of constraints to high accuracy;
(iii) STRIDE safeguards existing fast heuristics for robust estimation (e.g., RANSAC or Graduated
Non-Convexity), i.e., it certifies global optimality if the heuristic estimates are optimal,
or detects and allows escaping local optima when the heuristic estimates are suboptimal.

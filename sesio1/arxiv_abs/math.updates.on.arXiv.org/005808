Effective properties of materials with random heterogeneous structures are typically determined
by homogenising the mechanical quantity of interest in a window of observation. The entire problem
setting encompasses the solution of a local PDE and some averaging formula for the quantity of interest
in such domain. There are relatively standard methods in the literature to completely determine
the formulation except for two choices: i) the local domain itself and the ii) boundary conditions.
Hence, the modelling errors are governed by the quality of these two choices. The choice i) relates
to the degree of representativeness of a microscale sample, i.e., it is essentially a statistical
characteristic. Naturally, its reliability is higher as the size of the observation window becomes
larger and/or the number of samples increases. On the other hand, excepting few special cases there
is no automatic guideline to handle ii). Although it is known that the overall effect of boundary
condition becomes less important with the size of the microscale domain, the computational cost
to simulate such large problem several times might be prohibitive even for relatively small accuracy
requirements. Here we introduce a machine learning procedure to select most suitable boundary
conditions for multiscale problems, particularly those arising in solid mechanics. We propose
the combination Reduced-Order Models and Deep Neural Networks in an offline phase, whilst the online
phase consists in the very same homogenisation procedure plus one (cheap) evaluation of the trained
model for boundary conditions. Hence, the method allows an implementation with minimal changes
in existing codes and the use of relatively small domains without losing accuracy, which reduces
the computational cost by several orders of magnitude.

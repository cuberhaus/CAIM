A cohesive power of a computable structure is an effective ultrapower of the structure, where a cohesive
set plays the role of an ultrafilter. Let $\omega$, $\zeta$, and $\eta$ denote the respective order-types
of the natural numbers, the integers, and the rationals. We study cohesive powers of computable
copies of $\omega$ over $\Delta_2$ cohesive sets. We show that there is a computable copy $\mathcal{L}$
of $\omega$ such that, for every $\Delta_2$ cohesive set $C$, the cohesive power of $\mathcal{L}$
over $C$ has order-type $\omega + \eta$. This improves an earlier result of Dimitrov, Harizanov,
Morozov, Shafer, A. Soskova, and Vatev by generalizing from $\Sigma_1$ cohesive sets to $\Delta_2$
cohesive sets and by computing a single copy of $\omega$ that has the desired cohesive power over
all $\Delta_2$ cohesive sets. Furthermore, our result is optimal in the sense that $\Delta_2$ cannot
be replaced by $\Pi_2$. More generally, we show that if $X \subseteq \mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$
is a Boolean combination of $\Sigma_2$ sets, thought of as a set of finite order-types, then there
is a computable copy $\mathcal{L}$ of $\omega$ where the cohesive power of $\mathcal{L}$ over any
$\Delta_2$ cohesive set has order-type $\omega + \sigma(X \cup \{\omega + \zeta\eta + \omega^*\})$.
Moreover, if $X$ is finite and non-empty, then there is also a computable copy $\mathcal{L}$ of $\omega$
where the cohesive power of $\mathcal{L}$ over any $\Delta_2$ cohesive set has order-type $\omega
+ \sigma(X)$. Here $\sigma$ denotes the shuffle operation. An unexpected corollary of our work
is the existence of an infinite $\Pi_1$ set that has no $\Delta_2$ cohesive subset. This result generalizes
D. Martin's well-known result that there is a co-infinite c.e. set with no maximal superset, and
it is also optimal in that $\Delta_2$ cannot be replaced by $\Pi_2$.

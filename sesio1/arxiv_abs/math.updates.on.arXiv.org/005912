Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a kind of medical imaging technology used for diagnostic imaging
of diseases, but its image quality may be suffered by the long acquisition time. The compressive
sensing (CS) based strategy may decrease the reconstruction time greatly, but it needs efficient
reconstruction algorithms to produce high-quality and reliable images. This paper focuses on
the algorithmic improvement for the sparse reconstruction of CS-MRI, especially considering
a non-smooth convex minimization problem which is composed of the sum of a total variation regularization
term and a $\ell_1$-norm term of the wavelet transformation. The partly motivation of targeting
the dual problem is that the dual variables are involved in relatively low-dimensional subspace.
Instead of solving the primal model as usual, we turn our attention to its associated dual model composed
of three variable blocks and two separable non-smooth function blocks. However, the directly extended
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) must be avoided because it may be divergent,
although it usually performs well numerically. In order to solve the problem, we employ a symmetric
Gauss-Seidel (sGS) technique based ADMM. Compared with the directly extended ADMM, this method
only needs one additional iteration, but its convergence can be guaranteed theoretically. Besides,
we also propose a generalized variant of ADMM because this method has been illustrated to be efficient
for solving semidefinite programming in the past few years. Finally, we do extensive experiments
on MRI reconstruction using some simulated and real MRI images under different sampling patterns
and ratios. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms significantly achieve
high reconstruction accuracies with fast computational speed.

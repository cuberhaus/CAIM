In the last decade, major efforts have been made to promote inquiry-based mathematics learning
at the tertiary level. The Inquiry-Based Mathematics Education (IBME) movement has gained strong
momentum among some mathematicians, attracting substantial funding, including from some US government
agencies. This resulted in the successful mobilization of regional consortia in many states, uniting
over 800 mathematics education practitioners working to reform undergraduate education. Inquiry-based
learning is characterized by the fundamental premise that learners should be allowed to learn 'new
to them' mathematics without being taught. This progressive idea is based on the assumption that
it is best to advance learners to the level of experts by engaging learners in mathematical practices
similar to those of practising mathematicians: creating new definitions, conjectures and proofs
- that way learners are thought to develop 'deep mathematical understanding'. However, concerted
efforts to radically reform mathematics education must be systematically scrutinized in view
of available evidence and theoretical advances in the learning sciences. To that end, this scoping
review sought to consolidate the extant research literature from cognitive science and educational
psychology, offering a critical commentary on the effectiveness of inquiry-based learning. Our
analysis of research articles and books pertaining to the topic revealed that the call for a major
reform by the IBME advocates is not justified. Specifically, the general claim that students would
learn better (and acquire superior conceptual understanding) if they were not taught is not supported
by evidence. Neither is the general claim about the merits of IBME for addressing equity issues in
mathematics classrooms.

The Hilbert scheme of points $\mathrm{Hilb}^n(S)$ of a smooth surface $S$ is a well-studied parameter
space, lying at the interface of algebraic geometry, commutative algebra, representation theory,
combinatorics, and mathematical physics. The foundational result is a classical theorem of Fogarty,
stating that $\mathrm{Hilb}^n(S)$ is a smooth variety of dimension $2n$. In recent years there
has been growing interest in a natural generalization of $\mathrm{Hilb}^n(S)$, the nested Hilbert
schemes $\mathrm{Hilb}^{(n_1,n_2)}(S)$, which parametrize nested pairs of zero-dimensional
subschemes $Z_1 \supseteq Z_2$ of $S$ with $\mathrm{deg} (Z_i)=n_i$. In contrast to Fogarty's
theorem, $\mathrm{Hilb}^{(n_1,n_2)}(S)$ is almost always singular, and very little is known
about its singularities. In this paper we aim to advance the knowledge of the geometry of these nested
Hilbert schemes. Work by Fogarty in the 70's shows that $\mathrm{Hilb}^{(n,1)}(S)$ is a normal
Cohen-Macaulay variety, and Song more recently proved that it has rational singularities. In our
main result, we prove that the nested Hilbert scheme $\mathrm{Hilb}^{(n,2)}(S)$ has rational
singularities. We employ an array of tools from commutative algebra to prove this theorem. Using
Gr\"obner bases, we establish a connection between $\mathrm{Hilb}^{(n,2)}(S)$ and a certain
variety of matrices with an action of the general linear group. This variety of matrices plays a central
role in our work, and we analyze it by various algebraic techniques, including square-free Gr\"obner
degenerations, the Stanley-Reisner correspondence, and the Kempf-Lascoux-Weyman technique
of calculating syzygies. Along the way, we also obtain results on irreducible and reducible classes
of nested Hilbert schemes, dimension of singular loci, and $F$-singularities in positive characteristic.

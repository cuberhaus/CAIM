Humanitarian logistics service providers have two major responsibilities immediately after
a disaster: locating trapped people and routing aid to them. These difficult operations are further
hindered by failures in the transportation and telecommunications networks, which are often rendered
unusable by the disaster at hand. In this work, we propose a two-echelon vehicle routing framework
for performing these operations using aerial uncrewed autonomous vehicles (UAVs or drones) to
address the issues associated with these failures. In our proposed framework, we assume that ground
vehicles cannot reach the trapped population directly, but they can only transport drones from
a depot to some intermediate locations. The drones launched from these locations serve to both identify
demands for medical and other aids (e.g., epi-pens, medical supplies, dry food, water) and make
deliveries to satisfy them. Specifically, we present a decision framework, in which the resulting
optimization problem is formulated as a two-echelon vehicle routing problem with trucks as the
first echelon vehicles and for the second echelon vehicles, we consider two types of drones. Hotspot
drones have the capability of providing a cell phone and internet reception and hence are used to
capture demands. Delivery drones are subsequently employed to satisfy the observed demand. To
handle demand uncertainty, we decompose the decision problem into two stages: providing telecommunications
capabilities in the first stage thereby capturing demand precisely, and satisfying the resulting
demands in the second stage. To solve the resulting models, we propose efficient computational
approaches by designing a decomposition algorithm with column generation (CG)-based heuristics
to identify optimal drone routes.

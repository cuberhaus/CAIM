We define a boundary analogue of the Kang-Kashiwara-Kim-Oh generalized Schur-Weyl dualities
between quantum affine algebras and Khovanov-Lauda-Rouquier (KLR) algebras. Let $\mathfrak{g}$
be a complex simple Lie algebra and $U_qL\mathfrak{g}$ the corresponding quantum affine algebra.
We construct a functor ${}^{\theta}{\sf F}$ between finite-dimensional modules over a quantum
symmetric pair of affine type $U_q\mathfrak{k}\subset U_qL{\mathfrak{g}}$ and an orientifold
KLR ($o$KLR) algebra arising from a framed quiver with a contravariant involution, whose nodes
are indexed by finite-dimensional $U_qL{\mathfrak{g}}$-modules. With respect to the Kang-Kashiwara-Kim-Oh
construction, our combinatorial model is further enriched with the poles of the trigonometric
K-matrices (that is trigonometric solutions of a generalized reflection equation) intertwining
the action of $U_q\mathfrak{k}$ on finite-dimensional $U_qL{\mathfrak{g}}$-modules. By construction,
${}^{\theta}{\sf F}$ is naturally compatible with the Kang-Kashiwara-Kim-Oh functor in that,
while the latter is a functor of monoidal categories, ${}^{\theta}{\sf F}$ is a functor of module
categories. Relying on an isomorphism between suitable completions of $o$KLR algebras and affine
Hecke algebras of type $\sf C$, we prove that ${}^{\theta}{\sf F}$ recovers the Schur-Weyl dualities
due to Fan-Lai-Li-Luo-Wang-Watanabe in quasi-split type $\sf AIII$. Finally, we construct spectral
K-matrices for orientifold KLR algebras, yielding a meromorphic braiding on its category of finite-dimensional
representations. We prove that, in the case of the ${\sf A}_{\infty}$ quiver with no fixed points
and no framing, the functor ${}^{\theta}{\sf F}$ is exact, factors through a suitable localization,
and takes values in a boundary analogue of the Hernandez-Leclerc category.

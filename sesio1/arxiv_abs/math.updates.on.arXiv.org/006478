We explore a new way to handle flux boundary conditions imposed on level sets. The proposed approach
is a diffuse interface version of the shifted boundary method (SBM) for continuous Galerkin discretizations
of conservation laws in embedded domains. We impose the interface conditions weakly and approximate
surface integrals by volume integrals. The discretized weak form of the governing equation has
the structure of an immersed boundary finite element method. That is, integration is performed
over a fixed fictitious domain. Source terms are included to account for interface conditions and
extend the boundary data into the complement of the embedded domain. The calculation of these extra
terms requires (i) construction of an approximate delta function and (ii) extrapolation of embedded
boundary data into quadrature points. We accomplish these tasks using a level set function, which
is given analytically or evolved numerically. A globally defined averaged gradient of this approximate
signed distance function is used to construct a simple map to the closest point on the interface.
The normal and tangential derivatives of the numerical solution at that point are calculated using
the interface conditions and/or interpolation on uniform stencils. Similarly to SBM, extrapolation
back to the quadrature points is performed using Taylor expansions. The same strategy is used to
construct ghost penalty functions and extension velocities. Computations that require extrapolation
are restricted to a narrow band around the interface. Numerical results are presented for elliptic,
parabolic, and hyperbolic test problems, which are specifically designed to assess the error caused
by the numerical treatment of interface conditions on fixed and moving boundaries in 2D.

Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) are envisioned to play a key role in future wireless
communications, enabling programmable radio propagation environments. They are usually considered
as almost passive planar structures that operate as adjustable reflectors, giving rise to a multitude
of implementation challenges, including the inherent difficulty in estimating the underlying
wireless channels. In this paper, we focus on the recently conceived concept of Hybrid Reconfigurable
Intelligent Surfaces (HRISs), which do not solely reflect the impinging waveform in a controllable
fashion, but are also capable of sensing and processing an adjustable portion of it. We first present
implementation details for this metasurface architecture and propose a convenient mathematical
model for characterizing its dual operation. As an indicative application of HRISs in wireless
communications, we formulate the individual channel estimation problem for the uplink of a multi-user
HRIS-empowered communication system. Considering first a noise-free setting, we theoretically
quantify the advantage of HRISs in notably reducing the amount of pilots needed for channel estimation,
as compared to the case of purely reflective RISs. We then present closed-form expressions for the
MSE performance in estimating the individual channels at the HRISs and the base station for the noisy
model. Based on these derivations, we propose an automatic differentiation-based first-order
optimization approach to efficiently determine the HRIS phase and power splitting configurations
for minimizing the weighted sum-MSE performance. Our numerical evaluations demonstrate that
HRISs do not only enable the estimation of the individual channels in HRIS-empowered communication
systems, but also improve the ability to recover the cascaded channel, as compared to existing methods
using passive and reflective RISs.

Existing studies comparing individual-based models of growing cell populations and their continuum
counterparts have mainly focused on homogeneous populations, in which all cells have the same phenotypic
characteristics. However, significant intercellular phenotypic variability is commonly observed
in cellular systems. Therefore, we develop here an individual-based model for the growth of phenotypically
heterogeneous cell populations. In this model, the phenotypic state of each cell is described by
a structuring variable that captures intercellular variability in cell proliferation and migration
rates. The model tracks the spatial evolutionary dynamics of single cells, which undergo pressure-dependent
proliferation, heritable phenotypic changes and directional movement in response to pressure
differentials. We formally show that the continuum limit of this model comprises a non-local partial
differential equation for the cell population density, which generalises earlier models of growing
cell populations. Results of the individual-based model illustrate how proliferation-migration
tradeoffs shaping the evolution of single cells can lead to the formation of travelling waves at
the population level where highly-mobile cells locally dominate at the invasive front, while more-proliferative
cells are found at the rear. We demonstrate that there is an excellent quantitative agreement between
these results and the results of numerical simulations and formal travelling-wave analysis of
the continuum model, when sufficiently large cell numbers are considered. We provide numerical
evidence of scenarios in which the predictions of the two models may differ due to demographic stochasticity,
which cannot be captured by the continuum model. This indicates the importance of integrating individual-based
and continuum approaches when modelling the growth of phenotypically heterogeneous cell populations.

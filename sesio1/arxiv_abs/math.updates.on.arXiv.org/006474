Non-overlapping Schwarz methods with generalized Robin transmission conditions were originally
introduced by B. Despr\'es for time-harmonic wave propagation problems and have largely developed
over the past thirty years. The aim of the paper is to provide both a review of the available formulations
and methods as well as a consistent theory applicable to more general cases than studied until to
date. An abstract variational framework is provided reformulating the original problem by the
well-known form involving a scattering operator and an interface exchange operator, and the equivalence
between the formulations is discussed thoroughly. The framework applies to a series of wave propagation
problems throughout the de Rham complex, such as the scalar Helmholtz equation, Maxwell's equations,
a dual formulation of the Helmholtz equation in H(div), as well as any conforming finite element
discretization thereof, and it applies also to coercive problems. Three convergence results are
shown. The first one (using compactness) and the second one (based on absorbtion) generalize Despr\'es'
early findings and apply as well to the FETI-2LM formulation. The third result, oriented on the work
by Collino, Ghanemi, and Joly, establishes a convergence rate and covers cases with cross points,
while not requiring any regularity of the solution. The key ingredient is a global interface exchange
operator, proposed originally by X. Claeys and further developed by Claeys and Parolin, here worked
out in full generality. The third type of convergence theory is applicable at the discrete level
as well, where the exchange operator is allowed to be even local. The resulting scheme can be viewed
as a generalization of the 2-Lagrange-multiplier method introduced by S. Loisel, and connections
are drawn to another technique proposed by Gander and Santugini.

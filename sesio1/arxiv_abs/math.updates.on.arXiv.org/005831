Any scheme has its associated little and big Zariski toposes. These toposes support an internal
mathematical language which closely resembles the usual formal language of mathematics, but is
"local on the base scheme": For example, from the internal perspective, the structure sheaf looks
like an ordinary local ring (instead of a sheaf of rings with local stalks) and vector bundles look
like ordinary free modules (instead of sheaves of modules satisfying a local triviality condition).
The translation of internal statements and proofs is facilitated by an easy mechanical procedure.
We investigate how the internal language of the little Zariski topos can be exploited to give simpler
definitions and more conceptual proofs of the basic notions and observations in algebraic geometry.
To this end, we build a dictionary relating internal and external notions and demonstrate its utility
by giving a simple proof of Grothendieck's generic freeness lemma in full generality. We also employ
this framework to state a general transfer principle which relates modules with their induced quasicoherent
sheaves, to study the phenomenon that some properties spread from points to open neighborhoods,
and to compare general notions of spectra. We employ the big Zariski topos to set up the foundations
of a synthetic account of scheme theory. This account is similar to the synthetic account of differential
geometry, but has a distinct algebraic flavor. Central to the theory is the notion of synthetic quasicoherence,
which has no analogue in synthetic differential geometry. We also discuss how various common subtoposes
of the big Zariski topos can be described from the internal point of view and derive explicit descriptions
of the geometric theories which are classified by the fppf and by the surjective topology.

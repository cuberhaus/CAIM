An admissible Poisson algebra (or briefly, an adm-Poisson algebra) gives an equivalent presentation
with only one operation for a Poisson algebra. We establish a bialgebra theory for adm-Poisson algebras
independently and systematically, including but beyond the corresponding results on Poisson
bialgebras given in [27]. Explicitly, we introduce the notion of adm-Poisson bialgebras which
are equivalent to Manin triples of adm-Poisson algebras as well as Poisson bialgebras. The direct
correspondence between adm-Poisson bialgebras with one comultiplication and Poisson bialgebras
with one cocommutative and one anti-cocommutative comultiplications generalizes and illustrates
the polarization-depolarization process in the context of bialgebras. The study of a special class
of adm-Poisson bialgebras which include the known coboundary Poisson bialgebras in [27] as a proper
subclass in general, illustrating an advantage in terms of the presentation with one operation,
leads to the introduction of adm-Poisson Yang-Baxter equation in an adm-Poisson algebra. It is
an unexpected consequence that both the adm-Poisson Yang-Baxter equation and the associative
Yang-Baxter equation have the same form and thus it motivates and simplifies the involved study
from the study of the associative Yang-Baxter equation, which is another advantage in terms of the
presentation with one operation. A skew-symmetric solution of adm-Poisson Yang-Baxter equation
gives an adm-Poisson bialgebra. Finally the notions of an $\mathcal O$-operator of an adm-Poisson
algebra and a pre-adm-Poisson algebra are introduced to construct skew-symmetric solutions of
adm-Poisson Yang-Baxter equation and hence adm-Poisson bialgebras. Note that a pre-adm-Poisson
algebra gives an equivalent presentation for a pre-Poisson algebra introduced by Aguiar.

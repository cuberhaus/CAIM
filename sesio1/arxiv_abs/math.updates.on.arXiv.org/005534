In this paper, for $d\in \mathbb N$, we study the online nearest neighbor random tree in dimension
$d$ ($d$-NN tree for short) defined as follows. Fix the flat torus $\mathbb T^d_n$ of dimension $d$
and area $n$, equipped with the metric inherited from the Euclidean metric of $\mathbb R^d$. Then,
embed consecutively $n$ vertices in $\mathbb T^d_n$ uniformly at random and let each vertex but
the first one connect to its (already embedded) nearest neighbor. We show that a.a.s. the number
of vertices of degree at least $k\in \mathbb N$ in the $d$-NN tree decreases exponentially with $k$,
and we obtain en passant that the maximum degree of $G_n$ is of order $\Theta_d(\log n)$ a.a.s. Moreover,
the number of copies of any finite tree in the $d$-NN tree is shown to be a.a.s. $\Theta_d(n)$, and
all aforementioned counts are, by a general concentration lemma that we show, tightly concentrated
around their expectations. We also give explicit bounds for the number of leaves that are independent
of the dimension. Next, we show that a.a.s. the height of a uniformly chosen vertex in $\mathbb T^d_n$
is $(1+o(1))\log n$ independently of the dimension, and the diameter of $\mathbb T^d_n$ is a.a.s.
$(2e+o(1))\log n$, again, independently of the dimension. Finally, we define a natural infinite
version of a $d$-NN tree $G_{\infty}$ via a Poisson Point Process in $\mathbb{R}^d$, where the vertices
are equipped with uniform arrival times in $[0,1]$, and show that it corresponds to the local limit
of the sequence of finite graphs $(G_n)_{n \ge 1}$. Moreover, we prove that a.s. $G_{\infty}$ is
locally finite, that the simple random walk on $G_{\infty}$ is a.s. recurrent, and that a.s. $G_{\infty}$
is connected. To the best of our knowledge, ours are the first rigorous results both in the finite
and infinite setup of this model.

This work proposes a novel model and numerical formulation for lubricated contact problems describing
the mutual interaction between two deformable 3D solid bodies and an interposed fluid film. The
solid bodies are consistently described based on nonlinear continuum mechanics allowing for finite
deformations and arbitrary constitutive laws. The fluid film is modelled as a quasi-2D flow problem
on the interface between the solids governed by the averaged Reynolds equation. The averaged Reynolds
equation accounts for surface roughness utilizing spatially homogenized, effective fluid parameters
and for cavitation through a positivity constraint imposed on the pressure field. In contrast to
existing approaches, the proposed model accounts for the co-existence of frictional contact tractions
and hydrodynamic fluid tractions at every local point on the contact surface of the interacting
bodies and covers the entire range from boundary lubrication to mixed, elastohydrodynamic, and
eventually to full film hydrodynamic lubrication in one unified modelling framework with smooth
transition between these different regimes. Critically, the model relies on a recently proposed
regularization scheme for the mechanical contact constraint combining the advantages of classical
penalty and Lagrange multiplier approaches by expressing the mechanical contact pressure as a
function of the effective gap between the solid bodies while at the same time limiting the minimal
gap value occurring at the (theoretical) limit of infinitely high contact pressures. From a physical
point of view, this approach can be considered as a model for the elastic deformation of surface asperities,
with a bounded magnitude depending on the interacting solids' surface roughness. A consistent
and accurate model behavior is demonstrated and validated by employing several challenging and
practically relevant benchmark test cases.

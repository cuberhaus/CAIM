Fix a finite field $K$ of order $q$ and a word $w$ in a free group $F$ on $r$ generators. A $w$-random
element in $GL_N(K)$ is obtained by sampling $r$ independent uniformly random elements $g_1,\ldots,g_r\in
GL_N(K)$ and evaluating $w\left(g_1,\ldots,g_r\right)$. Consider $\mathbb{E}_w\left[\mathrm{fix}\right]$,
the average number of vectors in $K^{N}$ fixed by a $w$-random element. We show that $\mathbb{E}_{w}\left[\mathrm{fix}\right]$
is a rational function in $q^{N}$. Moreover, if $w=u^{d}$ with $u$ a non-power, then the limit $\lim_{N\to\infty}\mathbb{E}_{w}\left[\mathrm{fix}\right]$
depends only on $d$ and not on $u$. These two phenomena generalize to all stable characters of the
groups $\left\{ GL_N(K)\right\}_{N}$. A main feature of this work is the connection we establish
between word measures on $GL_N(K)$ and the free group algebra $K\left[F\right]$. A classical result
of Cohn [1964] and Lewin [1969] is that every one-sided ideal of $K\left[F\right]$ is a free $K\left[F\right]$-module
with a well-defined rank. We show that for $w$ a non-power, $\mathbb{E}_{w}\left[\mathrm{fix}\right]=2+\frac{C}{q^{N}}+O\left(\frac{1}{q^{2N}}\right)$,
where $C$ is the number of rank-2 right ideals $I\le K\left[F\right]$ which contain $w-1$ but not
as a basis element. We describe a full conjectural picture generalizing this result, featuring
a new invariant we call the $q$-primitivity rank of $w$. In the process, we prove several new results
about free group algebras. For example, we show that if $T$ is any finite subtree of the Cayley graph
of $F$, and $I\le K\left[F\right]$ is a right ideal with a generating set supported on $T$, then $I$
admits a basis supported on $T$. We also prove an analogue of Kaplansky's unit conjecture for certain
$K\left[F\right]$-modules.

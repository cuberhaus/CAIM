Logistic regression is one of the most fundamental methods for modeling the probability of a binary
outcome based on a collection of covariates. However, the classical formulation of logistic regression
relies on the independent sampling assumption, which is often violated when the outcomes interact
through an underlying network structure. This necessitates the development of models that can
simultaneously handle both the network peer-effect (arising from neighborhood interactions)
and the effect of high-dimensional covariates. In this paper, we develop a framework for incorporating
such dependencies in a high-dimensional logistic regression model by introducing a quadratic
interaction term, as in the Ising model, designed to capture pairwise interactions from the underlying
network. The resulting model can also be viewed as an Ising model, where the node-dependent external
fields linearly encode the high-dimensional covariates. We propose a penalized maximum pseudo-likelihood
method for estimating the network peer-effect and the effect of the covariates, which, in addition
to handling the high-dimensionality of the parameters, conveniently avoids the computational
intractability of the maximum likelihood approach. Consequently, our method is computationally
efficient and, under various standard regularity conditions, our estimate attains the classical
high-dimensional rate of consistency. In particular, our results imply that even under network
dependence it is possible to consistently estimate the model parameters at the same rate as in classical
logistic regression, when the true parameter is sparse and the underlying network is not too dense.
As a consequence of the general results, we derive the rates of consistency of our estimator for various
natural graph ensembles, such as bounded degree graphs, sparse Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graphs,
and stochastic block models.

We introduce a subalgebra $\overline F$ of the Clifford vertex superalgebra ($bc$ system) which
is completely reducible as a $L^{Vir} (-2,0)$-module, $C_2$-cofinite, but it is not conformal
and it is not isomorphic to the symplectic fermion algebra $\mathcal{SF}(1)$. We show that $\mathcal{SF}(1)$
and $\overline{F}$ are in an interesting duality, since $\overline{F}$ can be equipped with the
structure of a $\mathcal{SF}(1)$-module and vice versa. Using the decomposition of $\overline
F$ and a free-field realization from arXiv:1711.11342, we decompose $L_k(\mathfrak{osp}(1\vert
2))$ at the critical level $k=-3/2$ as a module for $L_k(\mathfrak{sl}(2))$. The decomposition
of $L_k(\mathfrak{osp}(1\vert 2))$ is exactly the same as of the $N=4$ superconformal vertex algebra
with central charge $c=-9$, denoted by $\mathcal V^{(2)}$. Using the duality between $\overline{F}$
and $\mathcal{SF}(1)$, we prove that $L_k(\mathfrak{osp}(1\vert 2))$ and $\mathcal V^{(2)}$
are in the duality of the same type. As an application, we construct and classify all irreducible
$L_k(\mathfrak{osp}(1\vert 2))$-modules in the category $\mathcal O$ and the category $\mathcal
R$ which includes relaxed highest weight modules. We also describe the structure of the parafermion
algebra $N_{-3/2}(\mathfrak{osp}(1\vert 2))$ as a $N_{-3/2}(\mathfrak{sl}(2))$-module.
We extend this example, and for each $p \ge 2$, we introduce a non-conformal vertex algebra $\mathcal
A^{(p)}_{new}$ and show that $\mathcal A^{(p)}_{new} $ is isomorphic to the doublet vertex algebra
as a module for the Virasoro algebra. We also construct the vertex algebra $ \mathcal V^{(p)} _{new}$
which is isomorphic to the logarithmic vertex algebra $\mathcal V^{(p)}$ as a module for $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(2)$.

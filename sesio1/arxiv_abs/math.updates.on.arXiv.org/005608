Caching at the wireless edge nodes is a promising way to boost the spatial and spectral efficiency,
for the sake of alleviating networks from content-related traffic. Coded caching originally introduced
by Maddah-Ali and Niesen significantly speeds up communication efficiency by transmitting multicast
messages simultaneously useful to multiple users. Most prior works on coded caching are based on
the assumption that each user may request all content in the library. However, in many applications
the users are interested only in a limited set of content items that depends on their location. For
example, visitors in a museum may stream audio and video related to the artworks in the room they are
visiting, or assisted self-driving vehicles may access super-high definition maps of the area
through which they are travelling. Motivated by these considerations, this paper formulates the
coded caching problem for location-based content with edge cache nodes. The considered problem
includes a content server with access to N location-based files, K edge cache nodes located at different
regions, and K users each of which is in the serving region of one cache node and can retrieve the cached
content of this cache node with negligible cost. Depending on the location, each user only requests
a file from a location-dependent subset of the library. The objective is to minimize the worst-case
load transmitted from the content server among all possible demands. We propose a highly non-trivial
converse bound under uncoded cache placement, which shows that a simple achievable scheme is optimal.
In addition, this achievable scheme is generally order optimal within 3. Finally, we extend the
coded caching problem for location-based content to the multiaccess coded caching topology, where
each user is connected to L nearest cache nodes. When $L \geq 2$ we characterize the exact optimality
on the worst-case load.

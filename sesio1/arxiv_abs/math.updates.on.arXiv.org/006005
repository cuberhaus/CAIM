The notion of probability plays an important role in almost all areas of science and technology.
In modern mathematics, however, probability theory means nothing other than measure theory, and
the operational characterization of the notion of probability is not established yet. In this paper,
based on the toolkit of algorithmic randomness we present an operational characterization of the
notion of probability, called an ensemble. Algorithmic randomness, also known as algorithmic
information theory, is a field of mathematics which enables us to consider the randomness of an individual
infinite sequence. We use the notion of Martin-Loef randomness with respect to Bernoulli measure
to present the operational characterization. As the first step of the research of this line, in this
paper we consider the case of finite probability space, i.e., the case where the sample space of the
underlying probability space is finite, for simplicity. We give a natural operational characterization
of the notion of conditional probability in terms of ensemble, and give equivalent characterizations
of the notion of independence between two events based on it. Furthermore, we give equivalent characterizations
of the notion of independence of an arbitrary number of events/random variables in terms of ensembles.
Moreover, we show that the independence of events/random variables is equivalent to the independence
in the sense of van Lambalgen's Theorem, in the case where the underlying finite probability space
is computable. In the paper we make applications of our framework to information theory, cryptography,
and the simulation of a biased coin using fair coins, in order to demonstrate the wide applicability
of our framework to the general areas of science and technology.

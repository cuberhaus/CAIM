This paper addresses the construction of the pilots' schedules under the preferential bidding
system in the airline industry. In this system, the pilots bid on the different activities and the
airline constructs the schedules that maximize the scores of the pilots lexicographically: the
most senior is served first, then the second one, etc. A sequential approach to solve this problem
is natural, and actually quite common: the problem is first solved with the bids of the most senior
pilot in the objective function; then it is solved with those of the second most senior without decreasing
the score of the most senior, and so on. Each step often involves column generation, requires solving
an integer program, and usually takes into account the possible schedules of the less senior crew
members approximately, which might compel to time-consuming backtrackings. The known existing
exact method for this problem follows the sequential approach. The literature commonly admits
that the structure of the problems somehow imposes such an approach. In this work, we show that this
belief is actually not completely correct by proposing another exact method that, among other things,
solves directly the continuous relaxation of the full problem via column generation. The problem
of generating new columns is solved using a lexicographic resource-constrained longest path algorithm.
With this approach, we show that standard schemes of mathematical programming (such as column generation,
bounds, dominance, etc.) can be extended directly to optimization problems with lexicographic
objectives. Numerical experiments on industrial instances provided by Air France show that the
method can solve these instances in relatively short computational time that is compatible with
the operational constraints of the airline.

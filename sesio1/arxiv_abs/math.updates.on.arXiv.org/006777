In this paper we exploit two binary codes associated to a projective nodal surface (the strict code
$\mathcal{K}$ and, for even degree $d$, the extended code $\mathcal{K}'$) to investigate the `Nodal
Severi varieties $\mathcal{F}(d, \nu)$ of nodal surfaces in $\mathbb{P}^3$ of degree $d$ and with
$\nu$ nodes, and their incidence hierarchy, relating partial smoothings to code shortenings.
Our first main result solves a question which dates back over 100 years: the irreducible components
of $\mathcal{F}(4, \nu)$ are in bijection with the isomorphism classes of their extended codes
$\mathcal{K}'$, and these are exactly all the 34 possible shortenings of the extended Kummer code
$\mathcal{K}'$, and a component is in the closure of another if and only if the code of the latter is
a shortening of the code of the former. We then extend this result to nodal K3 surfaces of all other
degrees $d = 2h$ in an entirely analogous way, showing that some unexpected families occur. For surfaces
of degree $d=5$ in $\mathbb{P}^3$ we determine (with one possible exception) all the possible codes
$\mathcal{K}$ of nodal quintics, and for several cases of $\mathcal{K}$, we show the irreducibility
of the corresponding open set of $\mathcal{F}(5, \nu)$, for instance we show the irreducibility
of the family of Togliatti quintic surfaces. In the fourth part we show that a `Togliatti-like' description
holds for surfaces of degree 6 with the maximum number of nodes= 65: they are discriminants of cubic
hypersurfaces in P^6 with 31 (respectively 32) nodes, and we have an irreducible 18-dimensional
family of them. For degree d=6, our main result is based on some novel auxiliary results: 1) the study
of the half-even sets of nodes on sextic surfaces, 2) the investigation of discriminants of cubic
hypersurfaces $X$, 3) the computer assisted proof that, for $n = 65$, both codes $\mathcal{K}$,
$\mathcal{K}'$ are uniquely determined, 4) the description of these codes, relating the geometry
of the Barth sextic with the Doro-Hall graph.

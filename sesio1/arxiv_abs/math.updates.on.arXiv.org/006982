Target detection in hyperspectral imagery is the process of locating pixels from an image which
are likely to contain target, typically done by comparing one or more spectra for the desired target
material to each pixel in the image. Target identification is the process of target detection incorporating
an additional process to identify more specifically the material that is present in each pixel that
scored high in detection. Detection is generally a 2-class problem of target vs. background, and
identification is a many class problem including target, background, and additional know materials.
The identification process we present is probabilistic and hierarchical which provides transparency
to the process and produces trustworthy output. In this paper we show that target identification
has a much lower false alarm rate than detection alone, and provide a detailed explanation of a robust
identification method using probabilistic hierarchical classification that handles the vague
categories of materials that depend on users which are different than the specific physical categories
of chemical constituents. Identification is often done by comparing mixtures of materials including
the target spectra to mixtures of materials that do not include the target spectra, possibly with
other steps. (band combinations, feature checking, background removal, etc.) Standard linear
regression does not handle these problems well because the number of regressors (identification
spectra) is greater than the number of feature variables (bands), and there are multiple correlated
spectra. Our proposed method handles these challenges efficiently and provides additional important
practical information in the form of hierarchical probabilities computed from Bayesian model
averaging.

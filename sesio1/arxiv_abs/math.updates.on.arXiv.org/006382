Most natural and engineered information-processing systems transmit information via signals
that vary in time. Computing the information transmission rate or the information encoded in the
temporal characteristics of these signals, requires the mutual information between the input
and output signals as a function of time, i.e. between the input and output trajectories. Yet, this
is notoriously difficult because of the high-dimensional nature of the trajectory space, and all
existing techniques require approximations. We present an exact Monte Carlo technique called
Path Weight Sampling (PWS) that, for the first time, makes it possible to compute the mutual information
between input and output trajectories for any stochastic system that is described by a master equation.
The principal idea is to use the master equation to evaluate the exact conditional probability of
an individual output trajectory for a given input trajectory, and average this via Monte Carlo sampling
in trajectory space to obtain the mutual information. We present three variants of PWS, which all
generate the trajectories using the standard stochastic simulation algorithm. While Direct PWS
is a brute-force method, Rosenbluth-Rosenbluth PWS exploits the analogy between signal trajectory
sampling and polymer sampling, and Thermodynamic Integration PWS is based on a reversible work
calculation in trajectory space. PWS also makes it possible to compute the mutual information between
input and output trajectories for systems with hidden internal states as well as systems with feedback
from output to input. Applying PWS to the bacterial chemotaxis system, consisting of 173 coupled
chemical reactions, demonstrates not only that the scheme is highly efficient, but also that the
appropriate measure for quantifying information transmission via time-varying signals is indeed
the information transmission rate.

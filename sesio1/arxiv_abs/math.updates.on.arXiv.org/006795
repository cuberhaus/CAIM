We call a function on permutations {\em $k$-local} if it is a linear combination of indicator functions
for sets of permutations with fixed values in $k$ positions. Summarizing prior work by Diaconis,
Ellis-Friedgut-Pilpel and others, we explain why local functions are best understood as `low-frequency'
with respect to the Fourier transform of the symmetric group. When a $k$-local function is also a
class function, we give an explicit rule for calculating its expansion in the basis $\{ \chi^{\lambda}
\}$ of irreducible $\mathfrak{S}_n$-characters. To do so, we introduce a new {\em path power sum
basis} $\{ \vec{p}_{\mu} \}$ of the ring of symmetric functions and prove a Path Murnaghan-Nakayama
Rule for the Schur expansion of $\vec{p}_{\mu}$. This rule involves novel ribbon tableau combinatorics
distinct from the classical Murnaghan-Nakayama Rule and gives a formula for the character sums
$\sum_w \chi^{\lambda}(w)$ over permutations $w \in \mathfrak{S}_n$ with fixed values in certain
positions. We also introduce a family of local functions we call {\em regular} that count weighted
occurrences of patterns. Using the theory of character polynomials for the symmetric group, we
show regular class functions can be interpreted as multivariate rational functions. This allows
us to generalize results of Dimitrov-Khare, Gaetz-Pierson, Gaetz-Ryba on moments for permutation
pattern counting statistics and recover a result of Khare-Lorentz-Yan on pattern counting in perfect
matchings. We compute conditional expectations for regular statistics applied to uniformly random
permutations with a fixed cycle type. As a consequence, we show many regular statistics satisfy
a law of large numbers for conjugation invariant probability distributions, depending only on
the limiting proportion of fixed points.

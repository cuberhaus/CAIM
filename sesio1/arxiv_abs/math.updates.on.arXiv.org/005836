This paper aims to apply the tool of generalized existential completions of conjunctive doctrines,
concerning a class $\Lambda$ of morphisms of their base category, to deepen the study of regular
and exact completions of existential elementary Lawvere's doctrines. After providing a characterization
of generalized existential completions, we observe that both the subobjects doctrine $\mathrm{Sub}_{C}$
and the weak subobjects doctrine $\Psi_{\mathcal{C}}$ of a category $\mathcal{C}$ with finite
limits are generalized existential completions of the constant true doctrine, the first along
the class of all the monomorphisms of $\mathcal{C}$ while the latter along all the morphisms of $\mathcal{C}$.
We then name full existential completion a generalized completion of a conjunctive doctrine along
the class of all the morphisms of its base. From this we immediately deduce that both the regular and
the exact completion of a finite limit category are regular and exact completions of full existential
doctrines since it is known that both the regular completion $(\mathcal{D})_{ reg / lex}$ and the
exact completion $(\mathcal{D})_{ex / lex}$ of a finite limit category $\mathcal{D}$ are respectively
the regular completion $\mathrm{Reg}(\Psi_{\mathcal{D}})$ and the exact completion $\mathcal{T}_{\Psi_{\mathcal{D}}}$
(as an instance of the tripos-to-topos construction) of the weak subobjects doctrine $\Psi_{\mathcal{D}}$
of $\mathcal{D}$. Here we prove that the condition of being a generic full existential completion
is also sufficient to produce a regular/exact completion equivalent to a regular/exact completion
of a finite limit category. Then, we show more specialized characterizations from which we derive
known results as well as remarkable examples of exact completions of full existential completions,
including all realizability toposes and supercoherent localic toposes.

This paper investigates how autonomous vehicles (AV) affect passengers, for-hire human drivers,
and the platform on a ride-sourcing network. We consider a ride-sourcing market where a mixture
of AVs and human drivers is deployed by the platform to provide mobility-on-demand services under
labor regulations. In this market, the ride-sourcing platform determines the spatial prices,
fleet size, human driver payments, and vehicle relocation strategies to maximize its profit, while
individual passengers choose between different transport modes to minimize their travel costs.
A market equilibrium model is proposed to capture the interactions among passengers, human drivers,
AVs, and the ride-sourcing platform over the network. The overall problem is formulated as a non-convex
program with network constraints, and an algorithm is developed to derive its approximate solution
with performance guarantee. Our study shows that ride-sourcing platform prioritizes AV deployment
in high-demand areas to make a higher profit. As AVs flood into these high-demand areas, they compete
with human drivers in the urban core and push them to relocate to suburbs. This leads to reduced earning
opportunities for human drivers and increased spatial inequity for passengers. We also show that
placing a wage floor may protect drivers from the negative impact of AVs, and meanwhile the total
vehicle supply and passenger demand are almost unaffected. However, there exists a threshold beyond
which the minimum wage will trigger a paradigm shift of labor supply where the platform will completely
replace all human drivers with AVs. This indicates that the minimum wage should be carefully designed
in the mixed environment to avoid the loss of job opportunities for human drivers. These results
are validated with realistic case studies for San Francisco.

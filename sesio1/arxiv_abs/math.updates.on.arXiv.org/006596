Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is an all-purpose tool that allows one to generate dependent replicates
from a posterior distribution for effectively any Bayesian hierarchical model. As such, MCMC has
become a standard in Bayesian statistics. However, convergence issues, tuning, and the effective
sample size of the MCMC are nontrivial considerations that are often overlooked or can be difficult
to assess. Moreover, these practical issues can produce a significant computational burden. This
motivates us to consider finding closed-form expressions of the posterior distribution that are
computationally straightforward to sample from directly. We focus on a broad class of Bayesian
generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMM) that allows one to jointly model data of different
types (e.g., Gaussian, Poisson, and binomial distributed observations). Exact sampling from
the posterior distribution for Bayesian GLMMs is such a difficult problem that it is now arguably
overlooked as a possible problem to solve. To solve this problem, we derive a new class of distributions
that gives one the flexibility to specify the prior on fixed and random effects to be any conjugate
multivariate distribution. We refer to this new distribution as the generalized conjugate multivariate
(GCM) distribution, and several technical results are provided. The expression of the exact posterior
distribution is given along with the steps to obtain direct independent simulations from the posterior
distribution. These direct simulations have an efficient projection/regression form, and hence,
we refer to our method as Exact Posterior Regression (EPR). Several theoretical results are developed
that create the foundation for EPR. Illustrative examples are provided including a simulation
study and an analysis of estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS).

This paper develops a new approach to the estimation of the degree of boundedness or stability of
multidimensional nonlinear systems with time-dependent nonperiodic coefficients-an essential
task in various engineering and natural science applications. Known approaches to assessing the
stability of such systems rest on the utility of Lyapunov functions and Lyapunov first approximation
methodologies, typically providing conservative and computationally elaborate criteria for
multidimensional systems of this category. Adequate criteria of boundedness of solutions to nonhomogeneous
systems of this kind are rare in the contemporary literature. Lately, we develop a new approach to
these problems which rests on bounding the evolution of the norms of solutions to initial systems
by matching solutions of a scalar auxiliary equation we introduced in [1], [2] and [3]. Still, the
technique advanced in [3] rests on the assumption that the average of the linear components of the
underlying system is defined by a stable matrix of general position. The current paper substantially
amplifies the application domain of this approach. It is merely assumed that the time-dependent
linear block of the underlying system can be split into slow and fast varying components by application
of any smoothing technique. This dichotomy of temporal scales is determined by the optimal criterion
reducing the conservatism of our estimates. In turn, we transform the linear subsystem with slow-varying
matrix in a diagonally dominant form by successive applications of the Lyapunov transforms. This
prompts the development of novel scalar auxiliary equations embracing the estimation of the norms
of solutions to our initial systems. Next, we formulate boundedness or stability criteria and estimate
the relevant regions of the underlying systems using analytical and abridged numerical reasoning.

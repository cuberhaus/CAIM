In this paper we introduce a constructive approach to study well-posedness of solutions to stochastic
fluid-structure interaction with stochastic noise. We focus on a benchmark problem in stochastic
fluid-structure interaction, and prove the existence of a unique weak solution in the probabilistically
strong sense. The benchmark problem consists of the 2D time-dependent Stokes equations describing
the flow of an incompressible, viscous fluid interacting with a linearly elastic membrane modeled
by the 1D linear wave equation. The membrane is stochastically forced by the time-dependent white
noise. The fluid and the structure are linearly coupled. The constructive existence proof is based
on a time-discretization via an operator splitting approach. This introduces a sequence of approximate
solutions, which are random variables. We show the existence of a subsequence of approximate solutions
which converges, almost surely, to a weak solution in the probabilistically strong sense. The proof
is based on uniform energy estimates in terms of the expectation of the energy norms, which are the
backbone for a weak compactness argument giving rise to a weakly convergent subsequence of probability
measures associated with the approximate solutions. Probabilistic techniques based on the Skorohod
representation theorem and the Gy\"ongy-Krylov lemma are then employed to obtain almost sure convergence
of a subsequence of the random approximate solutions to a weak solution in the probabilistically
strong sense. The result shows that the deterministic benchmark FSI model is robust to stochastic
noise, even in the presence of rough white noise in time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
well-posedness result for fully coupled stochastic fluid-structure interaction.

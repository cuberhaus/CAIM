The paper is devoted to the observability study of a dynamic system, which describes the vibrations
of an elastic beam with an attached rigid body and distributed control actions. The mathematical
model is derived using Hamilton's principle in the form of the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation with
hinged boundary conditions and interface condition at the point of attachment of the rigid body.
It is assumed that the sensors distributed along the beam provide output information about the deformation
in neighborhoods of the specified points of the beam. Based on the variational form of the equations
of motion, the spectral problem for defining the eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions of the beam
oscillations is obtained. Some properties of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the spectral
problem are investigated. Finite-dimensional approximations of the dynamic equations are constructed
in the linear manifold spanned by the system of eigenfunctions. For these Galerkin approximations,
observability conditions for the control system with incomplete information about the state are
derived. An algorithm for observer design with an arbitrary number of modal coordinates is proposed
for the differential equation on a finite-dimensional manifold. Based on a quadratic Lyapunov
function with respect to the coordinates of the finite-dimensional state vector, the exponential
convergence of the observer dynamics is proved. The proposed method of constructing a dynamic observer
makes it possible to estimate the full system state by the output signals characterizing the motion
of particular point only. Numerical simulations illustrate the exponential decay of the norm of
solutions of the system of ordinary differential equations that describes the observation error.

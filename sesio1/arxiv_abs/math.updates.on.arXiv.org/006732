The paper treats the problem of optimal distributed control of a Cahn-Hilliard-Oono system in $\mathbb{R}^d$,
$1\leq d\leq 3$, with the control located in the mass term and admitting general potentials that
include both the case of a regular potential and the case of some singular potential. The first part
of the paper is concerned with the dependence of the phase variable on the control variable. In the
case of a logarithmic potential, we need to prove an ad hoc strict separation property, and for this
reason we have to restrict ourselves to the case $d = 2$. In the rest of the work, we study the necessary
first-order optimality conditions, which are proved under suitable compatibility conditions
on the initial datum of the phase variable and the time derivative of the control, at least in case
of potentials having unbounded domain. PLEASE NOTE: A revised version of this paper has been published
in Discrete Contin. Dyn. Syst. Ser. S 15 (2022), 2135-2172: the authors point out that both the published
version and the arXiv preprint contain a trivial mistake in formula (2.21), which leads to suitable
changes in the assumption (2.10) and in some occurrences of it. Namely, (2.21) and (2.10) become
$ \bar \varphi(t) = \bar \varphi_0 e^{-t} + \int_0^t e^{-(t-s)} \bar u(s) \, ds$ for every $t\in[0,T]$,
and $-M - (\bar\varphi_0)^- , M + (\bar\varphi_0)^+$ belong to the interior of $D(\beta)$, respectively.
The formula just after (2.21) becomes $-M - (\bar\varphi_0)^- \leq \bar \varphi(t) \leq M + (\bar\varphi_0)^+$
and a similar change must be done in (4.20). The first line of (2.24) is now implied by the new (2.21).
Next, (2.39) becomes $-(M+ R) - (\bar\varphi_0)^- , (M+ R) + (\bar\varphi_0)^+$ belong to the interior
of $D(\beta)$. Similar changes must be done in the interval written just two lines before (4.18)
and in (4.18) itself.

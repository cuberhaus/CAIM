We provide a novel framework to compute a discrete vector potential of a given discrete vector field
on arbitrary polyhedral meshes. The framework exploits the concept of acyclic matching, a combinatorial
tool at the core of discrete Morse theory. We introduce the new concept of complete acyclic matchings
and we show that they give the same end result of Gaussian elimination. Basically, instead of doing
costly row and column operations on a sparse matrix, we compute equivalent cheap combinatorial
operations that preserve the underlying sparsity structure. Currently, the most efficient algorithms
proposed in literature to find discrete vector potentials make use of tree-cotree techniques.
We show that they compute a special type of complete acyclic matchings. Moreover, we show that the
problem of computing them is equivalent to the problem of deciding whether a given mesh has a topological
property called collapsibility. This fact gives a topological characterization of well-known
termination problems of tree-cotree techniques. We propose a new recursive algorithm to compute
discrete vector potentials. It works directly on basis elements of $1$- and $2$-chains by performing
elementary Gaussian operations on them associated with acyclic matchings. However, the main novelty
is that it can be applied recursively. Indeed, the recursion process allows us to sidetrack termination
problems of the standard tree-cotree techniques. We tested the algorithm on pathological triangulations
with known topological obstructions. In all tested problems we observe linear computational complexity
as a function of mesh size. Moreover, the algorithm is purely graph-based so it is straightforward
to implement and does not require specialized external procedures. We believe that our framework
could offer new perspectives to sparse matrix computations.

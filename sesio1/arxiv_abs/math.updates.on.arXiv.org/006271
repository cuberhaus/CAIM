The \emph{turnpike property} in contemporary macroeconomics asserts that if an economic planner
seeks to move an economy from one level of capital to another, then the most efficient path, as long
as the planner has enough time, is to rapidly move stock to a level close to the optimal stationary
or constant path, then allow for capital to develop along that path until the desired term is nearly
reached, at which point the stock ought to be moved to the final target. Motivated in part by its nature
as a resource allocation strategy, over the past decade, the turnpike property has also been shown
to hold for several classes of partial differential equations arising in mechanics. When formalized
mathematically, the turnpike theory corroborates the insights from economics: for an optimal
control problem set in a finite-time horizon, optimal controls and corresponding states, are close
(often exponentially), during most of the time, except near the initial and final time, to the optimal
control and corresponding state for the associated stationary optimal control problem. In particular,
the former are mostly constant over time. This fact provides a rigorous meaning to the asymptotic
simplification that some optimal control problems appear to enjoy over long time intervals, allowing
the consideration of the corresponding stationary problem for computing and applications. We
review a slice of the theory developed over the past decade --the controllability of the underlying
system is an important ingredient, and can even be used to devise simple turnpike-like strategies
which are nearly optimal--, and present several novel applications, including, among many others,
the characterization of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman asymptotics, and stability estimates in deep
learning via residual neural networks.

The Covid-19 pandemic has caused impressive damages and disruptions in social, economic, and health
systems (among others), and posed unprecedented challenges to public health and policy/decision-makers
concerning the design and implementation of measures to mitigate its strong negative impacts.
The Portuguese health authorities are currently using some decision analysis-like techniques
to assess the impact of this pandemic and implementing measures for each county, region, or the whole
country. Such decision tools led to some criticism and many stakeholders asked for novel approaches,
in particular those having in consideration dynamical changes in the pandemic behavior arising,
e.g., from new virus variants or vaccines. A multidisciplinary team formed by researchers of the
Covid-19 Committee of Instituto Superior T\'ecnico at Universidade de Lisboa (CCIST analysts
team) and medical doctors from the Crisis Office of the Portuguese Medical Association (GCOM experts
team) gathered efforts and worked together in order to propose a new tool to help politicians and
decision-makers in the combat of the pandemic. This paper presents the main steps and elements,
which led to the construction of a pandemic impact assessment composite indicator, applied to the
particular case of {\sc{Covid-19}} in Portugal. A multiple criteria approach based on an additive
multi-attribute value theory (MAVT) aggregation model was used to construct the pandemic assessment
composite indicator (PACI). The parameters of the additive model were built through a sociotechnical
co-constructive interactive process between CCIST and GCOM team members. The deck of cards method
was the technical tool adopted to help in building the value functions and the assessment of the criteria
weights.

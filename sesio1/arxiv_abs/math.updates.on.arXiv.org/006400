Fully localised patterns involving cellular hexagons or squares have been found experimentally
and numerically in various continuum models. However, there is currently no mathematical theory
for the emergence of these localised cellular patterns from a quiescent state. A key issue is that
standard techniques for one-dimensional patterns have proven insufficient for understanding
localisation in higher dimensions. In this work, we present a comprehensive approach to this problem
by using techniques developed in the study of radially-symmetric patterns. Our analysis covers
localised planar patterns equipped with a wide range of dihedral symmetries, thereby avoiding
a restriction to solutions on a predetermined lattice. The context in this paper is a theory for the
emergence of such patterns near a Turing instability for a general class of planar reaction-diffusion
equations. Posing the reaction-diffusion system in polar coordinates, we carry out a finite-mode
Fourier decomposition in the angular variable to yield a large system of coupled radial ordinary
differential equations. We then perform radial invariant-manifold and normal form analysis,
leading to an algebraic matching condition for localised patterns to exist in the finite-mode reduction.
This algebraic matching condition is nontrivial, and solving it reveals the existence of a plethora
of localised dihedral patterns. These results capture the essence of the emergent localised hexagonal
patterns witnessed in experiments. Moreover, we combine rigorous numerics and a Newton-Kantorovich
procedure to prove the existence of localised patches with 6m-fold symmetry for arbitrarily large
Fourier decompositions. This includes the localised hexagon patches that have been elusive to
analytical treatment.

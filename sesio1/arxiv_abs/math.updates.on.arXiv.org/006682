Patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) are born with an underdeveloped left heart.
They typically receive a sequence of surgeries that result in a single ventricle physiology called
the Fontan circulation. While these patients usually survive into early adulthood, they are at
risk for medical complications, partially due to their lower than normal cardiac output, which
leads to insufficient cerebral and gut perfusion. While clinical imaging data can provide detailed
insight into cardiovascular function within the imaged region, it is difficult to use this data
for assessing deficiencies in the rest of the body and for deriving blood pressure dynamics. Data
from patients used in this paper include three dimensional, magnetic resonance angiograms (MRA),
time-resolved phase contrast cardiac magnetic resonance images (4D-MRI) and sphygmomanometer
blood pressure measurements. The 4D-MRI images provide detailed insight into velocity and flow
in vessels within the imaged region, but they cannot predict flow in the rest of the body, nor do they
provide values of blood pressure. To remedy these limitations, this study combines the MRA, 4D-MRI,
and pressure data with 1D fluid dynamics models to predict hemodynamics in the major systemic arteries,
including the cerebral and gut vasculature. To study effects post-surgery we compare simulations
for an HLHS patient with simulations for a matched control patient that has double outlet right ventricle
(DORV) physiology with a native aorta. Our results show that the HLHS patient has hypertensive pressures
in the brain as well as reduced flow to the gut. Wave-intensity analysis suggests that the HLHS patient
has irregular circulatory function during light upright exercise conditions and that predicted
wall-shear stresses are lower than normal, suggesting the HLHS patient may have hypertension.

In this article we continue our investigation of the M\"obius-invariant Willmore flow, starting
to move in smooth and umbilic-free immersions $F_0$, which map some fixed torus $\Sigma$ into $\mathbb{S}^n$.
Here we investigate the behaviour of flow lines $\{F_t\}$ of the MIWF in $\mathbb{S}^3$ starting
to move with Willmore energy below $8\pi$, as the time $t$ approaches the maximal time of existence
$T_{max}(F_0)$. We prove that any singularity of a flow line $\{F_t\}$ of the MIWF can be interpreted
as the support of a $2$-rectifiable, integral varifold $\mu$ on $\mathbb{R}^4$, which is the weak
limit of varifolds $\{\mathcal{H}^2\lfloor_{F_{t_{j_l}}}\}$, for an appropriate sequence
$t_{j_l} \nearrow T_{max}(F_0)$, and that the support $spt(\mu)$ has either degenerated to a point
or is homeomorphic to either a $2$-sphere or a torus in $\mathbb{S}^3$. The cases $spt(\mu)=\{point\}
\vee spt(\mu) \cong \mathbb{S}^2$ can only occur, if the measures $\mathcal{M}^0_l(\Omega):=\int_{F_{t_{j_l}}^{-1}(\Omega\cap
\mathbb{S}^3)} |A^0_{F_{t_{j_l}}}|^2\, d\mu_{F_{t_{j_l}}^*g_{euc}}$ on $\mathbb{R}^4$
concentrate in at least one point in $\mathbb{S}^3$, as $l \nearrow \infty$. If the singularity
$spt(\mu)$ is a torus, it can be parametrized by a bi-Lipschitz homeomorphism, which is uniformly
conformal w.r.t. some appropriate metric of vanishing scalar curvature on $\Sigma$. If the initial
immersion of a flow line $\{F_t\}$ is assumed to parametrize a smooth Hopf-torus in $\mathbb{S}^3$
with Willmore energy smaller than $8\pi$, then we obtain stronger types of convergence of certain
subsequences of $\{F_{t_{j_l}}\}$ to uniformly conformal $W^{4,2}$-parametrizations of limit
Hopf-tori, which finally yields a surprisingly simple criterion for full $C^m$-convergence of
such a flow line to a smooth parametrization of a Clifford-torus, as $t\nearrow \infty$, for any
fixed integer $m$.

The flat torus ${\mathbb T}={\mathbb S}^1\left (\frac{1}{2} \right ) \times {\mathbb S}^1\left
(\frac{1}{2} \right )$ admits a proper biharmonic isometric immersion into the unit $4$-dimensional
sphere ${\mathbb S}^4$ given by $\Phi=i \circ \varphi$, where $\varphi:{\mathbb T} \to {\mathbb
S}^3(\frac{1}{\sqrt 2})$ is the minimal Clifford torus and $i:{\mathbb S}^3(\frac{1}{\sqrt
2}) \to {\mathbb S}^4$ is the biharmonic small hypersphere. The first goal of this paper is to compute
the biharmonic index and nullity of the proper biharmonic immersion $\Phi$. After, we shall study
in the detail the kernel of the generalised Jacobi operator $I_2^\Phi$. We shall prove that it contains
a direction which admits a natural variation with vanishing first, second and third derivatives,
and such that the fourth derivative is negative. In the second part of the paper we shall analyse the
specific contribution of $\varphi$ to the biharmonic index and nullity of $\Phi$. In this context,
we shall study a more general composition $\tilde{\Phi}=\tilde{\varphi} \circ i$, where $\tilde{\varphi}:
M^m \to {\mathbb S}^{n-1}(\frac{1}{\sqrt 2})$, $ m \geq 1$, $n \geq {3}$, is a minimal immersion
and $i:{\mathbb S}^{n-1}(\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}) \to {\mathbb S}^n$ is the biharmonic small hypersphere.
First, we shall determine a general sufficient condition which ensures that the second variation
of $\tilde{\Phi}$ is nonnegatively defined on $\mathcal{C}\big (\tilde{\varphi}^{-1}T{\mathbb
S}^{n-1}\big )$. Then we complete this type of analysis on our Clifford torus and, as a complementary
result, we obtain the $p$-harmonic index and nullity of $\varphi$. In the final section we compare
our general results with those which can be deduced from the study of the equivariant second variation.

This memoir is devoted to the study of formal-analytic arithmetic surfaces. These are arithmetic
counterparts, in the context of Arakelov geometry, of germs of smooth complex-analytic surfaces
along a projective complex curve. Formal-analytic surfaces provide a natural framework for arithmetic
algebraization theorems, old and new. Formal-analytic arithmetic surfaces admit a rich geometry
which parallels the geometry of complex analytic surfaces. Notably the dichotomy between pseudoconvexity
and pseudoconcavity plays a central role in their geometry. Our study of formal-analytic arithmetic
surfaces relies crucially on the use of real-valued invariants. Some of these are intersection-theoretic,
in the spirit of Arakelov intersection theory. Some other invariants involve infinite-dimensional
geometry of numbers. Relating our new intersection-theoretic invariants to more classical invariants
of Arakelov geometry leads us to investigate a new invariant, the Archimedean overflow, attached
to an analytic map from a pointed compact Riemann surface with boundary to a Riemann surface. It is
related to the characteristic functions of Nevanlinna theory. Our results on the geometry of formal-analytic
arithmetic surfaces admit applications to concrete problems of arithmetic geometry. Notably
we generalize the arithmetic holonomicity theorem of Calegari-Dimitrov-Tang regarding the dimension
of spaces of power series with integral coefficients satisfying some convergence conditions.
We also establish an arithmetic counterpart of theorems of Lefschetz and Nori by providing a bound
on the index, in the \'etale fundamental group of an arithmetic surface, of the closed subgroup generated
by the \'etale fundamental groups of some arithmetic curve and of some compact Riemann surfaces
mapping to the arithmetic surface.

Symmetries found through automorphisms or graph fibrations provide important insights in network
analysis. Symmetries identify clusters of robust synchronization in the network which improves
the understanding of the functionality of complex biological systems. Network symmetries can
be determined by finding a {\it balanced coloring} of the graph, which is a node partition in which
each cluster of nodes receives the same information (color) from the rest of the graph. In recent
work we saw that biological networks such as gene regulatory networks, metabolic networks and neural
networks in organisms ranging from bacteria to yeast and humans are rich in fibration symmetries
related to the graph balanced coloring. Networks based on real systems, however, are built on experimental
data which are inherently incomplete, due to missing links, collection errors, and natural variations
within specimens of the same biological species. Therefore, it is fair to assume that some of the
existing symmetries were not detected in our analysis. For that reason, a method to find pseudosymmetries
and repair networks based on those symmetries is important when analyzing real world networks.
In this paper we introduce the {\it pseudobalanced coloring} \eqref{eq:mainip} problem, and provide
an integer programming formulation which (a) calculates a pseudobalanced coloring of the graph
taking into account the missing data, and (b) optimally repairs the graph with the minimal number
of added/removed edges to maximize the symmetry of the graph. We apply our formulation to the {\it
C. elegans} connectome to find pseudocoloring and the optimal graph repair. Our solution compares
well with a manually curated ground-truth {\it C. elegans} graph as well as solutions generated
by other methods of missing link prediction.

We consider a multi-link diffusion-based molecular communication (MC) system where multiple
spatially distributed transmitter (TX)-receiver (RX) pairs establish point-to-point communication
links employing the same type of signaling molecules. To exploit the full potential of such a system,
an in-depth understanding of the interplay between the spatial user density and inter-user interference
(IUI) and its impact on the system performance is needed. In this paper, we consider a three-dimensional
unbounded domain with multiple spatially distributed point-to-point non-cooperative transmission
links, where both the TXs and RXs are positioned on a regular fixed grid. For this setup, we first derive
an analytical expression for the channel impulse responses between all TXs and RXs. Then, we derive
the maximum likelihood (ML) detector for the RXs and show that it reduces to a threshold-based detector.
Moreover, we derive an analytical expression for the corresponding detection threshold which
depends on the statistics of the desired signal, the statistics of the MC channel, and the statistics
of the IUI. Furthermore, we derive an analytical expression for the bit error rate and the achievable
rate of a single transmission link. Finally, we propose a new performance metric, which we refer
to as area rate efficiency (ARE), that captures the tradeoff between the transmission link density
and the IUI. The ARE characterizes how efficiently the available TX and RX areas are used for information
transmission and is expressed in bits per unit area. We show that there exists an optimal transmission
link density for maximizing the ARE. The presented results reveal that the optimal link density
depends on the number of molecules used for modulation and the value of the diffusion coefficient,
while the impact of the chosen grid structure and the concentration of background noise molecules
is negligible.

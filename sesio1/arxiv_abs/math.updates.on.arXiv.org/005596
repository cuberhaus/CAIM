The totally nonnegative part of a partial flag variety in $\mathbb{C}^n$ is the subset where all
Pl\"ucker coordinates are real and nonnegative. It is well-known that one can view a partial flag
variety as an adjoint orbit $\mathcal{O}_\lambda$ inside the Lie algebra of $n \times n$ skew-Hermitian
matrices. We use the orbit context to study totally nonnegative flag varieties from an algebraic,
geometric, and dynamical perspective. The paper has three main parts: (1) We introduce the totally
nonnegative part of $\mathcal{O}_\lambda$, and describe it explicitly in several cases. We define
a twist map on it, which generalizes (in type $A$) a map of Bloch, Flaschka, and Ratiu (1990) on an isospectral
manifold of Jacobi matrices. (2) We study gradient flows on $\mathcal{O}_\lambda$ which preserve
positivity, working in three natural Riemannian metrics. In the K\"ahler metric, positivity is
preserved in many cases of interest, extending results of Galashin, Karp, and Lam (2017, 2019).
In the normal metric, positivity is essentially never preserved on a generic orbit. In the induced
metric, whether positivity is preserved appears to depends on the spacing of the eigenvalues defining
the orbit. (3) We present two applications. First, we discuss the topology of totally nonnegative
flag varieties and amplituhedra. Galashin, Karp, and Lam (2017, 2019) showed that the former are
homeomorphic to closed balls, and we interpret their argument in the orbit framework. We also show
that a new family of amplituhedra, which we call twisted Vandermonde amplituhedra, are homeomorphic
to closed balls. Second, we discuss the symmetric Toda flow on $\mathcal{O}_\lambda$. We show that
it preserves positivity, and that on the totally nonnegative part, it is a gradient flow in the K\"ahler
metric up to applying the twist map. This extends a result of Bloch, Flaschka, and Ratiu (1990).

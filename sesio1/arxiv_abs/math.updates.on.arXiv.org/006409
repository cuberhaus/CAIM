Emerging mobility systems, e.g., connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), shared mobility, and
electric vehicles, provide the most intriguing opportunity for enabling users to better monitor
transportation network conditions and make better decisions for improving safety and transportation
efficiency. However, before connectivity and automation are deployed en masse, a thorough evaluation
of CAVs is required-ranging from numerical simulation to real-world public roads. Assessment
of the performance of CAVs in scaled testbeds has recently gained momentum due to the flexibility
they offer to conduct quick, repeatable experiments that could go one step beyond simulation. This
article introduces the Information and Decision Science Lab's Scaled Smart City (IDS$^3$C), a
1:25 research and educational scaled robotic testbed that is capable of replicating different
real-world urban traffic scenarios. IDS$^3$C was designed to investigate the effect of emerging
mobility systems on safety and transportation efficiency. On the educational front, IDS$^3$C
can be used for (a) training and educating graduate students by exposing them to a balanced mix of
theory and practice, (b) integrating the research outcomes into existing courses, (c) involving
undergraduate students in research, (d) creating interactive educational demos, and (e) reaching
out to high-school students. In our exposition, we also present a real-time control framework that
can be used to coordinate CAVs at traffic scenarios such as crossing signal-free intersections,
merging at roadways and roundabouts, cruising in congested traffic, passing through speed reduction
zones, and lane-merging or passing maneuvers. Finally, we provide a tutorial for applying our framework
in coordinating robotic CAVs to a multi-lane roundabout scenario and a transportation corridor
in IDS$^3$C.

Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a complex Kac-Moody algebra, with Cartan subalgebra $\mathfrak{h}$. Also
fix a weight $\lambda\in\mathfrak{h}^*$. For $M(\lambda)\twoheadrightarrow V$ an arbitrary
highest weight $\mathfrak{g}$-module, we provide a cancellation-free, non-recursive formula
for the weights of $V$. This is novel even in finite type, and is obtained from $\lambda$ and a collection
$\mathcal{H}=\mathcal{H}_V$ of independent sets in the Dynkin diagram of $\mathfrak{g}$ that
are associated to $V$. Our proofs use and reveal a finite family (for each $\lambda$) of "higher order
Verma modules" $\mathbb{M}(\lambda,\mathcal{H})$ - these are all of the universal modules for
weight-considerations. They (i) generalize and subsume parabolic Verma modules $M(\lambda,J)$,
and (ii) have pairwise distinct weight-sets, which exhaust the weight-sets of all modules $M(\lambda)\twoheadrightarrow
V$. As an application, we explain the sense in which the modules $M(\lambda)$ of Verma and $M(\lambda,J_V)$
of Lepowsky are respectively the zeroth and first order upper-approximations of every $V$, and
continue to higher order upper-approximations $\mathbb{M}_k(\lambda,\mathcal{H}_V)$ (and
to lower-approximations). We also determine the $k$th order integrability of $V$, for all $k\geq
0$. We then introduce the category $\mathcal{O}^\mathcal{H}\subset\mathcal{O}$, which is a
higher order parabolic analogue that contains the higher order Verma modules $\mathbb{M}(\lambda,\mathcal{H})$.
We show that $\mathcal{O}^\mathcal{H}$ has enough projectives, and also initiate the study of
BGG reciprocity, by proving it for all $\mathcal{O}^\mathcal{H}$ over $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{sl}_2^{\oplus
n}$. Finally, we provide a BGG resolution for the universal modules $\mathbb{M}(\lambda,\mathcal{H})$
in certain cases; this yields a Weyl-type character formula for them, and involves the action of
a parabolic Weyl semigroup.

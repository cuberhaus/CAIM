Menger's Theorem asserts that in an undirected graph $G$ there exist $k$ pairwise edge-disjoint
paths between two vertices if and only if a deletion of any $k-1$ or less edges does not disconnect
these two vertices. Alternatively, one can consider $\mathbb{F}_2$-linear spaces of all the formal
sums of edges in $G$ and of all the formal sums of vertices in $G$, and the $\mathbb{F}_2$-linear boundary
map from the former to the latter, which takes each edge to the sum of its two boundary vertices. Menger's
Theorem now states, that there exist $k$ sums of edges, no two of which have any common summands, such
that all these $k$ sums are mapped by the boundary map to the sum of two vertices, if and only if after
a deletion of any $k-1$ or less edges there still exists a sum of edges which is mapped by the boundary
map to the sum of these two vertices. We extend Menger's Edge Theorem to the sums of edges which are
mapped by the boundary map to the sum of four vertices $A,B,C,D$. We prove that in an undirected graph
$G$, in which all the vertices different from $A,B,C,D$ have even degrees, the following two statements
are equivalent: There exist $k$ sums of edges, no two of which have any common summands, such that
all these $k$ sums are mapped by the boundary map to $A+B+C+D$; After a deletion of any $k-1$ or less
edges there still exists a sum of edges which is mapped by the boundary map to $A+B+C+D$. Equivalently,
for such a graph $G$, if after a deletion of any $k-1$ or less edges, four vertices $A,B,C,D$ can be
split into two pairs of vertices, and the two vertices in each one of these pairs can be connected by
a path so that these two paths are edge-disjoint, then four vertices $A,B,C,D$ can be split $k$ times
into two pairs of vertices and the two vertices in each one of these $2k$ pairs connected by a path,
in such a way that these $2k$ paths are pairwise edge-disjoint.

This is a manuscript of a chapter prepared for a book. The good codes possess large information length
and large minimum distance. A class of codes is said to be asymptotically good if there exists a positive
real $\delta$ such that, for any positive integer $N$ we can find a code in the class with code length
greater than $N$, and with both the rate and the relative minimum distance greater than $\delta$.
The linear codes over any finite field are asymptotically good. More interestingly, the (asymptotic)
GV-bound is a phase transition point for the linear codes; i.e., asymptotically speaking, the parameters
of most linear codes attain the GV-bound. It is a long-standing open question: whether or not the
cyclic codes over a finite field (which are an important class of codes) are asymptotically good?
However, from a long time ago the quasi-cyclic codes of index $2$ were proved to be asymptotically
good. This chapter consists of some of our studies on the asymptotic properties of several classes
of quasi-group codes. We'll explain the studies in a consistent and self-contained style. We begin
with the classical results on linear codes. In many cases we consider the quasi-group codes over
finite abelian groups (including the cyclic case as a subcase of course), and study their asymptotic
properties along two directions: (1) the order of the group (the coindex) is fixed while the index
is going to infinity; (2) the index is small while the order of the group (the coindex) is going to infinity.
Finally we describe the story on dihedral codes. The dihedral groups are non-abelian but near to
cyclic groups (they have cyclic subgroups of index $2$). The asymptotic goodness of binary dihedral
codes was obtained in the beginning of this century, and extended to the general dihedral codes recently.

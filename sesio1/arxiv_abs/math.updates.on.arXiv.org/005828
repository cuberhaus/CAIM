In this paper, we define the weighted homogeneous space (WHS), denoted by $\frac{G}{P}[\psi_H]$
where $\psi_H$ is weight function defined on the set of simple roots of $G$, by an element $H$ in the
highest Weyl chamber. The weight function $\psi_H$ describes the action of the maximal torus $T$
on different Bruhat cells and is well behaved via the change of coordinates defined by the action
of the Weyl group $W$. The major effort in this text is to prove basic algebraic and geometric properties
of a weighted homogeneous space. The definition can be compared with an existing version given by
Reid-Corti \cite{CR}. Additionally, we express $\frac{G}{P}[\psi_H]$ as a whole compact quotient
of $G/P$ by a certain action of a finite abelian group. Besides, it is presented a criterion when two
WHS with possibly different weight systems are isomorphic. The criteria give a simple method to
understand the regular maps between two WHS's, defined by matrices with specific polynomial entries.
We also explain invariant K\"ahler differentials on WHS by using certain potential functions on
$G$. Our contribution is a generalization of the results presented in \cite{Al, AL, AKQ}. For that,
we explain how the weights affect different computations of chern classes of line bundles given
in \cite{AL, AKQ}. Finally, we provide a result on the coordinate ring of a WHS by cluster algebras
associated to weighted quivers. Specifically, we show that the coordinate ring of a WHS is a weighted
cluster algebra of finite type. In this case, the corresponding Dynkin quiver is equipped with a
weight function defined on the vertices where the mutations also affect the weights. We present
an embedding of a WHS in a product of weighted projective spaces, showing that the coordinate ring
is a weighted graded algebra.

A biological system achieve homeostasis when there is a regulated quantity that is maintained within
a narrow range of values. Here we consider homeostasis as a phenomenon of network dynamics. In this
context, we improve a general theory for the analysis of homeostasis in network dynamical systems
with distinguished input and output nodes, called `input-output networks'. The theory allows
one to define `homeostasis types' of a given network in a `model independent' fashion, in the sense
that the classification depends on the network topology rather than on the specific model equations.
Each `homeostasis type' represents a possible mechanism for generating homeostasis and is associated
with a suitable `subnetwork motif' of the original network. Our contribution is an extension of
the theory to the case of networks with multiple input nodes. To showcase our theory, we apply it to
bacterial chemotaxis, a paradigm for homeostasis in biochemical systems. By considering a representative
model of Escherichia coli chemotaxis, we verify that the corresponding abstract network has multiple
input nodes. Thus showing that our extension of the theory allows for the inclusion of an important
class of models that were previously out of reach. Moreover, from our abstract point of view, the
occurrence of homeostasis in the studied model is caused by a new mechanism, called input counterweight
homeostasis. This new homeostasis mechanism was discovered in the course of our investigation
and is generated by a balancing between the several input nodes of the network -- therefore, it requires
the existence of at least two input nodes to occur. Finally, the framework developed here allows
one to formalize a notion of `robustness' of homeostasis based on the concept of `genericity' from
the theory dynamical systems. We discuss how this kind of robustness of homeostasis appears in the
chemotaxis model.

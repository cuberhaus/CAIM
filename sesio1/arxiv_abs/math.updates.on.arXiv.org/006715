The Gaussian $\beta$-ensemble is a real $n$-point configuration $\{x_j\}_1^n$ picked randomly
with respect to the Boltzmann factor $e^{-\frac\beta 2H_n}$, $H_n=\sum_{i\ne j}\log\frac 1{|x_i-x_j|}+n\sum_{i=1}^n\tfrac
12x_i^2.$ The point process $\{x_j\}_1^n$ tends to follow the semicircle law $\sigma(x)=\tfrac
1{2\pi}\sqrt{(4-x^2)_+}$ in certain average senses. A Fekete configuration (minimizer of $H_n$)
is spread out in a much more uniform way in the interval $[-2,2]$ with respect to the regularization
$\sigma_n(x)=\max\{\sigma(x),n^{-\frac 1 3}\}$ of the semicircle law. In particular, Fekete
configurations are "equidistributed" with respect to $\sigma_n(x)$, in a certain technical sense
of Beurling-Landau densities. We consider the problem of characterizing sequences $\beta_n$
of inverse temperatures, which guarantee almost sure equidistribution as $n\to\infty$. We find
that a necessary and sufficient condition is that $\beta_n$ grows at least logarithmically in $n$:
$$\beta_n\gtrsim \log n.$$ We call this growth rate the perfect freezing regime. We give several
further results on the distribution of particles when $\beta_n\gtrsim\log n$, for example on minimal
spacing, discrepancies, and sampling and interpolation for weighted polynomials. The condition
$\beta_n\gtrsim\log n$ was introduced by some of the authors in the context of two-dimensional
Coulomb gas ensembles, where it is shown to be sufficient for equidistribution. Although the technical
implementation requires some considerable modifications, the strategy from dimension two adapts
well to prove sufficiency also for one-dimensional Gaussian ensembles. On a technical level, we
use estimates for weighted polynomials due to Levin, Lubinsky, Gustavsson and others. The other
direction (necessity) involves estimates due to Ledoux and Rider on the distribution of particles
which fall near or outside the boundary.

In this work we consider a class of non-linear eigenvalue problems that admit a spectrum similar
to that of a Hamiltonian matrix, in the sense that the spectrum is symmetric with respect to both the
real and imaginary axis. More precisely, we present a method to iteratively approximate the eigenvalues
of such non-linear eigenvalue problems closest to a given purely real or imaginary shift, while
preserving the symmetries of the spectrum. To this end the presented method exploits the equivalence
between the considered non-linear eigenvalue problem and the eigenvalue problem associated with
a linear but infinite-dimensional operator. To compute the eigenvalues closest to the given shift,
we apply a specifically chosen shift-invert transformation to this linear operator and compute
the eigenvalues with the largest modulus of the new shifted and inverted operator using an (infinite)
Arnoldi procedure. The advantage of the chosen shift-invert transformation is that the spectrum
of the transformed operator has a "real skew-Hamiltonian"-like structure. Furthermore, it is
proven that the Krylov space constructed by applying this operator, satisfies an orthogonality
property in terms of a specifically chosen bilinear form. By taking this property into account in
the orthogonalization process, it is ensured that even in the presence of rounding errors, the obtained
approximation for, e.g., a simple, purely imaginary eigenvalue is simple and purely imaginary.
The presented work can thus be seen as an extension of [V. Mehrmann and D. Watkins, "Structure-Preserving
Methods for Computing Eigenpairs of Large Sparse Skew-Hamiltonian/Hamiltonian Pencils", SIAM
J. Sci. Comput. (22.6), 2001], to the considered class of non-linear eigenvalue problems. Although
the presented method is initially defined on function spaces, it can be implemented using finite
dimensional linear algebra operations.

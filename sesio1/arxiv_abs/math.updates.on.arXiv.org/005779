There has recently been much activity within the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class spurred
by the construction of the canonical limiting object, the parabolic Airy sheet $\mathcal{S}:\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}$
[arXiv:1812.00309]. The parabolic Airy sheet provides a coupling of parabolic Airy$_2$ processes
-- a universal limiting geodesic weight profile in planar last passage percolation models -- and
a natural goal is to understand this coupling. Geodesic geometry suggests that the difference of
two parabolic Airy$_2$ processes, i.e., a difference profile, encodes important structural information.
This difference profile $\mathcal{D}$, given by $\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}:x\mapsto \mathcal{S}(1,x)-\mathcal{S}(-1,x)$,
was first studied by Basu, Ganguly, and Hammond [arXiv:1904.01717], who showed that it is monotone
and almost everywhere constant, with its points of non-constancy forming a set of Hausdorff dimension
$1/2$. Noticing that this is also the Hausdorff dimension of the zero set of Brownian motion, we adopt
a different approach. Establishing previously inaccessible fractal structure of $\mathcal{D}$,
we prove, on a global scale, that $\mathcal{D}$ is absolutely continuous on compact sets to Brownian
local time (of rate four) in the sense of increments, which also yields the main result of [arXiv:1904.01717]
as a simple corollary. Further, on a local scale, we explicitly obtain Brownian local time of rate
four as a local limit of $\mathcal{D}$ at a point of increase, picked by a number of methods, including
at a typical point sampled according to the distribution function $\mathcal{D}$. Our arguments
rely on the representation of $\mathcal{S}$ in terms of a last passage problem through the parabolic
Airy line ensemble and an understanding of geodesic geometry at deterministic and random times.

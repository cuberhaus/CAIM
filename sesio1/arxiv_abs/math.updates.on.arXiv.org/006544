Recent results by various authors have established a "model deformation phenomenon" in random
matrix theory. Specifically, it is possible to construct pairs of random matrix models such that
the limiting eigenvalue distributions are connected by push-forward under an explicitly constructible
map of the plane to itself. In this paper, we argue that the analogous transformation at the finite-$N$
level can be accomplished by applying an appropriate heat flow to the characteristic polynomial
of the first model. Let the "second moment" of a random polynomial $p$ denote the expectation value
of the square of the absolute value of $p.$ We find certain pairs of random matrix models and we apply
a certain heat-type operator to the characteristic polynomial $p_{1}$ of the first model, giving
a new polynomial $q.$ We prove that the second moment of $q$ is equal to the second moment of the characteristic
polynomial $p_{2}$ of the second model. This result leads to several conjectures of the following
sort: when $N$ is large, the zeros of $q$ have the same bulk distribution as the zeros of $p_{2},$ namely
the eigenvalues of the second random matrix model. At a more refined level, we conjecture that, as
the characteristic polynomial of the first model evolves under the appropriate heat flow, its zeros
will evolve close to the characteristic curves of a certain PDE. All conjectures are formulated
in "additive" and "multiplicative" forms. As a special case, suppose we apply the standard heat
operator for time $1/N$ to the characteristic polynomial $p$ of an $N\times N$ GUE matrix, giving
a new polynomial $q.$ We conjecture that the zeros of $q$ will be asymptotically uniformly distributed
over the unit disk. That is, the heat operator converts the distribution of zeros from semicircular
to circular.

Predictive risk scores estimating probabilities for a binary outcome on the basis of observed covariates
are frequently developed with the intent of avoiding that outcome by intervening on covariates
in response to estimated risks. Since risk scores are usually developed in complex systems, interventions
often take the form of expert actors responding to estimated risks as they best see fit. In this case,
interventions may be complex and their effects difficult to observe or infer, meaning that explicit
specification of interventions in response to risk scores is impractical. The capacity to design
the aggregate model-intervention scheme in a way which optimises objectives is hence limited.
We propose an algorithm by which a model-intervention scheme can be developed by `stacking' possibly
unknown intervention effects. By repeatedly observing and updating the intervention and model,
this scheme leads to convergence or almost-convergence of eventual outcome risk to an equivocal
value for any initial value of covariates, given reasonable assumptions. Roughly, our approach
involves deploying a series of risk scores to expert actors, with instructions to act on them in succession.
Our algorithm uses only observations of pre-intervention covariates and the eventual outcome
as input. It is not necessary to know the action of the intervention, other than a general assumption
that it is `well-intentioned'. This algorithm can also be used to safely update risk scores in the
presence of unknown interventions, an important contemporary problem in machine learning. We
demonstrate convergence of expectation of outcome in a range of settings, and give sufficient conditions
for convergence in distribution of covariate values. Finally, we demonstrate a potential practical
implementation by simulation to optimise population-level outcome frequency.

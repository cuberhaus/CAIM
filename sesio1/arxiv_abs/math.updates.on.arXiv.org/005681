A finitely-additive measure $\lambda $ on an infinite-dimensional real Hilbert space $E$ which
is invariant with respect to shifts and orthogonal mappings has been defined. This measure can be
considered as the analog of the Lebesgue measure in the sense of its invariance with respect to the
above transformations. The constructed measure is defined on the ring $\cal R$ of subsets of the
Hilbert space generated by measurable rectangles. A measurable rectangle is an infinite-dimensional
parallelepiped such that the product of the lengths of its edges converges unconditionally. The
shift and rotation-invariant measure is obtained as a continuation of a family of shift-invariant
measures $\lambda _{\cal E}$, where each measure $\lambda _{\cal E}$ is defined on the ring ${\cal
R}_{\cal E}$ of measurable rectangles with edges collinear to the vectors of some orthonormal basis
$\cal E$ in the space $E$. An equivalence relation is introduced on the set of orthonormal bases in
terms of the transition matrix from one orthonormal basis to another. The equivalence relation
allows to glue measures defined on the subset rings corresponding to different bases into the one
measure $\lambda $ defined on the unique ring $\cal R$. The obtained measure $\lambda $ is invariant
with respect to shifts and rotations. The decomposition of the measure $\lambda$ into the sum of
mutually singular shift-invariant measures is obtained. The paper describes the structure of
the space $\cal H$ of numerical functions square integrable with respect to the constructed shift
and rotation-invariant measure $\lambda $. The decomposition of the space $\cal H$ into the orthogonal
sum of subspaces corresponding to all possible equivalence classes of bases is obtained. Unitary
groups acting by means of orthogonal transformations of the argument in the space $\cal H$ of square
integrable functions are investigated.

Estimating contraction rates for maps induced by dynamical systems is a widely used method in stability
analysis and control theory. In smoothly varying inner-product spaces, such as $\mathbb{R}^n$
and $\mathbb{C}^n$ with Riemannian metrics, these rates can be tightly estimated by bounding the
real numerical range of the Jacobian of the generating vector field. However, vector spaces with
norms other than $L^2$ may commonly arise in the stability analysis of finite- and infinite-dimensional
problems such as regularized gradient descent and partial differential equations. To this end,
we presented a unified approach to contraction analysis in Banach spaces using the theory of weighted
semi-inner products, in the sense of Lumer. We generalize the notion of contraction in a geodesic
distance to asymptotic stability of perturbations in smoothly varying semi-inner products, and
show that the latter is a dynamical invariant similar to the coordinate-invariance of Lyapunov
exponents. We show that contraction in particular weighted spaces verifies asymptotic convergence
to subspaces and submanifolds, and present applications to limit-cycle analysis and phase-locking
phenomena. Using a differential analysis, we present conditions under which feedback systems
in Banach spaces and their constituents inherit contraction properties from each other, and generalize
various combination properties previously shown in $L^2$. We discuss the application of contraction
rates in Sobolev spaces for retention of regularity in partial differential equations, and suggest
a type of weak solution defined by a vanishing contraction. Lastly, we present an application to
machine learning, using weighted semi-inner products to derive stability conditions for functional
gradient descent in a Banach space.

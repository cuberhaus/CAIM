We use Transition Path Theory (TPT) to frame, in a statistically more robust fashion than earlier
analyses, equatorward routes of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) in the subpolar North Atlantic.
TPT is applied on all available RAFOS and Argo floats in the area by means of a discretization of the
Lagrangian dynamics described by their trajectories. By considering floats at different depths,
we investigate transition paths of NADW in its upper (UNADW) and lower (LNADW) layers. We find that
the majority of UNADW transition paths sourced in the Labrador and southwestern Irminger Seas reach
the western side of a target arranged zonally along the southern edge of the subpolar North Atlantic
domain visited by the floats. This is accomplished in the form of a well-organized deep boundary
current (DBC). LNADW transition paths sourced west of the Reykjanes Ridge reveal a similar pattern,
while those sourced east of the ridge are found to hit the western side of the target via a DBC and also
several other places along it in a less organized fashion, indicating southward flow along the eastern
and western flanks of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Naked-eye inspection of trajectories suggest generally
much more diffusive equatorward NADW routes. A source-independent dynamical decomposition of
the flow domain into analogous backward-time basins of attraction, beyond the reach of direct inspection
of trajectories, reveals a much wider influence of the western side of the target for UNADW than for
LNADW. For UNADW, the average expected duration of the pathways from the Labrador and Irminger Seas
was found to be of 2 to 3 years. For LNADW, the duration was found to be influenced by the Reykjanes Ridge,
being as long as 8 years from the western side of the ridge and of about 3 years on average from its eastern
side.

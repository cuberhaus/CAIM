In customer support contact centers, every service interaction involves a messaging dialogue
between a customer and an agent. Both parties depend on one another for information and problem solving,
hence this interaction defines a co-produced service process. In this paper, we develop and compare
new stochastic models for service co-production in contact centers. A key observation is that this
service interaction features cross- and self-exciting dynamics within each conversation. The
cross-excitation stems from the two parties responding to one another, and the self-excitation
captures one party sending follow-ups to their own prior message. Hence, messages beget messages,
and we capture this phenomenon by introducing Hawkes point process models of the conversational
services, which depend on the conversation's history, on the customer-agent relationships, and
on the state of the system. To evaluate our service co-production models, we apply them to an industry
contact center dataset containing nearly 5 million messages. We show that the Hawkes models better
represent the service dynamics than classic Poisson and phase-type models do. Indeed, we find that
service interactions are characterized by strong agent-customer dependency and by the centrality
of the process's cross- and self-excitation attributes. Finally, we use the proposed models to
improve upon popular routing algorithms used in contact centers. We show how dynamic routing based
on Hawkes process predictions outperforms well-known concurrency-based routing rules. Large
data-driven simulation experiments show that this Hawkes-based routing significantly reduces
customer waiting time, demonstrating how these history-dependent stochastic models can improve
operational decision making in practice.

In the present paper, a new three-scale asymptotic homogenization method is proposed to study the
electrical behavior of the cardiac tissue structure with multiple heterogeneities at two different
levels. The first level is associated with the mesoscopic structure such that the cardiac tissue
is composed of extracellular and intracellular domains. The second level is associated with the
microscopic structure in such a way the intracellular medium can only be viewed as a periodical layout
of unit cells (mitochondria). Then, we define two kinds of local cells that are obtained by upscaling
methods. The homogenization method is based on a power series expansion which allows determining
the macroscopic (homogenized) bidomain model from the microscopic bidomain problem at each structural
level. First, we use the two-scale asymptotic expansion to homogenize the extracellular problem.
Then, we apply a three-scale asymptotic expansion in the intracellular problem to obtain its homogenized
equation at two levels. The first upscaling level of the intracellular structure yields the mesoscopic
equation and the second step of the homogenization leads to obtain the intracellular homogenized
equation. Both the mesoscopic and microscopic information is obtained by homogenization to capture
local characteristics inside the cardiac tissue structure. Finally, we obtain the macroscopic
bidomain model and the heart domain coincides with the intracellular medium and extracellular
one, which are two inter-penetrating and superimposed continua connected at each point by the cardiac
cellular membrane. The interest of the proposed method comes from the fact that it combines microscopic
and mesoscopic characteristics to obtain a macroscopic description of the electrical behavior
of the heart.

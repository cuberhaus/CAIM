Among probability measures on $d$-dimensional real projective space, one which maximizes the
expected angle $\arccos(\frac{x}{|x|}\cdot \frac{y}{|y|})$ between independently drawn projective
points $x$ and $y$ was conjectured to equidistribute its mass over the standard Euclidean basis
$\{e_0,e_1,\ldots, e_d\}$ by Fejes T\'oth \cite{FT59}. If true, this conjecture evidently implies
the same measure maximizes the expectation of $\arccos^\alpha(\frac{x}{|x|}\cdot \frac{y}{|y|})$
for any exponent $\alpha > 1$. The kernel $\arccos^\alpha(\frac{x}{|x|}\cdot \frac{y}{|y|})$
represents the objective of an infinite-dimensional quadratic program. We verify discrete and
continuous versions of this {milder} conjecture in a non-empty range $\alpha > \alpha_{\Delta^d}
\ge 1$, and establish uniqueness of the resulting maximizer $\hat \mu$ up to rotation. We show $\hat
\mu$ no longer maximizes when $\alpha<\alpha_{\Delta^d}$. At the endpoint $\alpha=\alpha_{\Delta^d}$
of this range, we show another maximizer $\mu$ must also exist which is not a rotation of $\hat \mu$.
For the continuous version of the conjecture, an appendix provided by Bilyk et al in response to an
earlier draft of this work combines with the present improvements to yield $\alpha_{\Delta^d}<2$.
The original conjecture $\ald=1$ remains open (unless $d=1$). However, in the maximum possible
range $\alpha>1$, we show $\hat \mu$ and its rotations maximize the aforementioned expectation
uniquely on a sufficiently small ball in the $L^\infty$-Kantorovich-Rubinstein-Wasserstein
metric $d_\infty$ from optimal transportation; the same is true for any measure $\mu$ which is mutually
absolutely continuous with respect to $\hat \mu$, but the size of the ball depends on {$\alpha,d$,
and} $\|\frac{d \hat \mu}{d\mu}\|_{\infty}$.

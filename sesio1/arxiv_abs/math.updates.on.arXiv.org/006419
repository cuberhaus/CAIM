We study the transverse dynamics of two-dimensional traveling periodic waves for the gravity--capillary
water-wave problem. The governing equations are the Euler equations for the irrotational flow
of an inviscid fluid layer with free surface under the forces of gravity and surface tension. We focus
on two open sets of dimensionless parameters $(\alpha,\beta)$, where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are
the inverse square of the Froude number and the Weber number, respectively. For each arbitrary but
fixed pair $(\alpha,\beta)$ in one of these sets, two-dimensional traveling periodic waves bifurcate
from the trivial constant flow. In one open set we find a one-parameter family of periodic waves,
whereas in the other open set we find two geometrically distinct one-parameter families of periodic
waves. Starting from a transverse spatial dynamics formulation of the governing equations, we
investigate the transverse linear instability of these periodic waves and the induced dimension-breaking
bifurcation. The two results share a common analysis of the purely imaginary spectrum of the linearization
at a periodic wave. We apply a simple general criterion for the transverse linear instability problem
and a Lyapunov center theorem for the dimension-breaking bifurcation. For parameters $(\alpha,\beta)$
in the open set where there is only one family of periodic waves, we prove that these waves are linearly
transversely unstable. For the other open set, we show that the waves with larger wavenumber are
transversely linearly unstable. We also identify an open subset of parameters for which both families
of periodic waves are tranversely linearly unstable. For each of these transversely linearly unstable
periodic waves, a dimension-breaking bifurcation occurs in which three-dimensional doubly periodic
waves bifurcate from the two-dimensional periodic wave.

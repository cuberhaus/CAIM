In this paper, for symplectic and split odd special orthogonal groups, following Atobe's refinement
on Moeglin's construction of local Arthur packets, we give new algorithms, comparing to those given
by Atobe ([Ato22]), to determine whether a given representation is of Arthur type, and determine
all local Arthur packets containing a representation of Arthur type. Our algorithms depend on certain
operators on construction data, each of which preserves representations, forming a proper subset
of those used by Atobe. In particular, for any representation $\pi$ of Arthur type, we give a precise
formula to compute the set $$ \{ \text{local Arthur parameter }\psi \ | \ \text{the local Arthur packet
} \Pi_{\psi} \text{ contains } \pi\}.$$ Our main results have four applications as follows. (1).
We give a classification of all the local Arthur packets which contain tempered representations,
and give the precise number of the tempered representations in any local Arthur packet and describe
their $L$-data. We also give a classification of all the local Arthur packets which have non-trivial
intersection with a given tempered local Arthur packet. (2). We prove the enhanced Shahidi's conjecture,
which says that local Arthur packets are tempered if and only if they have generic members. (3). We
give a complete description of the construction data for representations in the $L$-packet of any
given local Arthur packet. (4). For each representation of Arthur type, we specify a unique construction
data satisfying the property that if this representation lies in the $L$-packet of a local Arthur
packet then this construction data provides exactly the corresponding local Arthur parameter.
This result suggests an answer to the mysterious question of determining which local Arthur parameter
is "the" parameter for a representation if it lies in several local Arthur packets.

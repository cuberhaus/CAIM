For a free filter $F$ on $\omega$, endow the space $N_F=\omega\cup\{p_F\}$, where $p_F\not\in\omega$,
with the topology in which every element of $\omega$ is isolated whereas all open neighborhoods
of $p_F$ are of the form $A\cup\{p_F\}$ for $A\in F$. Spaces of the form $N_F$ constitute the class
of the simplest non-discrete Tychonoff spaces. The aim of this paper is to study them in the context
of the celebrated Josefson--Nissenzweig theorem from Banach space theory. We prove, e.g., that
a space $N_F$ carries a sequence $\langle\mu_n\colon n\in\omega\rangle$ of normalized finitely
supported signed measures such that $\mu_n(f)\to 0$ for every bounded continuous real-valued
function $f$ on $N_F$ if and only if there is a density submeasure $\varphi$ on $\omega$ such that
the dual ideal $F^*$ is contained in the exhaustive ideal $\mbox{Exh}(\varphi)$. Consequently,
we get that if $F$ is a free filter on $\omega$ contained in the filter dual to a density ideal, then:
(1) if $X$ is a Tychonoff space and $N_F$ is homeomorphic to a subspace of $X$, then the space $C_p^*(X)$
of bounded continuous real-valued functions on $X$ contains a complemented copy of the space $c_0$
endowed with the pointwise topology, (2) if $K$ is a compact Hausdorff space and $N_F$ is homeomorphic
to a subspace of $K$, then the Banach space $C(K)$ of continuous real-valued functions on $K$ is not
a Grothendieck space. The latter result generalizes the well-known fact stating that if a compact
Hausdorff space $K$ contains a non-trivial convergent sequence, then the space $C(K)$ is not Grothendieck.
We also prove that the set of filters which can be covered by filters dual to density ideals contains
a family of $2^\omega$ many mutually non-isomorphic $\mathbb{F}_\sigma$ P-filters and a family
of $2^{2^\omega}$ many mutually non-isomorphic non-Borel filters.

The symmetric binary perceptron ($\texttt{SBP}$) exhibits a dramatic statistical-to-computational
gap: the densities at which known efficient algorithms find solutions are far below the threshold
for the existence of solutions. Furthermore, the $\texttt{SBP}$ exhibits a striking structural
property: at all positive constraint densities almost all of its solutions are 'totally frozen'
singletons separated by large Hamming distance \cite{perkins2021frozen,abbe2021proof}. This
suggests that finding a solution to the $\texttt{SBP}$ may be computationally intractable. At
the same time, the $\texttt{SBP}$ does admit polynomial-time search algorithms at low enough densities.
A conjectural explanation for this conundrum was put forth in \cite{baldassi2020clustering}:
efficient algorithms succeed in the face of freezing by finding exponentially rare clusters of
large size. However, it was discovered recently that such rare large clusters exist at all subcritical
densities, even at those well above the limits of known efficient algorithms \cite{abbe2021binary}.
Thus the driver of the statistical-to-computational gap exhibited by this model remains a mystery.
In this paper, we conduct a different landscape analysis to explain the algorithmic tractability
of this problem. We show that at high enough densities the $\texttt{SBP}$ exhibits the multi Overlap
Gap Property ($m-$OGP), an intricate geometrical property known to be a rigorous barrier for large
classes of algorithms. Our analysis shows that the $m-$OGP threshold (a) is well below the satisfiability
threshold; and (b) matches the best known algorithmic threshold up to logarithmic factors as $m\to\infty$.
We then prove that the $m-$OGP rules out the class of stable algorithms for the $\texttt{SBP}$ above
this threshold. We conjecture that the $m \to \infty$ limit of the $m$-OGP threshold marks the algorithmic
threshold for the problem.

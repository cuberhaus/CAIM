We consider a multiperiod stochastic capacitated facility location problem under uncertain demand
and budget in each period. Using a scenario tree representation of the uncertainties, we formulate
a multistage stochastic integer program to dynamically locate facilities in each period and compare
it with a two-stage approach that determines the facility locations up front. In the multistage
model, in each stage, a decision maker optimizes facility locations and recourse flows from open
facilities to demand sites, to minimize certain risk measures of the cost associated with current
facility location and shipment decisions. When the budget is also uncertain, a popular modeling
framework is to prioritize the candidate sites. In the two-stage model, the priority list is decided
in advance and fixed through all periods, while in the multistage model, the priority list can change
adaptively. In each period, the decision maker follows the priority list to open facilities according
to the realized budget, and optimizes recourse flows given the realized demand. Using expected
conditional risk measures (ECRMs), we derive tight lower bounds for the gaps between the optimal
objective values of risk-averse multistage models and their two-stage counterparts in both settings
with and without prioritization. Moreover, we propose two approximation algorithms to efficiently
solve risk-averse two-stage and multistage models without prioritization, which are asymptotically
optimal under an expanding market assumption. We also design a set of super-valid inequalities
for risk-averse two-stage and multistage stochastic programs with prioritization to reduce the
computational time. We conduct numerical studies using both randomly generated and real-world
instances with diverse sizes, to demonstrate the tightness of the analytical bounds and efficacy
of the approximation algorithms and prioritization cuts.

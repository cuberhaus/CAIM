This book is devoted to exploring properties of generalized Herz spaces and establishing a complete
real-variable theory of Hardy spaces associated with local and global generalized Herz spaces
via a totally fresh perspective which means that the authors view these generalized Herz spaces
as special cases of ball quasi-Banach function spaces. To be precise, in this book, the authors first
study some basic properties of generalized Herz spaces and obtain boundedness and compactness
characterizations of commutators on them. Then the authors introduce the associated Herz-Hardy
spaces, local Herz-Hardy spaces, and weak Herz-Hardy spaces, and develop a complete real-variable
theory of these Herz-Hardy spaces, including their various maximal function, atomic, finite atomic,
molecular as well as various Littlewood-Paley function characterizations. As applications,
the authors establish the boundedness of some important operators arising from harmonic analysis
on these Herz-Hardy spaces. Finally, the inhomogeneous Herz-Hardy spaces and their complete real-variable
theory are also investigated. Due to the deficiency of the associate space of the global Herz space,
the known real-variable characterizations about Hardy-type spaces associated with ball quasi-Banach
function spaces are not applicable to Hardy spaces associated with global generalized Herz spaces
which need an improved generalization of the existing one, done by the authors also in this book and
having more additional anticipating applications. The authors should also point out that, with
the fresh perspective and the improved conclusions on the real-variable theory of Hardy spaces
associated with ball quasi-Banach function spaces, the exponents in all the obtained results of
this book are sharp. Moreover, all of these results in this book are new and have never been published
before.

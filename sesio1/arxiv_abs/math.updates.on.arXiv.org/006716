Let $K$ be a field and $G$ be a group of its automorphisms endowed with the compact-open topology.
There are many situations, where it is natural to study the category $Sm_K(G)$ of smooth (i.e. with
open stabilizers) $K$-semilinear representations of $G$. The category $Sm_K(G)$ is semisimple
(in which case $K$ is a generator of $Sm_K(G)$) if and only if $G$ is precompact. In this note we study
the case of the non-precompact group $G$ of all permutations of an infinite set $S$. It is shown that
the categories $Sm_K(G)$ are locally noetherian; the morphisms are `locally split'. Given a field
$F$ and a subfield $k\neq F$ algebraically closed in $F$, one of principal results describes the
Gabriel spectra (and related objects) of the categories $Sm_K(G)$ for some of $G$-invariant subfields
$K$ of the fraction field $F_{k,S}$ of the tensor product over $k$ of the labeled by $S$ copies of $F$.
In particular, the object $F_{k,S}$ turns out to be an injective cogenerator of the category $Sm_K(G)$
for any $G$-invariant subfield $K$ of $F_{k,S}$. As an application, when transcendence degree
of $F|k$ is 1, a correspondence between the $G$-invariant subfields of $F_{k,S}$ algebraically
closed in $F_{k,S}$ and certain systems of isogenies of `generically $F$-pointed' torsors over
absolutely irreducible one-dimensional algebraic $k$-groups is constructed, so far only in characteristic
0. The only irreducible finite-dimensional smooth representation of $G$ is trivial. However,
under some mild restriction on the field $k$, for each integer $0<n<6$ it is possible to find an invariant
subfield $K$ of $k(S)$ and an irreducible non-trivial $n$-dimensional smooth $K$-semilinear
representation of $G$. It is likely that there are no such representations for $n>5$. In general,
any smooth $G$-field $K$ admits a smooth $G$-field extension $L|K$ such that $L$ is a cogenerator
of $Sm_L(G)$.

Consider an interacting particle system indexed by the vertices of a (possibly random) locally
finite graph whose vertices and edges are equipped with marks representing parameters of the model
such as the environment and initial conditions. Each particle takes values in a countable state
space and evolves according to a pure jump process whose jump intensities depend on only the states
(or histories) and marks of itself and particles and edges in its neighborhood. Under mild conditions,
it is shown that if the sequence of (marked) interaction graphs converges locally in probability
to a limit (marked) graph that satisfies a certain finite dissociability property, then the corresponding
sequence of empirical measures of the particle trajectories converges weakly to the law of the marginal
dynamics at the root vertex of the limit graph. The proof of this limit relies on several results of
independent interest. First, such interacting particle systems are shown to be well-posed on almost
surely finitely dissociable graphs, which include graphs of maximal bounded degree and any Galton-Watson
tree whose offspring distribution has a finite first moment. A counterexample is provided to show
that well-posedness can fail for dynamics on graphs outside this class. Second, the dynamics on
a locally convergent sequence of graphs are shown to converge in the local weak sense to the dynamics
on the limit graph when the latter is finitely dissociable. Finally, the dynamics are also shown
to exhibit an (annealed) asymptotic correlation decay property. These results complement recent
work that establishes hydrodynamic limits of locally interacting probabilistic cellular automata
and diffusions on sparse random graphs. However, the analysis of jump processes requires very different
techniques, including percolation arguments and notions such as (consistent) spatial localization
and causal chains.

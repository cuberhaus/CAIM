For the study of the Mordell-Weil group of an elliptic curve ${\bf E}$ over a complex function field
of a projective curve $B$, the first author introduced the use of differential-geometric methods
arising from K\"ahler metrics on $\mathcal H \times \mathbb C$ invariant under the action of the
semi-direct product ${\rm SL}(2,\mathbb R) \ltimes \mathbb R^2$. To a properly chosen geometric
model $\pi: \mathcal E \to B$ of ${\bf E}$ as an elliptic surface and a non-torsion holomorphic section
$\sigma: B \to \mathcal E$ there is an associated ``verticality'' $\eta_\sigma$ of $\sigma$ related
to the locally defined Betti map. The first-order linear differential equation satisfied by $\eta_\sigma$,
expressed in terms of invariant metrics, is made use of to count the zeros of $\eta_\sigma$, in the
case when the regular locus $B^0\subset B$ of $\pi: \mathcal E \to B$ admits a classifying map $f_0$
into a modular curve for elliptic curves with level-$k$ structure, $k \ge 3$, explicitly and linearly
in terms of the degree of the ramification divisor $R_{f_0}$ of the classifying map, and the degree
of the log-canonical line bundle of $B^0$ in $B$. Our method highlights ${\rm deg}(R_{f_0})$ in
the estimates, and recovers the effective estimate obtained by a different method of Ulmer-Urz\'ua
on the multiplicities of the Betti map associated to a non-torsion section, noting that the finiteness
of zeros of $\eta_\sigma$ was due to Corvaja-Demeio-Masser-Zannier. The role of $R_{f_0}$ is natural
in the subject given that in the case of an elliptic modular surface there is no non-torsion section
by a theorem of Shioda, for which a differential-geometric proof had been given by the first author.
Our approach sheds light on the study of non-torsion sections of certain abelian schemes.

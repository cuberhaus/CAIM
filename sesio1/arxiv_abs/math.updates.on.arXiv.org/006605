We study two continuous-time Markov chains modeling the spread of infections on graphs, namely
the SIS and the SIRS model. In the SIS model, vertices are either susceptible or infected; each infected
vertex becomes susceptible at rate 1 and infects each of its neighbors independently at rate $\lambda$.
In the SIRS model, vertices are either susceptible, infected, or recovered; each infected vertex
becomes recovered at rate 1 and infects each of its susceptible neighbors independently at rate
$\lambda$; each recovered vertex becomes susceptible at a rate $\varrho$, which we assume to be
independent of the size of the graph. The survival time of the SIS process, i.e., the time until no
vertex of the host graph is infected, is fairly well understood for a variety of graph classes. Stars
are an important graph class for the SIS model, as the survival time of SIS on stars has been used to
show that the process survives on real-world graphs for a long time. For the SIRS model, however,
to the best of our knowledge, there are no rigorous results, even for simple graphs such as stars.
We analyze the survival time of the SIS and the SIRS process on stars and cliques. We determine three
threshold values for $\lambda$ such that when $\lambda<\lambda_\ell$, the expected survival
time of the process is at most logarithmic, when $\lambda<\lambda_p$, it is at most polynomial,
and when $\lambda>\lambda_s$, it is at least super-polynomial in the number of vertices. Our results
show that the survival time of the two processes behaves fundamentally different on stars, while
it behaves fairly similar on cliques. Our analyses bound the drift of potential functions with globally
stable equilibrium points. On the SIRS process, our two-state potential functions are inspired
by Lyapunov functions used in mean-field theory.

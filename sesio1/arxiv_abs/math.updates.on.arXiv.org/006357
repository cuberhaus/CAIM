The unit commitment problem is a short-term planning problem in the energy industry. Dantzig-Wolfe
decomposition is a popular approach to solve the problem. This paper focuses on primal heuristics
used with Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition. We propose two primal heuristics: one based on decomposition
and one based on machine learning. The first one uses the fractional solution to the restricted master
problem to fix a subset of the integer variables. In each iteration of the column generation procedure,
the primal heuristic obtains the fractional solution, checks whether each binary variable satisfies
the integrality constraint and fix those which do. The remaining variables are then optimised quickly
by a solver to find a feasible, near-optimal solution to the original instance. The other primal
heuristic based on machine learning is of interest when the problems are to be solved repeatedly
with different demand data but with the same problem structure. The primal heuristic uses a pre-trained
neural network to fix a subset of the integer variables. In the training phase, a neural network is
trained to predict for any demand data and for each binary variable how likely it is that the variable
takes each of two possible values. After the training, given an instance to be solved, the prediction
of the model is used with a rounding threshold to fix some binary variables. Our numerical experiments
compare our methods with solving the undecomposed problem and also with other primal heuristics
from the literature. The experiments reveal that the primal heuristic based on machine learning
is superior when the suboptimality tolerance is relatively large, such as 0.5% or 0.25%, while the
decomposition is the best when the tolerance is small, for example 0.1%.

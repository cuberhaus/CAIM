Solving zero-dimensional polynomial systems using Gr\"obner bases is usually done by, first,
computing a Gr\"obner basis for the degree reverse lexicographic order, and next computing the
lexicographic Gr\"obner basis with a change of order algorithm. Currently, the change of order
now takes a significant part of the whole solving time for many generic instances. Like the fastest
known change of order algorithms, this work focuses on the situation where the ideal defined by the
system satisfies natural properties which can be recovered in generic coordinates. First, the
ideal has a \emph{shape} lexicographic Gr\"obner basis. Second, the set of leading terms with respect
to the degree reverse lexicographic order has a \emph{stability} property; in particular, the
multiplication matrix can be read on the input Gr\"obner basis. The current fastest algorithms
rely on the sparsity of this matrix. Actually, this sparsity is a consequence of an algebraic structure,
which can be exploited to represent the matrix concisely as a univariate polynomial matrix. We show
that the Hermite normal form of that matrix yields the sought lexicographic Gr\"obner basis, under
assumptions which cover the shape position case. Under some mild assumption implying $n \le t$,
the arithmetic complexity of our algorithm is $O\tilde{~}(t^{\omega-1}D)$, where $n$ is the number
of variables, $t$ is a sparsity indicator of the aforementioned matrix, $D$ is the degree of the zero-dimensional
ideal under consideration, and $\omega$ is the exponent of matrix multiplication. This improves
upon both state-of-the-art complexity bounds $O\tilde{~}(tD^2)$ and $O\tilde{~}(D^\omega)$,
since $\omega < 3$ and $t\le D$. Practical experiments, based on the libraries msolve and PML, confirm
the high practical benefit.

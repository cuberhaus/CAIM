Early literature on genome rearrangement modelling views the problem of computing evolutionary
distances as an inherently combinatorial one. In particular, attention was given to estimating
distances using the minimum number of events required to transform one genome into another. In hindsight,
this approach is analogous to early methods for inferring phylogenetic trees from DNA sequences
such as maximum parsimony -- both are motivated by the principle that the true distance minimises
evolutionary change, and both are effective if this principle is a true reflection of reality. Recent
literature considers genome rearrangement under statistical models, continuing this parallel
with DNA-based methods; the goal here is to use model-based methods (for example maximum likelihood
techniques) to compute distance estimates that incorporate the large number of rearrangement
paths that can transform one genome into another. Crucially, this approach requires one to decide
upon a set of feasible rearrangement events and, in this paper, we focus on characterising well-motivated
models for signed, uni-chromosomal circular genomes, where the number of regions remains fixed.
Since rearrangements are often mathematically described using permutations, we isolate the sets
of permutations representing rearrangements that are biologically reasonable in this context,
for example inversions and translocations. We provide precise mathematical expressions for these
rearrangements, and then describe them in terms of the set of cuts made in the genome when they are
applied. We directly compare cuts to breakpoints, and use this concept to count the distinct rearrangement
actions which apply a given number of cuts. Finally, we provide some examples of rearrangement models,
and include a discussion of some questions that arise when defining plausible models.

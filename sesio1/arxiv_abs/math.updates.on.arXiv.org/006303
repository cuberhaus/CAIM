In $d$ dimensions, approximating an arbitrary function oscillating with frequency $\lesssim
k$ requires $\sim k^d$ degrees of freedom. A numerical method for solving the Helmholtz equation
(with wavenumber $k$) suffers from the pollution effect if, as $k\to \infty$, the total number of
degrees of freedom needed to maintain accuracy grows faster than this natural threshold. While
the $h$-version of the finite element method (FEM) (where accuracy is increased by decreasing the
meshwidth $h$ and keeping the polynomial degree $p$ fixed) suffers from the pollution effect, the
celebrated papers [Melenk, Sauter 2010], [Melenk, Sauter 2011], [Esterhazy, Melenk 2012], and
[Melenk, Parsania, Sauter 2013] showed that the $hp$-FEM (where accuracy is increased by decreasing
the meshwidth $h$ and increasing the polynomial degree $p$) applied to a variety of constant-coefficient
Helmholtz problems does not suffer from the pollution effect. The heart of the proofs of these results
is a PDE result splitting the solution of the Helmholtz equation into "high" and "low" frequency
components. The main novelty of the present paper is that we prove this splitting for the constant-coefficient
Helmholtz equation in full-space (i.e., in $\mathbb{R}^d$) using only integration by parts and
elementary properties of the Fourier transform (this is contrast to the proof for this set-up in
[Melenk, Sauter 2010] which uses somewhat-involved bounds on Bessel and Hankel functions). We
combine this splitting with (i) standard arguments about convergence of the FEM applied to the Helmholtz
equation (the so-called "Schatz argument", which we reproduce here) and (ii) polynomial-approximation
results (which we quote from the literature without proof) to give a simple proof that the $hp$-FEM
does not suffer from the pollution effect for the constant-coefficient full-space Helmholtz equation.

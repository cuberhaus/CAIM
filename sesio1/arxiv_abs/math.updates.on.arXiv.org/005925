We resolve the problem of optimal regularity and Uhlenbeck compactness for affine connections
in General Relativity and Mathematical Physics. First, we prove that any connection $\Gamma$ defined
on the tangent bundle of an arbitrary differentiable manifold, satisfying the condition that in
some coordinate system the components of $\Gamma$ are bounded in $L^{2p}$, and the components of
its Riemann curvature tensor are bounded in $L^p$, can be smoothed by coordinate transformation
to optimal regularity, $\Gamma \in W^{1,p}$ (one derivative smoother than the curvature), $p>
\max\{n/2,2\}$, dimension $n\geq 2$. For Lorentzian metrics in General Relativity this implies
that shock wave solutions of the Einstein-Euler equations are non-singular -- geodesic curves,
locally inertial coordinates and the Newtonian limit, all exist in a classical sense. The proof
is based on extending authors' existence theory for the Regularity Transformation (RT) equations
by one order, to the level of $L^{2p}$ connections with $L^p$ curvature, and to accomplish this we
introduce the reduced RT-equations, a system of elliptic partial differential equations for the
Jacobians of the regularizing coordinate transformations. Secondly, we prove that this existence
theory suffices to extend Uhlenbeck compactness from the case of connections on vector bundles
over Riemannian manifolds, to the case of (affine) connections bounded in $L^\infty$ with $L^{p}$
curvature, ($p>n$), defined on the tangent bundle of arbitrary manifolds, including Lorentzian
manifolds of relativistic Physics. By this, Uhlenbeck compactness and optimal regularity are
pure logical consequences of the rule which defines how connections transform from one coordinate
system to another -- the starting assumption of geometry.

Wave front propagation with non-trivial bottom topography is studied within the formalism of hyperbolic
long wave models. Evolution of non-smooth initial data is examined, and in particular the splitting
of singular points and their short time behaviour is described. In the opposite limit of longer times,
the local analysis of wavefronts is used to estimate the gradient catastrophe formation and how
this is influenced by the topography. The limiting cases when the free surface intersects the bottom
boundary, belonging to the so-called "physical" and "non-physical" vacuum classes, are examined.
Solutions expressed by power series in the spatial variable lead to a hierarchy of ordinary differential
equations for the time-dependent series coefficients, which are shown to reveal basic differences
between the two vacuum cases: for non-physical vacuums, the equations of the hierarchy are recursive
and linear past the first two pairs, while for physical vacuums the hierarchy is non-recursive,
fully coupled and nonlinear. The former case may admit solutions that are free of singularities
for nonzero time intervals, while the latter is shown to develop non-standard velocity shocks instantaneously.
We show that truncation to finite dimensional systems and polynomial solutions is in general only
possible for the case of a quadratic bottom profile. In this case the system's evolution can reduce
to, and is completely described by, a low dimensional dynamical system for the time-dependent coefficients.
This system encapsulates all the nonlinear properties of the solution for general power series
initial data, and in particular governs the loss of regularity in finite times at the dry point. For
the special case of parabolic bottom topographies, an exact, self-similar solution class is introduced
and studied to illustrate via closed form expressions the general results.

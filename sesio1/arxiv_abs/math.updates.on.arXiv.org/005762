We construct solutions for the fractional Yamabe problem in the $n$-dimensional Euclidean space
which are singular along a smooth submanifold of dimension $(n-2s)/2$ and lead to complete metrics.
Here $s\in(0,1)$ is the fractional exponent and we restrict to $s=1/2$ for parity reasons. We perform
a direct integral asymptotic analysis with global geometric weights, based on stability and semilinearity
of the equation. This completes the missing case in a previous work we did in collaboration with Ao,
Fontelos, Gonz\'{a}lez and Wei, where complete singular metrics of dimensions $0<k<(n-2s)/2$
were constructed. Moreover the dimension $(n-2s)/2$ is maximal for the conformal factor to be a
distributional solution. Even so, we conjecture that there exist complete metrics with prescribed
singularities of strictly higher dimensions. We also provide a complete study of the model problem
-- the fractional Lane--Emden equation posed in the punctured ball with Serrin's critical exponent
and homogeneous Dirichlet condition, for all $s\in(0,1)$. First, we construct the profile, show
that it is radially symmetric, and build multiple solutions in a bounded domain with any prescribed
closed singular set. Secondly, we prove a Liouville-type result, asserting the non-existence
of exterior solutions of the model equation without any assumption on its asymptotic behavior.
Finally, we develop new methods to prove that the singular behavior of the profile is unique. In sharp
contrast to known techniques in the literature, our method is based on the striking connection between
the non-local equation and its associated first order ODE. A local continuation argument is then
utilized. This gives an alternative proof to the recent work of Wei and Wu based on adapting the classical
proof in the extension, and it seems to be the first time that a genuinely local ODE is used to study
a non-local elliptic problem.

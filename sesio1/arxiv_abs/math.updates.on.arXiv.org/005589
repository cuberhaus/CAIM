The purpose of this paper is to discuss the relationship between prime numbers and sums of Fibonacci
numbers. One of our main results says that for every sufficiently large integer $k$ there exists
a prime number that can be represented as the sum of k different and non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers.
This property is closely related to, and based on, a prime number theorem for certain morphic sequences.
In our case, these morphic sequences are based on the Zeckendorf sum-of-digits function $z$, which
returns the number of summands in the representation of a nonnegative integer as sum of non-consecutive
Fibonacci numbers. The proof of such a prime number theorem, combined with a corresponding local
result, constitutes the central contribution of this paper, from which the result stated in the
beginning follows. These kinds of problems have been discussed intensively in the context of the
base-$q$ expansion of integers. The Gelfond problems (1968/1969), and the Sarnak conjecture,
were the driving forces of this development. Mauduit and Rivat resolved the question on the sum of
digits of prime numbers (2010) and the sum of digits of squares (2009), thus leaving open only part
of the third Gelfond problem. Later the second author (2017) proved Sarnak's conjecture for the
class of automatic sequences, which are based on the $q$-ary expansion of integers, and which generalize
the sum-of-digits function in base $q$ considerably. In the present paper, we use Gowers norms,
and extend Mauduit and Rivat's method significantly. Employing Gowers norms in our proof allows
us to prove that $\exp(2\pi i \alpha z(n))$ has level of distribution 1. This latter result forms
an essential part of our treatment of the occurring sums of type I and II. An analogous result for the
Thue--Morse sequence has been obtained by the third author (2020).

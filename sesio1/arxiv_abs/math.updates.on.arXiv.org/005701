A moment function is called doubly robust if it is comprised of two nuisance functions and has the
desired property that the estimator based on it is a consistent estimator of the target parameter
even if one of the nuisance functions is misspecified. A common approach for obtaining such a moment
function is based on using the influence function (IF) of the parameter of interest. Robins et al.
(2008) introduced a large class of doubly robust IFs. However, that class does not include the IF
of functionals for which the nuisance functions are solutions to integral equations. Such functionals
are particularly important in the field of causal inference, specifically in the recently proposed
proximal inference framework of (Miao et al., 2018; Tchetgen Tchetgen et al., 2020), which allows
for estimating the average causal effect when unobserved confounders are present in the system.
Motivated by the proximal inference framework, in this paper, we first extend the class of Robins
et al. to include doubly robust IFs in which the nuisance functions are solutions to integral equations.
Then we demonstrate that the double robustness property of these IFs can be leveraged to construct
estimating equations for the nuisance functions, which enables us to solve the integral equations
without resorting to parametric models. The main idea is to choose each nuisance function such that
it minimizes the dependency of the expected value of the moment function to the other nuisance function.
We frame this idea as a minimax optimization problem and use RKHSes as the function spaces. We provide
convergence rates for the nuisance functions and conditions required for asymptotic linearity
of the estimator of the functional of interest. The experiment results demonstrate that our proposed
methodology leads to robust and high-performance estimators for average causal effect in the proximal
inference framework.

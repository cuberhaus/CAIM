We regard a geometric theory classified by a topos as a syntactic presentation for the topos and develop
tools for finding such presentations. Extensions of geometric theories, which can add axioms,
symbols and sorts, are treated as objects in their own right, to be able to build up complex theories
from parts. The role of equivalence extensions, which leave the theory the same up to Morita equivalence,
is investigated. Motivated by the question what the big Zariski topos of a non-affine scheme classifies,
we show how to construct a syntactic presentation for a topos if syntactic presentations for a covering
family of open subtoposes are given. For this, we introduce conditional theory extensions that
require part of the data a model is made of only under some condition given in the form of a closed geometric
formula. We also give a general definition for systems of interdependent theory extensions, to
be able to talk about compatible syntactic presentations not only for the open subtoposes in a given
cover but also for their finite intersections. An important concept for finding classified theories
of toposes in concrete situations is that of theories of presheaf type. We develop several techniques
for extending a theory while preserving the presheaf type property, and give a list of examples of
simple extensions which can destroy it. Finally, we determine a syntactic presentation of the big
crystalline topos of a scheme. In the case of an affine scheme, this is accomplished by showing that
the biggest part of the classified theory is of presheaf type and transforming the site defining
the crystalline topos into the canonical presheaf site for this theory, while the remaining axioms
induce the Zariski topology. Then we can apply our results on gluing classifying toposes to obtain
a classified theory even in the non-affine case.

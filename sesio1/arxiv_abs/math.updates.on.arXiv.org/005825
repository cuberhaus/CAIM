How do spaces emerge from pregeometric discrete building blocks governed by computational rules?
To address this, we investigate non-deterministic rewriting systems (multiway systems) of the
Wolfram model. We formalize these rewriting systems as homotopy types. Using this new formulation,
we outline how spatial structures can be functorially inherited from pregeometric type-theoretic
constructions. We show how higher homotopy types are constructed from rewriting rules. These correspond
to morphisms of an $n$-fold category. Subsequently, the $n \to \infty$ limit of the Wolfram model
rulial multiway system is identified as an $\infty$-groupoid, with the latter being relevant given
Grothendieck's homotopy hypothesis. We then go on to show how this construction extends to the classifying
space of rulial multiway systems, which forms a multiverse of multiway systems and carries the formal
structure of an ${\left(\infty, 1\right)}$-topos. This correspondence to higher categorical
structures offers a new way to understand how spaces relevant to physics may result from pregeometric
combinatorial models. The key issue we have addressed here is to formally relate abstract non-deterministic
rewriting systems to higher homotopy spaces. A consequence of constructing spaces and geometry
synthetically is that it removes ad hoc assumptions about geometric attributes of a model such as
an a priori background or pre-assigned geometric data. Instead, geometry is inherited functorially
from globular structures. This is relevant for formally justifying different choices of underlying
spacetime discretization adopted by various models of quantum gravity. Finally, we end with comments
on how the framework of higher category-theoretic combinatorial constructions developed here,
corroborates with other approaches investigating higher categorical structures relevant to
the foundations of physics.

We investigate the geometry of a typical spin cluster in random triangulations sampled with a probability
proportional to the energy of an Ising configuration on their vertices, both in the finite and infinite
volume settings. This model is known to undergo a combinatorial phase transition at an explicit
critical temperature, for which its partition function has a different asymptotic behavior than
uniform maps. The purpose of this work is to give geometric evidence of this phase transition. In
the infinite volume setting, called the Infinite Ising Planar Triangulation, we exhibit a phase
transition for the existence of an infinite spin cluster: for critical and supercritical temperatures,
the root spin cluster is finite almost surely, while it is infinite with positive probability for
subcritical temperatures. Remarkably, we are able to obtain an explicit parametric expression
for this probability, which allows to prove that the percolation critical exponent is $\beta=1/4$.
We also derive critical exponents for the tail distribution of the perimeter and of the volume of
the root spin cluster, both in the finite and infinite volume settings. Finally, we establish the
scaling limit of the interface of the root spin cluster seen as a looptree. In particular in the whole
supercritical temperature regime, we prove that the critical exponents and the looptree limit
are the same as for critical Bernoulli site percolation. Our proofs mix combinatorial and probabilistic
arguments. The starting point is the gasket decomposition, which makes full use of the spatial Markov
property of our model. This decomposition enables us to characterize the root spin cluster as a Boltzmann
planar map in the finite volume setting. We then combine precise combinatorial results obtained
through analytic combinatorics and universal features of Boltzmann maps to establish our results.

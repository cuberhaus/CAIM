In massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, hybrid analog-digital beamforming
is an essential technique for exploiting the potential array gain without using a dedicated radio
frequency chain for each antenna. However, due to the large number of antennas, the conventional
channel estimation and hybrid beamforming algorithms generally require high computational complexity
and signaling overhead. In this work, we propose an end-to-end deep-unfolding neural network (NN)
joint channel estimation and hybrid beamforming (JCEHB) algorithm to maximize the system sum rate
in time-division duplex (TDD) massive MIMO. Specifically, the recursive least-squares (RLS)
algorithm and stochastic successive convex approximation (SSCA) algorithm are unfolded for channel
estimation and hybrid beamforming, respectively. In order to reduce the signaling overhead, we
consider a mixed-timescale hybrid beamforming scheme, where the analog beamforming matrices
are optimized based on the channel state information (CSI) statistics offline, while the digital
beamforming matrices are designed at each time slot based on the estimated low-dimensional equivalent
CSI matrices. We jointly train the analog beamformers together with the trainable parameters of
the RLS and SSCA induced deep-unfolding NNs based on the CSI statistics offline. During data transmission,
we estimate the low-dimensional equivalent CSI by the RLS induced deep-unfolding NN and update
the digital beamformers. In addition, we propose a mixed-timescale deep-unfolding NN where the
analog beamformers are optimized online, and extend the framework to frequency-division duplex
(FDD) systems where channel feedback is considered. Simulation results show that the proposed
algorithm can significantly outperform conventional algorithms with reduced computational
complexity and signaling overhead.

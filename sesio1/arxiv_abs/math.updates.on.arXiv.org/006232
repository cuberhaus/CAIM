Given the counters of vehicles that traverse the roads of a traffic network, we aim at reconstructing
the travel demand that generated them expressed in terms of the number of origin-destination trips
made by users. We model the problem as a bi-level optimization problem. In the inner level, given
a tentative travel demand, we solve a dynamic traffic assignment problem to decide the routing of
the users between their origins and destinations. In the outer level, we adjust the number of trips
and their origins and destinations, aiming at minimizing the discrepancy between the consequent
counters generated in the inner level and the given vehicle counts measured by sensors in the traffic
network. We solve the dynamic traffic assignment problem employing a mesoscopic model implemented
by the traffic simulator SUMO. Thus, the outer problem becomes an optimization problem that minimizes
a black-box objective function determined by the results of the simulation, which is a costly computation.
We study different approaches to the outer level problem categorized as gradient-based and derivative-free
approaches. Among the gradient-based approaches, we study an assignment matrix-based approach
and an assignment matrix-free approach that uses the Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation
(SPSA) algorithm. Among the derivative-free approaches, we study machine learning algorithms
to learn a model of the simulator that can then be used as a surrogated objective function in the optimization
problem. We compare these approaches computationally on an artificial network. The gradient-based
approaches perform the best in terms of archived solution quality and computational requirements,
while the results obtained by the machine learning approach are currently less satisfactory but
provide an interesting avenue of future research.

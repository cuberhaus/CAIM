The fact that the millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel has
sparse support in the spatial domain has motivated recent compressed sensing (CS)-based mmWave
channel estimation methods, where the angles of arrivals (AoAs) and angles of departures (AoDs)
are quantized using angle dictionary matrices. However, the existing CS-based methods usually
obtain the estimation result through one-stage channel sounding that have two limitations: (i)
the requirement of large-dimensional dictionary and (ii) unresolvable quantization error. These
two drawbacks are irreconcilable; improvement of the one implies deterioration of the other. To
address these challenges, we propose, in this paper, a two-stage method to estimate the AoAs and
AoDs of mmWave channels. In the proposed method, the channel estimation task is divided into two
stages, Stage I and Stage II. Specifically, in Stage I, the AoAs are estimated by solving a multiple
measurement vectors (MMV) problem. In Stage II, based on the estimated AoAs, the receive sounders
are designed to estimate AoDs. The dimension of the angle dictionary in each stage can be reduced,
which in turn reduces the computational complexity substantially. We then analyze the successful
recovery probability (SRP) of the proposed method, revealing the superiority of the proposed framework
over the existing one-stage CS-based methods. We further enhance the reconstruction performance
by performing resource allocation between the two stages. We also overcome the unresolvable quantization
error issue present in the prior techniques by applying the atomic norm minimization method to each
stage of the proposed two-stage approach. The simulation results illustrate the substantially
improved performance with low complexity of the proposed two-stage method.

In this paper, we focus on the demodulation/decoding of the complex modulations/codes that approach
the Shannon capacity. Theoretically, the maximum likelihood (ML) algorithm can achieve the optimal
error performance whereas it has $\mathcal{O}(2^k)$ demodulation/decoding complexity with
$k$ denoting the number of information bits. Recent progress in deep learning provides a new direction
to tackle the demodulation and the decoding. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the feasibility
of the neural network to demodulate/decode the complex modulations/codes close to the Shannon
capacity and characterize the error performance and the complexity of the neural network. Regarding
the neural network demodulator, we use the golden angle modulation (GAM), a promising modulation
format that can offer the Shannon capacity approaching performance, to evaluate the demodulator.
It is observed that the neural network demodulator can get a close performance to the ML-based method
while it suffers from the lower complexity order in the low-order GAM. Regarding the neural network
decoder, we use the Gaussian codebook, achieving the Shannon capacity, to evaluate the decoder.
We also observe that the neural network decoder achieves the error performance close to the ML decoder
with a much lower complexity order in the small Gaussian codebook. Limited by the current training
resources, we cannot evaluate the performance of the high-order modulation and the long codeword.
But, based on the results of the low-order GAM and the small Gaussian codebook, we boldly give our
conjecture: the neural network demodulator/decoder is a strong candidate approach for demodulating/decoding
the complex modulations/codes close to the Shannon capacity owing to the error performance of the
near-ML algorithm and the lower complexity.

Observability is a fundamental structural property of any dynamic system and describes the possibility
of reconstructing the state that characterizes the system from observing its inputs and outputs.
Despite the huge effort made to study this property and to introduce analytical criteria able to
check whether a dynamic system satisfies this property or not, there is no general analytical criterion
to automatically check the state observability when the dynamics are also driven by unknown inputs.
Here, we introduce the general analytical solution of this fundamental problem, often called the
unknown input observability problem. This paper provides the general analytical solution of this
problem, namely, it provides the systematic procedure, based on automatic computation (differentiation
and matrix rank determination), that allows us to automatically check the state observability
even in the presence of unknown inputs. A first solution of this problem was presented in the second
part of the book: "Observability: A New Theory Based on the Group of Invariance" [45]. The solution
presented by this paper completes the previous solution in [45]. In particular, the new solution
exhaustively accounts for the systems that do not belong to the category of the systems that are canonic
with respect to their unknown inputs. The new solution is also provided in the form of a new algorithm.
A further novelty with respect to the algorithm provided in [45] consists of a new convergence criterion
that holds in all the cases (the convergence criterion of the algorithm provided in [45] can fail
in some cases). Finally, we also provide the answer to the problem of unknown input reconstruction
which is intimately related to the problem of state observability. We illustrate the implementation
of the new algorithm by studying a nonlinear system in the framework of visual-inertial sensor fusion.

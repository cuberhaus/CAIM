Many important theories in modern physics can be stated using differential geometry. Symplectic
geometry is the natural framework to deal with autonomous Hamiltonian mechanics. This admits several
generalizations for nonautonomous systems, both regular and singular. Some of these extensions
are the subject of this thesis. Recently there has been a growing interest in studying dissipative
mechanical systems from a geometric perspective using contact geometry. In this thesis we review
what has been done in this topic and go deeper, studying symmetries and dissipated quantities of
contact systems, and developing the Skinner-Rusk formalism for these systems. With regard to classical
field theory, we introduce the notion of k-precosymplectic manifold and use it to give a geometric
description of singular nonautonomous field theories. We also devise a constraint algorithm for
these systems. Field theories with damping are described through a modification of the De Donder-Weyl
Hamiltonian field theory. This is achieved by combining contact geometry and k-symplectic structures,
resulting in the k-contact formalism. We introduce two notions of dissipation laws, generalizing
the concept of dissipated quantity. These developments are also applied to Lagrangian field theory.
The Skinner-Rusk formulation for k-contact systems is described in detail and we show how to recover
the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms from it. Throughout the thesis we present several examples
in mechanics and field theory. The most remarkable mechanical examples are the damped harmonic
oscillator, the motion in a gravitational field with friction, the parachute equation and the damped
simple pendulum. In field theory, we study the damped vibrating string, the Burgers' equation,
the Klein-Gordon equation and its relation with the telegrapher's equation, and the Maxwell's
equations with dissipation.

We study well-posedness, stabilization and control problems involving freely vibrating beams
that may undergo motions of large magnitude -- i.e. large displacements of the reference line and
large rotations of the cross sections. Such beams, shearable and very flexible, are often called
geometrically exact beams and are especially needed in modern highly flexible light-weight structures,
where one cannot neglect these large motions. We view these beams from two perspectives. The first
perspective is one in which the beam is described in terms of the position of its reference line and
the orientation of its cross sections (expressed in some fixed coordinate system). This is the generally
encountered model, due to Eric Reissner and Juan C. Simo. Of second order in time and space, it is a
quasilinear system of six equations. The second perspective is one in which the beam is rather described
by intrinsic variables -- velocities and strains or internal forces and moments -- which are moreover
expressed in a moving coordinate system attached to the beam. This system, proposed in its most general
form by Dewey H. Hodges, consists of twice as many equations, but is of first order in time and space,
hyperbolic and only semilinear (quadratic). From the definition of the state of the latter model,
one can see that both perspectives are linked by a nonlinear transformation. The questions of well-posedness,
stabilization and control are addressed for beams governed by the intrinsic model, while by using
the transformation we also prove that the existence and uniqueness of a classical solution to the
intrinsic model implies that of a classical solution to the model written in terms of positions and
rotations. In particular, this enables us to deduce corresponding results for the latter model.
We also also address these questions for networks of beams attached to each other by means of rigid
joints.

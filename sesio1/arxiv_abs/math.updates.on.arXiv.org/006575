In this paper, we are interested in the linear and the nonlinear Rayleigh instability for the incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations with Navier-slip boundary conditions around a laminar smooth density
profile $\rho_0(x_2)$ being increasing in an infinite slab $2\pi L\mathbb{T} \times (-1,1)$ ($L>0$,
$\mathbb{T}$ is the usual 1D torus). The linear instability study of the viscous Rayleigh-Taylor
model amounts to the study of the following ordinary differential equation of the vertical component
of perturbed velocity on the finite interval $(-1,1)$, \begin{equation} -\lambda^2 [ \rho_0 k^2
\phi - (\rho_0 \phi')'] = \lambda \mu (\phi^{(4)} - 2k^2 \phi'' + k^4 \phi) - gk^2 \rho_0'\phi, \qquad(0.1)\end{equation}
with the boundary conditions \begin{equation}\label{4thBound} \begin{cases} \phi(-1)=\phi(1)=0,\\
\mu \phi''(1) = \xi_+ \phi'(1), \\ \mu \phi''(-1) =- \xi_- \phi'(-1), \end{cases} \qquad(0.2)\end{equation}
where $g>0$ is the gravity constant, $\lambda$ is the growth rate in time, $k$ is the wave number transverse
to the density profile and two Navier-slip coefficients $\xi_{\pm}$ are nonnegative constants.
For each $k\in L^{-1}\mathbb{Z}\setminus\{0\}$, we define a threshold of viscosity coefficient
$\mu_c(k,\Xi)$ for linear instability. we provide a spectral analysis adapting the operator method
of Lafitte-Nguyen in \cite{LN20} and then prove that there are infinite solutions of \eqref{EqMain}-\eqref{4thBound}.
Based on infinitely unstable modes of the linearized problem, we consider a wide class of initial
data to the nonlinear perturbation problem, extending Grenier's framework \cite{Gre00}, to prove
nonlinear Rayleigh-Taylor instability in a high regime of viscosity coefficient, namely $\mu
>3\sup_{k\in L^{-1}\mathbb{Z}\setminus\{0\}}\mu_c(k,\Xi)$.

The signature of a path, introduced by K.T. Chen [5] in $1954$, has been extensively studied in recent
years. The $2010$ paper [12] of Hambly and Lyons showed that the signature is injective on the space
of continuous finite-variation paths up to a general notion of reparameterisation called tree-like
equivalence. The signature has been widely used in applications, underpinned by the result [15]
that guarantees uniform approximation of a continuous function on a compact set by a linear functional
of the signature. We study in detail, and for the first time, the properties of three candidate topologies
on the set of unparameterised paths (the tree-like equivalence classes). These are obtained through
properties of the signature and are: (1) the product topology, obtained by equipping the tensor
algebra with the product topology and requiring $S$ to be an embedding, (2) the quotient topology
derived from the 1-variation topology on the underlying path space, and (3) the metric topology
associated to $d( [ \gamma] ,[ \sigma] ) := \vert\vert \gamma^*-\sigma^*\vert\vert_{1}$ using
suitable representatives $\gamma^*$ and $\sigma^*$ of the equivalence classes. The topologies
are ordered by strict inclusion, (1) being the weakest and (3) the strongest. Each is separable and
Hausdorff, (1) being both metrisable and $\sigma$-compact, but not a Baire space and so neither
Polish nor locally compact. The quotient topology (2) is not metrisable and the metric $d$ is not
complete. An important function on (unparameterised) path space is the (fixed-time) solution
map of a controlled differential equation. For a broad class of such equations, we prove measurability
of this map for each topology. Under stronger regularity assumptions, we show continuity on explicit
compact subsets of the product topology (1). We relate these results to the expected signature model
of [15].

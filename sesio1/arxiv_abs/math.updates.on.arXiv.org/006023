Many science phenomena are described as interacting particle systems (IPS). The mean field limit
(MFL) of large all-to-all coupled deterministic IPS is given by the solution of a PDE, the Vlasov
Equation (VE). Yet, many applications demand IPS coupled on networks/graphs. It is interesting
to know, how the limit of a sequence of digraphs associated with the IPS influences the macroscopic
MFL. This paper studies VEs on a generalized digraph, regarded as limit of a sequence of digraphs,
which we refer to as a digraph measure (DGM) to emphasize that we work with its limit via measures.
We provide well-posedness and discretization of the solution of the VE by empirical distributions
supported on solutions of an IPS via ODEs coupled on a sequence of digraphs converging to the given
DGM. Our result extends existing results on one-dimensional Kuramoto-type networks coupled on
dense graphs. Here we allow the underlying digraphs to be not necessarily dense which include many
interesting graphical structures such that stars, trees and rings, which have been frequently
used in many sparse network models in finance, telecommunications, physics, genetics, neuroscience,
and social sciences. A key contribution of this paper is a nontrivial generalization of Neunzert's
in-cell-particle approach for all-to-all coupled indistinguishable IPS with global Lipschitz
continuity in Euclidean spaces to distinguishable IPS on heterogeneous digraphs with local Lipschitz
continuity, via a measure-theoretic viewpoint. The approach together with the metrics is different
from the known techniques in $L^p$-functions using graphons and their generalization via harmonic
analysis of locally compact Abelian groups. Finally, to demonstrate the wide applicability, we
apply our results to various models in higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces in epidemiology, ecology,
and social sciences.

Propensity score methods have been shown to be powerful in obtaining efficient estimators of average
treatment effect (ATE) from observational data, especially under the existence of confounding
factors. When estimating, deciding which type of covariates need to be included in the propensity
score function is important, since incorporating some unnecessary covariates may amplify both
bias and variance of estimators of ATE. In this paper, we show that including additional instrumental
variables that satisfy the exclusion restriction for outcome will do harm to the statistical efficiency.
Also, we prove that, controlling for covariates that appear as outcome predictors, i.e. predict
the outcomes and are irrelevant to the exposures, can help reduce the asymptotic variance of ATE
estimation. We also note that, efficiently estimating the ATE by non-parametric or semi-parametric
methods require the estimated propensity score function, as described in Hirano et al. (2003)\cite{Hirano2003}.
Such estimation procedure usually asks for many regularity conditions, Rothe (2016)\cite{Rothe2016}
also illustrated this point and proposed a known propensity score (KPS) estimator that requires
mild regularity conditions and is still fully efficient. In addition, we introduce a linearly modified
(LM) estimator that is nearly efficient in most general settings and need not estimation of the propensity
score function, hence convenient to calculate. The construction of this estimator borrows idea
from the interaction estimator of Lin (2013)\cite{Lin2013}, in which regression adjustment with
interaction terms are applied to deal with data arising from a completely randomized experiment.
As its name suggests, the LM estimator can be viewed as a linear modification on the IPW estimator
using known propensity scores. We will also investigate its statistical properties both analytically
and numerically.

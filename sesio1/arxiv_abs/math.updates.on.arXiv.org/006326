In this article we consider min-min type of problems or minimization by two groups of variables.
Min-min problems may occur in case if some groups of variables in convex optimization have different
dimensions or if these groups have different domains. Such problem structure gives us an ability
to split the main task to subproblems, and allows to tackle it with mixed oracles. However existing
articles on this topic cover only zeroth and first order oracles, in our work we consider high-order
tensor methods to solve inner problem and fast gradient method to solve outer problem. We assume,
that outer problem is constrained to some convex compact set, and for the inner problem we consider
both unconstrained case and being constrained to some convex compact set. By definition, tensor
methods use high-order derivatives, so the time per single iteration of the method depends a lot
on the dimensionality of the problem it solves. Therefore, we suggest, that the dimension of the
inner problem variable is not greater than 1000. Additionally, we need some specific assumptions
to be able to use mixed oracles. Firstly, we assume, that the objective is convex in both groups of
variables and its gradient by both variables is Lipschitz continuous. Secondly, we assume the inner
problem is strongly convex and its gradient is Lipschitz continuous. Also, since we are going to
use tensor methods for inner problem, we need it to be $p$-th order Lipschitz continuous ($p > 1$).
Finally, we assume strong convexity of the outer problem to be able to use fast gradient method for
strongly convex functions. We need to emphasize, that we use superfast tensor method to tackle inner
subproblem in unconstrained case. And when we solve inner problem on compact set, we use accelerated
high-order composite proximal method.

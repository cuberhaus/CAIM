To improve the poor performance of distributed operation and non-scalability of centralized operation
in traditional cell-free massive MIMO, we propose a cell-free distributed collaborative (CFDC)
massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system based on a novel two-layer model to take
advantages of the distributed cloud-edge-end collaborative architecture in beyond 5G (B5G) internet
of things (IoT) environment to provide strong flexibility and scalability. We further ultilize
the proposed CFDC massive MIMO system to support the low altitude three-dimensional (3-D) coverage
scenario with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), while accounting for 3-D Rician channel estimation,
user-centric association and different scalable receiving schemes. Since coexisted UAVs and
ground users (GUEs) cause greater interference, we ultilize user-centric association strategy
and minimum-mean-square error (MMSE) channel state information (CSI) estimation to obtain the
estimated CSI of UAVs and GUEs. Under the CFDC scenarios, scalable receiving schemes as maximum
ratio combing (MRC), partial zero-forcing (P-ZF) and partial minimum-mean-square error (P-MMSE)
can be performed at edge servers and the closed-form expressions for uplink spectral efficiency
(SE) are derived. Based on the derived expressions, we propose an efficient power control algorithm
by solving a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) between maximizing the average SE of
UAVs and GUEs simultaneously with Deep Q-Network (DQN). Numerical results verify the accuracy
of the derived closed-form expressions and the effectiveness of the coexisted UAVs and GUEs transmission
scheme in CFDC massive MIMO systems. The SE analysis under various system parameters offers numerous
flexibilities for system optimization.

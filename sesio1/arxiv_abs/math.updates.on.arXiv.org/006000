As an established bandwidth-efficient coded modulation technique, bit-interleaved coded modulation
(BICM) can achieve very desirable error performance with relatively low implementation complexity
for a large number of communication and storage systems. It attracted considerable attention from
the research community in the past three decades. The BICM is able to approach Shannon capacity limits
over various channels with the use of powerful forward-error-correction (FEC) codes, bit mappers
(i.e., interleavers), and high-order modulations. Based on the natural serially-concatenated
structure of BICM, iterative demapping and decoding (ID) can be adopted to boost the system performance.
Due to the tremendous error-correction capability and simple structures, protograph low-density
parity-check (PLDPC) codes and their spatially-coupled (SC) variants have emerged to be a pragmatic
and promising FEC solution for BICM systems, and found widespread applications such as deep-space
communication, satellite communication, wireless communication, optical communication, and
flash-memory-based data storage in recent years. This article offers a comprehensive survey on
the state-of-the-art development of PLDPC-coded BICM and its innovative SC variants over a variety
of channel models, e.g., additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels, fading channels, Poisson
pulse position modulation (PPM) channels, and NAND flash-memory channels. Of particular interest
is code construction, constellation shaping, as well as bit-mapper design, where the receiver
is formulated as a serially-concatenated decoding framework consisting of a soft-decision demapper
and a belief-propagation decoder. In addition, several promising research directions are discussed,
which have not been adequately addressed in the current literature.

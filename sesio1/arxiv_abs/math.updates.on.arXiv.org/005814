Let R be a non-commutative field. We prove that generic triples of flags in an m-dimensional R-vector
space are described by flat R-line bundles on the honeycomb graph with (m-1)(m-2)/2 holes. Generalising
this, we prove that non-commutative stacks X(m,S) of framed rank m flat R-vector bundles of on decorated
surfaces S are birationally identified with the moduli spaces of flat line bundles on a spectral
surface assigned to certain bipartite graphs on S. We introduce non-commutative cluster Poisson
varieties related to bipartite ribbon graphs. They carry canonical non-commutative Poisson structure.
The space X(m,S) has a structure of a non-commutative cluster Poisson variety, equivariant under
the action of the mapping class group. For bipartite graphs on a torus, we get the non-commutative
dimer cluster integrable system. We define non-commutative cluster A-varieties related to bipartite
ribbon graphs. They carry canonical non-commutative 2-form. The non-commutative stack A(m,S)
of twisted decorated local systems on S carries a cluster A-variety structure, equivariant under
the action of the mapping class group. The non-commutative cluster A-coordinates on the space A(m,S)
are ratios of Gelfand-Retakh quasideterminants. In the case m=2 this recovers the Berenstein-Retakh
non-commutative cluster algebras related to surfaces. We introduce stacks of admissible dg-sheaves,
and use them to give an alternative proof of main results. We show that any stack of Stokes data is a
stack of admissible dg-sheaves of certain type. Using this we prove that all stacks of framed Stokes
data carry a cluster Poisson structure, equivariant under the wild mapping class group. Therefore
they can be equivariantly quantized. Similar stacks of decorated Stokes data carry an equivariant
cluster A-variety structure.

G\"odel's Dialectica interpretation was conceived as a tool to obtain the consistency of Peano
arithmetic via a proof of consistency of Heyting arithmetic in the 40s. In recent years, several
proof-theoretic transformations, based on G\"odel's Dialectica interpretation, have been used
systematically to extract new content from classical proofs, following a suggestion of Kreisel.
Thus, the interpretation has found new relevant applications in several areas of mathematics and
computer science. Several authors have explained the Dialectica interpretation in categorical
terms. In our previous work, we introduced an intrinsic categorical presentation of the Dialectica
construction via a generalisation of Hofstra's work, using the notion of G\"odel fibration and
its proof-irrelevant version, a G\"odel doctrine. The key idea is that G\"odel fibrations can be
thought of as fibrations generated by some basic elements playing the role of quantifier-free elements.
This categorification of quantifier-free elements is crucial not only to show that our notion of
G\"odel fibration is equivalent to Hofstra's Dialectica fibration in the appropriate way, but
also to show how G\"odel doctrines embody the main logical features of the Dialectica Interpretation.
To show that, we derive the soundness of the interpretation of the implication connective, as expounded
by Troelstra, in the categorical model. This requires extra logical principles, going beyond intuitionistic
logic, namely Markov Principle and the Independence of Premise principle, as well as some choice.
We show how these principles are satisfied in the categorical setting, establishing a tight correspondence
between the logical system and the categorical framework. Finally, to complete our analysis, we
characterise categories obtained as results of the tripos-to-topos of Hyland, Johnstone and Pitts
applied to G\"odel doctrines.

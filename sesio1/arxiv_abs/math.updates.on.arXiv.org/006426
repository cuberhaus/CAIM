We consider the task of identifying and estimating the causal effect of a treatment variable on a
long-term outcome variable using data from an observational domain and an experimental domain.
The observational domain is subject to unobserved confounding. Furthermore, subjects in the experiment
are only followed for a short period of time; hence, long-term effects of treatment are unobserved
but short-term effects will be observed. Therefore, data from neither domain alone suffices for
causal inference about the effect of the treatment on the long-term outcome, and must be pooled in
a principled way, instead. Athey et al. (2020) proposed a method for systematically combining such
data for identifying the downstream causal effect in view. Their approach is based on the assumptions
of internal and external validity of the experimental data, and an extra novel assumption called
latent unconfoundedness. In this paper, we first review their proposed approach and discuss the
latent unconfoundedness assumption. Then we propose three alternative approaches for data fusion
for the purpose of identifying and estimating average treatment effect as well as the effect of treatment
on the treated. Our first proposed approach is based on assuming equi-confounding bias for the short-term
and long-term outcomes. Our second proposed approach is based on a relaxed version of the equi-confounding
bias assumption, where we assume the existence of a binary confounder such that the confounding
bias in the sub-populations corresponding to its realizations are the same. Our third proposed
approach is based on the proximal causal inference framework, in which we assume the existence of
an extra variable in the system which is a proxy of the latent confounder of the treatment-outcome
relation. For the proximal data fusion framework, we also provide results on the estimation aspect
of the task of causal inference.

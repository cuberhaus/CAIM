In millimeter wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, one-bit
analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are employed to reduce the impractically high power consumption,
which is incurred by the wide bandwidth and large arrays. In practice, the mmWave band consists of
a small number of paths, thereby rendering sparse virtual channels. Then, the resulting maximum
a posteriori (MAP) channel estimation problem is a sparsity-constrained optimization problem,
which is NP-hard to solve. In this paper, iterative approximate MAP channel estimators for mmWave
massive MIMO systems with one-bit ADCs are proposed, which are based on the gradient support pursuit
(GraSP) and gradient hard thresholding pursuit (GraHTP) algorithms. The GraSP and GraHTP algorithms
iteratively pursue the gradient of the objective function to approximately optimize convex objective
functions with sparsity constraints, which are the generalizations of the compressive sampling
matching pursuit (CoSaMP) and hard thresholding pursuit (HTP) algorithms, respectively, in compressive
sensing (CS). However, the performance of the GraSP and GraHTP algorithms is not guaranteed when
the objective function is ill-conditioned, which may be incurred by the highly coherent sensing
matrix. In this paper, the band maximum selecting (BMS) hard thresholding technique is proposed
to modify the GraSP and GraHTP algorithms, namely the BMSGraSP and BMSGraHTP algorithms, respectively.
The BMSGraSP and BMSGraHTP algorithms pursue the gradient of the objective function based on the
band maximum criterion instead of the naive hard thresholding. In addition, a fast Fourier transform-based
(FFT-based) fast implementation is developed to reduce the complexity. The BMSGraSP and BMSGraHTP
algorithms are shown to be both accurate and efficient, whose performance is verified through extensive
simulations.

To understand the mechanisms underlying species coexistence, ecologists often study invasion
growth rates of theoretical and data-driven models. These growth rates correspond to average per-capita
growth rates of one species with respect to an ergodic measure supporting other species. In the ecological
literature, coexistence often is equated with the invasion growth rates being positive. Intuitively,
positive invasion growth rates ensure that species recover from being rare. To provide a mathematically
rigorous framework for this approach, we prove theorems that answer two questions: (i) When do the
signs of the invasion growth rates determine coexistence? (ii) When signs are sufficient, which
invasion growth rates need to be positive? We focus on deterministic models and equate coexistence
with permanence, i.e., a global attractor bounded away from extinction. For models satisfying
certain technical assumptions, we introduce invasion graphs where vertices correspond to proper
subsets of species (communities) supporting an ergodic measure and directed edges correspond
to potential transitions between communities due to invasions by missing species. These directed
edges are determined by the signs of invasion growth rates. When the invasion graph is acyclic (i.e.
there is no sequence of invasions starting and ending at the same community), we show that permanence
is determined by the signs of the invasion growth rates. In this case, permanence is characterized
by the invasibility of all -i communities, i.e., communities without species i where all other missing
species having negative invasion growth rates. We show that dissipative Lotka-Volterra models
satisfy our technical assumptions and computing their invasion graphs reduces to solving systems
of linear equations. We provide additional applications of the results and discuss open problems.

Space-time behaviors for 3D compressible bipolar Navier-Stokes-Poisson system (BNSP) with unequal
viscosities are given. The space-time estimate of electric field $\nabla\phi$ is the most important
thing when deducing generalized Huygens' principle for BNSP since this estimate only can be obtained
by $\nabla\phi=\frac{\nabla}{\Delta}(\rho-n)$ from the Poisson equation. Thus, it requires
to prove that the space-time estimate of $\rho-n$ only contains diffusion wave. The appearance
of these unequal coefficients results that one cannot follow ideas for the special case, where the
original system was rewritten as a compressible NS system and a compressible (unipolar) NSP system
after a linear combination of unknowns. This linear combination brings special structure for nonlinear
terms, and this structure was also used to get desired space-time estimate for $\rho-n$. Moreover,
Green's function of the subsystem NSP does not contain Huygens wave is equally important in [36].
However, for the general case, the benefits from this linear combination will not exist any longer.
First, we have to directly consider an $8\times8$ Green's matrix of the original system. Second,
all of entries in Green's function in low frequency actually contain wave operators. This generally
produces the Huygens' wave for each entry in Green's function, as a result, one cannot achieve that
the space-time estimate of $\rho-n$ only contains the diffusion wave as usual. We overcome this
difficulty by taking more detailed spectral analysis and developing new estimates arising from
subtle cancellations in Green's function. Third, due to loss of the special structure of nonlinear
terms from the linear combination, we shall develop new nonlinear convolution estimates such that
we can ultimately obtain the expected space-time estimate for $\nabla\phi$ and further verify
the generalized Huygens' principle.

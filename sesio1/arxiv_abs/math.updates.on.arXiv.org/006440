Using the concepts of mixed volumes and quermassintegrals of convex geometry, we derive an exact
formula for the exclusion volume for a general convex body that applies in any space dimension, including
both the rotationally-averaged exclusion volume and with the same orientation. We show that the
sphere minimizes the dimensionless exclusion volume $v_{ex}(K)/v(K)$ among all convex bodies,
whether randomly oriented or uniformly oriented, for any $d$, where $v(K)$ is the volume of $K$.
When the bodies have the same orientation, the simplex maximizes the dimensionless exclusion volume
for any $d$ with a large-$d$ asymptotic scaling behavior of $2^{2d}/d^{3/2}$, which is to be contrasted
with the scaling of $2^d$ for the sphere. We present explicit formulas for quermassintegrals for
many nonspherical convex bodies as well as as well as lower-dimensional bodies. These results are
utilized to determine the rotationally-averaged exclusion volume for these shapes for dimensions
2 through 12. While the sphere is the shape possessing the minimal dimensionless exclusion volume,
among the convex bodies considered that are sufficiently compact, the simplex possesses the maximal
dimensionless exclusion volume with a scaling behavior of $2^{1.6618\ldots d}$. We also determine
the corresponding second virial coefficient $B_2(K)$ of the aforementioned hard hyperparticles
and compute estimates of the continuum percolation threshold $\eta_c$ derived previously by the
authors. We conjecture that overlapping spheres possess the maximal value of $\eta_c$ among all
identical nonzero-volume convex overlapping bodies for $d \ge 2$, randomly or uniformly oriented,
and that, among all identical, oriented nonzero-volume convex bodies, overlapping simplices
have the minimal value of $\eta_c$ for $d\ge 2$.

This work is partially motivated by the recent articles related to the continuum hypothesis and
the forcing axioms. Ever since G\"{o}del's and Cohen's proofs that the ZFC cannot be used to disprove
or approve continuum hypothesis, i.e., that it is independent of the ZFC axioms there are efforts
of adding at least one new axiom to ZFC that should illuminate the structure of infinite sets. The
two main contenders for addition to ZFC are the inner-model axiom 'V-ultimate L' that builds a universe
of sets from the ground up and Martin's axiom that allows to expand it outward in all directions. If
Martin's axiom is correct, then the continuum hypothesis is false, and if the inner-model axiom
is right, then the continuum hypothesis is true. That model dependent view is underlined with the
L\"{o}wenheim-Skolem theorem, no theory can have only nondenumerable models; if a theory has a
nondenumerable model, it must have denumerably infinite ones as well. Accepting axiomatization
in whatever shape means the notions 'denumerable' and 'nondenumerable' turn out to be relative
and it requires to accept the relativization of cardinals as it is first pointed out by Skolem and
Carnap. To show the impact of axiomatization considered will be as an example a set created by a successive
generation of algebraic pairs, each filled with a single transcendental number, and examined will
be the impact of the axiom of choice on the determining the property of such set. It will be shown that
the given example supports the L\"{o}wenheim-Skolem theorem. To underline the uncertainty implied
by that theorem considered will be Wagner's $\Sigma$ model that generates a set in a constructive
way, different from ZF. For the first time, provided will be an explicit example that satisfies Wagner's
model. It will be shown that this model also supports the L\"{o}wenheim-Skolem theorem.

Given a directed graph, we show how to efficiently find a shortest (directed, simple) cycle on an
even number of vertices. As far as we know, no polynomial-time algorithm was previously known for
this problem. In fact, finding any even cycle in a directed graph in polynomial time was open for more
than two decades until Robertson, Seymour, and Thomas (Ann. of Math. (2) 1999) and, independently,
McCuaig (Electron. J. Combin. 2004; announced jointly at STOC 1997) gave an efficiently testable
structural characterisation of even-cycle-free directed graphs. Methodologically, our algorithm
relies on algebraic fingerprinting and randomized polynomial identity testing over a finite field,
and uses a generating polynomial implicit in Vazirani and Yannakakis ( Discrete Appl. Math. 1989)
that enumerates weighted cycle covers as a difference of a permanent and a determinant polynomial.
The need to work with the permanent is where our main technical contribution occurs. We design a family
of finite commutative rings of characteristic 4 that simultaneously (i) give a nondegenerate representation
for the generating polynomial identity via the permanent and the determinant, (ii) support efficient
permanent computations, and (iii) enable emulation of finite-field arithmetic in characteristic
2. Here our work is foreshadowed by that of Bj\"orklund and Husfeldt (SIAM J. Comput. 2019), who used
a considerably less efficient ring design to obtain a polynomial-time algorithm for the shortest
two disjoint paths problem. Building on work of Gilbert and Tarjan (Numer. Math. 1978) as well as
Alon and Yuster (J. ACM 2013), we also show how ideas from the nested dissection technique for solving
linear equation systems leads to faster algorithm designs when we have control on the separator
structure of the input graph; for example, this happens when the input has bounded genus.

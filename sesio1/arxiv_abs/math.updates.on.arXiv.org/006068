Let $\bx_j = \btheta +\bep_j, j=1,...,n$, be observations of an unknown parameter $\btheta$ in
a Euclidean or separable Hilbert space $\scrH$, where $\bep_j$ are noises as random elements in
$\scrH$ from a general distribution. We study the estimation of $f(\btheta)$ for a given functional
$f:\scrH\rightarrow \RR$ based on $\bx_j$'s. The key element of our approach is a new method which
we call High-Order Degenerate Statistical Expansion. It leverages the use of classical multivariate
Taylor expansion and degenerate $U$-statistic and yields an elegant explicit formula. In the univariate
case of $\scrH=\R$, the formula expresses the error of the proposed estimator as a sum of order $k$
degenerate $U$-products of the noises with coefficient $f^{(k)}(\btheta)/k!$ and an explicit
remainder term in the form of the Riemann-Liouville integral as in the Taylor expansion around the
true $\btheta$. For general $\scrH$, the formula expresses the estimation error in terms of the
inner product of $f^{(k)}(\btheta)/k!$ and the average of the tensor products of $k$ noises with
distinct indices and a parallel extension of the remainder term from the univariate case. This makes
the proposed method a natural statistical version of the classical Taylor expansion. The proposed
estimator can be viewed as a jackknife estimator of an ideal degenerate expansion of $f(\cdot)$
around the true $\btheta$ with the degenerate $U$-product of the noises, and can be approximated
by bootstrap. Thus, the jackknife, bootstrap and Taylor expansion approaches all converge to the
proposed estimator. We develop risk bounds for the proposed estimator and a central limit theorem
under a second moment condition (even in expansions of higher than the second order). We apply this
new method to generalize several existing results with smooth and nonsmooth $f$ to universal $\bep_j$'s
with only minimum moment constraints.

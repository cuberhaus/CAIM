In this paper we are concerned with the existence of transonic shocks for 2-D steady isothermal Euler
flows in a horizontal flat nozzle under vertical gravity. In particular, we focus on the contribution
of the vertical gravity in determining the position of the shock front. For steady horizontal flows,
the existence of normal shocks with the position of the shock front being arbitrary in the nozzle
can be easily established. This paper will try to determine the position of the shock front as the
state of the flow at the entrance of the nozzle and the pressure at the exit are slightly perturbed.
To this end, this paper proposes a free boundary problem of the linearized Euler system with vertical
gravity, whose solution could be an initial approximation for the shock solution with the free boundary
being the approximation for the shock front. Due to the existence of the vertical gravity, difficulties
arise in solving the boundary value problem in the approximate subsonic domain behind the shock
front. The linearized Euler system is elliptic-hyperbolic composite for subsonic flows, and the
elliptic part and the hyperbolic part are coupled in the $0$-order terms depending on the acceleration
of gravity $g$. Moreover, the coefficients are not constants since the unperturbed shock solution
depends on the vertical variable. New ideas and techniques are developed to deal with these difficulties
and, under certain sufficient conditions on the perturbation, the existence of the solution to
the proposed free boundary problem is established as the acceleration of gravity $g>0$ and the perturbation
are sufficiently small. Then, with the obtained initial approximation of the shock solution, a
nonlinear iteration scheme can be constructed which leads to a transonic shock solution with the
position of the shock front being close to the initial approximating position.

Resurgent-transseries solutions to Painleve equations may be recursively constructed out of
these nonlinear differential-equations--but require Stokes data to be globally defined over
the complex plane. Stokes data explicitly construct connection-formulae which describe the nonlinear
Stokes phenomena associated to these solutions, via implementation of Stokes transitions acting
on the transseries. Nonlinear resurgent Stokes data lack, however, a first-principle computational
approach, hence are hard to determine generically. In the Painleve I and Painleve II contexts, nonlinear
Stokes data get further hindered as these equations are resonant, with non-trivial consequences
for the interconnections between transseries sectors, bridge equations, and associated Stokes
coefficients. In parallel to this, the Painleve I and Painleve II equations are string-equations
for two-dimensional quantum (super) gravity and minimal string theories, where Stokes data have
natural ZZ-brane interpretations. This work computes for the first time the complete, analytical,
resurgent Stokes data for the first two Painleve equations, alongside their quantum gravity or
minimal string incarnations. The method developed herein, dubbed "closed-form asymptotics",
makes sole use of resurgent large-order asymptotics of transseries solutions--alongside a careful
analysis of the role resonance plays. Given its generality, it may be applicable to other distinct
(nonlinear, resonant) problems. Results for analytical Stokes coefficients have natural structures,
which are described, and extensive high-precision numerical tests corroborate all analytical
predictions. Connection-formulae are explicitly constructed, with rather simple and compact
final results encoding the full Stokes data, and further allowing for exact monodromy checks--hence
for an analytical proof of our results.

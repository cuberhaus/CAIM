Let $\Gamma < G$ be a discrete subgroup of a locally compact unimodular group $G$. Let $m\in C_b(G)$
be a $p$-multiplier on $G$ with $1 \leq p < \infty$ and let $T_{m}: L_p(\widehat{G}) \rightarrow
L_p(\widehat{G})$ be the corresponding Fourier multiplier. Similarly, let $T_{m \vert_\Gamma}:
L_p(\widehat{\Gamma}) \rightarrow L_p(\widehat{\Gamma})$ be the Fourier multiplier associated
to the restriction $m|_{\Gamma}$ of $m$ to $\Gamma$. We show that $$ c( {\rm supp}( m|_{\Gamma} )
) \Vert T_{m \vert_\Gamma}: L_p(\widehat{\Gamma}) \rightarrow L_p(\widehat{\Gamma}) \Vert
\leq \Vert T_{m }: L_p(\widehat{G}) \rightarrow L_p(\widehat{G}) \Vert, $$ for a specific constant
$0 \leq c(U) \leq 1$ that is defined for every $U \subseteq \Gamma$. The function $c$ quantifies the
failure of $G$ to admit small almost $\Gamma$-invariant neighbourhoods and can be determined explicitly
in concrete cases. In particular, $c(\Gamma) =1$ when $G$ has small almost $\Gamma$-invariant
neighbourhoods. Our result thus extends the De Leeuw restriction theorem from [CPPR15] as well
as De Leeuw's classical theorem [Lee65]. For real reductive Lie groups $G$ we provide an explicit
lower bound for $c$ in terms of the maximal dimension $d$ of a nilpotent orbit in the adjoint representation.
We show that $c(B_\rho^G) \geq \rho^{-d/2}$ where $B_\rho^G$ is the ball of $g\in G$ with $\Vert
{\rm Ad}_g \Vert < \rho$. We further prove several results for multilinear Fourier multipliers.
Most significantly, we prove a multilinear De Leeuw restriction theorem for pairs $\Gamma<G$ with
$c(\Gamma) = 1$. We also obtain multilinear versions of the lattice approximation theorem, the
compactification theorem and the periodization theorem. Consequently, we are able to provide
the first examples of bilinear multipliers on nonabelian groups.

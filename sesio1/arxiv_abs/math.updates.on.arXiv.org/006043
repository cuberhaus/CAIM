We consider how the outputs of the Kadison transitivity theorem and Gelfand-Naimark-Segal construction
may be obtained in families when the initial data are varied. More precisely, for the Kadison transitivity
theorem, we prove that for any nonzero irreducible representation $(\mathcal{H}, \pi)$ of a $C^*$-algebra
$\mathfrak{A}$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$, there exists a continuous function $A:X \rightarrow \mathfrak{A}$
such that $\pi(A(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}))x_i = y_i$ for all $i \in \{1, \ldots, n\}$, where $X$
is the set of pairs of $n$-tuples $(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) \in \mathcal{H}^n \times \mathcal{H}^n$
such that the components of $\mathbf{x}$ are linearly independent. Versions of this result where
$A$ maps into the self-adjoint or unitary elements of $\mathfrak{A}$ are also presented. Regarding
the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal construction, we prove that given a topological $C^*$-algebra fiber
bundle $p:\mathfrak{A} \rightarrow Y$, one may construct a topological fiber bundle $\mathscr{P}(\mathfrak{A})
\rightarrow Y$ whose fiber over $y \in Y$ is the space of pure states of $\mathfrak{A}_y$ (with the
norm topology), as well as bundles $\mathscr{H} \rightarrow \mathscr{P}(\mathfrak{A})$ and
$\mathscr{N} \rightarrow \mathscr{P}(\mathfrak{A})$ whose fibers $\mathscr{H}_\omega$ and
$\mathscr{N}_\omega$ over $\omega \in \mathscr{P}(\mathfrak{A})$ are the GNS Hilbert space
and closed left ideal, respectively, corresponding to $\omega$. When $p:\mathfrak{A} \rightarrow
Y$ is a smooth fiber bundle, we show that $\mathscr{P}(\mathfrak{A}) \rightarrow Y$ and $\mathscr{H}\rightarrow
\mathscr{P}(\mathfrak{A})$ are also smooth fiber bundles; this involves proving that the group
of $*$-automorphisms of a $C^*$-algebra is a Banach-Lie group. In service of these results, we review
the geometry of the topology and pure state space. A simple non-interacting quantum spin system
is provided as an example.

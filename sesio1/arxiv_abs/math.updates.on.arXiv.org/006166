We cast the classical Yang-Baxter equation (CYBE) in a variational context for the first time, by
relating it to the theory of Lagrangian multiforms, a framework designed to capture integrability
in a variational fashion. This provides a significant connection between Lagrangian multiforms
and the CYBE, one of the most fundamental concepts of integrable systems. This is achieved by introducing
a generating Lagrangian multiform which depends on a skew-symmetric classical $r$-matrix with
spectral parameters. The multiform Euler-Lagrange equations produce a generating Lax equation
which yields a generating zero curvature equation. The CYBE plays a role at three levels: 1) It ensures
the commutativity of the flows of the generating Lax equation; 2) It ensures that the generating
zero curvature equation holds; 3) It implies the closure relation for the generating Lagrangian
multiform. The specification of an integrable hierarchy is achieved by fixing certain data: a finite
set $S\in CP^1$, a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, a $\mathfrak{g}$-valued rational function with
poles in $S$ and an $r$-matrix. We show how our framework is able to generate a large class of ultralocal
integrable hierarchies by providing several known and new examples pertaining to the rational
or trigonometric class. These include the Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur hierarchy, the sine-Gordon
(sG) hierarchy and various hierachies related to Zakharov-Mikhailov type models which contain
the Faddeev-Reshetikhin (FR) model and recently introduced deformed sigma/Gross-Neveu models
as particular cases. The versatility of our method is illustrated by showing how to couple integrable
hierarchies together to create new examples of integrable field theories and their hierarchies.
We provide two examples: the coupling of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger system to the FR model and the
coupling of sG with the anisotropic FR model.

We study the Newton polytopes of $F$-polynomials in a totally sign-skew-symmetric cluster algebra
$\mathcal A$ and generalize them to a larger set consisting of polytopes $N_{h}$ associated to vectors
$h\in\mathbb{Z}^{n}$ as well as $\hat{\mathcal{P}}$ consisting of polytope functions $\rho_{h}$
corresponding to $N_{h}$. The main contribution contains (i)\; obtaining a {\em recurrence construction}
of the Laurent expression of a cluster variable in a cluster from its $g$-vector; (ii)\; proving
the subset $\mathcal{P}$ of $\hat{\mathcal{P}}$ is a strongly positive $\mathbb Z Trop(Y)$-basis
for $\mathcal{U(A)}$ consisting of certain universally indecomposable Laurent polynomials
when $\mathcal A$ is a cluster algebra with principal coefficients. For a cluster algebra $\mathcal
A$ over arbitrary semifield $\mathbb P$, $\mathcal{P}$ is a strongly positive $\mathbb Z\mathbb
P$-basis for a subalgebra $\mathcal{I_P(A)}$ of $\mathcal{U(A)}$; (iii)\; constructing some
explicit maps among corresponding $F$-polynomials, $g$-vectors and $d$-vectors to characterize
their relationship. As an application of (i), we give an affirmation to the positivity conjecture
of cluster variables in a TSSS cluster algebra, which in particular provides a new method different
from that given in \cite{GHKK} to present the positivity of cluster variables in the skew-symmetrizable
case. As another application, a conjecture on Newton polytopes posed by Fei is answered affirmatively.
For (ii), in rank 2 case, $\mathcal{P}$ coincides with the greedy basis introduced by Lee, Li and
Zelevinsky. Hence, we can regard $\mathcal{P}$ as a natural generalization of the greedy basis
in general rank. As an application of (iii), the positivity of denominator vectors associated to
non-initial cluster variables, which came up as a conjecture in \cite{FZ4}, is proved in a TSSS cluster
algebra.

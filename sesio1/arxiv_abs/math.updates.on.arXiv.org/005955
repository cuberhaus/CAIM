We give a stably birational classification for algebraic tori of dimensions $3$ and $4$ over a field
$k$. First, we define the weak stably equivalence of algebraic tori and show that there exist $13$
(resp. $128$) weak stably equivalent classes of algebraic tori $T$ of dimension $3$ (resp. $4$)
which are not stably rational by computing some cohomological stably birational invariants, e.g.
the Brauer-Grothendieck group of $X$ where $X$ is a smooth compactification of $T$, provided by
Kunyavskii, Skorobogatov and Tsfasman. We make a procedure to compute such stably birational invariants
effectively and the computations are done by using the computer algebra system GAP. Second, we define
the $p$-part of the flabby class $[\widehat{T}]^{fl}$ as a $Z_p[Sy_p(G)]$-lattice and prove that
they are faithful and indecomposable $Z_p[Sy_p(G)]$-lattices unless it vanishes for $p=2$ (resp.
$p=2,3$) in dimension $3$ (resp. $4$). The $Z_p$-ranks of them are also given. Third, we give a necessary
and sufficient condition for which two not stably rational algebraic tori $T$ and $T^\prime$ of
dimensions $3$ (resp. $4$) are stably birationally equivalent in terms of the splitting fields
and the weak stably equivalent classes of $T$ and $T^\prime$. In particular, the splitting fields
of them should coincide if $\widehat{T}$ and $\widehat{T}^\prime$ are indecomposable. Forth,
for each $7$ cases of not stably but retract rational algebraic tori of dimension $4$, we find an algebraic
torus $T^\prime$ of dimension $4$ which satisfies that $T\times_k T^\prime$ is stably rational.
Finally, we give a criteria to determine whether two algebraic tori $T$ and $T^\prime$ of general
dimensions are stably birationally equivalent when $T$ (resp. $T^\prime$) is stably birationally
equivalent to some algebraic torus of dimension up to $4$.

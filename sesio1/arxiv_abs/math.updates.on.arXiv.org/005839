Finite element methods based on cut-cells are becoming increasingly popular because of their advantages
over formulations based on body-fitted meshes for problems with moving interfaces. In such methods,
the cells (or elements) which are cut by the interface between two different domains need to be integrated
using special techniques in order to obtain optimal convergence rates and accurate fluxes across
the interface. Adaptive integration technique in which the cells are recursively subdivided is
one of the popular techniques for the numerical integration of cut-cells due to its advantages over
tessellation, particularly for problems involving complex geometries in three dimensions. Although
adaptive integration does not impose any limitations on the representation of the geometry of immersed
solids as it requires only point location algorithms, it becomes computationally expensive for
recovering optimal convergence rates. This paper presents a comprehensive assessment of the adaptive
integration of cut-cells for applications in computational fluid dynamics and fluid-structure
interaction. We assess the effect of the accuracy of integration of cut cells on convergence rates
in velocity and pressure fields, and then on forces and displacements for fluid-structure interaction
problems by studying several examples in two and three dimensions. By taking the computational
cost and the accuracy of forces and displacements into account, we demonstrate that numerical results
of acceptable accuracy for FSI problems involving laminar flows can be obtained with only fewer
levels of refinement. In particular, we show that three levels of adaptive refinement are sufficient
for obtaining force and displacement values of acceptable accuracy for laminar fluid-structure
interaction problems.

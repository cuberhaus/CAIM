In this paper we study the problem of characterizing and computing the nonanticipative rate distortion
function (NRDF) for partially observable multivariate Gauss-Markov processes with hard mean
squared error (MSE) distortion constraints. For the finite time horizon case, we first derive the
complete characterization of this problem and its corresponding optimal realization which is
shown to be a linear functional of the current time sufficient statistic of the past and current observations
signals. We show that when the problem is strictly feasible, it can be computed via semidefinite
programming (SDP) algorithm. For time-varying scalar processes with average total MSE distortion
we derive an optimal closed form expression by means of a dynamic reverse-waterfilling solution
that we also implement via an iterative scheme that convergences linearly in finite time, and a closed-form
solution under pointwise MSE distortion constraint. For the infinite time horizon, we give necessary
and sufficient conditions to ensure that asymptotically the sufficient statistic process of the
observation signals achieves a steady-state solution for the corresponding covariance matrices
and impose conditions that allow existence of a time-invariant solution. Then, we show that when
a finite solution exists in the asymptotic limit, it can be computed via SDP algorithm. We also give
strong structural properties on the characterization of the problem in the asymptotic limit that
allow for an optimal solution via a reverse-waterfilling algorithm that we implement via an iterative
scheme that converges linearly under a finite number of spatial components. Our results are corroborated
with various simulation studies and are also compared with existing results in the literature.

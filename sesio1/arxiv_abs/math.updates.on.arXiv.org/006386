We study elective surgery planning in flexible operating rooms (ORs) where emergency patients
are accommodated in the existing elective surgery schedule. Specifically, elective surgeries
can be scheduled weeks or months in advance. In contrast, an emergency surgery arrives randomly
and must be performed on the day of arrival. Probability distributions of the actual durations of
elective and emergency surgeries are unknown, and only a possibly small set of historical realizations
may be available. To address distributional uncertainty, we first construct an ambiguity set that
encompasses all possible distributions of surgery durations within a 1-Wasserstein distance
from the empirical distribution. We then define a distributionally robust surgery assignment
(DSA) problem to determine optimal elective surgery assignment decisions to available surgical
blocks in multiple ORs, considering the capacity needed for emergency cases. The objective is to
minimize the total cost consisting of the fixed cost related to scheduling or rejecting elective
surgery plus the maximum expected cost associated with OR overtime and idle time over all distributions
defined in the ambiguity set. Using the DSA model's structural properties, we derive an equivalent
mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) reformulation that can be implemented and solved efficiently
using off-the-shelf optimization software. In addition, we extend the proposed model to determine
the number of ORs needed to serve the two competing surgery classes and derive a MILP reformulation
of this extension. We conduct extensive numerical experiments based on real-world surgery data,
demonstrating our proposed model's computational efficiency and superior out-of-sample operational
performance over two state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, we derive insights into surgery
scheduling in flexible ORs.

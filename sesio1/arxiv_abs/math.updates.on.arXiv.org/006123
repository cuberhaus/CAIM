In this paper, we are dealing with a rigorous homogenization result at two different levels for the
bidomain model of cardiac electro-physiology. The first level associated with the mesoscopic
structure such that the cardiac tissue consists of extracellular and intracellular domains separated
by an interface (the sarcolemma). The second one related to the microscopic structure in such a way
that the intracellular medium can only be viewed as a periodical layout of unit cells (mitochondria).
At the interface between intra-and extracellular media, the fluxes are given by nonlinear functions
of ionic and applied currents. A rigorous homogenization process based on unfolding operators
is applied to derive the macroscopic (homogenized) model from our meso-microscopic bidomain model.
We apply a three-scale unfolding method in the intracellular problem to obtain its homogenized
equation at two levels. The first level upscaling of the intracellular structure yields the mesoscopic
equation. The second step of the homogenization leads to obtain the intracellular homogenized
equation. To prove the convergence of the nonlinear terms, especially those defined on the microscopic
interface, we use the boundary unfolding method and a Kolmogorov-Riesz compactness's result.
Next, we use the standard unfolding method to homogenize the extracellular problem. Finally, we
obtain, at the limit, a reaction-diffusion system on a single domain (the superposition of the intracellular
and extracellular media) which contains the homogenized equations depending on three scales.
Such a model is widely used for describing the macroscopic behavior of the cardiac tissue, which
is recognized to be an important messengers between the cytoplasm (intracellular) and the other
extracellular inside the biological cells. Contents 2020 Mathematics Subject Classification.

We study the log-rank conjecture from the perspective of point-hyperplane incidence geometry.
We formulate the following conjecture: Given a point set in $\mathbb{R}^d$ that is covered by constant-sized
sets of parallel hyperplanes, there exists an affine subspace that accounts for a large (i.e., $2^{-{\operatorname{polylog}(d)}}$)
fraction of the incidences. Alternatively, our conjecture may be interpreted linear-algebraically
as follows: Any rank-$d$ matrix containing at most $O(1)$ distinct entries in each column contains
a submatrix of fractional size $2^{-{\operatorname{polylog}(d)}}$, in which each column contains
one distinct entry. We prove that our conjecture is equivalent to the log-rank conjecture. Motivated
by the connections above, we revisit well-studied questions in point-hyperplane incidence geometry
without structural assumptions (i.e., the existence of partitions). We give an elementary argument
for the existence of complete bipartite subgraphs of density $\Omega(\epsilon^{2d}/d)$ in any
$d$-dimensional configuration with incidence density $\epsilon$. We also improve an upper-bound
construction of Apfelbaum and Sharir (SIAM J. Discrete Math. '07), yielding a configuration whose
complete bipartite subgraphs are exponentially small and whose incidence density is $\Omega(1/\sqrt
d)$. Finally, we discuss various constructions (due to others) which yield configurations with
incidence density $\Omega(1)$ and bipartite subgraph density $2^{-\Omega(\sqrt d)}$. Our framework
and results may help shed light on the difficulty of improving Lovett's $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\operatorname{rank}(f)})$
bound (J. ACM '16) for the log-rank conjecture; in particular, any improvement on this bound would
imply the first bipartite subgraph size bounds for parallel $3$-partitioned configurations which
beat our generic bounds for unstructured configurations.

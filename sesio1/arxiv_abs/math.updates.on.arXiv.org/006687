Locally convex (or nondegenerate) curves in the sphere $S^n$ (or the projective space) have been
studied for several reasons, including the study of linear ordinary differential equations of
order $n+1$. Taking Frenet frames allows us to obtain corresponding curves $\Gamma$ in the group
$Spin_{n+1}$; recall that $\Pi: Spin_{n+1} \to Flag_{n+1}$ is the universal cover of the space
of flags. Let $L(z_0;z_1)$ be the space of such curves $\Gamma$ with prescribed endpoints $\Gamma(0)
= z_0$, $\Gamma(1) = z_1$. The aim of this paper is to determine the homotopy type of the spaces $L_3(z_0;z_1)$
for all $z_0, z_1 \in Spin_4$. Recall that $Spin_4 = S^3 \times S^3 \subset H \times H$, where $H$ is
the ring of quaternions. This paper relies heavily on previous publications. The earliest such
paper solves the corresponding problem for curves in $S^2$. Another previous result (with B. Shapiro)
reduces the problem to $z_0 = 1$ and $z_1 \in Quat_4$ where $Quat_4 \subset Spin_4$ is a finite group
of order $16$ with center $Z(Quat_4) = \{(\pm 1,\pm 1)\}$. A more recent paper shows that for $z_1
\in Quat_4 \smallsetminus Z(Quat_4)$ we have a homotopy equivalence $L_3(1;z_1) \approx \Omega
Spin_4$. In this paper we compute the homotopy type of $L_3(1;z_1)$ for $z_1 \in Z(Quat_4)$: it is
equivalent to the infinite wedge of $\Omega Spin_4$ with an infinite countable family of spheres
(as for the case $n = 2$). The structure of the proof is roughly the same as for the case $n = 2$ but some
of the steps are much harder. In both cases we construct explicit subsets $Y \subset L_n(z_0;z_1)$
for which the inclusion $Y \subset \Omega Spin_{n+1}(z_0;z_1)$ is a homotopy equivalence. For
$n = 3$, this is done by considering the itineraries of such curves. The itinerary of a curve in $L_n(1;z_1)$
is a finite word in the alphabet $S_{n+1} \smallsetminus \{e\}$ of nontrivial permutations.

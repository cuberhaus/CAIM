We prove that the Fourier-Stieltjes algebra $\mathrm{B}(G)$ of a discrete group $G$ is isometrically
isomorphic to the algebra $\mathfrak{M}^{\infty,\mathrm{dec}}(G)$ of decomposable Fourier
multipliers on the group von Neumann algebra $\mathrm{VN}(G)$. With sharp contrast, we prove that
$\mathfrak{M}^{\infty,\mathrm{dec}}(G)\not=\mathrm{B}(G)$ for some class of non-discrete
locally compact groups and that $\mathfrak{M}^{\infty,\mathrm{dec}}(G)=\mathrm{B}(G)$ for
any (second countable unimodular) inner amenable locally compact group. To prove these results,
we connect to groupoid theory and to the problem of the existence of a contractive projection preserving
complete positivity from the space of normal completely bounded operators on $\mathrm{VN}(G)$
onto the space $\mathfrak{M}^{\infty,\mathrm{cb}}(G)$ of completely bounded Fourier multipliers,
that we solve affirmatively in the inner amenable case. In addition, we are able to show that such
projections does not exist for (second countable) non-amenable connected locally compact groups.
Indeed, we examine more generally if the space $\mathfrak{M}^{p,\mathrm{cb}}(G)$ of completely
bounded Fourier multipliers on the noncommutative $\mathrm{L}^p$-space $\mathrm{L}^p(\mathrm{VN}(G))$
is complemented in the space of completely bounded operators, where $1 \leq p \leq \infty$. Using
doubling metrics on Lie groups and structure theory from the solution to Hilbert's fifth problem,
we establish that any (second countable unimodular) finite-dimensional amenable locally compact
group admits compatible bounded projections at level $p=1$ and $p=\infty$. Finally, we also state
a related new characterization of amenability for (second countable unimodular) locally compact
groups and we also give applications to decomposable (=regular) multipliers.

The Lipschitz extension modulus $e(M)$ of a metric space $M$ is the infimum over $L\ge 1$ such that
for any Banach space $Z$ and any $C\subset M$, any 1-Lipschitz function $f:C\to Z$ can be extended
to an $L$-Lipschitz function $F:M\to Z$. Johnson, Lindenstrauss and Schechtman proved that if
$X$ is an $n$-dimensional normed space, then $e(X)=O(n)$. In the reverse direction, we prove that
every $n$-dimensional normed space $X$ satisfies $e(X)\ge n^c$, where $c>0$ is a universal constant.
Our core technical contribution is a geometric structural result on stochastic clustering of finite
dimensional normed spaces which implies upper bounds on their Lipschitz extension moduli using
an extension method of Lee and the author. The separation modulus of a metric space $(M,d_M)$ is the
infimum over $\sigma>0$ such that for any $\Delta>0$ there is a distribution over random partitions
of $M$ into clusters of diameter at most $\Delta$ such that for every $x,y\in M$ the probability that
they belong to different clusters is at most $\sigma d_M(x,y)/\Delta$. We obtain upper and lower
bounds on the separation moduli of finite dimensional normed spaces that relate them to well-studied
volumetric invariants. Using these connections, we find the growth rate of the separation moduli
of various normed spaces. We formulate a conjecture on isomorphic reverse isoperimetry that can
be used with our volumetric bounds on the separation modulus to obtain many more asymptotic evaluations
of the separation moduli of normed spaces. Our estimates on the separation modulus imply improved
bounds on the Lipschitz extension moduli of various classical spaces. In particular, we deduce
an improved bound on $e(\ell_p^n)$ when $p>2$ that resolves a conjecture of Brudnyi and Brudnyi,
and prove that $e(\ell_\infty^n)\asymp{\sqrt{n}}$, which is the first time that the order of $e(X)$
has been evaluated for any normed space $X$.

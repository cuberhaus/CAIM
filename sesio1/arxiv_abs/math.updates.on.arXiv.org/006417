In this paper, we propose and analyze a set of fully non-stationary Anderson acceleration algorithms
with dynamic window sizes and optimized damping. Although Anderson acceleration (AA) has been
used for decades to speed up nonlinear solvers in many applications, most authors are simply using
and analyzing the stationary version of Anderson acceleration (sAA) with fixed window size and
a constant damping factor. The behavior and potential of the non-stationary version of Anderson
acceleration methods remain an open question. Since most efficient linear solvers use composable
algorithmic components. Similar ideas can be used for AA to solve nonlinear systems. Thus in the
present work, to develop non-stationary Anderson acceleration algorithms, we first propose two
systematic ways to dynamically alternate the window size $m$ by composition. One simple way to package
sAA(m) with sAA(n) in each iteration is applying sAA(m) and sAA(n) separately and then average their
results. It is an additive composite combination. The other more important way is the multiplicative
composite combination, which means we apply sAA(m) in the outer loop and apply sAA(n) in the inner
loop. By doing this, significant gains can be achieved. Secondly, to make AA to be a fully non-stationary
algorithm, we need to combine these strategies with our recent work on the non-stationary Anderson
acceleration algorithm with optimized damping (AAoptD), which is another important direction
of producing non-stationary AA and nice performance gains have been observed. Moreover, we also
investigate the rate of convergence of these non-stationary AA methods under suitable assumptions.
Finally, our numerical results show that some of these proposed non-stationary Anderson acceleration
algorithms converge faster than the stationary sAA method and they may significantly reduce the
storage and time to find the solution in many cases.

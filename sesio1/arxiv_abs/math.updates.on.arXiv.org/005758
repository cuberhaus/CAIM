Construction of a top-down holographic dual of thermal QCD-like theories (equivalence class of
theories which are UV-conformal, IR-confining and have fundamental quarks) {\it at intermediate
't Hooft coupling} and the $G$-structure (torsion classes) classification of the underlying geometries
(in the Infra Red (IR)/non-conformal sector in particular) of the {\it non-supersymmetric} string/${\cal
M}$-theory duals, have been missing in the literature. We take the first important steps in this
direction by studying the ${\cal M}$ theory dual of large-$N$ thermal QCD-like theories at intermediate
gauge and 't Hooft couplings and obtaining the ${\cal O}(l_p^6)$ corrections arising from the ${\cal
O}(R^4)$ terms to the ``MQGP'' background (${\cal M}$-theory dual of large-$N$ thermal QCD-like
theories at intermediate gauge/string coupling, but large 't Hooft coupling) of \cite{MQGP}.
The main Physics lesson learnt is that there is a competition between non-conformal IR enhancement
and Planckian and large-$N$ suppression and going to orders beyond the ${\cal O}(l_p^6)$ is necessitated
if the IR enhancement wins out. The main lesson learnt in Math is in the context of the differential
geometry ($G$-structure classification) of the internal manifolds relevant to the string/${\cal
M}$-theory duals of large-$N$ thermal QCD-like theories, wherein we obtain for the first time inclusive
of the ${\cal O}(R^4)$ corrections in the Infra-Red (IR), the $SU(3)$-structure torsion classes
of the type IIA mirror of \cite{metrics} (making contact en route with Siegel theta functions related
to appropriate hyperelliptic curves, as well as the Kiepert's algorithm of solving quintics),
and the $G_2/SU(4)/Spin(7)$-structure torsion classes of the seven- and eight-folds associated
with its ${\cal M}$ theory uplift.

Finite tensor categories (FTCs) $\bf T$ are important generalizations of the categories of finite
dimensional modules of finite dimensional Hopf algebras, which play a key role in many areas of mathematics
and mathematical physics. There are two fundamentally different support theories for them: a cohomological
one and a universal one based on the noncommutative Balmer spectra of their stable (triangulated)
categories $\underline{\bf T}$. In this paper we introduce the new notion of the categorical center
$C^\bullet_{\underline{\bf T}}$ of the cohomology ring $R^\bullet_{\underline{\bf T}}$ of
an FTC, $\bf T$. This enables us to put forward a complete and detailed program for determining the
exact relationship between the two support theories, based on $C^\bullet_{\underline{\bf T}}$
of the cohomology ring $R^\bullet_{\underline{\bf T}}$ of an FTC, $\bf T$. More specifically,
we construct a continuous map from the noncommutative Balmer spectrum of an FTC, $\bf T$, to the $\text{Proj}$
of the categorical center $C^\bullet_{\underline{\bf T}}$, and prove that this map is surjective
under a weaker finite generation assumption for $\bf T$ than the one conjectured by Etingof-Ostrik.
Under stronger assumptions, we prove that (i) the map is homeomorphism and (ii) the two-sided thick
ideals of $\underline{\bf T}$ are classified by the specialization closed subsets of $\text{Proj}
C^\bullet_{\underline{\bf T}}$. We conjecture that both results hold for all FTCs. Many examples
are presented that demonstrate how in important cases $C^\bullet_{\underline{\bf T}}$ arises
as a fixed point subring of $R^\bullet_{\underline{\bf T}}$ and how the two-sided thick ideals
of $\underline{\bf T}$ are determined in a uniform fashion. The majority of our results are proved
in the greater generality of monoidal triangulated categories.

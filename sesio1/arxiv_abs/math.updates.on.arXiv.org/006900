We develop a cross-border market model between two countries in which the transmission capacities
that enable transactions between market participants of different countries are limited. Starting
from two so-called reduced-form representations of national limit order book dynamics, we allow
incoming market orders to be matched with standing volumes of the foreign market, resulting in cross-border
trades. We introduce a microscopic model that consists of two bid and ask price processes, four queue
length processes that describe the number of unexecuted limit orders at the best bid and ask prices,
and a capacity process. The latter counts the net number of executed cross-border trades over time.
Since the transmission capacities in our model are limited, our model alternates between regimes
in which cross-border trades are possible and regimes in which incoming market orders can only be
matched against limit orders of the same origin. If the size of an individual order converges to zero
while the order arrival rate tends to infinity, we derive a continuous-time limit approximation
of our microscopic market dynamics. In the limit the volume dynamics is approximated by a four-dimensional,
non-negative semimartingale with a non-trivial martingale part and reflections to the interior
of $\mathbb{R}^4_+$ on hits of the (cumulative) queue length process of the axes. The approximation
of the capacity dynamics turns out to be a bounded continuous process of finite variation. Since
the tick size in our model is constant, the approximation of the bid (resp. ask) price dynamics is
a two-dimensional pure jump process with jump times equal to those of the volume approximation.
The usefulness of the ability to transact across borders is illustrated through a simulation study
of price evolution.

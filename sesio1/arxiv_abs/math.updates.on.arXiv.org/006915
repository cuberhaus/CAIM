We define a class of not necessarily linear $C_0$-semigroups $(P_t)_{t\geq0}$ on $C_b(E)$ (more
generally, on $C_\kappa(E):=\frac{1}{\kappa} C_b(E)$, for some growth bounding continuous
function $\kappa$) equipped with the mixed topology $\tau_1^{\mathcal M}$ for a large class of
topological state spaces $E$. In the linear case we prove that such $(P_t)_{t\geq 0}$ can be characterized
as integral operators given by measure kernels satisfying certain properties. As a main result
we prove that transition semigroups of Markov processes are $C_0$-semigroups on $(C_b(E),\tau_{1}^{\mathcal
M})$, if they leave $C_b(E)$ invariant and they are jointly weakly continuous in space and time.
In particular, they are infinitesimally generated by their generator $(L,D(L))$ and thus reconstructable
through an Euler formula from their strong derivative at zero in $(C_b(E), \tau_{1}^{\mathcal
M})$. This solves a long standing open problem on Markov processes. Our results apply to a large number
of Markov processes given as the laws of solutions to SDEs and SPDEs, including the stochastic 2D
Navier-Stokes equations and the stochastic fast and slow diffusion porous media equations. Furthermore,
we introduce the notion of a Markov core operator $(L_0, D(L_0))$ for the above generators $(L, D(L))$
and prove that uniqueness of the Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equations corresponding to $(L_0,D(L_0))$
for all Dirac initial conditions implies that $(L_0,D(L_0))$ is a Markov core operator for $(L,D(L))$.
This allows to identify the Kolmogorov operators of a large number of SDEs on finite and infinite
dimensional state spaces as Markov core operators for the infinitesimal generators of their transition
semigroups. Moreover, we prove that convex $C_0$-semigroups $(P_t)_{t\geq0}$ give rise to viscosity
solutions to the Cauchy problem of their associated infinitesimal generators.

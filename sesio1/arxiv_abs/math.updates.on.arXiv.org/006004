We initiate a systematic study of cohomogeneity-one solitons in Bryant's Laplacian flow of closed
G_2-structures on a 7-manifold, motivated by the problem of understanding finite-time singularities
of that flow. Here we focus on solitons with symmetry groups Sp(2) and SU(3); in both cases we prove
the existence of continuous families of local cohomogeneity-one gradient Laplacian solitons
and characterise which of these local solutions extend smoothly over their unique singular orbits.
The main questions are then to determine which of these smoothly-closing solutions extend to complete
solitons and furthermore to understand the asymptotic geometry of these complete solitons. We
provide complete answers to both questions in the case of steady solitons. Up to the actions of scaling
and discrete symmetries, we show that the set of all smoothly-closing SU(3)-invariant steady Laplacian
solitons defined on a neighbourhood of the zero-section of the anti-self-dual bundle of CP^2 is
parametrised by the set of nonnegative reals. An open interval I=(0,c) corresponds to complete
nontrivial gradient solitons that are asymptotic to the unique SU(3)-invariant torsion-free
G_2 cone. The boundary point 0 of I corresponds to the well-known Bryant--Salamon asymptotically
conical G_2-manifold, while the other boundary point c corresponds to an explicit complete gradient
steady soliton with exponential volume growth and novel asymptotic geometry. The open interval
(c, oo) consists entirely of incomplete solutions. In addition, we find an explicit complete gradient
shrinking soliton on the anti-self-dual bundle of S^4 and CP^2. Both these shrinkers are asymptotic
to closed but non-torsion-free G_2 cones. Like the nontrivial AC gradient steady solitons on the
anti-self-dual bundle of CP^2, these shrinkers appear to be potential singularity models for finite-time
singularities of Laplacian flow.

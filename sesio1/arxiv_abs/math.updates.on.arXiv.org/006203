In mathematical modeling, several different functional forms can often be used to fit a data set
equally well, especially if the data is sparse. In such cases, these mathematically different but
similar looking functional forms are typically considered interchangeable. Recent work, however,
shows that similar functional responses may nonetheless result in significantly different bifurcation
points for the Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey system. Since the bifurcation behaviours
include destabilising oscillations, predicting the occurrence of such behaviours is clearly
important. Ecologically, different bifurcation behaviours mean that different predictions
may be obtained from the models. These predictions can range from stable coexistence to the extinction
of both species, so obtaining more accurate predictions is also clearly important for conservationists.
Mathematically, this difference in bifurcation structure given similar functional responses
is called structural sensitivity. We extend the existing work to find that the Leslie-Gower-May
predator-prey system is also structurally sensitive to the functional response. Using the Rosenzweig-MacArthur
and Leslie-Gower-May models, we then aim to determine if there is some way to obtain a functional
description of data so that different functional responses yield the same bifurcation structure,
i.e., we aim to describe data such that our model is not structurally sensitive. We analyze the functional
responses using two different methods to determine which part of each function contributes most
to the observed bifurcation behaviour. We find that prey densities around the coexistence steady
state are most important in defining the functional response. Lastly, we propose a procedure for
ecologists and mathematical modelers to increase the accuracy of model predictions in predator-prey
systems.

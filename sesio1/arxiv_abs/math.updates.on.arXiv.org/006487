The purpose of this work is to introduce a notion of weak solution to the master equation of a potential
mean field game and to prove that existence and uniqueness hold under quite general assumptions.
Remarkably, this is achieved without any monotonicity constraint on the coefficients. The key
point is to interpret the master equation in a conservative sense and then to adapt to the infinite
dimensional setting earlier arguments for hyperbolic systems deriving from a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman
equation. Here, the master equation is indeed regarded as an infinite dimensional system set on
the space of probability measures and is formally written as the derivative of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman
equation associated with the mean field control problem lying above the mean field game. To make
the analysis easier, we assume that the coefficients are periodic, which allows to represent probability
measures through their Fourier coefficients. Most of the analysis then consists in rewriting the
master equation and the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation for the mean field control
problem as partial differential equations set on the Fourier coefficients themselves. In the end,
we establish existence and uniqueness of functions that are displacement semi-concave in the measure
argument and that solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation in a suitable generalized sense
and, subsequently, we get existence and uniqueness of functions that solve the master equation
in an appropriate weak sense and that satisfy a weak one-sided Lipschitz inequality. As another
new result, we also prove that the optimal trajectories of the associated mean field control problem
are unique for almost every starting point, for a suitable probability measure on the space of probability
measures.

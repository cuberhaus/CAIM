\emph{Full-bond percolation} with parameter $p$ is the process in which, given a graph, for every
edge independently, we delete the edge with probability $1-p$. Bond percolation is motivated by
problems in mathematical physics and it is studied in parallel computing and network science to
understand the resilience of distributed systems to random link failure and the spread of information
in networks through unreliable links. Full-bond percolation is also equivalent to the \emph{Reed-Frost
process}, a network version of \emph{SIR} epidemic spreading, in which the graph represents contacts
among people and $p$ corresponds to the probability that a contact between an infected person and
a susceptible one causes a transmission of the infection. We consider \emph{one-dimensional power-law
small-world graphs} with parameter $\alpha$ obtained as the union of a cycle with additional long-range
random edges: each pair of nodes $(u,v)$ at distance $L$ on the cycle is connected by a long-range
edge $(u,v)$, with probability proportional to $1/L^\alpha$. Our analysis determines three phases
for the percolation subgraph $G_p$ of the small-world graph, depending on the value of $\alpha$.
1) If $\alpha < 1$, there is a $p<1$ such that, with high probability, there are $\Omega(n)$ nodes
that are reachable in $G_p$ from one another in $O(\log n)$ hops; 2) If $1 < \alpha < 2$, there is a $p<1$
such that, with high probability, there are $\Omega(n)$ nodes that are reachable in $G_p$ from one
another in $\log^{O(1)}(n)$ hops; 3) If $\alpha > 2$, for every $p<1$, with high probability all
connected components of $G_p$ have size $O(\log n)$. The setting of full-bond percolation in finite
graphs studied in this paper, which is the one that corresponds to the network SIR model of epidemic
spreading, had not been analyzed before.

Ratios and coefficients are used to simplify calculations. For geometric usage these values also
called function values. Like in Egypt also in Babylon such a value system can be shown. The reconstructed
calculation sequence, of the Plimpton 322 cuneiform tablet, presented and described here, shows
in its completeness that, around 3800 years ago there already was a systematically applied exact
measuring system, with the usage of trigonometric function values. With this approach one can plausibly
explain that, as we still it practice today, a geometry of the circle has been used for this calculation.
It is based on, but not only, of the usage of the regularities, which 1200 years later, were named after
Pythagoras. During a second calculation step, for an intended scaled documentation, presentation
or transfer to other locations, the dimensionless calculated function value, was extended, with
a fractional part, or more exact spelled a common factor. This transformation creates a real measurable
length from the ratios, always related to the smallest unit. The systematic usage by means of inclining
triangles already in old Babylonian times, goes far beyond the previously known level of this age.
The accuracy of the individual calculation is just as verifiable and on exactly the same level as
the trigonometric functions used today. However, at least at this point in time, the Babylonians
were content with dividing a quarter circle into at least 150 inclining triangles. This old Babylonian
trigonometric function value system, together with the here described "Babylonian diagonal calculation",
is thus the forerunner of the Greek chord calculation and the Indo-Arabic trigonometric functions
of the early Middle Ages, which we still use today. In addition, the new approach to Plimpton 322 plausible
explains why and how such values could have been used.

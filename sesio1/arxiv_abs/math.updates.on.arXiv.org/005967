Bennett's notion of depth is usually considered to describe the usefulness and internal organization
of the information encoded into an object such as an infinite binary sequence. We consider a natural
way to relativize the notion of depth for such sets, and we investigate for various kinds of oracles
whether and how the unrelativized and the relativized version of depth differ. Intuitively speaking,
access to an oracle increases computation power. Accordingly, for most notions for sets considered
in computability theory, for the corresponding classes trivially for all oracles the unrelativized
class is contained in the relativized class or for all oracles the relativized class is contained
in the unrelativized class. Examples for these two cases are given by the classes of computable and
of Martin-L\"{o}f random sets, respectively. However, in the case for depth the situation is different.
It turns out that the classes of deep sets and of sets that are deep relative to the halting set $\emptyset
'$ are incomparable with respect to set-theoretical inclusion. On the other hand, the class of deep
sets is strictly contained in the class of sets that are deep relative to any given Martin-L\"{o}f-random
oracle. The set built in the proof of the latter result can also be used to give a short proof of the known
fact that every PA-complete degree is Turing-equivalent to the join of two Martin-L\"{o}f-random
sets. In fact, we slightly strengthen this result by showing that every DNC$_2$ function is truth-table-equivalent
to the join of two Martin-L\"{o}f random sets. Furthermore, we observe that the class of deep sets
relative to any given K-trivial oracle either is the same as or is strictly contained in the class
of deep sets. Obviously, the former case applies to computable oracles. We leave it as an open problem
which of the two possibilities can occur for noncomputable K-trivial oracles.

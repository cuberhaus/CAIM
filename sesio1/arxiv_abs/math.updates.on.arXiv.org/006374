We consider the cache-aided multiple-input single-output (MISO) broadcast channel, which consists
of a server with $L$ antennas and $K$ single-antenna users, where the server contains $N$ files of
equal length and each user is equipped with a local cache of size $M$ files. Each user requests an arbitrary
file from library. The objective is to design a coded caching scheme based on uncoded placement and
one-shot linear delivery, to achieve the maximum sum Degree-of-Freedom (sum-DoF) with low subpacketization.
It was shown in the literature that under the constraint of uncoded placement and one-shot linear
delivery, the optimal sum-DoF is $L+\frac{KM}{N}$. However, previously proposed schemes for
this setting incurred either an exponential subpacketization order in $K$, or required specific
conditions in the system parameters $L$, $K$, $M$ and $N$. In this paper, we propose a new combinatorial
structure called multiple-antenna placement delivery array (MAPDA). Based on MAPDA and Latin
square, the first proposed scheme achieves the optimal sum-DoF $L+\frac{KM}{N}$ with the subpacketization
of $K$ when $\frac{KM}{N}+L=K$. Subsequently, for the general case we propose a transformation
approach to construct an MAPDA from any $g$-regular PDA (a class of PDA where each integer in the array
occurs $g$ times) for the original shared-link coded caching problem. When the original PDA corresponds
to the Maddah-Ali and Niesen coded caching scheme, the resulting scheme under the combinatorial
structure of MAPDA can achieve the optimal sum-DoF $L+\frac{KM}{N}$ with reduced subpacketization
with respect to the existing schemes. The work can be extended to the multiple independent single-antenna
transmitters (servers) corresponding to the cache-aided interference channel proposed by Naderializadeh
et al. and the scenario of transmitters equipped with multiple antennas.

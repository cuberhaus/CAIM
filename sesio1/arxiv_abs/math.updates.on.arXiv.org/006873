Phase-field models are a leading approach for realistic fracture problems. They treat the crack
as a second phase and use gradient terms to smear out the crack faces, enabling the use of standard
numerical methods for simulations. This regularization causes cracks to occupy a finite volume
in the reference, and leads to the inability to appropriately model the closing or contacting --
without healing -- of crack faces. Specifically, the classical idealized crack face tractions
are that the shear component is zero, and that the normal component is zero when the crack opens and
identical to the intact material when the crack closes. Phase-field fracture models do not replicate
this behavior. This work addresses this shortcoming by introducing an effective crack energy density
that endows the regularized (finite volume) phase-field crack with the effective properties of
an idealized sharp crack. The approach is based on applying the QR (upper triangular) decomposition
of the deformation gradient tensor in the basis of the crack, enabling a transparent identification
of the crack deformation modes. By then relaxing over those modes that do not cost energy, an effective
energy is obtained that has the intact response when the crack faces close and zero energy when the
crack faces are open. A highlight of this approach is that it lies completely in the setting of finite
deformation, enabling potential application to soft materials and other settings with large deformation
or rotations. The model is applied to numerically study representative complex loadings, including
(1) cyclic loading on a cavity in a soft solid that shows the growth and closing of cracks in complex
stress states; and (2) cyclic shear that shows a complex pattern of crack branching driven by the
closure of cracks.

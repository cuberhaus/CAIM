Pattern formation in biological tissues plays an important role in the development of living organisms.
Since the classical work of Alan Turing, a pre-eminent way of modelling has been through reaction-diffusion
mechanisms. More recently, alternative models have been proposed, that link dynamics of diffusing
molecular signals with tissue mechanics. In order to distinguish among different models, they
should be compared to experimental observations. However, in many experimental situations only
the limiting, stationary regime of the pattern formation process is observable, without knowledge
of the transient behaviour or the initial state. The unstable nature of the underlying dynamics
in all alternative models seriously complicates model and parameter identification, since small
changes in the initial condition lead to distinct stationary patterns. To overcome this problem
the initial state of the model can be randomised. In the latter case, fixed values of the model parameters
correspond to a family of patterns rather than a fixed stationary solution, and standard approaches
to compare pattern data directly with model outputs, e.g., in the least squares sense, are not suitable.
Instead, statistical characteristics of the patterns should be compared, which is difficult given
the typically limited amount of available data in practical applications. To deal with this problem,
we extend a recently developed statistical approach for parameter identification using pattern
data, the so-called Correlation Integral Likelihood (CIL) method. We suggest modifications that
allow increasing the accuracy of the identification process without resizing the data set. The
proposed approach is tested using different classes of pattern formation models. For all considered
equations, parallel GPU-based implementations of the numerical solvers with efficient time stepping
schemes are provided.

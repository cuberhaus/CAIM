Circulant graphs $C_n(R)$ and $C_n(S)$ are said to be \emph{Adam's isomorphic} if there exist some
$a\in \mathbb{Z}_n^*$ such that $S = a R$ under arithmetic reflexive modulo $n$. $C_n(R)$ is said
to have {\it Cayley Isomorphism} (CI) property if whenever $C_n(S)$ is isomorphic to $C_n(R),$
they are of Adam's isomorphic. Investigation of circulant graphs without $CI$-property is not
much done. Vilfred defined a new type of isomorphism, Type-2 isomorphism, different from Adam's
isomorphism, on circulant graphs of order $n$ with respect to $r$, $\gcd(n, r)$ $>$ 1 and $r,n\in\mathbb{N}$
and we obtained such families of graphs for $r$ = 2,3,5,7 and $n\in\mathbb{N}$. In this paper, we
obtain more general families of Type-2 isomorphic circulant graphs of order $np^3$ with respect
to $r = p$, and abelian groups on these isomorphic graphs where $p$ is a prime number and $n\in\mathbb{N}$.
Type-2 isomorphic circulant graphs don't have CI-property. In this paper, we obtain families of
Type-2 isomorphic circulant graphs of order $np^3$ w.r.t. $r = p$, and abelian groups on these isomorphic
graphs where $p$ is a prime number and $n\in\mathbb{N}$. Theorems \ref{c10} and \ref{c13} are the
main results. Example \ref{e9} shows that there are isomorphic circulant graphs $C_n(R)$ and $C_n(S)$
which are neither of Adam's nor of Type-2 isomorphic w.r.t. any particular $r$, $r\in R,S$. Using
Theorem \ref{c13}, a list of $T2_{np^3,p}(C_{np^3}(R^{np^3,x+yp}_j))$ for $p$ = 3,5,7,11 and
$n$ = 1 to 5 and also for $p$ = 13 and $n$ = 1 to 3 are given in the Annexure where $(T2_{np^3,p}(C_{np^3}(R^{np^3,x+yp}_j)),
\circ)$ is an abelian group on the $p$ isomorphic graphs $C_{np^3}(R^{np^3,x+yp}_i)$ of Type-2
w.r.t. $r = p$, $1 \leq i,j \leq p$, $1 \leq x \leq p-1$, $y\in\mathbb{N}_0$, $0 \leq y \leq np - 1$, $1
\leq x+yp \leq np^2-1$, $p,np^3-p\in R^{np^3,x+yp}_i$ and $i,j,n,x\in\mathbb{N}$.

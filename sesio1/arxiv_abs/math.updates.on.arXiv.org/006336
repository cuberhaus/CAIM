We consider growing random networks $\{\mathcal{G}_n\}_{n \ge 1}$ where, at each time, a new vertex
attaches itself to a collection of existing vertices via a fixed number $m \ge 1$ of edges, with probability
proportional to a function $f$ (called attachment function) of their degree. It was shown in \cite{BBpersistence}
that such network models exhibit two distinct regimes: (i) the persistent regime, corresponding
to $\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}f(i)^{-2} < \infty$, where the top $K$ maximal degree vertices fixate
over time for any given $K$, and (ii) the non-persistent regime, with $\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}f(i)^{-2}
= \infty$, where the identities of these vertices keep changing infinitely often over time. In this
article, we develop root finding algorithms using the empirical degree structure and local network
information based on a snapshot of such a network at some large time. In the persistent regime, the
algorithm is purely based on degree centrality. For a given error tolerance $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$,
there exists $K_{\varepsilon} \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for any $n \ge 1$, the confidence set for
the root in $\mathcal{G}_n$, which contains the root with probability at least $1 - \varepsilon$,
consists of the top $K_{\varepsilon}$ maximal degree vertices. In particular, the size of the confidence
set is stable in the network size. Upper and lower bounds on $K_{\varepsilon}$ are explicitly characterized
in terms of the error tolerance $\varepsilon$ and the attachment function $f$. In the non-persistent
regime, for an appropriate choice of $r_n \rightarrow \infty$ at a rate much smaller than the diameter
of the network, the neighborhood of radius $r_n$ around the maximal degree vertex is shown to contain
the root with high probability, and a size estimate for this set is obtained.

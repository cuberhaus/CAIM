Let $Y, Y^!$ be a pair of symplectically dual conical symplectic singularities. Assume that $Y$
has a symplectic resolution $X \rightarrow Y$. The equivariant Hikita conjecture (that we call
Hikita-Nakajima conjecture) claims that there should be an isomorphism of (graded) algebras $H^*_{S_Y}(X,\mathbb{C})
\simeq \mathbb{C}[(Y^{!,\mathrm{univ}})^{\mathbb{C}^\times}]$, here $S_Y \curvearrowright
Y$ is the torus acting on $Y$ preserving the Poisson structure, $Y^{!,\mathrm{univ}}$ is the universal
deformation of $Y^!$, $\mathbb{C}^\times$ is a generic one-dimensional torus acting on $Y^!$
and $\mathbb{C}[(Y^{!,\mathrm{univ}})^{\mathbb{C}^\times}]$ is the algebra of schematic
$\mathbb{C}^\times$-fixed points of $Y^!$. We prove the Hikita-Nakajima conjecture for $X=\mathfrak{M}(n,r)$
Gieseker variety ($ADHM$ space). We produce the isomorphism explicitly on generators and relations.
It turns out that if we realize $\mathfrak{M}_0(n,r)^{!,\mathrm{univ}}$ as a Coulomb branch,
then Chern classes of the tautological bundle on $\mathfrak{M}(n,r)$ correspond to Chern classes
of the tautological bundle on the corresponding variety of triples. We also describe the Hikita-Nakajima
isomorphism above using realization of $\mathfrak{M}_0(n,r)^{!,\mathrm{univ}}$ as a Nakajima
quiver variety and as the spectrum of the center of rational Cherednik algebra corresponding to
$S_n \ltimes (\mathbb{Z}/r\mathbb{Z})^n$ and identify all the algebras that appear with the center
of degenerate cyclotomic Hecke algebra (generalizing some results of Shan, Varagnolo and Vasserot).
Finally, we formulate as a conjecture that when $X$ is a Nakajima quiver variety then the Hikita-Nakajima
isomorphism should identify Chern classes of tautological bundles on $X$ with Chern classes of
tautological bundles on the corresponding variety of triples and describe possible approaches
towards the proof.

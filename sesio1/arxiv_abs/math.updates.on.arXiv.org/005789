We study periodic review stochastic inventory control in the data-driven setting where the retailer
makes ordering decisions based only on historical demand observations without any knowledge of
the probability distribution of the demand. Since an (s, S)-policy is optimal when the demand distribution
is known, we investigate the statistical properties of the data-driven (s, S)-policy obtained
by recursively computing the empirical cost-to-go functions. This policy is inherently challenging
to analyze because the recursion induces propagation of the estimation error backwards in time.
In this work, we establish the asymptotic properties of this data-driven policy by fully accounting
for the error propagation. First, we rigorously show the consistency of the estimated parameters
by filling in some gaps (due to unaccounted error propagation) in the existing studies. In this setting,
empirical process theory (EPT) cannot be directly applied to show asymptotic normality. To explain,
the empirical cost-to-go functions for the estimated parameters are not i.i.d. sums due to the error
propagation. Our main methodological innovation comes from an asymptotic representation for
multi-sample U-processes in terms of i.i.d. sums. This representation enables us to apply EPT to
derive the influence functions of the estimated parameters and to establish joint asymptotic normality.
Based on these results, we also propose an entirely data-driven estimator of the optimal expected
cost and we derive its asymptotic distribution. We demonstrate some useful applications of our
asymptotic results, including sample size determination and interval estimation. The results
from our numerical simulations conform to our theoretical analysis.lations conform to our theoretical

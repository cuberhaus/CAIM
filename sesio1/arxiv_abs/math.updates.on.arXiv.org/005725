In this paper, we mainly study the gradient based Jacobi-type algorithms to maximize two classes
of homogeneous polynomials with orthogonality constraints, and establish their convergence
properties. For the first class of homogeneous polynomials subject to a constraint on a Stiefel
manifold, we reformulate it as an optimization problem on a unitary group, which makes it possible
to apply the gradient based Jacobi-type (Jacobi-G) algorithm. Then, if the subproblem can be always
represented as a quadratic form, we establish the global convergence of Jacobi-G under any one of
the three conditions (A1), (A2) and (A3). The convergence result for (A1) is an easy extension of
the result in [Usevich et al. SIOPT 2020], while (A2) and (A3) are two new ones. This algorithm and
the convergence properties apply to the well-known joint approximate symmetric tensor diagonalization
and joint approximate symmetric trace maximization. For the second class of homogeneous polynomials
subject to constraints on the product of Stiefel manifolds, we similarly reformulate it as an optimization
problem on the product of unitary groups, and then develop a new gradient based multi-block Jacobi-type
(Jacobi-MG) algorithm to solve it. We similarly establish the global convergence of Jacobi-MG
under any one of the three conditions (A1), (A2) and (A3), if the subproblem can be always represented
as a quadratic form. This algorithm and the convergence properties apply to the well-known joint
approximate tensor diagonalization and joint approximate tensor compression. As the proximal
variants of Jacobi-G and Jacobi-MG, we also propose the Jacobi-GP and Jacobi-MGP algorithms, and
establish their global convergence without any further condition. Some numerical results are
provided indicating the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.

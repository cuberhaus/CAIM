Second law of thermodynamics imposes that in any thermodynamic process the entropy production
must be nonnegative. In continuum physics such a requirement is fulfilled by postulating the constitutive
equations which represent the material properties of the bodies in such a way that second law of thermodynamics
is satisfied in arbitrary processes. Such an approach, first assumed in some pioneering papers
by Coleman and Noll \cite{ColNol} and Coleman and Mizel \cite{ColMiz}, in practice regards second
law of thermodynamics as a restriction on the constitutive equations, which must guarantee that
any solution of the balance laws satisfies also the entropy inequality. As observed by Muschik and
Ehrentraut \cite{MusEhr}, this is a useful operative assumption, but not a consequence of general
physical laws. Indeed, a different point of view, which regards second law of thermodynamics as
a restriction on the thermodynamic processes, i.e., on the solutions of the system of balance laws,
is possible. This is tantamount to assume that there are solutions of the balance laws which satisfy
the entropy inequality, and solutions which do not satisfy it. In order to decide what is the correct
approach, Muschik and Erhentraut postulated an amendment to the second law, which makes explicit
the evident but rather hidden assumption that in any point of the body the entropy production is zero
if, and only if, this point is thermodynamic equilibrium. Then they proved that, given the amendment,
second law of thermodynamics is necessarily a restriction on the constitutive equations and not
on the thermodynamic processes. In the present paper we revisit their proof, lighting up some geometric
aspects which were hidden in Ref. \cite{MusEhr}. Moreover, we propose an alternative formulation
of second law of thermodynamics which incorporates the amendment.

By concisely representing a joint function of many variables as the combination of small functions,
discrete graphical models (GMs) provide a powerful framework to analyze stochastic and deterministic
systems of interacting variables. One of the main queries on such models is to identify the extremum
of this joint function. This is known as the Weighted Constraint Satisfaction Problem (WCSP) on
deterministic Cost Function Networks and as Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) inference on stochastic
Markov Random Fields. Algorithms for approximate WCSP inference typically rely on local consistency
algorithms or belief propagation. These methods are intimately related to linear programming
(LP) relaxations and often coupled with reparametrizations defined by the dual solution of the
associated LP. Since the seminal work of Goemans and Williamson, it is well understood that convex
SDP relaxations can provide superior guarantees to LP. But the inherent computational cost of interior
point methods has limited their application. The situation has improved with the introduction
of non-convex Burer-Monteiro style methods which are well suited to handle the SDP relaxation of
combinatorial problems with binary variables (such as MAXCUT, MaxSAT or MAP/Ising). We compute
low rank SDP upper and lower bounds for discrete pairwise graphical models with arbitrary number
of values and arbitrary binary cost functions by extending a Burer-Monteiro style method based
on row-by-row updates. We consider a traditional dualized constraint approach and a dedicated
Block Coordinate Descent approach which avoids introducing large penalty coefficients to the
formulation. On increasingly hard and dense WCSP/CFN instances, we observe that the BCD approach
can outperform the dualized approach and provide tighter bounds than local consistencies/convergent
message passing approaches.

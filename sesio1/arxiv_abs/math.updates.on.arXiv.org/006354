This work concerns the relation between the geometry of Lagrangian Grassmannians and the CKP integrable
hierarchy. For a complex vector space $V$ of dimension $N$, and ${\mathcal H}_N:=V\oplus V^*$ the
associated symplectic space with canonical symplectic structure $\omega_N$, the exterior space
$\Lambda({\mathcal H}_N)$ is decomposed into a direct sum of irreducible $Sp({\mathcal H}_N,
\omega_N)$ submodules, and a basis adapted to this decomposition is constructed. Composing the
Pl\"ucker map on the Lagrangian Grassmannian $Gr^{\mathcal L}_V({\mathcal H}_N,\omega_N)$
of maximal isotropic subspaces with projection to the subspace of symmetric elements under dualization,
the Lagrangian map ${\mathcal L}: Gr^{\mathcal L}_V({\mathcal H}_N, \omega_N) \rightarrow P(\Lambda(V))$
is defined. In terms of the affine coordinate matrix on the big cell, this reduces to the principal
minors map, whose image is cut out by the $2 \times 2 \times 2$ quartic hyperdeterminantal relations.
To apply this to the CKP hierarchy, the Lagrangian Grassmannian framework is extended to infinite
dimensions, with ${\mathcal H}_N$ replaced by a polarized Hilbert space $ {\mathcal H} ={\mathcal
H}_+\oplus{\mathcal H}$ with symplectic form $\omega$. The fermionic Fock space ${\mathcal F}=
\Lambda^{\infty/2}{\mathcal H}$ is decomposed into a direct sum of irreducible $Sp({\mathcal
H},\omega)$ representations and the infinite dimensional Lagrange is defined. The linear constraints
defining the reduction to the CKP hierarchy are expressed as a fermionic null condition and the infinite
analogue of the hyperdeterminantal relations is deduced. A multiparameter family of such relations
is shown to be satisfied by the evaluation of the $\tau$-function at translates of any point in the
space of odd flow variables along the cubic lattices generated by power sums in the parameters.

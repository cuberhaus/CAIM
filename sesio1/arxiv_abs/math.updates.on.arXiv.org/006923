Egyptologists and historians of mathematics around 1930 did an admirable job in showing that problem
14 of the newly discovered Moscow Papyrus from around 1850 BCE amounts to a general and exact calculation
of the volume of a truncated pyramid (frustum). They were less successful in giving tentative explanations
of what convinced the Egyptians of its correctness. In particular, they never looked into the possibility
of dissecting three identical copies of the frustum and recomposing them into three boxes of differing
sizes whose volumes can be easily calculated. This is surprising because the formula at which the
historians arrived seems to suggest this procedure. About 2000 years after the Egyptians, the Chinese
scholar Liu Hui did exactly this for the almost identical problem from the Nine Chapters. If those
historians of mathematics around 1930 had known Liu Hui's algorithm they could have easily drawn
tentative conclusions also for the Egyptian case. The present paper suggests that it was their knowledge
of rigorous Euclidean geometry and of relatively modern algebra which distorted the judgment of
those historians, something which could not have been the case for Liu Hui. Their failure seems to
have discouraged later Egyptologists to look for explanations or to even point to Liu Hui when his
work had become known. Thus a chance was missed to use the great intuitive and pedagogic potential
of a remarkable piece of Egyptian mathematics. This paper is not a contribution to the historiography
of Egyptian mathematics for which the author is no specialist but argues primarily on a methodological
level using secondary historical sources. The paper is partly inspired by a more recent publication
of Paul Shutler (2009) who suggests an intuitive and historically possible proof also for the special,
and mathematically crucial case of the second formula, which is related to the full pyramid.

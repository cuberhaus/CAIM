Gravity is a phenomenon which arises due to the space-time geometry. The main equations that describe
gravity are the Einstein equations. To understand the consequences of these field equations we
need to calculate the free particle worldlines to the geometries, which solve these field equations
e.g. the Schwarzschild metric solves the Einstein equations and we would need to solve the geodesic
equations to this metric. If we were to describe the space-time geometry in terms of geodesics instead
of the metric, we could skip the step of solving for the metric and solve for the geodesics directly.
In this work we have developed a formalism doing that: we use the bundle of the arclength parametrized
geodesics (geodesic flow bundle GFB) from all points in the manifold to describe a Riemannian geometry.
Our formalism uses characteristic properties of smooth Riemannian geometries, infinitesimal
spherical triangles as generating elements, to solve geometric problems. We relate the geodesic
flow bundle to Gaussian curvature and develop a method to calculate the geodesics geometrically
starting from a Gaussian curvature field. The result amounts to a generalization of the cosine-
and sine-laws for constant curvature to varying curvature fields. In this work we restrict ourselves
to the Riemannian case and positive curvature fields. We expand the triangulation problem in power
series and calculate the main result up to second order. The method itself could be extended to treat
more generic cases in particular pseudo-Riemannian geometries which relate directly to Einsteins
equations. We test our results against the sphere and perform consistency checks for a number of
examples of varying curvature fields. As a by-product we generalize the notion of integration to
products and derive a relation analogue to the main theorem of calculus, for product integrals.

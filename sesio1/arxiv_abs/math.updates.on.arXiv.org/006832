Stochastic MPECs have found increasing relevance for modeling a broad range of settings in engineering
and statistics. Yet, there seem to be no efficient first/zeroth-order schemes equipped with non-asymptotic
rate guarantees for resolving even deterministic variants of such problems. We consider SMPECs
where the parametrized lower-level equilibrium problem is given by a deterministic/stochastic
VI problem whose mapping is strongly monotone. We develop a zeroth-order implicit algorithmic
framework by leveraging a locally randomized spherical smoothing scheme. We present schemes for
single-stage and two-stage stochastic MPECs when the upper-level problem is either convex or nonconvex.
(I). Single-stage SMPECs: In convex regimes, our proposed inexact schemes are characterized by
a complexity in upper-level projections, upper-level samples, and lower-level projections of
$\mathcal{O}(\tfrac{1}{\epsilon^2})$, $\mathcal{O}(\tfrac{1}{\epsilon^2})$, and $\mathcal{O}(\tfrac{1}{\epsilon^2}\ln(\tfrac{1}{\epsilon}))$
, respectively. Analogous bounds for the nonconvex regime are $\mathcal{O}(\tfrac{1}{\epsilon})$,
$\mathcal{O}(\tfrac{1}{\epsilon^2})$, and $\mathcal{O}(\tfrac{1}{\epsilon^3})$, respectively
. (II). Two-stage SMPECs: In convex regimes, our proposed inexact schemes have a complexity in upper-level
projections, upper-level samples, and lower-level projections of $\mathcal{O}(\tfrac{1}{\epsilon^2}),\mathcal{O}(\tfrac{1}{\epsilon^2})$,
and $\mathcal{O}(\tfrac{1}{\epsilon^2}\ln(\tfrac{1}{\epsilon}))$ while the corresponding
bounds in the nonconvex regime are $\mathcal{O}(\tfrac{1}{\epsilon})$, $\mathcal{O}(\tfrac{1}{\epsilon^2})$,
and $\mathcal{O}(\tfrac{1}{\epsilon^2}\ln(\tfrac{1}{\epsilon}))$ , respectively . In addition,
we derive statements for exact as well as accelerated counterparts. We also provide a comprehensive
set of numerical results for validating the theoretical findings.

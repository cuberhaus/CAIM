In this work, we present mixed dimensional models for simulating blood flow and transport processes
in breast tissue and the vascular tree supplying it. These processes are considered, to start from
the aortic inlet to the capillaries and tissue of the breast. Large variations in biophysical properties
and flow conditions exist in this system necessitating the use of different flow models for different
geometries and flow regimes. Large variations in biophysical properties and flow conditions exist
in this system necessitating the use of different flow models for different geometries and flow
regimes. In total, we consider four different model types. First, a system of 1D nonlinear hyperbolic
PDEs is considered to simulate blood flow in larger arteries with highly elastic vessel walls. Second,
we assign 1D linearized hyperbolic PDEs to model the smaller arteries with stiffer vessel walls.
The third model type consists of ODE systems (0D models). It is used to model the arterioles and peripheral
circulation. Finally, homogenized 3D porous media models are considered to simulate flow and transport
in capillaries and tissue within the breast volume. Sink terms are used to account for the influence
of the venous and lymphatic systems. Combining the four model types, we obtain two different 1D-0D-3D
coupled models for simulating blood flow and transport processes: The first 1D-0D-3D model covers
the whole path from the aorta to the breast, while the second model is a sub-model obtained by restriction
to breast vasculature and tissue making possible a significant reduction in computational cost.
Several numerical experiments are conducted that demonstrate realistic flow simulations compared
to existing data on blood flow in human breast and vascular system.

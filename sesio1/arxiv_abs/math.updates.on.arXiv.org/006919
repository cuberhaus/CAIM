The transport of many kinds of singular structures in a medium, such as vortex points/lines/sheets
in fluids, dislocation loops in crystalline plastic solids, or topological singularities in magnetism,
can be expressed in terms of the geometric (Lie) transport equation \[ \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}
t} T_t + \mathcal{L}_{b_t} T_t = 0 \] for a time-indexed family of integral or normal $k$-currents
$t \mapsto T_t$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Here, $b_t$ is the driving vector field and $\mathcal{L}_{b_t}
T_t$ is the Lie derivative of $T_t$ with respect to $b_t$. Written in coordinates for different values
of $k$, this PDE encompasses the classical transport equation ($k = d$), the continuity equation
($k = 0$), as well as the equations for the transport of dislocation lines in crystals ($k = 1$) and
membranes in liquids ($k =d-1$). The top-dimensional and bottom-dimensional cases have received
a great deal of attention in connection with the DiPerna--Lions and Ambrosio theories of Regular
Lagrangian Flows. On the other hand, very little is rigorously known at present in the intermediate-dimensional
cases. This work develops the theory of the geometric transport equation for arbitrary $k$ and in
the case of boundaryless currents $T_t$, covering in particular existence and uniqueness of solutions,
structure theorems, rectifiability, and a number of Rademacher-type differentiability results.
The latter yield, given an absolutely continuous (in time) path $t \mapsto T_t$, the existence almost
everywhere of a ''geometric derivative'', namely a driving vector field $b_t$. This subtle question
turns out to be intimately related to the critical set of the evolution, a new notion introduced in
this work, which is closely related to Sard's theorem and concerns singularities that are ''smeared
out in time''. Our differentiability results are sharp, which we demonstrate through an explicit
example.

This paper considers the problem of decentralized analysis and control synthesis to verify and
ensure properties like stability and dissipativity of a large-scale networked system comprised
of linear subsystems interconnected in an arbitrary topology. In particular, we design systematic
networked system analysis and control synthesis processes that can be executed in a decentralized
manner at the subsystem level with minimal information sharing among the subsystems. Compared
to our most recent work on the same topic, we consider a substantially more generalized problem setup
in this paper and develop decentralized processes to verify and ensure a broader range of networked
system properties. We show that for such decentralized processes: (1) optimizing the used subsystem
indexing scheme can substantially reduce the required inter-subsystem information-sharing
sessions, and (2) in some network topologies, information sharing among only neighboring subsystems
is sufficient (hence, distributed!). Moreover, the proposed networked system analysis and control
synthesis processes are compositional, which enable them to conveniently and efficiently handle
situations where new subsystems are being added/removed to/from an existing network. We also provide
significant insights into our decentralized approach so that it can be quickly adopted to verify
and ensure properties beyond the stability and dissipativity of networked systems. En route to
developing such decentralized techniques, we have also derived new centralized solutions for
dissipative observer and dynamic output feedback controller design problems. Subsequently,
we also specialize all the derived results for discrete-time networked systems. We conclude this
paper by providing several simulation results demonstrating the proposed novel decentralized
analysis and control synthesis processes and dissipativity-based results.

The Directed Landscape, a random directed metric on the plane (where the first and the second coordinates
are termed spatial and temporal respectively), was constructed in the breakthrough work of Dauvergne,
Ortmann, and Vir\'ag, and has since been shown to be the scaling limit of various integrable models
of Last Passage percolation, a central member of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class.
It exhibits several scale invariance properties making it a natural source of rich fractal behavior.
Such a study was initiated in Basu-Ganguly-Hammond, where the difference profile i.e., the difference
of passage times from two fixed points (say $(\pm 1,0)$), was considered. Owing to geodesic geometry,
it turns out that this difference process is almost surely locally constant. The set of non-constancy
is connected to disjointness of geodesics and inherits remarkable fractal properties. In particular,
it has been established that when only the spatial coordinate is varied, the set of non-constancy
of the difference profile has Hausdorff dimension $1/2$, and bears a rather strong resemblance
to the zero set of Brownian motion. The arguments crucially rely on a monotonicity property, which
is absent when the temporal structure of the process is probed, necessitating the development of
new methods. In this paper, we put forth several new ideas, and show that the set of non-constancy
of the 2D difference profile and the 1D temporal process (when the spatial coordinate is fixed and
the temporal coordinate is varied) have Hausdorff dimensions $5/3$ and $2/3$ respectively. A particularly
crucial ingredient in our analysis is the novel construction of a local time process for the geodesic
akin to Brownian local time, supported on the "zero set" of the geodesic. Further, we show that the
latter has Hausdorff dimension $1/3$ in contrast to the zero set of Brownian motion which has dimension
$1/2.$

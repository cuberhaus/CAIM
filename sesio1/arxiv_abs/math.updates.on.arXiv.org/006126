Maintenance planning plays a key role in power system operations under uncertainty by helping system
operators ensure a reliable and secure power grid. This paper studies a short-term condition-based
integrated maintenance planning with operations scheduling problem while considering the unexpected
failure possibilities of generators as well as transmission lines. We formulate this problem as
a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer program with failure scenarios sampled from the sensor-driven
remaining lifetime distributions of the individual system elements whereas a joint chance-constraint
consisting of Poisson Binomial random variables is introduced to account for failure risks. Because
of its intractability, we develop a cutting-plane method to obtain an exact reformulation of the
joint chance-constraint by proposing a separation subroutine and deriving stronger cuts as part
of this procedure. To solve large-scale instances, we derive a second-order cone programming based
safe approximation of this constraint. Furthermore, we propose a decomposition-based algorithm
implemented in parallel fashion for solving the resulting stochastic program, by exploiting the
features of the integer L-shaped method and the special structure of the maintenance and operations
scheduling problem to derive stronger optimality cuts. We further present preprocessing steps
over transmission line flow constraints to identify redundancies. To illustrate the computational
performance and efficiency of our algorithm compared to more conventional maintenance approaches,
we design a computational study focusing on a weekly plan with daily maintenance and hourly operational
decisions involving detailed unit commitment subproblems. Our computational results on various
IEEE instances demonstrate the computational efficiency of the proposed approach with reliable
and cost-effective maintenance and operational schedules.

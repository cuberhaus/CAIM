Let $G$ be a prolific graph, that is a finite connected simple graph which is not isomorphic to a cycle
nor a path nor the star graph $K_{1,3}$. The line-graph of $G$, denoted by $L(G)$, is defined by having
its vertex-set equal to the edge-set of $G$ and two vertices of $L(G)$ are adjacent if the corresponding
edges are adjacent in $G$. For a positive integer $k$, the iterated line-graph $L^k(G)$ is defined
recursively by $L^k(G)=L(L^{k-1}(G))$. We consider fifteen graph parameters and study their
behaviour when the operation of taking the line-graph is iterated. We shall first show that all of
these parameters are unbounded. This idea is motivated by a well-known result of van Rooij and Wilf
that says that the number of vertices is unbounded if and only if the graph is prolific. We then study
of the value of $k(P,{\mathcal F})$, which is the index of a family of prolific graphs with regards
to a given graph parameter $P(G)$. For a given parameter $P(G)$, the index of $G$ is denoted by $ind(P,G)
= \min \{ r : P(G) < P(L^r(G) \}$. Now for a family $\mathcal F$ of prolific graphs, the index of the family
is $k(P,\mathcal{F}) = \max \{ ind(P,G) : G \in \mathcal F\}$. The problem of determining the index
of a parameter over the family of prolific graphs is motivated by a result of Chartrand who showed
that it could require $k=|V(G)|-3$ iterations for $L^k(G)$ to have a hamiltonian cycle. For twelve
of the parameters considered, we exactly determine $k(P,\mathcal F)$ where $\mathcal F$ is the
family of all prolific graphs, and for some parameters we also characterize the class of prolific
graphs realizing the extremal value $k(P,\mathcal F$). Interesting open problems remain, in particular
completing the determination of $k(P,\mathcal F)$ for the three parameters: the independence
number, independent domination number and domination number.

In Brownian last-passage percolation (BLPP), the Busemann functions $\mathcal B^{\theta}(\mathbf
x,\mathbf y)$ are indexed by two points $\mathbf x,\mathbf y \in \mathbb Z \times \mathbb R$, and
a direction parameter $\theta > 0$. We derive the joint distribution of Busemann functions across
all directions. We use this to conclude that for every $\mathbf x,\mathbf y \in \mathbb Z \times \mathbb
R$, the Busemann process $\theta \mapsto \mathcal B^{\theta}(\mathbf x,\mathbf y)$ is locally
constant except at a discrete set of directions where the process has a jump. The union over all $\mathbf
x,\mathbf y$, of this set of directions, denoted $\Theta$, provides detailed information about
the uniqueness and coalescence of semi-infinite geodesics. Similar results have been shown for
discrete models, but the uncountable set of initial points in BLPP gives rise to new phenomena and
requires new methods of proof. One example is that, for every direction $\theta > 0$, there exists
a countably infinite set of initial points $\mathbf x$ such that there are two $\theta$-directed
geodesics that split at $\mathbf x$ but eventually come back together. As another example of new
phenomena, we define the competition interface in BLPP and show that the set of initial points whose
competition interface is nontrivial has Hausdorff dimension $\frac{1}{2}$, almost surely. From
each of these exceptional initial points, there exists a random direction $\theta \in \Theta$ for
which there exists two $\theta$-directed semi-infinite geodesics that split immediately from
the initial point and never come back together. Conversely, for every $\theta \in \Theta$ and from
every initial point $\mathbf x \in \mathbb Z \times \mathbb R$, there exists two $\theta$-directed
semi-infinite geodesics that eventually separate. Whenever $\theta \notin \Theta$, all $\theta$-directed
semi-infinite geodesics coalesce.

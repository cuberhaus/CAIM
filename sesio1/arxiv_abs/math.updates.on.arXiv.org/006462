The classical Cheeger's inequality relates the edge conductance $\phi$ of a graph and the second
smallest eigenvalue $\lambda_2$ of the Laplacian matrix. Recently, Olesker-Taylor and Zanetti
discovered a Cheeger-type inequality $\psi^2 / \log |V| \lesssim \lambda_2^* \lesssim \psi$ connecting
the vertex expansion $\psi$ of a graph $G=(V,E)$ and the maximum reweighted second smallest eigenvalue
$\lambda_2^*$ of the Laplacian matrix. In this work, we first improve their result to $\psi^2 / \log
d \lesssim \lambda_2^* \lesssim \psi$ where $d$ is the maximum degree in $G$, which is optimal assuming
the small-set expansion conjecture. Also, the improved result holds for weighted vertex expansion,
answering an open question by Olesker-Taylor and Zanetti. Building on this connection, we then
develop a new spectral theory for vertex expansion. We discover that several interesting generalizations
of Cheeger inequalities relating edge conductances and eigenvalues have a close analog in relating
vertex expansions and reweighted eigenvalues. These include an analog of Trevisan's result on
bipartiteness, an analog of higher order Cheeger's inequality, and an analog of improved Cheeger's
inequality. Finally, inspired by this connection, we present negative evidence to the $0/1$-polytope
edge expansion conjecture by Mihail and Vazirani. We construct $0/1$-polytopes whose graphs have
very poor vertex expansion. This implies that the fastest mixing time to the uniform distribution
on the vertices of these $0/1$-polytopes is almost linear in the graph size. This does not provide
a counterexample to the conjecture, but this is in contrast with known positive results which proved
poly-logarithmic mixing time to the uniform distribution on the vertices of subclasses of $0/1$-polytopes.

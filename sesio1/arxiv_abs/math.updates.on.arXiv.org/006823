Recent experimental advances in Floquet engineering and controlling dissipation in open systems
have brought about unprecedented flexibility in tailoring novel phenomena without any static
and Hermitian analogues. It can be epitomized by the various Floquet and non-Hermitian topological
phases. Topological classifications of either static/Floquet Hermitian or static non-Hermitian
systems based on the underlying symmetries have been well established in the past several years.
However, a coherent understanding and classification of Floquet non-Hermitian (FNH) topological
phases have not been achieved yet. Here we systematically classify FNH topological bands for 54-fold
generalized Bernard-LeClair (GBL)symmetry classes and arbitrary spatial dimensions using $K$-theory.
The classification distinguishes two different scenarios of the Floquet operator's spectrum
gaps [dubbed as Floquet operator (FO) angle-gapped and FO angle-gapless]. The results culminate
into two periodic tables, each containing 54-fold GBL symmetry classes. Our scheme reveals FNH
topological phases without any static/Floquet Hermitian and static non-Hermitian counterparts.
And our results naturally produce the periodic tables of Floquet Hermitian topological insulators
and Floquet unitaries. The framework can also be applied to characterize the topological phases
of bosonic systems. We provide concrete examples of one and two-dimensionalfermionic/bosonic
systems. And we elucidate the meaning of the topological invariants and their physical consequences.
Our paper lays the foundation for a comprehensive exploration of FNH topological bands. And it opens
a broad avenue toward uncovering unique phenomena and functionalities emerging from the synthesis
of periodic driving, non-Hermiticity, and band topology.

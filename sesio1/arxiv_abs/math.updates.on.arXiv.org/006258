Computations of incompressible flows with velocity boundary conditions require solution of a
Poisson equation for pressure with all Neumann boundary conditions. Discretization of such a Poisson
equation results in a rank-deficient matrix of coefficients. When a non-conservative discretization
method such as finite difference, finite element, or spectral scheme is used, such a matrix also
generates an inconsistency which makes the residuals in the iterative solution to saturate at a
threshold level that depends on the spatial resolution and order of the discretization scheme.
In this paper, we examine inconsistency for a high-order meshless discretization scheme suitable
for solving the equations on a complex domain. The high order meshless method uses polyharmonic
spline radial basis functions (PHS-RBF) with appended polynomials to interpolate scattered data
and constructs the discrete equations by collocation. The PHS-RBF provides the flexibility to
vary the order of discretization by increasing the degree of the appended polynomial. In this study,
we examine the convergence of the inconsistency for different spatial resolutions and for different
degrees of the appended polynomials by solving the Poisson equation for a manufactured solution
as well as the Navier-Stokes equations for several fluid flows. We observe that the inconsistency
decreases faster than the error in the final solution, and eventually becomes vanishing small at
sufficient spatial resolution. The rate of convergence of the inconsistency is observed to be similar
or better than the rate of convergence of the discretization errors. This beneficial observation
makes it unnecessary to regularize the Poisson equation by fixing either the mean pressure or pressure
at an arbitrary point. A simple point solver such as the SOR is seen to be well-convergent, although
it can be further accelerated using multilevel methods.

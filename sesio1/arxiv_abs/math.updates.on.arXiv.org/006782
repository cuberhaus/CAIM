In this paper, we address the problem of joint sensing, computation, and communication (SC$^{2}$)
resource allocation for federated edge learning (FEEL) via a concrete case study of human motion
recognition based on wireless sensing in ambient intelligence. First, by analyzing the wireless
sensing process in human motion recognition, we find that there exists a thresholding value for
the sensing transmit power, exceeding which yields sensing data samples with approximately the
same satisfactory quality. Then, the joint SC$^{2}$ resource allocation problem is cast to maximize
the convergence speed of FEEL, under the constraints on training time, energy supply, and sensing
quality of each edge device. Solving this problem entails solving two subproblems in order: the
first one reduces to determine the joint sensing and communication resource allocation that maximizes
the total number of samples that can be sensed during the entire training process; the second one
concerns the partition of the attained total number of sensed samples over all the communication
rounds to determine the batch size at each round for convergence speed maximization. The first subproblem
on joint sensing and communication resource allocation is converted to a single-variable optimization
problem by exploiting the derived relation between different control variables (resources),
which thus allows an efficient solution via one-dimensional grid search. For the second subproblem,
it is found that the number of samples to be sensed (or batch size) at each round is a decreasing function
of the loss function value attained at the round. Based on this relationship, the approximate optimal
batch size at each communication round is derived in closed-form as a function of the round index.
Finally, extensive simulation results are provided to validate the superiority of the proposed
joint SC$^{2}$ resource allocation scheme.

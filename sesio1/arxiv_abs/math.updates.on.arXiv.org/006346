A four-field mixed variational principle is proposed for large deformation analysis of Kirchhoff
rods with a $C^0$ mixed FE approximations. The core idea behind the approach is to introduce a one-parameter
family of points (the centerline) and a separate one-parameter family of orthonormal frames (the
Cartan moving frame) that are specified independently. The curvature and torsion of the curve are
related to the relative rotation of neighboring frames. The relationship between the frame and
the centerline is then enforced at the solution step using a Lagrange multiplier (which plays the
role of section force). Well known frames like the Frenet-Serret are defined only using the centerline,
which demands higher-order smoothness for the centerline approximation. Decoupling the frame
from the position vector of the base curve leads to a description of torsion and curvature that is
independent of the position information, thus allowing for simpler interpolations. This approach
is then cast in the language of exterior calculus. In this framework, the strain energy may be interpreted
as a differential form leading to the natural force-displacement (velocity) pairing. The four-field
mixed variational principle we propose has frame, differential forms, and position vector as input
arguments. While the position vector is interpolated linearly, the frames are interpolated as
piecewise geodesics on the rotation group. Similarly, consistent interpolation schemes are also
adopted to obtain finite dimensional approximations for other differential forms aswell. Using
these discrete approximations, a discrete mixed variational principle is laid out which is then
numerically extremized. The discrete approximation is then applied to benchmark problems, our
numerical studies reveal an impressive performance of the proposed method without numerical instabilities
or locking.

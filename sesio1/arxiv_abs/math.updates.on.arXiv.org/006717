Since the seminal works of Strassen and Valiant it has been a central theme in algebraic complexity
theory to understand the relative complexity of algebraic problems, that is, to understand which
algebraic problems (be it bilinear maps like matrix multiplication in Strassen's work, or the determinant
and permanent polynomials in Valiant's) can be reduced to each other (under the appropriate notion
of reduction). In this paper we determine precisely how many independent scalar multiplications
can be reduced to a given bilinear map (this number is called the subrank, and extends the concept
of matrix diagonalization to tensors), for essentially all (i.e. generic) bilinear maps. Namely,
we prove for a generic bilinear map $T : V \times V \to V$ where $\dim(V) = n$ that $\theta(\sqrt{n})$
independent scalar multiplications can be reduced to $T$. Our result significantly improves on
the previous upper bound from the work of Strassen (1991) and B\"urgisser (1990) which was $n^{2/3
+ o(1)}$. Our full result is much more general and applies not only to bilinear maps and 3-tensors
but also to $k$-tensors, for which we find that the generic subrank is $\theta(n^{1/(k-1)})$. Moreover,
as an application we prove that the subrank is not additive under the direct sum. The subrank plays
a central role in several areas of complexity theory (matrix multiplication algorithms, barrier
results) and combinatorics (e.g., the cap set problem and sunflower problem). As a consequence
of our result we obtain several large separations between the subrank and tensor methods that have
received much interest recently, notably the slice rank (Tao, 2016), analytic rank (Gowers--Wolf,
2011; Lovett, 2018; Bhrushundi--Harsha--Hatami--Kopparty--Kumar, 2020), geometric rank (Kopparty--Moshkovitz--Zuiddam,
2020), and G-stable rank (Derksen, 2020).

In evolutionary studies it is common to use phylogenetic trees to represent the evolutionary history
of a set of species. However, in case the transfer of genes or other genetic information between the
species or their ancestors has occurred in the past, a tree may not provide a complete picture of their
history. In such cases,tree-based phylogenetic networks can provide a useful, more refined representation
of the species evolution. Such a network is essentially a phylogenetic tree with some arcs added
between the tree edges so as to represent reticulate events such as gene transfer. Even so, this model
does not permit the representation of evolutionary scenarios where reticulate events have taken
place between different subfamilies or lineages of species. To represent such scenarios, in this
paper we introduce the notion of a forest-based phylogenetic network, that is, a collection of leaf-disjoint
phylogenetic trees on a set of species with arcs added between the edges of distinct trees within
the collection. Forest-based networks include the recently introduced class of overlaid species
forests which are used to model introgression. As we shall see, even though the definition of forest-based
networks is closely related to that of tree-based networks, they lead to new mathematical theory
which complements that of tree-based networks. As well as studying the relationship of forest-based
networks with other classes of phylogenetic networks, such as tree-child networks and universal
tree-based networks, we present some characterizations of some special classes of forest-based
networks. We expect that our results will be useful for developing new models and algorithms to understand
reticulate evolution, such as gene transfer between collections of bacteria that live in different
environments.

We uncover the gradient structure to investigate the convergence of solutions in nonlocal nonlinear
dynamical systems. Mainly but not exclusively, we use the Lojasiewicz inequality to prove convergence
results in various spaces with continuous, or discrete temporal domain, and finite, or infinite
dimensional spatial domain. To be more specific, we analyze Lotka-Volterra type dynamics and concentration-dispersion
dynamics. Lotka-Volterra equations describe the population dynamics of a group of species. Under
the assumption that the interaction between species is symmetric, we present two different methods
to derive the convergence result. One, the entropy trapping method, is to adapt the idea of Akin and
Hofbauer (Math. Biosci. 61 (1982) 51-62) of using monotonicity of the energy to bound the entropy,
which provides the proximal distance of the solution from the desired equilibrium. Another method,
inspired by Jabin and Liu's observation in (Nonlinearity 30 (2017) 4220) is to change variables
to resolve the singular nature of gradient structure. We apply this idea to show the convergence
result in generalized Lokta-Volterra systems, such as regularized Lotka-Volterra systems and
infinite dimensional Lotka-Volterra equations with mutation. Concentration-dispersion dynamics
is a new type of equation that is inspired by fixed point formulations for solitary wave shapes. As
a continuous time analogue of Petviashvili iteration, we aim to dynamically calculate the nontrivial
solitary wave profile. Using the gradient structure we deduce the existence of nontrivial solitary
and periodic wave profiles. Unfortunately, the convergence result remains open. Instead, we regularize
the concentration dispersion equations by adding a nonlinear diffusive term, and prove the convergence
of the solutions by using the Lojasiewicz convergence framework.

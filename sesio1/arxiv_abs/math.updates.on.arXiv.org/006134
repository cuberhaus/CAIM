This paper is devoted to establishing various $L^p$-boundedness properties of the wave operators
$W_\pm=W_\pm(H, \Delta^2)$ associated with the fourth-order Schr\"odinger operators $H=\Delta^{2}+V(x)$
on the line $\mathbb{R}$. Under a suitable decay condition on $V$ and the absence of embedded eigenvalues
of $H$, we first prove that the wave and dual wave operators are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R})$ for
all $1<p<\infty$: $$ \|W_\pm f\|_{L^p(\mathbb{R})}+\|W_\pm^* f\|_{L^p(\mathbb{R})}\lesssim
\|f\|_{L^p(\mathbb{R})}. $$ This result is further extended to the weighted $L^p$-boundedness
with the sharp $A_p$-bounds for general even $A_p$-weights and to the boundedness on the Sobolev
spaces $W^{s,p}(\mathbb{R})$. For the limiting case $p=1$, we also obtain several weak-type boundedness,
including $W_\pm\in \mathbb B(L^1,L^{1,\infty})\cap \mathbb B(\mathcal{H}^1,L^1)$ and $W_\pm^*\in
\mathbb B(L^1,L^{1,\infty})\cap \mathbb B(L^\infty, \mathrm{BMO})$. These results especially
hold whatever the zero energy is a regular point or a resonance. Next, for the case that zero is a regular
point, we prove that the wave operators are neither bounded on $L^1(\mathbb{R})$ nor on $L^\infty(\mathbb{R})$,
and they are even not bounded from $L^\infty(\mathbb{R})$ to $\mathrm{BMO}(\mathbb{R})$ if in
addition $V$ is compactly supported. In particular, these results give a complete picture of the
validity of $L^p$-boundedness of the wave operators for all $1\le p\le \infty$ in the regular case.
Finally, as applications, we can deduce the $L^p$-$L^q$ decay estimates for the propagator $e^{-itH}P_{\mathrm{ac}}(H)$
with pairs $(1/p,1/q)$ belonging to certain region of $\mathbb{R}^2$, as well as the H\"ormander-type
$L^p$-boundedness theorem for the spectral multiplier $f(H)$.

Over-complete systems of vectors, or in short, frames, play the role of analog codes in many areas
of communication and signal processing. To name a few, spreading sequences for code-division multiple
access (CDMA), over-complete representations for multiple-description (MD) source coding,
space-time codes, sensing matrices for compressed sensing (CS), and more recently, codes for unreliable
distributed computation. In this survey paper we observe an information-theoretic random-like
behavior of frame subsets. Such sub-frames arise in setups involving erasures (communication),
random user activity (multiple access), or sparsity (signal processing), in addition to channel
or quantization noise. The goodness of a frame as an analog code is a function of the eigenvalues of
a sub-frame, averaged over all sub-frames. Within the highly symmetric class of Equiangular Tight
Frames (ETF), as well as other "near ETF" families, we show a universal behavior of the empirical
eigenvalue distribution (ESD) of a randomly-selected sub-frame: (i) the ESD is asymptotically
indistinguishable from Wachter's MANOVA distribution; and (ii) it exhibits a convergence rate
to this limit that is indistinguishable from that of a matrix sequence drawn from MANOVA (Jacobi)
ensembles of corresponding dimensions. Some of these results follow from careful statistical
analysis of empirical evidence, and some are proved analytically using random matrix theory arguments
of independent interest. The goodness measures of the MANOVA limit distribution are better, in
a concrete formal sense, than those of the Marchenko-Pastur distribution at the same aspect ratio,
implying that deterministic analog codes are better than random (i.i.d.) analog codes. We further
give evidence that the ETF (and near ETF) family is in fact superior to any other frame family in terms
of its typical sub-frame goodness.

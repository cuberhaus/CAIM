We give a complete solution, for discrete countable groups, to the problem of defining and computing
a geometric pairing between the left hand side of the Baum-Connes assembly map, given in terms of
geometric cycles associated to proper actions on manifolds, and cyclic periodic cohomology of
the group algebra. Indeed, for any such group $\Gamma$ (without any further assumptions on it) we
construct an explicit morphism from the Left-Hand side of the Baum-Connes assembly map to the periodic
cyclic homology of the group algebra. This morphism, called here the Chern-Baum-Connes assembly
map, allows to give a proper and explicit formulation for a Chern-Connes pairing with the periodic
cyclic cohomology of the group algebra. Several theorems are needed to formulate the Chern-Baum-Connes
assembly map. In particular we establish a delocalised Riemann-Roch theorem, the wrong way functoriality
for periodic delocalised cohomology for $\Gamma$-proper actions, the construction of a Chern
morphism between the Left-Hand side of Baum-Connes and a delocalised cohomology group associated
to $\Gamma$ which is an isomorphism once tensoring with $\mathbb{C}$, and the construction of an
explicit cohomological assembly map between the delocalised cohomology group associated to $\Gamma$
and the homology group $H_*(\Gamma,F\Gamma)$. We then give an index theoretical formula for the
above mentioned pairing (for any $\Gamma$) in terms of pairings of invariant forms, associated
to geometric cycles and given in terms of delocalized Chern and Todd classes, and currents naturally
associated to group cocycles using Burghelea's computation. As part of our results we prove that
left-Hand side group used in this paper is isomorphic to the usual analytic model for the left-hand
side of the assembly map.

We analyze the measurement problem by simulating the dynamics of amplitudes associated with backward
and forward propagating stochastic equations in a realistic, objective model. By deriving a theorem
based on conditional probabilities at the boundaries, we obtain trajectories equivalent to quantum
mechanics. The joint densities of complementary variables give the correct quantum probability
distribution. We model a measurement on a single-mode system via parametric amplification, showing
how a system prepared in a superposition of eigenstates evolves to produce distinct macroscopic
outcomes consistent with Born's rule. The amplified variable corresponds to a backward propagating
trajectory. Sampling is carried out according to a future boundary condition determined by the
measurement setting. A distinctive feature is the existence of vacuum noise associated with an
eigenstate. This noise remains constant at the level of the quantum vacuum throughout the dynamics
and is not macroscopically measurable. The precise fluctuations are specified retrocausally,
and originate from past and future boundary conditions. Where the separation of eigenstates greatly
exceeds the vacuum, we argue consistency with macroscopic realism and causality: the macroscopic
outcome of the measurement can be considered determined prior to the measurement. This leads to
hybrid macro-causal and micro-retrocausal relations. The states inferred for coupled trajectories
conditioned on a measured outcome are not quantum states. They are defined more precisely than allowed
by the uncertainty principle, although they approach eigenstates with amplification in the limit
of a macroscopic superposition. A full collapse into an eigenstate is simulated by coupling to a
second mode, and occurs with loss of information. The model permits Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen correlations
and Bell non-locality.

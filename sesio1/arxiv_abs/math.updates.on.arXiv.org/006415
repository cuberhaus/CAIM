In this paper, we study an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided radar-communication (Radcom)
system, where the IRS is leveraged to help Radcom base station (BS) transmit the joint of communication
signals and radar signals for serving communication users and tracking targets simultaneously.
The objective of this paper is to minimize the total transmit power at the Radcom BS by jointly optimizing
the active beamformers, including communication beamformers and radar beamformers, at the Radcom
BS and the phase shifts at the IRS, subject to the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio
(SINR) required by communication users, the minimum SINR required by the radar, and the cross-correlation
pattern design. In particular, we consider two cases, namely, case I and case II, based on the presence
or absence of the radar cross-correlation design and the interference introduced by the IRS on the
Radcom BS. For case I where the cross correlation design and the interference are not considered,
we prove that the dedicated radar signals are not needed, which significantly reduces implementation
complexity and simplifies algorithm design. Then, a penalty-based algorithm is proposed to solve
the resulting non-convex optimization problem. Whereas for case II considering the cross-correlation
design and the interference, we unveil that the dedicated radar signals are needed in general to
enhance the system performance. Since the resulting optimization problem is more challenging
to solve as compared with the case I, the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) based alternating optimization
(AO) algorithm is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed algorithms
and also show the superiority of the proposed scheme over various benchmark schemes.

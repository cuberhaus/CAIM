In many applications, to estimate a parameter or quantity of interest psi, a finite-dimensional
nuisance parameter theta is estimated first. For example, many estimators in causal inference
depend on the propensity score: the probability of (possibly time-dependent) treatment given
the past. theta is often estimated in a first step, which can affect the variance of the estimator
for psi. theta is often estimated by maximum (partial) likelihood. Inverse Probability Weighting,
Marginal Structural Models and Structural Nested Models are well-known causal inference examples,
where one often posits a (pooled) logistic regression model for the treatment (initiation) and/or
censoring probabilities, and estimates these with standard software, so by maximum partial likelihood.
Inverse Probability Weighting, Marginal Structural Models and Structural Nested Models have
something else in common: they can all be shown to be based on unbiased estimating equations. This
paper has four main results for estimators psi-hat based on unbiased estimating equations including
theta. First, it shows that the true limiting variance of psi-hat is smaller or remains the same when
theta is estimated by solving (partial) score equations, compared to if theta were known and plugged
in. Second, it shows that if estimating theta using (partial) score equations is ignored, the resulting
sandwich estimator for the variance of psi-hat is conservative. Third, it provides a variance correction.
Fourth, it shows that if the estimator psi-hat with the true theta plugged in is efficient, the true
limiting variance of psi-hat does not depend on whether or not theta is estimated, and the sandwich
estimator for the variance of psi-hat ignoring estimation of theta is consistent. These findings
hold in semiparametric and parametric settings where the parameters of interest psi are estimated
based on unbiased estimating equations.

We study Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) surfaces whose law has been reweighted according to nesting
statistics for a conformal loop ensemble (CLE) relative to $n\in \{0,1,2,\dots\}$ marked points
$z_1,\dots,z_n$. The idea is to consider a reweighting by $\prod_{B\subseteq [n]} e^{\sigma_B
N_B}$, where $\sigma_B$ are real constants and $N_B$ is the number of CLE loops surrounding the points
$z_i$ for $i\in B$. This is made precise via an approximation procedure where as part of the proof
we derive strong spatial independence results for CLE. The reweighting induces logarithmic singularities
for the Liouville field at $z_1,\dots,z_n$ with a magnitude depending explicitly on $\sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_n$.
We define the partition function of the surface and explain its relationship to Liouville conformal
field theory (CFT) correlation functions and a potential relationship with a CFT for CLE. In the
case of $n\in\{0,1\}$ points we derive an explicit formula for the partition function. Furthermore,
we obtain a recursive formula for the partition functions where we express the $n$ point partition
function in terms of the partition function for disks with $k<n$ marked points, and we use this to
partially determine for which values of $(\sigma_B\colon B\subseteq [n])$ the partition function
is finite. The recursive formula is derived via a continuum counterpart of the peeling process on
planar maps, which was earlier studied in works of Miller, Sheffield, and Werner in the setting of
$n=0$ marked points. We also find an explicit formula for the generator of the Markov process describing
the LQG boundary lengths in the continuum peeling process. Via an explicit calculation for this
Markov process for $n=0$ we give a new proof for the law of the conformal radius of the outermost CLE
loop in the unit disk around 0, which was earlier established by Schramm, Sheffield, and Wilson.

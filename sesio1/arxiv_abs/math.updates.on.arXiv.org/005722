The list-decodable code has been an active topic in theoretical computer science since the seminal
papers of M. Sudan and V. Guruswami in 1997-1998. List-decodable codes are also considered in rank-metric,
subspace metric, cover-metric, pair metric and insdel metric settings. In this paper we show that
rates, list-decodable radius and list sizes are closely related to the classical topic of covering
codes. We prove new general simple but strong upper bounds for list-decodable codes in general finite
metric spaces based on various covering codes of finite metric spaces. The general covering code
upper bounds can apply to the case when the volumes of the balls depend on the centers, not only on the
radius case. Then any good upper bound on the covering radius or the size of covering code imply a good
upper bound on the size of list-decodable codes. Hence the list-decodablity of codes is a strong
constraint from the view of covering codes on general finite metric spaces. Our results give exponential
improvements on the recent generalized Singleton upper bound of Shangguan and Tamo in STOC 2020
for Hamming metric list-decodable codes, when the code lengths are very large. The generalized
Singleton upper bound for average-radius list-decodable codes is given. The asymptotic forms
of covering code bounds can partially recover the Blinovsky bound and the combinatorial bound of
Guruswami-H{\aa}stad-Sudan-Zuckerman in Hamming metric setting. We also suggest to study the
combinatorial covering list-decodable codes as a natural generalization of combinatorial list-decodable
codes. We apply our general covering code upper bounds for list-decodable rank-metric codes, list-decodable
subspace codes, list-decodable insertion codes and list-decodable deletion codes. Some new better
results about non-list-decodability of rank-metric codes and subspace codes are obtained.

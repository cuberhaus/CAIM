Sepsis is a life-threatening medical emergency, which is a major cause of death worldwide and the
second highest cause of mortality in the United States. Researching the optimal control treatment
or intervention strategy on the comprehensive sepsis system is key in reducing mortality. For this
purpose, first, this paper improves a complex nonlinear sepsis model proposed in our previous work.
Then, bifurcation analyses are conducted for each sepsis subsystem to study the model behaviors
under some system parameters. The bifurcation analysis results also further indicate the necessity
of control treatment and intervention therapy. If the sepsis system is without adding any control
under some parameter and initial system value settings, the system will perform persistent inflammation
outcomes as time goes by. Therefore, we develop our complex improved nonlinear sepsis model into
a sepsis optimal control model, and then use some effective biomarkers recommended in existing
clinic practices as optimization objective function to measure the development of sepsis. Besides
that, a Bayesian optimization algorithm by combining Recurrent neural network (RNN-BO algorithm)
is introduced to predict the optimal control strategy for the studied sepsis optimal control system.
The difference between the RNN-BO algorithm from other optimization algorithms is that once given
any new initial system value setting (initial value is associated with the initial conditions of
patients), the RNN-BO algorithm is capable of quickly predicting a corresponding time-series
optimal control based on the historical optimal control data for any new sepsis patient. To demonstrate
the effectiveness and efficiency of the RNN-BO algorithm on solving the optimal control solution
on the complex nonlinear sepsis system, some numerical simulations are implemented by comparing
with other optimization algorithms in this paper.

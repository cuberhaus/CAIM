We consider the FCFS $GI/GI/n$ queue, and prove the first simple and explicit bounds that scale as
$\frac{1}{1-\rho}$ (and sometimes better). Here $\rho$ denotes the corresponding traffic intensity.
Conceptually, our results can be viewed as a multi-server analogue of Kingman's bound. Our main
results are bounds for the tail of the steady-state queue length and the steady-state probability
of delay. The strength of our bounds (e.g. in the form of tail decay rate) is a function of how many moments
of the inter-arrival and service distributions are assumed finite. More formally, suppose that
the inter-arrival and service times (distributed as random variables $A$ and $S$ respectively)
have finite $r$th moment for some $r > 2.$ Let $\mu_A$ (respectively $\mu_S$) denote $\frac{1}{\mathbb{E}[A]}$
(respectively $\frac{1}{\mathbb{E}[S]}$). Then our bounds (also for higher moments) are simple
and explicit functions of $\mathbb{E}\big[(A \mu_A)^r\big], \mathbb{E}\big[(S \mu_S)^r\big],
r$, and $\frac{1}{1-\rho}$ only. Our bounds scale gracefully even when the number of servers grows
large and the traffic intensity converges to unity simultaneously, as in the Halfin-Whitt scaling
regime. Some of our bounds scale better than $\frac{1}{1-\rho}$ in certain asymptotic regimes.
More precisely, they scale as $\frac{1}{1-\rho}$ multiplied by an inverse polynomial in $n(1 -
\rho)^2.$ These results formalize the intuition that bounds should be tighter in light traffic
as well as certain heavy-traffic regimes (e.g. with $\rho$ fixed and $n$ large). In these same asymptotic
regimes we also prove bounds for the tail of the steady-state number in service. Our main proofs proceed
by explicitly analyzing the bounding process which arises in the stochastic comparison bounds
of amarnik and Goldberg for multi-server queues. Along the way we derive several novel results for
suprema of random walks and pooled renewal processes which may be of independent interest. We also
prove several additional bounds using drift arguments (which have much smaller pre-factors),
and make several conjectures which would imply further related bounds and generalizations.

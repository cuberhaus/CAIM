In swimming microorganisms and the cell cytoskeleton, inextensible fibers resist bending and
twisting, and interact with the surrounding fluid to cause or resist large-scale fluid motion.
In this paper, we develop a novel numerical method for the simulation of cylindrical fibers by extending
our previous work on inextensible bending fibers [Maxian et al., Phys. Rev. Fluids 6 (1), 014102]
to fibers with twist elasticity. In our "Euler" model, twist is a scalar function that measures the
deviation of the fiber cross section relative to a twist-free frame, the fiber exerts only torque
parallel to the centerline on the fluid, and the perpendicular components of the rotational fluid
velocity are discarded in favor of the translational velocity. In the first part of this paper, we
justify this model by comparing it to another commonly-used "Kirchhoff" formulation where the
fiber exerts both perpendicular and parallel torque on the fluid, and the perpendicular angular
fluid velocity is required to be consistent with the translational fluid velocity. We then develop
a spectral numerical method for the hydrodynamics of the Euler model. We define hydrodynamic mobility
operators using integrals of the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa tensor, and evaluate these integrals
through a novel slender-body quadrature, which requires on the order of 10 points along the fiber
to obtain several digits of accuracy. We demonstrate that this choice of mobility removes the unphysical
negative eigenvalues in the translation-translation mobility associated with asymptotic slender
body theories, and ensures strong convergence of the fiber velocity and weak convergence of the
fiber constraint forces. We pair the spatial discretization with a semi-implicit temporal integrator
to confirm the negligible contribution of twist elasticity to the relaxation dynamics of a bent
fiber and study the instability of a twirling fiber.

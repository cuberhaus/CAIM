We show that the geometry of the asymptotic infinities of Minkowski spacetime (in $d+1$ dimensions)
is captured by homogeneous spaces of the Poincar\'e group: the blow-ups of spatial (Spi) and timelike
(Ti) infinities in the sense of Ashtekar--Hansen and a novel space Ni fibering over $\mathscr{I}$.
We embed these spaces \`a la Penrose--Rindler into a pseudo-euclidean space of signature $(d+1,2)$
as orbits of the same Poincar\'e subgroup of O$(d+1,2)$. We describe the corresponding Klein pairs
and determine their Poincar\'e-invariant structures: a carrollian structure on Ti, a pseudo-carrollian
structure on Spi and a "doubly-carrollian" structure on Ni. We give additional geometric characterisations
of these spaces as grassmannians of affine hyperplanes in Minkowski spacetime: Spi is the (double
cover of the) grassmannian of affine lorentzian hyperplanes; Ti is the grassmannian of affine spacelike
hyperplanes and Ni fibers over the grassmannian of affine null planes, which is $\mathscr{I}$.
We exhibit Ni as the fibred product of $\mathscr{I}$ and the lightcone over the celestial sphere.
We also show that Ni is the total space of the bundle of scales of the conformal carrollian structure
on $\mathscr{I}$ and show that the symmetry algebra of its doubly-carrollian structure is isomorphic
to the symmetry algebra of the conformal carrollian structure on $\mathscr{I}$; that is, the BMS
algebra. We show how to reconstruct Minkowski spacetime from any of its asymptotic geometries,
by establishing that points in Minkowski spacetime parametrise certain lightcone cuts in the asymptotic
geometries. We include an appendix comparing with (A)dS and observe that the de Sitter groups have
no homogeneous spaces which could play the r\^ole that the celestial sphere plays in flat space holography.

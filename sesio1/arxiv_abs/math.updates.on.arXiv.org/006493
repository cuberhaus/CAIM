Extending the celebrated results of Alexandrov (1958) and Korevaar-Ros (1988) for smooth sets,
as well as the results of Schneider (1979) and the first author (1999) for arbitrary convex bodies,
we obtain for the first time the characterization of the isoperimetric sets of a uniformly convex
smooth finite-dimensional normed space (i.e. Wulff shapes) in the non-smooth and non-convex setting,
based on the natural geometric condition involving the curvature measures. More specifically
we show, under a natural mean-convexity assumption, that finite unions of disjoint Wulff shapes
are the only sets of positive reach $ A \subseteq \mathbf{R}^{n+1} $ with finite and positive volume
such that, for some $ k \in \{0, \ldots , n-1\}$, the $ k $-th generalized curvature measure $ \Theta^\phi_{k}(A,
\cdot) $, which is defined on the unit normal bundle of $ A $ with respect to the relative geometry induced
by $ \phi $, is proportional to $ \Theta^\phi_{n}(A, \cdot)$. If $ k = n-1 $ the conclusion holds for
all sets of positive reach with finite and positive volume. We also prove a related sharp result about
the removability of the singularities. This result is based on the extension of the notion of a normal
boundary point, originally introduced by Busemann and Feller (1936) for arbitrary convex bodies,
to sets of positive reach. These results are new even in the Euclidean space. Several auxiliary and
related results are also proved, which are of independent interest. They include the extension
of the classical Steiner--Weyl tube formula to arbitrary closed sets in a finite dimensional uniformly
convex normed vector space and a general formula for the derivative of the localized volume function,
which extends and complements recent results of Chambolle--Lussardi--Villa (2021).

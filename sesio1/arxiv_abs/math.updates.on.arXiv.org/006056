Certain applications that analyze damping effects require the solution of quadratic eigenvalue
problems (QEPs). We use refined isogeometric analysis (rIGA) to solve quadratic eigenproblems.
rIGA discretization, while conserving desirable properties of maximum-continuity isogeometric
analysis (IGA), reduces the interconnection between degrees of freedom by adding low-continuity
basis functions. This connectivity reduction in rIGA's algebraic system results in faster matrix
LU factorizations when using multifrontal direct solvers. We compare computational costs of rIGA
versus those of IGA when employing Krylov eigensolvers to solve quadratic eigenproblems arising
in 2D vector-valued multifield problems. For large problem sizes, the eigencomputation cost is
governed by the cost of LU factorization, followed by costs of several matrix-vector and vector-vector
multiplications, which correspond to Krylov projections. We minimize the computational cost
by introducing C^0 and C^1 separators at specific element interfaces for our rIGA generalizations
of the curl-conforming Nedelec and divergence-conforming Raviart-Thomas finite elements. Let
p be the polynomial degree of basis functions; the LU factorization is up to O((p-1)^2) times faster
when using rIGA compared to IGA in the asymptotic regime. Thus, rIGA theoretically improves the
total eigencomputation cost by O((p-1)^2) for sufficiently large problem sizes. Yet, in practical
cases of moderate-size eigenproblems, the improvement rate deteriorates as the number of computed
eigenvalues increases because of multiple matrix-vector and vector-vector operations. Our numerical
tests show that rIGA accelerates the solution of quadratic eigensystems by O(p-1) for moderately
sized problems when we seek to compute a reasonable number of eigenvalues.

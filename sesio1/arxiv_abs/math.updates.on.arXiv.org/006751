We consider quasi-compact linear operator cocycles $\mathcal{L}^{n}_\omega:=\mathcal{L}_{\sigma^{n-1}\omega}\circ\cdots\circ\mathcal{L}_{\sigma\omega}\circ
\mathcal{L}_{\omega}$ driven by an invertible ergodic process $\sigma:\Omega\to\Omega$, and
their small perturbations $\mathcal{L}_{\omega,\epsilon}^{n}$. We prove an abstract $\omega$-wise
first-order formula for the leading Lyapunov multipliers. We then consider the situation where
$\mathcal{L}_{\omega}^{n}$ is a transfer operator cocycle for a random map cocycle $T_\omega^{n}:=T_{\sigma^{n-1}\omega}\circ\cdots\circ
T_{\sigma\omega}\circ T_{\omega}$ and the perturbed transfer operators $\mathcal{L}_{\omega,\epsilon}$
are defined by the introduction of small random holes $H_{\omega,\epsilon}$ in $[0,1]$, creating
a random open dynamical system. We obtain a first-order perturbation formula in this setting, which
reads $\lambda_{\omega,\epsilon}=\lambda_\omega-\theta_{\omega}\mu_{\omega}(H_{\omega,\epsilon})+o(\mu_\omega(H_{\omega,\epsilon})),$
where $\mu_\omega$ is the unique equivariant random measure (and equilibrium state) for the original
closed random dynamics. Our new machinery is then deployed to create a spectral approach for a quenched
extreme value theory that considers random dynamics with general ergodic invertible driving,
and random observations. An extreme value law is derived using the first-order terms $\theta_\omega$.
Further, in the setting of random piecewise expanding interval maps, we establish the existence
of random equilibrium states and conditionally invariant measures for random open systems via
a random perturbative approach. Finally we prove quenched statistical limit theorems for random
equilibrium states arising from contracting potentials. We illustrate the theory with a variety
of explicit examples.

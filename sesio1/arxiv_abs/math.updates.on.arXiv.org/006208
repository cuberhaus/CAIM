Estimating the frequency of sub-graphs is of importance for many tasks, including sub-graph isomorphism,
kernel-based anomaly detection, and network structure analysis. While multiple algorithms were
proposed for full enumeration or sampling-based estimates, these methods fail in very large graphs.
Recent advances in parallelization allow for estimates of total sub-graphs counts in very large
graphs. The task of counting the frequency of each sub-graph associated with each vertex also received
excellent solutions for undirected graphs. However, there is currently no good solution for very
large directed graphs. We here propose VDMC (Vertex specific Distributed Motif Counting) -- a fully
distributed algorithm to optimally count all the 3 and 4 vertices connected directed graphs (sub-graph
motifs) associated with each vertex of a graph. VDMC counts each motif only once and its efficacy
is linear in the number of counted motifs. It is fully parallelized to be efficient in GPU-based computation.
VDMC is based on three main elements: 1) Ordering the vertices and only counting motifs containing
increasing order vertices, 2) sub-ordering motifs based on the average length of the BFS composing
the motif, and 3) removing isomorphisms only once for the entire graph. We here compare VDMC to analytical
estimates of the expected number of motifs and show its accuracy. VDMC is available as a highly efficient
CPU and GPU code with a novel data structure for efficient graph manipulation. We show the efficacy
of VDMC and real-world graphs. VDMC allows for the precise analysis of sub-graph frequency around
each vertex in large graphs and opens the way for the extension of methods until now limited to graphs
of thousands of edges to graphs with millions of edges and above. GIT: https://github.com/louzounlab/graph-measures

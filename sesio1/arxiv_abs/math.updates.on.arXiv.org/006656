We address the thesis defence scheduling problem, a critical academic scheduling management process,
which has been overshadowed in the literature by its counterparts, course timetabling and exam
scheduling. Specifically, the single defence assignment type of thesis defence scheduling problems,
where each committee is assigned to a single defence, scheduled for a specific day, hour and room.
We formulate a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model, which aims to be a general
representation of the problem mentioned above, and that can, therefore, be applied to a broader
set of cases than other models present in the literature, which have a focus on the characteristics
of their universities. We introduce a new decision variable, propose constraint formulations
that are not policy specific, and offer new takes on the more common objectives seen in the literature.
We also include new objective functions based on our experience with the problem at our university.
We also propose a two-stage solution approach. The first stage is employed to find the number of schedulable
defences, enabling the optimisation of instances with unschedulable defences. The second stage
is an implementation of the augmented e-constraint method, which allows for the search of a set of
different and non-dominated solutions while skipping redundant iterations. A novel instance
generator for thesis scheduling problems is presented. Its main benefit is the generation of the
availability of committee members and rooms in availability and unavailability blocks, resembling
their real-world counterparts. A set of 96 randomly generated instances of varying sizes is solved
and analysed. The proposed method can find the optimal number of schedulable defences and present
non-dominated solutions within the set time limits for every tested instance.

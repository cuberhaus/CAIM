This paper focuses on a class of nonlinear Klein-Gordon equations in three dimensions, which are
Hamiltonian and perturbations of the linear Klein-Gordon equation with potential. In quantum
mechanics, metastable states, which last longer than expected, have been observed. The unperturbed
dynamical system has a bound state with frequency $\Omega$, a spatially localized and time periodic
solution. These metastable states are a consequence of the instability of the bound state under
the nonlinear Fermi's Golden Rule. In 1999, Soffer and Weinstein began exploring the underlying
mathematical instability mechanism from the bound state to these metastable states in their work
\cite{SW1999}. They found that the rate of energy transfer from discrete to continuum modes was
anomalously slow at $1/(1 + t)^{\frac{1}{4}}$, when the discrete spectrum was close to the continuous
spectrum ($ \sigma_c(\sqrt{H}) = [m, \infty)$, $3\Omega > m$) of $H= -\Delta + V + m^2 $. Since then,
many efforts have been focused on the mechanism and the rate of energy transfer when $0 < 3\Omega <
m$, where the discrete spectrum is farther from the continuous spectrum of $H$. In this study, we
explore the decay mechanism of the metastable states by employing the conservation of energy and
the generalized or higher order Fermi's Golden Rule in the weak resonance regime $0 < 3\Omega < m$,
which was conjectured by Soffer and Weinstein \cite{SW1999}. We further explore the hidden non-resonance
structure of nonlinearities when projected to the continuous spectrum. Then, along with certain
weighted dispersive estimates, we can obtain the sharp decay rate of the energy transfer from discrete
to continuum modes. This confirms the conjecture raised in Soffer-Weinstein \cite{SW1999}, where
the eigenspace of $H$ is one-dimensional.

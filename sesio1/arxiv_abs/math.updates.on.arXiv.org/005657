Planning in public transportation is traditionally done in a sequential process: After the network
design process, the lines and their frequencies are planned. When these are fixed, a timetable is
determined and based on the timetable, the vehicle and crew schedules are optimized. After each
step, passenger routes are adapted to model the behavior of the passengers as realistically as possible.
It has been mentioned in many publications that such a sequential process is sub-optimal, and integrated
approaches, mainly heuristics, are under consideration. Sequential planning is not only common
in public transportation planning but also in many other applied problems, among others in supply
chain management, or in organizing hospitals efficiently. The contribution of this paper hence
is two-fold: on the one hand, we develop an integrated integer programming formulation for the three
planning stages line planning, (periodic) timetabling, and vehicle scheduling which also includes
the integrated optimization of the passenger routes. This gives us an exact formulation rewriting
the sequential approach as an integrated problem. We discuss properties of the integrated formulation
and apply it experimentally to data sets from the LinTim library. On the other hand, we propose a mathematical
formulation for general sequential processes which can be used to build integrated formulations.
For comparing sequential processes with their integrated counterparts we analyze the price of
sequentiality, i.e., the ratio between the solution obtained by the sequential process and an integrated
solution. We also experiment with different possibilities for partial integration of a subset
of the sequential problems and again illustrate our results using the case of public transportation.
The obtained results may be useful for other sequential processes.

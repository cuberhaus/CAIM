In this paper we consider coalescing random walks on a general connected graph $G=(V,E)$. We set
up a unified framework to study the leading order of the decay rate of $P_t$, the expectation of the
fraction of occupied sites at time $t$, particularly for the `Big Bang' regime where $t\ll t_{\text{coal}}:=\mathbb{E}[\inf\{s:\text{There
is only one particle at time }s\}]$. Our results show that $P_t$ satisfies certain mean field behavior,
if the graphs satisfy certain transience-like conditions. We apply this framework to two families
of graphs: (1) graphs given by the configuration model with a degree distribution supported in $[3,\bar
d]$ for some $\bar d\geq 3$, and (2) finite and infinite vertex-transitive graphs. In the first case,
we show that for $1 \ll t \ll |V|$, $P_t$ decays in the order of $t^{-1}$, and $(tP_t)^{-1}$ is approximately
the probability that two particles starting from the root of the corresponding unimodular Galton-Watson
tree never collide after one of them leaves the root, which is also roughly $|V|/(2t_{\text{meet}})$,
where $t_{\text{meet}}$ is the mean meeting time of two walkers. By taking the local weak limit,
for the unimodular Galton-Watson tree we prove the convergence of $tP_t$ as $t\to\infty$. For the
second family of graphs, if we take a sequence of finite graphs $G_n=(V_n, E_n)$, such that $t_{\text{meet}}=O(|V_n|)$
and the inverse of the spectral gap $t_{\text{rel}}$ is $o(|V_n|)$, then for $t_{\text{rel}}\ll
t\ll t_{\text{coal}}$, $(tP_t)^{-1}$ is approximately the probability that two random walks
never meet before time $t$, and also $|V|/(2t_{\text{meet}})$. In addition, we define a natural
uniform transience condition, and show that it implies the above for all $1\ll t\ll t_{\text{coal}}$.
Such estimates of $tP_t$ are also obtained for all infinite transient transitive unimodular graphs,
in particular, all transient transitive amenable graphs.

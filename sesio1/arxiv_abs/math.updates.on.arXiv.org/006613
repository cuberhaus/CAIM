The CP decomposition for high dimensional non-orthogonal spiked tensors is an important problem
with broad applications across many disciplines. However, previous works with theoretical guarantee
typically assume restrictive incoherence conditions on the basis vectors for the CP components.
In this paper, we propose new computationally efficient composite PCA and concurrent orthogonalization
algorithms for tensor CP decomposition with theoretical guarantees under mild incoherence conditions.
The composite PCA applies the principal component or singular value decompositions twice, first
to a matrix unfolding of the tensor data to obtain singular vectors and then to the matrix folding
of the singular vectors obtained in the first step. It can be used as an initialization for any iterative
optimization schemes for the tensor CP decomposition. The concurrent orthogonalization algorithm
iteratively estimates the basis vector in each mode of the tensor by simultaneously applying projections
to the orthogonal complements of the spaces generated by other CP components in other modes. It is
designed to improve the alternating least squares estimator and other forms of the high order orthogonal
iteration for tensors with low or moderately high CP ranks, and it is guaranteed to converge rapidly
when the error of any given initial estimator is bounded by a small constant. Our theoretical investigation
provides estimation accuracy and convergence rates for the two proposed algorithms. Both proposed
algorithms are applicable to deterministic tensor, its noisy version, and the order-$2K$ covariance
tensor of order-$K$ tensor data in a factor model with uncorrelated factors. Our implementations
on synthetic data demonstrate significant practical superiority of our approach over existing
methods.

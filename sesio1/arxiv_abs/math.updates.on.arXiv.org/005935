In our previous studies [17, 18], the commonly reported issue that most of the existing mapped WENO
schemes suffer from either losing high resolutions or generating spurious oscillations in long-run
simulations of hyperbolic problems has been successfully addressed, by devising the improved
mapped WENO schemes, namely MOP-WENO-X, where "X" stands for the version of the existing mapped
WENO scheme. However, all the MOP-WENO-X schemes bring about the serious deficiency that their
resolutions in the region with high-frequency but smooth waves are dramatically decreased compared
to their associated WENO-X schemes. The purpose of this paper is to overcome this drawback. We firstly
present the definition of the locally order-preserving (LOP) mapping. Then, by using a new proposed
posteriori adaptive technique, we apply this LOP property to obtain the new mappings from those
of the WENO-X schemes. The essential idea of the posteriori adaptive technique is to identify the
global stencil in which the existing mappings fail to preserve the LOP property, and then replace
the mapped weights with the weights of the classic WENO-JS scheme to recover the LOP property. We
build the resultant mapped WENO schemes and denote them as LOP-WENO-X. The numerical experiments
demonstrate that the resolutions in the region with high-frequency but smooth waves of the LOP-WENO-X
schemes are similar or even better than those of their associated WENO-X schemes and naturally much
higher than the MOP-WENO-X schemes. Furthermore, the LOP-WENO-X schemes gain all the great advantages
of the MOP-WENO-X schemes, such as attaining high resolutions and in the meantime preventing spurious
oscillations near discontinuities when solving the one-dimensional linear advection problems
with long output times, and significantly reducing the post-shock oscillations in the simulations
of the two-dimensional problems with shock waves.

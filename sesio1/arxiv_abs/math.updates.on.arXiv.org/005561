The interaction between individuals in biological populations, dilute components of chemical
systems, or particles transported by turbulent flows depends critically on their contact statistics.
This work clarifies those statistics under the simplifying assumptions that the underlying motions
approximate a Brownian random walk and that the particles can be treated as noninteracting. We measure
the contact-interval (also called the waiting-time or inter-arrival-time), contact-count,
and contact-duration distributions in populations of individuals undergoing noninteracting
continuous-space-time random walks on a periodic two-dimensional plane (a torus), as functions
of the population number density, walker radius, and random-walk step size. The contact-interval
is exponentially distributed for times longer than the mean-free-collision time but not for times
shorter than that, and the contact duration distribution is strongly peak at the ballistic-crossing
time for head-on collisions, when the ballistic-crossing time is short compared to the mean step
duration. While successive contacts between individuals are independent, the probability of
repeat contact decreases with time after a previous contact. This leads to a negative duration dependence
of the waiting-time interval and over dispersion of the contact-count probability density function
for all time intervals. The paper demonstrates that for populations of small particles (walker
radius small compared to the mean-separation or random-walk step size) the mean-free-collision
interval, the ballistic-crossing time, and the random-walk-step duration can be used to construct
temporal scalings which allow for common waiting-time, contact-count, and contact-duration
distributions across different populations. Semi-analytic approximations for both the waiting-time
and contact-duration distributions are also presented.

A non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-inspired integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)
framework is proposed, where a dual-functional base station (BS) transmits the composite unicast
communication signal and sensing signal. In contrast to treating the sensing signal as the harmful
interference to communication, in this work, multiple beams of the sensing signal are employed
to convey multicast information following the concept of NOMA. Then, each communication user receives
multiple multicast streams and one desired unicast stream, which are detected via successive interference
cancellation (SIC). Based on the proposed framework, a multiple-objective optimization problem
(MOOP) is formulated for designing the transmit beamforming, which characterizes the communication-sensing
trade-off. For general the multiple-user scenario, the formulated MOOP is converted to a single-objective
optimization problem (SOOP) via the e-constraint method. Then, a block coordinate descent (BCD)
algorithm is proposed by employing fractional programming (FP) and successive convex approximation
(SCA) to find a suboptimal solution. For the special single-user scenario, the globally optimal
solution can be obtained by transforming the MOOP to a quadratic semidefinite program (QSDP). Moreover,
it is rigorously proved that 1) in the multiple-user scenario, the proposed framework always outperform
the sensing-interference-cancellation (SenIC) ISAC frameworks by further exploiting sensing
signal for delivering information; 2) in the single-user scenario, the proposed framework achieves
the same performance as the existing SenIC ISAC frameworks, which reveals that the sensing interference
coordination is not required in this case. Numerical results verify the theoretical results and
show that exploiting one beam of the sensing signal for delivering multicast information is sufficient
for the proposed framework.

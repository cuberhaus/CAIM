For $2\le k\in\mathbb{N}$, we consider the following adaptation of the classical secretary problem,
which corresponds to $k=1$. There are $k$ items at each of $n$ distinguishable ranks. The $nk$ items
are revealed, one item at a time, to an observer whose objective is to select an item with the highest
rank. The order of the items is uniformly random. At each stage the observer only knows the relative
ranks of the items that have arrived thus far, and must either select the current item, in which case
the process terminates, or reject it and continue to the next item. For $M\in\{0,1,\cdots, nk-1\}$,
let $\mathcal{S}(n,k;M)$ denote the strategy whereby one allows the first $M$ items to pass, and
then chooses the first later arriving item whose rank is \it either equal to or greater than\rm\ the
highest rank of the first $M$ items (if such an item exists). Let $P_{n,k}(\mathcal{S}(n,k;M))$
denote the probability of selecting an item of highest rank using strategy $\mathcal{S}(n,k;M)$.
We obtain an exact formula for $P_{n,k}(\mathcal{S}(n,k;M))$, and an exact formula for $\lim_{n\to\infty}P_{n,k}(\mathcal{S}(n,k,M_n))$,
when $M_n\sim ckn$, with $c\in(0,1)$. As is very well known, in the classical secretary problem
($k=1$), the asymptotically optimal strategy $M_n\sim cn$ occurs with $c=\frac1e\approx0.368$,
and the corresponding asymptotic probability of success is $\frac1e\approx 0.368$. For $k=2$,
the asymptotically optimal strategy $M_n\sim ckn$ occurs with $c\approx 0.368$ -- almost exactly
(but not exactly) the same $c$ as in the classical case, and the corresponding asymptotic probability
of success jumps dramatically to about 0.701. For $k=3$, the optimal probability is above 0.85,
for $k=7$, that probability exceeds 0.99, and for $k=10$, it is approximately 0.999. The optimal
value of $c$ stabilizes around 0.486 for $n\ge20$.

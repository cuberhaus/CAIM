Floquet multipliers (characteristic multipliers) play significant role in the stability of the
periodic equations. In this paper, we provide a unified algorithm to compute the Floquet multipliers
(characteristic multipliers) and determine the stability of the periodic linear differential
equations on time scales unifying discrete, continuous, and hybrid dynamics. Furthermore, a computer
program is designed to realize our algorithm. Specifically, you can determine the stability of
a second order periodic linear system, whether they are discrete, continuous or hybrid, as long
as you enter the program codes associated with the parameters of the equation. In fact, few literatures
have dealt with the algorithm to compute the Floquet multipliers, not mention to design the program
for its computer realization. Our algorithm gives the explicit expressions of all Floquet multipliers
and our computer program is based on the approximations of these explicit expressions. Our approach
is based on calculating the value of $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ (see Theorem 3.1), which are
the sum and product of all Floquet multipliers (characteristic multipliers) of the system, respectively.
We obtain an explicit expression of $\mathcal{A}$ (see Theorem 4.1) by the method of variation and
approximation theory and an explicit expression of $\mathcal{B}$ by Liouville's formula. In particular,
on an arbitrary discrete periodic time scale, we can do a finite number of calculations to get the
explicit value of Floquet multipliers (see Theorem 4.2). Therefore, for any discrete periodic
system, we can accurately determine the stability of the system even without computer! Finally,
in Section 6, several examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.

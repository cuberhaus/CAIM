Let $X$ be a locally compact Hausdorff space, let $\mathrm A$ be a partially ordered algebra, and
let $T:\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm c}(X)\to \mathrm A$ be a positive algebra homomorphism. Under conditions
on $\mathrm A$ that are satisfied in a good number of cases of practical interest, we show that $T$
is represented by a (unique regular) measure $\mu$ on the Borel $\sigma$-algebra of $X$ that takes
it values in the positive cone of $\mathrm A$, and with the property that $\mu(A_1\cap A_2)=\mu(A_1)\mu(A_2)$
for Borel subsets $A_1,A_2$ of $X$. The positive algebra homomorphism $T$ can be extended from ${\mathrm
C}_{\mathrm c}(X)$ to the accompanying $\mathcal L^1$-space of $\mu$. We show that, quite often,
this $\mathcal L^1$-space is closed under multiplication, so that it is a Riesz algebra, and that
the extended map $T:\mathcal L^1\to\mathrm A$ is not only an algebra homomorphism, but, even when
$\mathrm A$ is not a Riesz space, also a vector lattice homomorphism in a sense that is explained in
the paper. The latter property enables one to describe images of the extended map in terms of sequential
up-downs and down-ups of the image of (the positive cone of ) ${\mathrm C}_{\mathrm c}(X)$ when $\mathrm
A$ has the countable sup property. We apply the main results, which are obtained by purely order-theoretical
methods, to positive algebra homomorphisms from ${\mathrm C}_0(X)$ into the order continuous
operators on a Banach lattice, and to representations of ${\mathrm C}_0(X,\mathbb C)$ on Hilbert
spaces. It is thus seen that, for representations on Banach lattices and on Hilbert spaces, although
situated in rather different contexts, spectral theorems can be established that are both rooted
in the same order-theoretical Riesz representation theorem for positive algebra homomorphisms
from ${\mathrm C_\mathrm c}(X)$ into partially ordered algebras.

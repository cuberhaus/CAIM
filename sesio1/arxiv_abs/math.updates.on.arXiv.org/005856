We predict the future course of ongoing susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemics on
regular, Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi and Barab\'asi-Albert networks. It is known that the contact network
influences the spread of an epidemic within a population. Therefore, observations of an epidemic,
in this case at the population-level, contain information about the underlying network. This information,
in turn, is useful for predicting the future course of an ongoing epidemic. To exploit this in a prediction
framework, the exact high-dimensional stochastic model of an SIS epidemic on a network is approximated
by a lower-dimensional surrogate model. The surrogate model is based on a birth-and-death process;
the effect of the underlying network is described by a parametric model for the birth rates. We demonstrate
empirically that the surrogate model captures the intrinsic stochasticity of the epidemic once
it reaches a point from which it will not die out. Bayesian parameter inference allows for uncertainty
about the model parameters and the class of the underlying network to be incorporated directly into
probabilistic predictions. An evaluation of a number of scenarios shows that in most cases the resulting
prediction intervals adequately quantify the prediction uncertainty. As long as the population-level
data is available over a long-enough period, even if not sampled frequently, the model leads to excellent
predictions where the underlying network is correctly identified and prediction uncertainty
mainly reflects the intrinsic stochasticity of the spreading epidemic. For predictions inferred
from shorter observational periods, uncertainty about parameters and network class dominate
prediction uncertainty. The proposed method relies on minimal data and is numerically efficient,
which makes it attractive either as a standalone inference and prediction scheme or in conjunction
with other methods.

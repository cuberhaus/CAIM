We develop the theory of a metric, which we call the $\nu$-based Wasserstein metric and denote by
$W_\nu$, on the set of probability measures $\mathcal P(X)$ on a domain $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^m$.
This metric is based on a slight refinement of the notion of generalized geodesics with respect to
a base measure $\nu$ and is relevant in particular for the case when $\nu$ is singular with respect
to $m$-dimensional Lebesgue measure; it is also closely related to the concept of linearized optimal
transport. The $\nu$-based Wasserstein metric is defined in terms of an iterated variational problem
involving optimal transport to $\nu$; we also characterize it in terms of integrations of classical
Wasserstein distance between the conditional probabilities and through limits of certain multi-marginal
optimal transport problems. As we vary the base measure $\nu$, the $\nu$-based Wasserstein metric
interpolates between the usual quadratic Wasserstein distance and a metric associated with the
uniquely defined generalized geodesics obtained when $\nu$ is sufficiently regular. When $\nu$
concentrates on a lower dimensional submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^m$, we prove that the variational
problem in the definition of the $\nu$-based Wasserstein distance has a unique solution. We establish
geodesic convexity of the usual class of functionals and of the set of source measures $\mu$ such
that optimal transport between $\mu$ and $\nu$ satisfies a strengthening of the generalized nestedness
condition introduced in \cite{McCannPass20}. We also present two applications of the ideas introduced
here. First, our dual metric is used to prove convergence of an iterative scheme to solve a variational
problem arising in game theory. We also use the multi-marginal formulation to characterize solutions
to the multi-marginal problem by an ordinary differential equation, yielding a new numerical method
for it.

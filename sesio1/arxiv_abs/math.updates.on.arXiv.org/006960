For centuries, soaring birds -- such as albatrosses and eagles -- have been mysterious and intriguing
for biologists, physicists, aeronautical/control engineers, and applied mathematicians. These
fascinating biological organisms have the ability to fly for long-duration while spending little
to no energy, as they utilize wind for gaining lift. This flight technique/maneuver is called Dynamic
Soaring (DS). For biologists and physicists, the DS phenomenon is nothing but a wonder of a very elegant
ability of the bird's interaction with nature and using its physical ether in an optimal way for better
survival and energy efficiency. For the engineering community, said DS phenomenon, is a source
of inspiration and an unequivocal promising chance for bio-mimicking. In literature, significant
work has been done on modeling and designing control systems that allow the DS maneuver to take place.
However, the DS phenomenon in literature has been configured as an optimal control problem that
utilized developments in numerical optimization algorithms along with control systems methods
to identify/find the optimal DS trajectory taken -- or to be taken -- by the bird, or the mimicking
UAV. Nevertheless, all said methods are non-real-time. In this paper, we provide a novel differential
geometric control formulation and analysis of the DS problem, which allow us to introduce a control
system structure similar to extremum seeking systems. The introduced control system is proved
to be controllable and able to conduct real-time DS, which hypothesizes that our framework captures
more of the biological behavior of soaring birds. It also allows for practical mimicking of them.
Simulation results are provided along with comparisons with powerful optimal control solvers
to demonstrate the effectiveness of the introduced approach.

Web search heavily relies on click-through behavior as an essential feedback signal for performance
improvement and evaluation. Traditionally, click is usually treated as a positive implicit feedback
signal of relevance or usefulness, while non-click (especially non-click after examination)
is regarded as a signal of irrelevance or uselessness. However, there are many cases where users
do not click on any search results but still satisfy their information need with the contents of the
results shown on the Search Engine Result Page (SERP). This raises the problem of measuring result
usefulness and modeling user satisfaction in "Zero-click" search scenarios. Previous works have
solved this issue by (1) detecting user satisfaction for abandoned SERP with context information
and (2) considering result-level click necessity with external assessors' annotations. However,
few works have investigated the reason behind non-click behavior and estimated the usefulness
of non-click results. A challenge for this research question is how to collect valuable feedback
for non-click results. With neuroimaging technologies, we design a lab-based user study and reveal
differences in brain signals while examining non-click search results with different usefulness
levels. The findings in significant brain regions and electroencephalogram~(EEG) spectrum also
suggest that the process of usefulness judgment might involve similar cognitive functions of relevance
perception and satisfaction decoding. Inspired by these findings, we conduct supervised learning
tasks to estimate the usefulness of non-click results with brain signals and conventional information
(i.e., content and context factors). Results show that it is feasible to utilize brain signals to
improve usefulness estimation performance and enhancing human-computer interactions in "Zero-click"
search scenarios.

Reconfigurable intelligent surface is a potential technology component of future wireless networks
due to its capability of shaping the wireless environment. The promising MIMO systems in terms of
extended coverage and enhanced capacity are, however, critically dependent on the accuracy of
the channel state information. However, traditional channel estimation schemes are not applicable
in RIS-assisted MIMO networks, since passive RISs typically lack the signal processing capabilities
that are assumed by channel estimation algorithms. This becomes most problematic when physical
imperfections or electronic impairments affect the RIS due to its exposition to different environmental
effects or caused by hardware limitations from the circuitry. While these real-world effects are
typically ignored in the literature, in this paper we propose efficient channel estimation schemes
for RIS-assisted MIMO systems taking different imperfections into account. Specifically, we
propose two sets of tensor-based algorithms, based on the parallel factor analysis decomposition
schemes. First, by assuming a long-term model in which the RIS imperfections, modeled as unknown
phase shifts, are static within the channel coherence time we formulate an iterative alternating
least squares (ALS)-based algorithm for the joint estimation of the communication channels and
the unknown phase deviations. Next, we develop the short-term imperfection model, which allows
both amplitude and phase RIS imperfections to be non-static with respect to the channel coherence
time. We propose two iterative ALS-based and closed-form higher order singular value decomposition-based
algorithms for the joint estimation of the channels and the unknown impairments. Moreover, we analyze
the identifiability and computational complexity of the proposed algorithms and study the effects
of various imperfections on the channel estimation quality.

We discuss the curvilinear web $\boldsymbol{\mathcal W}_{0,n+3}$ on the moduli space $\mathcal
M_{0,n+3}$ of projective configurations of $n+3$ points on $\mathbf P^1$ defined by the $n+3$ forgetful
maps $\mathcal M_{0,n+3}\rightarrow \mathcal M_{0,n+2}$. We recall classical results which
show that this web is linearizable when $n$ is odd, or is equivalent to a web by conics when $n$ is even.
We then turn to the abelian relations (ARs) of these webs. After recalling the well-known case when
$n=2$ (related to the 5-terms functional identity of the dilogarithm), we focus on the case of the
6-web $\boldsymbol{\mathcal W}_{{0,6}}$. We show that this web is isomorphic to the web formed
by the lines contained in Segre's cubic primal $\boldsymbol{S}\subset \mathbf P^4$ and that a kind
of `Abel's theorem' allows to describe the ARs of $\boldsymbol{\mathcal W}_{{0,6}}$ by means of
the abelian 2-forms on the Fano surface $F_1(\boldsymbol{S})\subset G_1(\mathbf P^4)$ of lines
contained in $\boldsymbol{S}$. We deduce from this that $\boldsymbol{\mathcal W}_{{0,6}}$ has
maximal rank with all its ARs rational, and that these span a space which is an irreducible $\mathfrak
S_6$-module. Then we take up an approach due to Damiano that we correct in the case when $n$ is odd:
it leads to an abstract description of the space of ARs of $\boldsymbol{\mathcal W}_{0,n+3}$ as
a $\mathfrak S_{n+3}$-representation. In particular, we obtain that this web has maximal rank
for any $n\geq 2$. Finally, we consider `Euler's abelian relation $\boldsymbol{\mathcal E}_n$',
a particular AR for $\boldsymbol{\mathcal W}_{0,n+3}$ constructed by Damiano from a characteristic
class on the grassmannian of 2-planes in $\mathbf R^{n+3}$ by means of Gelfand-MacPherson theory
of polylogarithmic forms. We give an explicit conjectural formula for the components of $\boldsymbol{\mathcal
E}_n$ that we prove to be correct for $n\leq 12$.

We prove nonlinear Lyapunov stability of a family of `$n+1$'-dimensional cosmological models
of general relativity locally isometric to the Friedman Lema\^itre Robertson Walker (FLRW) spacetimes
including a positive cosmological constant. In particular, we show that the perturbed solutions
to the Einstein-Euler field equations around a class of spatially compact FLRW metrics (for which
the spatial slices are compact negative Einstein spaces in general and hyperbolic for the physically
relevant $n=3$ case) arising from regular Cauchy data remain uniformly bounded and decay to a family
of metrics with constant negative spatial scalar curvature. To accomplish this result, we employ
an energy method for the coupled Einstein-Euler field equations in constant mean extrinsic curvature
spatial harmonic gauge (CMCSH). In order to handle Euler's equations, we construct energy from
a current that is similar to the one derived by Christodoulou \cite{christodoulou} (and which coincides
with Christodoulou's current on the Minkowski space) and show that this energy controls the desired
norm of the fluid degrees of freedom. The use of a fluid energy current together with the CMCSH gauge
condition casts the Einstein-Euler field equations into a coupled elliptic-hyperbolic system.
Utilizing the estimates derived from the elliptic equations, we first show that the gravity-fluid
energy functional remains uniformly bounded in the expanding direction. Using this uniform boundedness
property, we later obtain sharp decay estimates if a positive cosmological constant $\Lambda$
is included, which suggests that the accelerated expansion of the physical universe that is induced
by the positive cosmological constant is sufficient to control the non-linearities in the case
of small data. A few physical consequences of this stability result are discussed.

Non-randomized treatment effect models are widely used for the assessment of treatment effects
in various fields and in particular social science disciplines like political science, psychometry,
psychology. More specifically, these are situations where treatment is assigned to an individual
based on some of their characteristics (e.g. scholarship is allocated based on merit or antihypertensive
treatments are allocated based on blood pressure level) instead of being allocated randomly, as
is the case, for example, in randomized clinical trials. Popular methods that have been largely
employed till date for estimation of such treatment effects suffer from slow rates of convergence
(i.e. slower than $\sqrt{n}$). In this paper, we present a new model coined SCENTS: Score Explained
Non-Randomized Treatment Systems, and a corresponding method that allows estimation of the treatment
effect at $\sqrt{n}$ rate in the presence of fairly general forms of confoundedness, when the `score'
variable on whose basis treatment is assigned can be explained via certain feature measurements
of the individuals under study. We show that our estimator is asymptotically normal in general and
semi-parametrically efficient under normal errors. We further extend our analysis to high dimensional
covariates and propose a $\sqrt n$ consistent and asymptotically normal estimator based on a de-biasing
procedure. Our analysis for the high dimensional incarnation can be readily extended to analyze
partial linear models in the presence of noisy variables corresponding to the non-linear part of
the model, where the noise can be correlated with the variables corresponding to the linear part.
We analyze two real datasets via our method and compare our results with those obtained by using previous
approaches. We conclude this paper with a discussion on some possible extensions of our approach.

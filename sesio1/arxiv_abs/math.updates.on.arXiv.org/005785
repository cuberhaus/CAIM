An assessment of variance in ocean current signal and noise shared by in situ observations (drifters)
and a large gridded analysis (GlobCurrent) is sought as a function of day of the year for 1993-2015
and across a broad spectrum of current speed. Regardless of the division of collocations, it is difficult
to claim that any synoptic assessment can be based on independent observations. Instead, a measurement
model that departs from ordinary linear regression by accommodating error correlation is proposed.
The interpretation of independence is explored by applying Fuller's (1987) concept of equation
and measurement error to a division of error into shared (correlated) and unshared (uncorrelated)
components, respectively. The resulting division of variance in the new model favours noise. Ocean
current shared (equation) error is of comparable magnitude to unshared (measurement) error and
the latter is, for GlobCurrent and drifters respectively, comparable to ordinary and reverse linear
regression. Although signal variance appears to be small, its utility as a measure of agreement
between two variates is highlighted. Sparse collocations that sample a dense grid permit a first
order autoregressive form of measurement model to be considered, including parameterizations
of analysis-in situ error cross-correlation and analysis temporal error autocorrelation. The
former (cross-correlation) is an equation error term that accommodates error shared by both GlobCurrent
and drifters. The latter (autocorrelation) facilitates an identification and retrieval of all
model parameters. Solutions are sought using a prescribed calibration between GlobCurrent and
drifters (by variance matching). Because the true current variance of GlobCurrent and drifters
is small, signal to noise ratio is near zero at best. This is particularly evident for moderate current
speed and meridional current component.

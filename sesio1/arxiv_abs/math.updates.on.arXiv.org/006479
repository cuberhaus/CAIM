For $k\ge2$, consider the following variation of the classical secretary problem. There are $k$
items at each of $n$ ranks. The $kn$ items are revealed, one by one in a uniformly random order, to an
observer whose objective is to select an item with the highest rank. At each stage the observer only
knows the relative ranks of the items that have arrived thus far, and must either select the current
item, or reject it and continue to the next item. Let $\mathcal{S}(n,k;M)$ denote the strategy whereby
one allows the first $M$ items to pass, and then chooses the first later arriving item whose rank is
either equal to or greater than the highest rank of the first $M$ items (if such an item exists). Let
$P_{n,k}(\mathcal{S}(n,k;M))$ denote the probability of selecting an item of highest rank using
strategy $\mathcal{S}(n,k;M)$. We obtain a formula for $P_{n,k}(\mathcal{S}(n,k;M))$, and
a formula for $\lim_{n\to\infty}P_{n,k}(\mathcal{S}(n,k,M_n))$, when $M_n\sim ckn$, with
$c\in(0,1)$. In the classical secretary problem, the asymptotically optimal strategy $M_n\sim
cn$ occurs with $c=\frac1e\approx0.368$, and the corresponding asymptotic probability of success
is $\frac1e\approx 0.368$. For $k=2$, the asymptotically optimal strategy $M_n\sim ckn$ occurs
with $c\approx 0.368$ -- almost exactly the same $c$ as in the classical case, and the corresponding
asymptotic probability of success jumps dramatically to 0.701. For $k=10$, the optimal probability
is above 0.999. The optimal value of $c$ stabilizes around 0.486 for $n\ge20$. We also consider the
strategies $\mathcal{S}^+(n,k;M)$, whereby one allows the first $M$ items to pass, and then chooses
the first later arriving item whose rank is strictly greater than the highest rank of the first $M$
items (if such an item exists). These strategies turn the problem into one that is essentially equivalent
to the classical secretary problem.

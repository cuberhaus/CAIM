Stars are essentially gravitationally stabilised thermonuclear reactors in hydrostatic equilibrium.
The fundamental differential equation for all Newtonian gaseous stars in equilibrium is \begin{align}
\frac{dp(r)}{dr}=-\frac{\mathscr{G}\mathcal{M}(r)\rho(r)}{r^{2}}\nonumber \end{align}
where $p(r),\rho(r)$ are the pressure, density at radius $r$ and $\mathcal{M}(r)$ is the mass contained
within a shell of radius $r$ given by $\mathcal{M}(r)=\int_{0}^{r}4\pi \overline{r}^{2} \rho(\overline{r})d\overline{r}$,
and $\mathscr{G}$ is Newton's constant. This simple but crucial differential equation for the
pressure gradient within any star, underpins much of astrophysical theory and it can derived by
various methods:via a simple heuristic argument; via the Euler-Poisson equations for a self-gravitating
fluid/gas; via a variational method by taking the 1st variation of the sum of the thermal and gravitational
energies of the star; via the 2nd variation of the Massiue thermodynamic functional for a self-gravitating
isothermal perfect-gas sphere; from conservation of the virial tensor; as the non-relativistic
limit of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation (TOVE). The TOVE for equilibrium of relativistic
stars in general relativity can in turn be derived by various methods: from the energy-momentum
conservation constraint on the Einstein equations applied to a spherically symmetric perfect
fluid/gas; via a constrained optimization method on the mass and nucleon number; via a maximum entropy
variational method for a sphere of self-gravitating perfect fluid/gas or radiation. An overview
is given of all derivations with emphasis on variational methods. Many important applications
and astrophysical consequences of the Newtonian equilibrium equation are also reviewed.

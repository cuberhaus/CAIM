Motor systems show an overall robustness, but because they are highly nonlinear, understanding
how they achieve robustness is difficult. In many rhythmic systems, robustness against perturbations
involves response of both the shape and the timing of the trajectory. This makes the study of robustness
even more challenging. To understand how a motor system produces robust behaviors in a variable
environment, we consider a neuromechanical model of motor patterns in the feeding apparatus of
the marine mollusk \textit{Aplysia californica} \citep{shaw2015,lyttle2017}. We established
in \citep{WGCT2021} the tools for studying combined shape and timing responses of limit cycle systems
under sustained perturbations and here apply them to study robustness of the neuromechanical model
against increased mechanical load during swallowing. Interestingly, we discover that nonlinear
biomechanical properties confer resilience by immediately increasing resistance to applied
loads. In contrast, the effect of changed sensory feedback signal is significantly delayed by the
firing rates' hard boundary properties. Our analysis suggests that sensory feedback contributes
to robustness in swallowing primarily by shifting the timing of neural activation involved in the
power stroke of the motor cycle (retraction). This effect enables the system to generate stronger
retractor muscle forces to compensate for the increased load, and hence achieve strong robustness.
The approaches that we are applying to understanding a neuromechanical model in \textit{Aplysia},
and the results that we have obtained, are likely to provide insights into the function of other motor
systems that encounter changing mechanical loads and hard boundaries, both due to mechanical and
neuronal firing properties.

The albatross optimized flight maneuver - known as Dynamic Soaring (DS) - is nothing but a wonder
of physics, biology, and engineering. In an ideal DS cycle, this fascinating bird can travel in the
desired flight direction, for free, by harvesting energy from the wind, and thus, it achieves a neutral
energy cycle. This phenomenon has triggered a momentous interest among aerospace, control and
robotic engineering communities; if DS is mimicked, we have arrived at a new class of Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles (UAVs) which are very energy-efficient during part, or the full, duration of their flight.
However, the DS problem is highly nonlinear, under-actuated, and dependent on the wind profiles.
This have resulted in decades of DS control literature that, while making progress addressing the
control problem, seem not to be aligned well with the nature of the DS phenomenon itself. The control
works associated with DS in literature rely heavily on constrained optimal control algorithms,
control designs that require a mathematical expression of the objective function, and pre-defined
wind profile models. Clearly, a functioning controller for DS that allows meaningful bio-mimicry
of the albatross, needs to be autonomous, real time, stable, and capable of tolerating absence of
the expression of the objective function. The qualifications of such controller are the very same
characteristics of Extremum Seeking Control (ESC) systems. In this paper, we show that Extremum
Seeking Control (ESC) systems existing in control literature for decades are a natural characterization
for the DS problem. We provide the DS problem setup, design, stability, and simulation results of
the introduced ESC systems. The results, supported by comparison with optimal control solvers,
emphasize that the DS phenomenon is a natural expression of ESC systems in nature and that DS can be
performed autonomously and in real time.

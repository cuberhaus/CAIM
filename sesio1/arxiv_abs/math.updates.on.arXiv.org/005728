Consider the steady solution to the incompressible Euler equation $\bar u = A e _1$ in the 3D periodic
tunnel $\Omega = \mathbb T ^2 \times (0, 1)$. Consider now the family of solutions $u ^\nu$ to the associated
Navier-Stokes equation with the no-slip condition on the flat boundaries, for small viscosities
$\nu = A / \mathsf{Re}$, and initial values close in $L ^2$ to $A e _1$. Under a conditional assumption
on the energy dissipation close to the boundary, Kato showed in 1984 that $u ^\nu$ converges to $A
e _1$ when the viscosity converges to 0 and the initial value converges to $A e _1$. It is still unknown
whether this inviscid limit is unconditionally true. Actually, the convex integration method
predicts the possibility of a layer separation with energy at time $T$ up to: \[ \| u ^\nu (T) - A e_1
\| _{L ^2} ^2 \approx A^3 T. \] In this work, we prove that at the double limit for the inviscid asymptotic,
where both the Reynolds number $\mathsf{Re}$ converges to infinity and the initial value $u ^\nu$
converges to $A e _1$ in $L^2$, the energy of layer separation cannot be more than: \[ \| u ^\nu (T) -
A e_1 \| _{L ^2} ^2 \lesssim A^3 T (\log \mathsf{Re}) ^N. \] This result holds unconditionally for
any limit of Leray-Hopf solutions of Navier-Stokes equation. Especially, it shows that, even if
the limit is not unique, the shear flow pattern is observable up to time $1/(A(\log \mathsf{Re})^N)$.
This provides a notion of stability despite the possible non-uniqueness of the limit predicted
by the convex integration theory. The result relies on a new boundary vorticity estimate for the
Navier-Stokes equation. This new estimate, inspired by previous work on higher regularity estimates
for Navier-Stokes, provides a non-linear control rescalable through the inviscid limit.

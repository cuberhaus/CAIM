Rate-induced tipping (R-tipping) occurs when time-variation of input parameters of a dynamical
system interacts with system timescales to give genuine nonautonomous instabilities. Such instabilities
appear as the input varies at some critical rates and cannot, in general, be understood in terms of
autonomous bifurcations in the frozen system with a fixed-in-time input. This paper develops an
accessible mathematical framework for R-tipping in multidimensional nonautonomous dynamical
systems with an autonomous future limit. We focus on R-tipping via loss of tracking of base attractors
that are equilibria in the frozen system, due to crossing what we call regular thresholds. These
thresholds are associated with regular edge states: compact hyperbolic invariant sets with one
unstable direction and orientable stable manifold, that lie on a basin boundary in the frozen system.
We define R-tipping and critical rates for the nonautonomous system in terms of special solutions
that limit to a compact invariant set of the future limit system that is not an attractor. We focus
on the case when the limit set is a regular edge state, which we call the regular R-tipping edge state
that anchors the associated regular R-tipping threshold at infinity. We introduce the concept
of edge tails to rigorously classify R-tipping into reversible, irreversible, and degenerate
cases. The main idea is to compactify the problem and use regular edge states of the future limit system
to analyse R-tipping in the nonautonomous system. This allows us to give sufficient conditions
for the occurrence of R-tipping in terms of easily testable properties of the frozen system and input
variation, and necessary and sufficient conditions for the occurrence of reversible and irreversible
R-tipping in terms of computationally verifiable (heteroclinic) connections to regular R-tipping
edge states in the compactified system.

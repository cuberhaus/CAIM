For $1 <p < \infty$, we prove radial symmetry for bounded nonnegative solutions of \begin{equation*}
\begin{cases} -\dv\left\{ w(x) \, H( \na u )^{p-1}\, \na_{ \xi} H( \na u) \right\}= f(u) \, w(x) \
& \mbox{ in } \ \Si \cap \Om, \\ u=0 \ & \mbox{ on } \ \Ga_0 , \\ \langle \na_\xi H(\na u) , \nu \rangle = 0
\ & \mbox{ on } \ \Ga_1 \setminus \left\lbrace 0 \right\rbrace , \end{cases} \end{equation*} where
$\Om$ is a Wulff ball, $\Si$ is a convex cone with vertex at the center of $\Om$, $\Ga_0 := \Si \cap \pa
\Om$, $\Ga_1 := \pa \Si \cap \Om $, $H$ is a norm, $w$ is a given weight and~$f$ is a possibly discontinuous
nonnegative nonlinearity. Given the anisotropic setting that we deal with, the term ``radial''
is understood in the Finsler framework, that is, the function~$u$ is radial if there exists a point~$x$
such that $u$ is constant on the Wulff shapes centered at~$x$. When $\Si = \RR^N$, J. Serra obtained
the symmetry result in the isotropic unweighted setting (i.e., when~$H(\xi)\equiv|\xi|$ and~$w\equiv1$).
In this case we provide the extension of his result to the anisotropic setting. This provides a generalization
to the anisotropic setting of a celebrated result due to Gidas-Ni-Nirenberg and such a generalization
is new even for $p=2$ whenever $N>2$. When $\Si \subsetneq \RR^N$ the results presented are new even
in the isotropic and unweighted setting (i.e., when $H$ is the Euclidean norm and $w \equiv 1$) whenever
$2 \neq p \neq N$. Even for the previously known case of unweighted isotropic setting with~$p=2$
and $\Si \subsetneq \RR^N$, the present paper provides an approach to the problem by exploiting
integral (in)equalities which is new for $N>2$: this complements the corresponding symmetry result
obtained via the moving planes method by Berestycki-Pacella. The results obtained in the isotropic
and weighted setting (i.e., with $w \not\equiv 1$) are new for any $p$.

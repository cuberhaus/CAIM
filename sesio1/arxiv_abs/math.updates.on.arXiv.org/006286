Sensor placement is an important and ubiquitous problem across the engineering and physical sciences
for tasks such as reconstruction, forecasting and control. Surprisingly, there are few principled
mathematical techniques developed to date for optimizing sensor locations, with the leading sensor
placement algorithms often based upon the discovery of linear, low-rank sub-spaces and the QR algorithm.
QR is a computationally efficient greedy search algorithm which selects sensor locations from
candidate positions with maximal variance exhibited in a training data set. More recently, neural
networks, specifically shallow decoder networks (SDNs), have been shown to be very successful
in mapping sensor measurements to the original high-dimensional state space. SDNs outperform
linear subspace representations in reconstruction accuracy, noise tolerance, and robustness
to sensor locations. However, SDNs lack principled mathematical techniques for determining sensor
placement. In this work, we develop two algorithms for optimizing sensor locations for use with
SDNs: one which is a linear selection algorithm based upon QR (Q-SDN), and one which is a nonlinear
selection algorithm based upon neural network pruning (P-SDN). Such sensor placement algorithms
promise to enhance the already impressive reconstruction capabilities of SDNs. We demonstrate
our sensor selection algorithms on two example data sets from fluid dynamics. Moreover, we provide
a detailed comparison between our linear (Q-SDN) and nonlinear (P-SDN) algorithms with traditional
linear embedding techniques (proper orthogonal decomposition) and QR greedy selection. We show
that QR selection with SDNs enhances performance. QR even out-performs our nonlinear selection
method that uses magnitude-based pruning. Thus, the combination of a greedy linear selection (QR)
with nonlinear encoding (SDN) provides a synergistic combination.

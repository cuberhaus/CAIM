We introduce and study a multiparameter colored partition category $\mathcal{CPar}(\textbf{x})$
by extending the construction of the partition category, over an algebraically closed field $\mathbb{k}$
of characteristic zero and for a multiparameter $\textbf{x}\in \mathbb{k}^{r}$. The morphism
spaces in $\mathcal{CPar}(\textbf{x})$ have bases in terms of partition diagrams whose parts
are colored by elements of the multiplicative cyclic group $C_r$. The Deligne category for symmetric
groups is a special case of the additive Karoubi envelope of $\mathcal{CPar}(\textbf{x})$. We
show that the endomorphism spaces of $\mathcal{CPar}(\textbf{x})$ are generically semisimple.
The category $\mathcal{CPar}(\textbf{x})$ is rigid strict monoidal and we give a presentation
of $\mathcal{CPar}(\textbf{x})$ as a monoidal category. The path algebra of $\mathcal{CPar}(\textbf{x})$
admits a triangular decomposition with Cartan subalgebra being equal to the direct sum of the group
algebras of complex reflection groups $G(r,n)$. We compute the structure constants for the classes
of simple modules in the split Grothendieck ring of the category of modules over the path algebra
of the downward partition subcategory of $\mathcal{CPar}(\textbf{x})$ in two ways. Among other
things, this gives a closed formula for the product of reduced Kronecker coefficients in terms of
Littlewood--Richardson coefficients for $G(r,n)$ and certain Kronecker coefficients for the
wreath product $(C_r \times C_r)\wr S_n$. For $r=1$, this formula reduces to a formula for the reduced
Kronecker coefficient given by Littlewood. We also give two analogues of the Robinson--Schensted
correspondence for colored partition diagrams and, as an application, we classify the equivalence
classes of Green's left, right and two sided relations for the colored partition monoid in terms
of these correspondences.

In this article, we aim to provide a general and complete understanding of semi-supervised (SS)
causal inference for treatment effects. Specifically, we consider two such estimands: (a) the
average treatment effect and (b) the quantile treatment effect, as prototype cases, in an SS setting,
characterized by two available data sets: (i) a labeled data set of size $n$, providing observations
for a response and a set of high dimensional covariates, as well as a binary treatment indicator;
and (ii) an unlabeled data set of size $N$, much larger than $n$, but without the response observed.
Using these two data sets, we develop a family of SS estimators which are ensured to be: (1) more robust
and (2) more efficient than their supervised counterparts based on the labeled data set only. Beyond
the 'standard' double robustness results (in terms of consistency) that can be achieved by supervised
methods as well, we further establish root-n consistency and asymptotic normality of our SS estimators
whenever the propensity score in the model is correctly specified, without requiring specific
forms of the nuisance functions involved. Such an improvement of robustness arises from the use
of the massive unlabeled data, so it is generally not attainable in a purely supervised setting.
In addition, our estimators are shown to be semi-parametrically efficient as long as all the nuisance
functions are correctly specified. Moreover, as an illustration of the nuisance estimators, we
consider inverse-probability-weighting type kernel smoothing estimators involving unknown
covariate transformation mechanisms, and establish in high dimensional scenarios novel results
on their uniform convergence rates, which should be of independent interest. Numerical results
on both simulated and real data validate the advantage of our methods over their supervised counterparts
with respect to both robustness and efficiency.

The paper is concerned with the following $n\times n$ Dirac type equation$$Ly=-iB(x)^{-1}(y'+Q(x)y)=\lambda
y, \quad B(x)=B(x)^*,\quad y={\rm col}(y_1,\ldots,y_n),\quad x\in[0,\ell],$$ on a finite interval
$[0,\ell]$. Here $Q$ is a summable potential $n\times n$ matrix function and $B$ is an invertible
self-adjoint diagonal bounded matrix function. If $n=2m$ and $B(x)={\rm diag}(-I_m,I_m)$, this
equation is equivalent to Dirac equation of order $n$. We show the existence of triangular transformation
operators for such equation under additional uniform separation conditions on the entries of the
matrix function $B$. Here we apply this result to study direct spectral properties of the boundary
value problem (BVP) associated with the above equation subject to the general boundary conditions
$U(y)=Cy(0)+Dy(\ell)=0,{\rm rank}(C\ D)=n$. We apply this result to show that the deviation of
the characteristic determinants of this BVP and the unperturbed BVP (with $Q=0$) is a Fourier transform
of some summable function, which in turn yields asymptotic behavior of the spectrum in the case of
regular boundary conditions. Namely, $\lambda_m=\lambda_m^0+o(1)$ as $m\to\infty$, where
$\{\lambda_m\}_{m\in\mathbb{Z}}$ and $\{\lambda_m^0\}_{m\in\mathbb{Z}}$ are sequences
of eigenvalues of perturbed and unperturbed ($Q=0$) BVP, respectively. Further, we prove that
the system of root vectors of the above BVP constitutes a Riesz basis in a certain weighted $L^2$-space,
provided that the boundary conditions are strictly regular. The main results are applied to establish
asymptotic behavior of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and the Riesz basis property for the dynamic
generator of the Timoshenko beam model. We also found a new case when eigenvalues have an explicit
asymptotic, which to the best of our knowledge is new even in the case of constant parameters of the
model.

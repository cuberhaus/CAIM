To understand the fabric of spacetime we can search for inspiration in Wheeler's layman's analogy
of the Quantum foam using an ocean surface observed from an aeroplane at different heights. From
a 3+1 spacetime perspective, the ocean surface represents the hypersurfaces of spacetime at different
times. Therefore, the ocean surface observed from a great height, when it appears smooth, homogenous,
isotropic and flat is like looking at the current universe. When we get closer and see the waves, then
we are moving backwards in time, and when we start to see waves breaking and coarse foam-like structures
emerge, then we are at the boundary of the Planck scale. This foamy structure is called the Quantum
foam and to understand it - would it then not make sense to create a model that mimics Wheeler's analogy?
Here a 3+1 Quantum foam model is constructed with a dynamical shift vector. The shift vector is a fundamental
solution to a linearized wave equation. The existence of a sequence of smooth and compactly supported
shift vectors that converge to the fundamental solution as distributions is used to define a Planck
scale 3+1 Quantum foam as the formal limit of a sequence of 3+1 smooth spacetimes, each with a smooth
and compactly supported shift vector. Using basic topology and the existence of a partition of unity
of test functions it is shown that a 'sum of sets ' Quantum foam spacetime can be constructed by glueing
together the sequence of smooth spacetimes. It is proved that such Quantum foam spacetime necessarily
has an inflation period. It is shown, no matter how volatile the extrinsic curvature is in an early
universe, that it will be smeared as time goes on. This might provide support to Carlip 's view of an
absorbed and nearly invisible cosmological constant.

This work proposes a model-reduction approach for the material point method on nonlinear manifolds.
Our technique approximates the $\textit{kinematics}$ by approximating the deformation map using
an implicit neural representation that restricts deformation trajectories to reside on a low-dimensional
manifold. By explicitly approximating the deformation map, its spatiotemporal gradients -- in
particular the deformation gradient and the velocity -- can be computed via analytical differentiation.
In contrast to typical model-reduction techniques that construct a linear or nonlinear manifold
to approximate the (finite number of) degrees of freedom characterizing a given spatial discretization,
the use of an implicit neural representation enables the proposed method to approximate the $\textit{continuous}$
deformation map. This allows the kinematic approximation to remain agnostic to the discretization.
Consequently, the technique supports dynamic discretizations -- including resolution changes
-- during the course of the online reduced-order-model simulation. To generate $\textit{dynamics}$
for the generalized coordinates, we propose a family of projection techniques. At each time step,
these techniques: (1) Calculate full-space kinematics at quadrature points, (2) Calculate the
full-space dynamics for a subset of `sample' material points, and (3) Calculate the reduced-space
dynamics by projecting the updated full-space position and velocity onto the low-dimensional
manifold and tangent space, respectively. We achieve significant computational speedup via hyper-reduction
that ensures all three steps execute on only a small subset of the problem's spatial domain. Large-scale
numerical examples with millions of material points illustrate the method's ability to gain an
order of magnitude computational-cost saving -- indeed $\textit{real-time simulations}$ --
with negligible errors.

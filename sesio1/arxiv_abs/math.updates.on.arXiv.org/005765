For the large family of ARMA models with variable coefficients (TV-ARMA), either deterministic
or stochastic, we provide an explicit and computationally tractable representation based on the
general solution of the associated linear difference equation. Analogous representations are
established for the fundamental properties of such processes, including the Wold-Cram\'{e}r
decomposition and their covariance structure as well as explicit optimal linear forecasts based
on a finite set of past observations. These results are grounded on the principal determinant, that
is a banded Hessenbergian representation of a restriction of the Green function involved in the
solution of the linear difference equation associated with TV-ARMA models, built up solely of the
autoregressive coefficients of the model. The $L_2$ convergence properties of the model are a consequence
of the absolute summability of the aforementioned Hessenbergian representation, which is in line
with the asymptotic stability and efficiency of such processes. The invertibility of the model
is also a consequence of an analogous condition, but now the Green function is built up of the moving
average coefficients. The structural asymmetry between constant and deterministically time-varying
coefficient models, that is the backward and forward asymptotic efficiency differ in an essential
manner, is formally demonstrated. An alternative approach to the Hessenbergian solution representation
is described by an equivalent procedure for manipulating time-varying polynomials. The practical
significance of the theoretical results in this work is illustrated with an application to U.S.
inflation data. The main finding is that inflation persistence increased after 1976, whereas from
1986 onwards the persistence declines and stabilizes to even lower levels than the pre-1976 period.

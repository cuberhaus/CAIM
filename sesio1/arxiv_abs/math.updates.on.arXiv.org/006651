We consider the Yang-Mills (YM) QFT with group $U(N)$. We take a finite lattice regularization $\Lambda\subset
a\mathbb Z^d$, $d = 2,3,4$, with $a\in (0,1]$ and $L$ (even) sites on a side. Each bond has a gauge variable
$U\in U(N)$. The Wilson partition function is used and the action is a sum of gauge-invariant plaquette
(minimal square) actions times $a^{d-4}/g^2$, $g^2\in(0,g_0^2]$, $0<g_0^2<\infty$. A plaquette
action has the product of its four variables and the partition function is the integral of the Boltzmann
factor with a product of $U(N)$ Haar measures. Formally, when $a\searrow 0$ our action gives the
usual YM continuum action. For free and periodic b.c., we show thermodynamic and stability bounds
for a normalized partition function of any YM model defined as before, with bound constants independent
of $L,a,g$. The subsequential thermodynamic and ultraviolet limit of the free energy exist. To
get our bounds, the Weyl integration formula is used and, to obtain the lower bound, a new quadratic
global upper bound on the action is derived. We define gauge-invariant physical and scaled plaquette
fields. Using periodic b.c. and the multi-reflection method, we bound the generating function
of $r-$scaled plaquette correlations. A normalized generating function for the correlations
of $r$ scaled fields is absolutely bounded, for any $L,a,g$, and location of the external fields.
From the joint analyticity on the field sources, correlations are bounded. The bounds are new and
we get $a^{-d}$ for the physical two-plaquette correlation at coincident points. Comparing with
the $a\searrow 0$ singularity of the physical derivative massless scalar free field two-point
correlation, this is a measure of ultraviolet asymptotic freedom in the context of a lattice QFT.
Our methods are an alternative and complete the more traditional ones.

Many intuitively valid arguments involving intensionality cannot be captured by first-order
logic, even when extended by modal and epistemic operators. Indeed, previous attempts at providing
an adequate treatment of the phenomenon of intensionality in logic and language are fraught with
philosophical and technical difficulties. Bealer's solution to this problem hinges on an ontological
commitment to theory of Properties, Propositions and Relations (PRP). At the most basic level we
can distinguish two conceptions in the theory of PRPs. An objective one tied to modality and necessary
equivalence, and a mental (intentional) one tied to concepts and the requirement of non-circularity
in definitions. Building on the work of Russell, Church and Quine, Bealer proposes two distinct
intensional logics T1 and T2 corresponding to these two conceptions, both based on the language
of first-order logic extended with an intensional abstraction operator. In T1 necessitation can
be defined and the axioms entail S5 modal logic. These logics have features and desirable aspects
which set them apart from higher-order approaches. Bealer constructs a non-Tarskian algebraic
semantic framework, distinct from possible worlds semantics and its ontological commitments,
yielding two classes of models for which T1 and T2 are both sound and complete. Other features include
being able to deal with quantifying-in, and the various substitution puzzles, being free from artificial
type restrictions, having a Russellian semantics, satisfying Davidson's learnability requirement,
etc. Bealer proposes his logic as the basis of a larger philosophical project in the tradition of
logicism concerning which we refer to his book Quality and Concept (1982). This paper is meant to
provide an elementary introduction to Bealer's theory.

We present a monolithic geometric multigrid preconditioner for solving fluid-solid interaction
problems in Stokes limit. The problems are discretized by a spatially adaptive high-order meshless
method, the generalized moving least squares (GMLS) with adaptive $h$-refinement. In Stokes limit,
solid kinematics can be dominated by the singularities governing the lubrication effects. Resolving
those singularities with adaptive $h$-refinement can lead to an ill-conditioned linear system
of equations. For constructing the interpolation and restriction operators - the key ingredients
of the multigrid preconditioner, we utilize the geometric information of hierarchical sets of
GMLS nodes generated in adaptive $h$-refinement. We build decoupled smoothers through physics-based
splitting and then combine them via a multiplicative overlapping Schwarz approach. Through numerical
examples with the inclusion of different numbers and shapes of solid bodies, we demonstrate the
performance and assess the scalability of the designed preconditioner. As the total degrees of
freedom and the number of solid bodies $N_s$ increase, the proposed monolithic geometric multigrid
preconditioner can ensure convergence and good scalability when using the Krylov iterative method
for solving the linear systems of equations generated from the spatially adaptive GMLS discretization.
More specifically, for a fixed number of solid bodies, as the discretization resolution is incrementally
refined, the number of iterations of the linear solver can be maintained at the same level, indicating
nearly linear scalability of our preconditioner with respect to the total degrees of freedom. When
$N_s$ increases, the number of iterations is nearly proportional to $\sqrt{N_s}$, implying the
sublinear optimality with respect to the number of solid bodies.

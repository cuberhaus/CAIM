The nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger-Newton system \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} \Delta u- V(|x|)u
+ \Psi u=0, &~x\in\mathbb{R}^3,\\ \Delta \Psi+\frac12 u^2=0, &~x\in\mathbb{R}^3, \end{cases}
\end{equation*} is a nonlinear system obtained by coupling the linear Schr\"{o}dinger equation
of quantum mechanics with the gravitation law of Newtonian mechanics. Wei and Yan in (Calc. Var.
Partial Differential Equations 37 (2010),423--439) proved that the Schr\"{o}dinger equation
has infinitely many positive solutions in $\mathbb{R}^N$ and these solutions have polygonal symmetry
in the $(y_{1}, y_{2})$ plane and they are radially symmetric in the other variables. Duan et al.
in (arXiv:2006.16125v1) extended the results got by Wei and Yan and these solutions have polygonal
symmetry in the $(y_{1}, y_{2})$ plane and they are even in $y_{2}$with one more more parameter in
the expression of the solutions.Hu et al. Under the appropriate assumption on the potential function
V, Hu et al. in (arXiv: 2106.04288v1) constructed infinitely many non-radial positive solutions
for the Schr\"{o}dinger-Newton system and these positive solutions have polygonal symmetry in
the $(y_{1}, y_{2})$ plane and they are even in $y_{2}$ and $y_{3}$. Assuming that $V(r)$ has the
following character \begin{equation*} V(r)=V_{1}+\frac{b}{r^q}+O\Big(\frac{1}{r^{q+\sigma}}\Big),~\mbox{
as } r\rightarrow\infty, \end{equation*} Where $\frac12\leq q<1$ and $b, V_{1}, \sigma$ are some
positive constants, $V(y)\geq V_1>0$, we construct infinitely many non-radial positive solutions
which have polygonal symmetry in the $(y_{1}, y_{2})$ plane and are even in $y_{2}$ for the Schr\"{o}dinger-Newton
system by the Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction method. We extend the results got by Duan et al. in (arXiv:2006.16125v1)
to the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger-Newton system.

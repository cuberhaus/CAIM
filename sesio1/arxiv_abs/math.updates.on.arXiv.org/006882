Optimal stopping is a fundamental class of stochastic dynamic optimization problems with numerous
applications in finance and operations management. We introduce a new approach for solving computationally-demanding
stochastic optimal stopping problems with known probability distributions. The approach uses
simulation to construct a robust optimization problem that approximates the stochastic optimal
stopping problem to any arbitrary accuracy; we then solve the robust optimization problem to obtain
near-optimal Markovian stopping rules for the stochastic optimal stopping problem. In this paper,
we focus on designing algorithms for solving the robust optimization problems that approximate
the stochastic optimal stopping problems. These robust optimization problems are challenging
to solve because they require optimizing over the infinite-dimensional space of all Markovian
stopping rules. We overcome this challenge by characterizing the structure of optimal Markovian
stopping rules for the robust optimization problems. In particular, we show that optimal Markovian
stopping rules for the robust optimization problems have a structure that is surprisingly simple
and finite-dimensional. We leverage this structure to develop an exact reformulation of the robust
optimization problem as a zero-one bilinear program over totally unimodular constraints. We show
that the bilinear program can be solved in polynomial time in special cases, establish computational
complexity results for general cases, and develop polynomial-time heuristics by relating the
bilinear program to the maximal closure problem from graph theory. Numerical experiments demonstrate
that our algorithms for solving the robust optimization problems are practical and can outperform
state-of-the-art simulation-based algorithms in the context of widely-studied stochastic optimal
stopping problems from high-dimensional option pricing.

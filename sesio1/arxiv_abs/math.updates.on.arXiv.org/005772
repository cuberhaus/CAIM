We describe a weak tracial analog of approximate representability under the name "weak tracial
approximate representability" for finite group actions. Let $G$ be a finite abelian group, let
$A$ be an infinite-dimensional simple unital C*-algebra, and let $\alpha \colon G \to \operatorname{Aut}
(A)$ be an action of $G$ on $A$ which is pointwise outer. Then $\alpha$ has the weak tracial Rokhlin
property if and only if the dual action $\widehat{\alpha}$ of the Pontryagin dual $\widehat{G}$
on the crossed product $C^*(G, A, \alpha)$ is weakly tracially approximately representable, and
$\alpha$ is weakly tracially approximately representable if and only if the dual action $\widehat{\alpha}$
has the weak tracial Rokhlin property. This generalizes the results of Izumi in 2004 and Phillips
in 2011 on the dual actions of finite abelian groups on unital simple C*-algebras. Let $G$ be a finite
group, let $A$ be an infinite-dimensional stably finite simple unital C*-algebra, and let $\alpha
\colon G \to \operatorname{Aut} (A)$ be a weakly tracially strictly approximately inner action
of $G$ on $A$. Let $A^{\alpha}$ be the fixed point algebra. Then the radius of comparison satisfies
$\operatorname{rc} (A) \leq \operatorname{rc} \big( C^*(G, A, \alpha) \big)$ and if $C^*(G, A,
\alpha)$ is simple, then $\operatorname{rc} (A) \leq \operatorname{rc} \big( C^*(G, A, \alpha)
\big) \leq \operatorname{rc} (A^{\alpha})$. Further, the inclusion of $A$ in $C^*(G, A, \alpha)$
induces an isomorphism from the soft part of the Cuntz semigroup $\operatorname{Cu} (A)$ to its
image in $\operatorname{Cu} (C^*(G, A, \alpha))$. These results generalize our earlier results
on the radius of comparison and the Cuntz semigroup of the crossed product by a tracially strictly
approximately inner action.

We develop a novel approach for the construction of quantile processes governing the stochastic
dynamics of quantiles in continuous time. Two classes of quantile diffusions are identified: the
first, which we largely focus on, features a dynamic random quantile level and allows for direct
interpretation of the resulting quantile process characteristics such as location, scale, skewness
and kurtosis, in terms of the model parameters. The second type are function-valued quantile diffusions
and are driven by stochastic parameter processes, which determine the entire quantile function
at each point in time. By the proposed innovative and simple -- yet powerful -- construction method,
quantile processes are obtained by transforming the marginals of a diffusion process under a composite
map consisting of a distribution and a quantile function. Such maps, analogous to rank transmutation
maps, produce the marginals of the resulting quantile process. We discuss the relationship and
differences between our approach and existing methods and characterisations of quantile processes
in discrete and continuous time. As an example of an application of quantile diffusions, we show
how probability measure distortions, a form of dynamic tilting, can be induced. Though particularly
useful in financial mathematics and actuarial science, examples of which are given in this work,
measure distortions feature prominently across multiple research areas. For instance, dynamic
distributional approximations (statistics), non-parametric and asymptotic analysis (mathematical
statistics), dynamic risk measures (econometrics), behavioural economics, decision making
(operations research), signal processing (information theory), and not least in general risk
theory including applications thereof, for example in the context of climate change.

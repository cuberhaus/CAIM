In this work, we study various properties of embedded hypersurfaces in $1+1+2$ decomposed spacetimes
with a preferred spatial direction, denoted $e^{\mu}$, which are orthogonal to the fluid flow velocity
of the spacetime and admit a proper conformal transformation. To ensure a non-vanishing positivity
scalar curvature of the induced metric, we impose that the scalar curvature of the conformal metric
is non-negative and that the associated conformal factor satisfies $\hat{\varphi}^2+2\hat{\hat{\varphi}}>0$,
where $\hat{\ast}$ denotes derivative along $e^{\mu}$. Firstly, it is demonstrated that such
hypersurface is either Einstein or the twist vanishes on it, and that the scalar curvature of the
induced metric is constant. It is then proved that if the hypersurface is compact and of Einstein,
and admits a proper conformal transformation, then the hypersurface must be isomorphic to the $3$-sphere,
where we make use of well known results on Riemannian manifolds admitting conformal transformations.
If the hypersurface is not Einstein and has nowhere vanishing sheet expansion, we show that this
conclusion fails. However, with the additional conditions that the scalar curvatures of the induced
metric and the conformal metric coincide, the associated conformal factor is strictly negative
and the third and higher order derivatives of the conformal factor vanish, the conclusion follows.
Furthermore, additional results are obtained under the conditions that the scalar curvature of
a metric conformal to the induced metric is also constant. Finally, we consider some of our results
in context of locally rotationally symmetric spacetimes and show that, if the hypersurfaces are
compact and not of Einstein type, then under specified conditions the hypersurface is isomorphic
to the $3$-sphere, where we constructed explicit examples of proper conformal Killing vector fields
along $e^{\mu}$.

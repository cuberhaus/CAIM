We define a class of not necessarily linear $C_0$-semigroups $(P_t)_{t\geq0}$ on $C_b(E)$ (more
generally, on $C_\kappa(E):=\frac{1}{\kappa} C_b(E)$, for some continuous weight function
$\kappa$) equipped with the mixed topology $\tau_1^\mathscr{M}$ for a large class of topological
state spaces $E$. In the linear case we prove that such $(P_t)_{t\geq0}$ can be characterized as
integral operators given by certain measure kernels. One main result is that transition semigroups
of Markov processes are $C_0$-semigroups on $(C_b(E), \tau_{1}^{\mathscr M})$, if they leave
$C_b(E)$ invariant and are jointly weakly continuous in space and time. In particular, they are
infinitesimally generated by their generator $(L, D(L))$ and thus reconstructable through an
Euler formula from their strong derivative at zero in $(C_b(E), \tau_{1}^{\mathscr M})$. This
solves a long standing open problem on Markov processes. Our results apply to a large number of Markov
processes given as the laws of solutions to SDEs and SPDEs. We also introduce the notion of a Markov
core operator $(L_0, D(L_0))$ for $(L, D(L))$ and prove that uniqueness of the Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov
equations given by $(L_0,D(L_0))$ for all Dirac initial conditions implies that $(L_0,D(L_0))$
is a Markov core operator for $(L,D(L))$. As a consequence we can identify the Kolmogorov operator
of a large number of SDEs on finite and infinite dimensional state spaces as such. Furthermore, if
each $P_t$ is merely convex, we prove that $(P_t)_{t \geq 0}$ gives rise to viscosity solutions to
the Cauchy problem of its associated (non linear) infinitesimal generators. We also show that value
functions of finite or infinite dimensional optimal control problems are examples of convex $C_0$-semigroups
on $\left( C_b(E),\tau_{1}^{\mathscr M}\right)$.

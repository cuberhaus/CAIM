We propose a method for the numerical solution of a multiscale model describing sorption kinetics
of a surfactant around an oscillating bubble. The evolution of the particles is governed by a convection-diffusion
equation for the surfactant concentration $c$, with suitable boundary condition on the bubble
surface, which models the action of the short range attractive-repulsive potential acting on them
when they get sufficiently close to the surface \cite{multiscale_mod}. In the domain occupied
by the fluid, the particles are transported by the fluid motion generated by the bubble oscillations.
The method adopted to solve the equation for $c$ is based on a finite-difference scheme on a uniform
Cartesian grid and implemented in 2D and 3D axisymmetric domains. We use a level-set function to
define the region occupied by the bubble, while the boundary conditions are discretized by a ghost-point
technique to guarantee second order accuracy at the curved boundary. The sparse linear system is
finally solved with a geometric multigrid technique designed \textit{ad-hoc\/} for this specific
problem. Several accuracy tests are provided to prove second order accuracy in space and time. The
fluid dynamics generated by the oscillating bubble is governed by the Stokes equation solved with
a second order accurate method based on a monolithic approach, where the momentum and continuity
equations are solved simultaneously. Since the amplitude of the bubble oscillations are very small,
a simplified model is presented where the computational bubble is actually steady and its oscillations
are represented purely with time-dependent boundary conditions. A numerical comparison with
the moving domain model confirms that this simplification is perfectly reasonable for the class
of problems investigated in this paper.

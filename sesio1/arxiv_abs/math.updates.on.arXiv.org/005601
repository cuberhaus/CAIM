In this paper we consider compound conditionals, Fr\'echet-Hoeffding bounds and the probabilistic
interpretation of Frank t-norms. By studying the solvability of suitable linear systems, we show
under logical independence the sharpness of the Fr\'echet-Hoeffding bounds for the prevision
of conjunctions and disjunctions of $n$ conditional events. We study the set of all coherent prevision
assessments on a family containing $n$ conditional events and their conjunction, by verifying
that it is convex. We discuss the case where the prevision of conjunctions is assessed by Lukasiewicz
t-norms and we give explicit solutions for the linear systems; then, we analyze a selected example.
We obtain a probabilistic interpretation of Frank t-norms and t-conorms as prevision of conjunctions
and disjunctions of conditional events, respectively. Then, we characterize the sets of coherent
prevision assessments on a family containing $n$ conditional events and their conjunction, or
their disjunction, by using Frank t-norms, or Frank t-conorms. By assuming logical independence,
we show that any Frank t-norm (resp., t-conorm) of two conditional events $A|H$ and $B|K$, $T_{\lambda}(A|H,B|K)$
(resp., $S_{\lambda}(A|H,B|K)$), is a conjunction $(A|H)\wedge (B|K)$ (resp., a disjunction
$(A|H)\vee (B|K)$). By considering a family $\mathcal{F}$ containing three conditional events,
their conjunction, and all pairwise conjunctions we give some results on Frank t-norms and coherence
of the prevision assessments on $\mathcal{F}$. By assuming logical independence, we show that
it is coherent to assess the previsions of all the conjunctions by means of Minimum and Product t-norms.
We verify by a counterexample that, when the previsions of conjunctions are assessed by the Lukasiewicz
t-norm, coherence is not assured.

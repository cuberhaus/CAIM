In 1953, P.P. Korovkin discovered a simple criterion to decide whether a sequence of positive linear
operators on C[0,1] is an approximation process or not by only testing the convergence on the functions
\{1, t, t^2\} (the test set). This result is known as the first Korovkin theorem. This outstanding
result led to a new theory called Korovkin-type Approximation Theory. In 1968, O. Shisha and B. Mond
formulated and proved a quantitative form of this theorem. This estimation theorem gives the convergence
of a sequence of positive linear operators to the identity operator in terms of the convergence of
the test functions and a quantity called modulus of continuity. Later in 1972, Ronald A DeVore proved
an extension to this theorem. T. Nishishiraho obtained extensions of such results in various settings
in the 1980's. These quantitative versions give inequalities that cover the approximation results
and provide the convergence rate depending on the smoothness of the function. In a recent article,
Yusuf Zeren, Migdad Ismailov and Cemil Karacam proved Korovkin-type theorems on Banach function
spaces. They also derived an analogue of the Korovkin theorem for Kantorovich polynomials. These
results are applicable in various concrete examples such as Lebesgue spaces, grand-Lebesgue spaces,
Morrey-type spaces and their weighted versions, weak Lebesgue spaces, Orlicz spaces, etc. This
article discusses the quantitative versions of these results, in line with the classical quantitative
versions by O. Shisha, B. Mond and Ronald A DeVore. We obtained estimation theorems in terms of the
modulus of continuity for functions in C[0,1] under weaker conditions. These quantitative forms
apply to the case of Kantorovich polynomials on several spaces such as Lebesgue spaces, Grand Lebesgue
spaces, Morrey-type spaces etc. We also discuss the special forms of the inequalities in these various
examples.

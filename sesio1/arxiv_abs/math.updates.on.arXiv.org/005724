This is a tutorial and survey paper on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, first-order and second-order
numerical optimization, and distributed optimization. After a brief review of history of optimization,
we start with some preliminaries on properties of sets, norms, functions, and concepts of optimization.
Then, we introduce the optimization problem, standard optimization problems (including linear
programming, quadratic programming, and semidefinite programming), and convex problems. We
also introduce some techniques such as eliminating inequality, equality, and set constraints,
adding slack variables, and epigraph form. We introduce Lagrangian function, dual variables,
KKT conditions (including primal feasibility, dual feasibility, weak and strong duality, complementary
slackness, and stationarity condition), and solving optimization by method of Lagrange multipliers.
Then, we cover first-order optimization including gradient descent, line-search, convergence
of gradient methods, momentum, steepest descent, and backpropagation. Other first-order methods
are explained, such as accelerated gradient method, stochastic gradient descent, mini-batch
gradient descent, stochastic average gradient, stochastic variance reduced gradient, AdaGrad,
RMSProp, and Adam optimizer, proximal methods (including proximal mapping, proximal point algorithm,
and proximal gradient method), and constrained gradient methods (including projected gradient
method, projection onto convex sets, and Frank-Wolfe method). We also cover non-smooth and $\ell_1$
optimization methods including lasso regularization, convex conjugate, Huber function, soft-thresholding,
coordinate descent, and subgradient methods. Then, we explain second-order methods including
Newton's method for unconstrained, equality constrained, and inequality constrained problems....

Two tantalizing invariants of a combinatorial code $\mathcal C\subseteq 2^{[n]}$ are cdim$(\mathcal
C)$ and odim$(\mathcal C)$, the smallest dimension in which $\mathcal C$ can be realized by convex
closed or open sets, respectively. Cruz, Giusti, Itskov, and Kronholm showed that for intersection
complete codes $\mathcal C$ with $m+1$ maximal codewords, odim$(\mathcal C)$ and cdim$(\mathcal
C)$ are both bounded above by $\max\{2,m\}$. Results of Lienkaemper, Shiu, and Woodstock imply
that odim and cdim may differ, even for intersection complete codes. We add to the literature on open
and closed embedding dimensions of intersection complete codes with the following results: (*)
If $\mathcal C$ is a simplicial complex, then cdim$(\mathcal{C}) = \mbox{odim}(\mathcal C)$,
(*) If $\mathcal C$ is intersection complete, then cdim$(\mathcal C)\le \mbox{odim}(\mathcal
C)$, (*) If $\mathcal C\subseteq 2^{[n]}$ is intersection complete with $n\ge 2$, then cdim$(\mathcal
C) \le \min \{2d+1, n-1\}$, where $d$ is the dimension of the simplicial complex of $\mathcal C$,
and (*) For each simplicial complex $\Delta\subseteq 2^{[n]}$ with $m\ge 2$ facets, the code $\mathcal
S_\Delta := (\Delta \ast (n+1)) \cup \{[n]\}\subseteq 2^{[n+1]}$ is intersection complete, has
$m+1$ maximal codewords, and satisfies odim$(\mathcal S_\Delta)=m$. In particular, for each
$n\ge 3$ there exists an intersection complete code $\mathcal C\subseteq 2^{[n]}$ with odim$(\mathcal
C) = \binom{n-1}{\lfloor (n-1)/2\rfloor}$. A key tool in our work is the study of sunflowers: arrangements
of convex open sets in which the sets simultaneously meet in a central region, and nowhere else. We
use Tverberg's theorem to study the structure of "$k$-flexible" sunflowers, and consequently
obtain new lower bounds on odim$(\mathcal C)$ for intersection complete codes $\mathcal C$.

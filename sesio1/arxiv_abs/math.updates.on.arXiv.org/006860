While the classification of non-interacting crystalline topological insulator phases by equivariant
K-theory has become widely accepted, its generalization to anyonic interacting phases -- hence
to phases with topologically ordered ground states supporting topological braid quantum gates
-- has remained wide open. On the contrary, the success of K-theory with classifying non-interacting
phases seems to have tacitly been perceived as precluding a K-theoretic classification of interacting
topological order; and instead a mix of other proposals has been explored. However, only K-theory
connects closely to the actual physics of valence electrons; and self-consistency demands that
any other proposal must connect to K-theory. Here we provide a detailed argument for the classification
of symmetry protected/enhanced su(2)-anyonic topological order, specifically in interacting
2d semi-metals, by the twisted equivariant differential (TED) K-theory of configuration spaces
of points in the complement of nodal points inside the crystal's Brillouin torus orbi-orientifold.
We argue, in particular, that: (1) topological 2d semi-metal phases modulo global mass terms are
classified by the flat differential twisted equivariant K-theory of the complement of the nodal
points; (2) n-electron interacting phases are classified by the K-theory of configuration spaces
of n points in the Brillouin torus; (3) the somewhat neglected twisting of equivariant K-theory
by "inner local systems" reflects the effective "fictitious" gauge interaction of Chen, Wilczeck,
Witten & Halperin (1989), which turns fermions into anyonic quanta; (4) the induced su(2)-anyonic
topological order is reflected in the twisted Chern classes of the interacting valence bundle over
configuration space, constituting the hypergeometric integral construction of monodromy braid
representations.

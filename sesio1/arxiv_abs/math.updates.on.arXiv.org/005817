A generalization of fractional vector calculus as a self-consistent mathematical theory is proposed
to take into account a general form of non-locality in kernels of fractional vector differential
and integral operators. Self-consistency involves proving generalizations of all fundamental
theorems of vector calculus for generalized kernels of operators. In the generalization of FVC
from power-law nonlocality to the general form of nonlocality in space, we use the general fractional
calculus in the Luchko approach. This paper proposed the following: (1) Self-consistent definitions
of general fractional differential vector operators: the regional and line general fractional
gradients, the regional and surface general fractional curl operators, the general fractional
divergence are proposed. (2) Self-consistent definitions of general fractional integral vector
operators: the general fractional circulation, general fractional flux and general fractional
volume integral are proposed. (3) The general fractional gradient, Green, Stokes and Gauss theorems
as fundamental theorems of general fractional vector calculus are proved for simple and complex
regions. The fundamental theorems (Gradient, Green, Stokes, Gauss theorems) of the proposed general
FVC are proved for a wider class of domains, surfaces and curves. Therefore we can state that we proposed
a calculus, which is a general fractional vector calculus. The difficulties and problems of defining
general fractional integral and differential vector operators are discussed to the nonlocal case,
caused by the violation of standard product (Leibniz) rule, chain rule, and semigroup property.
General FVC for orthogonal curvilinear coordinates, which includes general fractional vector
operators for the spherical and cylindrical coordinates, is also proposed.

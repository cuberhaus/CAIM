We consider the approach of replacing trees by multi-indices as an index set of the abstract model
space $\mathsf{T}$ introduced by Otto, Sauer, Smith and Weber to tackle quasi-linear singular
SPDEs. We show that this approach is consistent with the postulates of regularity structures when
it comes to the structure group $\mathsf{G}$. In particular, $\mathsf{G}\subset{\rm Aut}(\mathsf{T})$
arises from a Hopf algebra $\mathsf{T}^+$ and a comodule $\Delta\colon\mathsf{T}\rightarrow
\mathsf{T}^+\otimes\mathsf{T}$. In fact, this approach, where the dual $\mathsf{T}^*$ of the
abstract model space $\mathsf{T}$ naturally embeds into a formal power series algebra, allows
to interpret $\mathsf{G}^*\subset{\rm Aut}(\mathsf{T}^*)$ as a Lie group arising from a Lie algebra
$\mathsf{L} \subset{\rm End}(\mathsf{T}^*)$ consisting of derivations on this power series
algebra. These derivations in turn are the infinitesimal generators of two actions on the space
of pairs (nonlinearities, functions of space-time mod constants). These actions are shift of space-time
and tilt by space-time polynomials. The Hopf algebra $\mathsf{T}^+$ arises from a coordinate representation
of the universal enveloping algebra ${\rm U}(\mathsf{L})$ of the Lie algebra $\mathsf{L}$. The
coordinates are determined by an underlying pre-Lie algebra structure of the derived algebra of
$\mathsf{L}$. Strong finiteness properties, which are enforced by gradedness and the restrictive
definition of $\mathsf{T}$, allow for this purely algebraic construction of $\mathsf{G}$. We
also argue that there exist pre-Lie algebra and Hopf algebra morphisms between our structure and
the tree-based one in the cases of branched rough paths (Grossman-Larson, Connes-Kreimer) and
of the generalized parabolic Anderson model.

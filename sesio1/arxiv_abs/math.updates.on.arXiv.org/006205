Feynman integral formulation is one of the most promising methodologies for handling the generally
covariant formulation of nonperturbative interacting quantum field theories (QFTs) without
a fixed prearranged causal background. Recent literature suggests that whenever the spacetime
metric is not fixed, one may not be able to avoid considering the Feynman integral in the original
Lorentz signature, without Wick rotation. Several mathematical phenomena are known, however,
which are at some point showstoppers to a mathematically sound definition of Feynman integral in
Lorentz signature. The Feynman integral formulation, however, is known to have a differential
reformulation, called to be the master Dyson--Schwinger (MDS) equation for the field correlators.
In this paper it is shown that a particular presentation of the MDS equation can be cast into a mathematically
rigorously defined form: the involved function spaces and operators can be strictly defined and
their properties can be established. Therefore, MDS equation can serve as a substitute for the Feynman
integral, in a mathematically sound formulation of constructive QFT, in arbitrary signature,
without a fixed background spacetime metric or causal structure. It is also shown that even in such
a generally covariant setting, there is a canonical way to define the Wilsonian regularization
of the MDS equation. The main result of the paper is a necessary and sufficient condition for the regularized
MDS solution space to be nonempty, for conformally invariant Lagrangians. The pertinent theorem
also provides an iterative approximation algorithm for obtaining regularized MDS solutions,
and is guaranteed to be convergent whenever the solution space is nonempty. The algorithm could
eventually serve as a method for putting Lorentz signature QFTs onto lattice, in the original metric
signature.

We develop a framework for simulating measure-preserving, ergodic dynamical systems on a quantum
computer. Our approach provides a new operator-theoretic representation of classical dynamics
by combining ergodic theory with quantum information science. The resulting quantum embedding
of classical dynamics (QECD) enables efficient simulation of spaces of classical observables
with exponentially large dimension using a quadratic number of quantum gates. The QECD framework
is based on a quantum feature map for representing classical states by density operators on a reproducing
kernel Hilbert space, $\mathcal H $, and an embedding of classical observables into self-adjoint
operators on $\mathcal H$. In this scheme, quantum states and observables evolve unitarily under
the lifted action of Koopman evolution operators of the classical system. Moreover, by virtue of
the reproducing property of $\mathcal H$, the quantum system is pointwise-consistent with the
underlying classical dynamics. To achieve an exponential quantum computational advantage, we
project the state of the quantum system to a density matrix on a $2^n$-dimensional tensor product
Hilbert space associated with $n$ qubits. By employing discrete Fourier-Walsh transforms, the
evolution operator of the finite-dimensional quantum system is factorized into tensor product
form, enabling implementation through a quantum circuit of size $O(n)$. Furthermore, the circuit
features a state preparation stage, also of size $O(n)$, and a quantum Fourier transform stage of
size $O(n^2)$, which makes predictions of observables possible by measurement in the standard
computational basis. We prove theoretical convergence results for these predictions as $n\to\infty$.
We present simulated quantum circuit experiments in Qiskit Aer, as well as actual experiments on
the IBM Quantum System One.

We develop the foundations of a geometric theory of countably-infinite approximate groups, extending
work of Bj\"orklund and the second-named author. Our theory is based on the notion of a quasi-isometric
quasi-action (qiqac) of an approximate group on a metric space. More specifically, we introduce
a geometric notion of finite generation for approximate group and prove that every geometrically
finitely-generated approximate group admits a geometric qiqac on a proper geodesic metric space.
We then show that all such spaces are quasi-isometric, hence can be used to associate a canonical
QI type with every geometrically finitely-generated approximate group. This in turn allows us
to define geometric invariants of approximate groups using QI invariants of metric spaces. Among
the invariants we consider are asymptotic dimension, finiteness properties, numbers of ends and
growth type. For geometrically finitely-generated approximate groups of polynomial growth we
derive a version of Gromov's polynomial growth theorem, based on work of Hrushovski and Breuillard--Green--Tao.
A particular focus is on qiqacs on hyperbolic spaces. Our strongest results are obtained for approximate
groups which admit a geometric qiqac on a proper geodesic hyperbolic space. For such "hyperbolic
approximate groups" we establish a number of fundamental properties in analogy with the case of
hyperbolic groups. For example, we show that their asymptotic dimension is one larger than the topological
dimension of their Gromov boundary and that - under some mild assumption of being "non-elementary"
- they have exponential growth and act minimally on their Gromov boundary. We also study convex cocompact
qiqacs on hyperbolic spaces. Using the theory of Morse boundaries, we extend some of our results
concerning qiqacs on hyperbolic spaces to qiqacs on proper geodesic metric spaces with non-trivial
Morse boundary.

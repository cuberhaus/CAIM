Hadwiger's conjecture, among the most famous open problems in graph theory, states that every graph
that does not contain $K_t$ as a minor is properly $(t-1)$-colorable. The purpose of this work is
to demonstrate that a natural extension of Hadwiger's problem to hypergraph coloring exists, and
to derive some first partial results and applications. Generalizing ordinary graph minors to hypergraphs,
we say that a hypergraph $H_1$ is a minor of a hypergraph $H_2$, if a hypergraph isomorphic to $H_1$
can be obtained from $H_2$ via a finite sequence of vertex- and hyperedge-deletions, and hyperedge
contractions. We first show that a weak extension of Hadwiger's conjecture to hypergraphs holds
true: For every $t \ge 1$, there exists a finite (smallest) integer $h(t)$ such that every hypergraph
with no $K_t$-minor is $h(t)$-colorable, and we prove $$\left\lceil\frac{3}{2}(t-1)\right\rceil
\le h(t) \le 2g(t)$$ where $g(t)$ denotes the maximum chromatic number of graphs with no $K_t$-minor.
Using the recent result by Delcourt and Postle that $g(t)=O(t \log \log t)$, this yields $h(t)=O(t
\log \log t)$. We further conjecture that $h(t)=\left\lceil\frac{3}{2}(t-1)\right\rceil$,
i.e., that every hypergraph with no $K_t$-minor is $\left\lceil\frac{3}{2}(t-1)\right\rceil$-colorable
for all $t \ge 1$, and prove this conjecture for all hypergraphs with independence number at most
$2$. By considering special classes of hypergraphs, the above additionally has some interesting
applications for ordinary graph coloring, such as: -graphs of chromatic number $C k t \log \log t$
contain $K_t$-minors with $k$-edge-connected branch-sets, -graphs of chromatic number $C q t
\log \log t$ contain $K_t$-minors with modulo-$q$-connected branch sets, -by considering cycle
hypergraphs of digraphs we recover known results on strong minors in digraphs of large dichromatic
number as special cases.

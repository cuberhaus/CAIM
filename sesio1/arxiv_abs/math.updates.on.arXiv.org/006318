The immersed boundary (IB) method is a non-body conforming approach to fluid-structure interaction
(FSI) that uses an Eulerian description of the momentum, viscosity, and incompressibility of a
coupled fluid-structure system and a Lagrangian description of the deformations, stresses, and
resultant forces of the immersed structure. Integral transforms with Dirac delta function kernels
couple the Eulerian and Lagrangian variables, and in practice, discretizations of these integral
transforms use regularized delta function kernels. Many different kernel functions have been
proposed, but prior numerical work investigating the impact of the choice of kernel function on
the accuracy of the methodology has been limited. This work systematically studies the effect of
the choice of regularized delta function in several FSI benchmark tests using the immersed finite
element/difference (IFED) method, which is an extension of the IB method that uses a finite element
structural discretizations combined with a Cartesian grid finite difference method for the incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations. The IFED formulation evaluates the regularized delta function on a collection
of interaction points that can be chosen to be denser than the nodes of the Lagrangian mesh, and this
study investigates the effect of varying the relative mesh widths of the Lagrangian and Eulerian
discretizations. Our results indicate that kernels satisfying a commonly imposed even-odd condition
require higher resolution to achieve similar accuracy as kernels that do not satisfy. We also find
that narrower kernels are more robust and that structural meshes that are substantially coarser
than the Cartesian grid can yield high accuracy for shear-dominated cases but not for cases with
large normal forces. We verify our results in a large-scale FSI model of a bovine pericardial bioprosthetic
heart valve in a pulse duplicator.

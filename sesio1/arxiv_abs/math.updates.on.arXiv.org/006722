The study of emergent behavior of swarms is of great interest for applied sciences. One of the most
fundamental questions for self-organizing swarms is whether the swarms disperse or remain in a
spatially cohesive configuration. In the paper we study dissipativity properties and spatial
cohesiveness of the swarm of self-propelled particles governed by the model $\ddot r_k = -p_k(|\dot
r_k|)\dot r_k - \sum_m a_{k,m}r_m$, where $r_k\in \mathbb R^d$, $k=1,\ldots,n$, and $A = \{a_{k,m}\}$
is a symmetric positive-semidefinie matrix. The self-propulsion term is assumed to be continuously
differentiable and to grow faster than $1/z$, that is, $p_k(z)z\to\infty $ as $z\to\infty$. We
establish that the velocity and acceleration of the particles are ultimately bounded. We show that
when $\ker (A)$ is trivial, the positions of the particles are also ultimately bounded. For systems
with $\ker (A)\neq \{0\}$, we show that, while the system might infinitely drift away from its initial
location, the particles remain within a bounded distance from the generalized center of mass of
the system, which geometrically coincides with the weighted average of agent positions. The weights
are determined by the coefficients of the projection matrix onto $\ker (A)$. We also include the
proof of the ultimate boundedness of velocities and accelerations for systems with bounded coupling,
including systems coupled via the Morse potential. In our proof we switch to the velocity-acceleration
coordinates and focus on the study of dissipativity properties for a more general class of Li\'enard
systems $\ddot x_k = -\mathbb F_k(x_k)\cdot \dot x_k -\sum_{m} a_{k,m}x_m$, $k=1,\ldots,n$,
$\mathbb F_k(x) = \nabla F_k(x)$ with $F_k: \mathbb R^d\rightarrow \mathbb R^d$ given by $F_k(x)
= p_k(|x|)x$.

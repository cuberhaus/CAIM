Let $\Sigma$ be a finite type surface, and $G$ a complex algebraic simple Lie group with Lie algebra
$\mathfrak{g}$. The quantum moduli algebra of $(\Sigma,G)$ is a quantization of the ring of functions
of $X_G(\Sigma)$, the variety of $G$-characters of $\pi_1(\Sigma)$, introduced by Alekseev-Grosse-Schomerus
and Buffenoir-Roche in the mid '90s. It can be realized as the invariant subalgebra of so-called
graph algebras, which are $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$-module-algebras associated to graphs on $\Sigma$,
where $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$ is the quantum group corresponding to $G$. We study the structure of
the quantum moduli algebra in the case where $\Sigma$ is a sphere with $n+1$ open disks removed, $n\geq
1$, using the graph algebra of the "daisy" graph on $\Sigma$ to make computations easier. We provide
new results that hold for arbitrary $G$ and generic $q$, and develop the theory in the case where $q=\epsilon$,
a primitive root of unity of odd order, and $G={\rm SL}(2,{\mathbb C})$. In such a situation we introduce
a Frobenius morphism that provides a natural identification of the center of the daisy graph algebra
with a finite extension of the coordinate ring $\mathcal{O}(G^n)$. We extend the quantum coadjoint
action of De-Concini-Kac-Procesi to the daisy graph algebra, and show that the associated Poisson
structure on the center corresponds by the Frobenius morphism to the Fock-Rosly Poisson structure
on $\mathcal{O}(G^n)$. We show that the set of fixed elements of the center under the quantum coadjoint
action is a finite extension of ${\mathbb C}[X_G(\Sigma)]$ endowed with the Atiyah-Bott-Goldman
Poisson structure. Finally, by using Wilson loop operators we identify the Kauffman bracket skein
algebra $K_{\zeta}(\Sigma)$ at $\zeta:={\rm i}\epsilon^{1/2}$ with this quantum moduli algebra
specialized at $q=\epsilon$.

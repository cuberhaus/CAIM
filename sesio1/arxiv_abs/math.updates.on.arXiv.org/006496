The paper presents a versatile framework for solids which undergo nonisothermal processes with
irreversibly changing microstructure at large strains. It outlines rate-type and incremental
variational principles for the full thermomechanical coupling in gradient-extended dissipative
materials. It is shown that these principles yield as Euler equations essentially the macro- and
micro-balances as well as the energy equation. Starting point is the incorporation of the entropy
and entropy rate as canonical arguments into constitutive energy and dissipation functions, which
additionally depend on the gradient-extended mechanical state and its rate, respectively. By
means of (generalized) Legendre transformations, extended variational principles with thermal
as well as mechanical driving forces can be constructed. On the thermal side, a rigorous distinction
between the quantity conjugate to the entropy and the quantity conjugate to the entropy rate is essential
here. Formulations with mechanical driving forces are especially suitable when considering possibly
temperature-dependent threshold mechanisms. With regard to variationally consistent incrementations,
we suggest an update scheme which renders the exact form of the intrinsic dissipation and is highly
suitable when considering adiabatic processes. It is shown that this proposed numerical algorithm
has the structure of an operator split. To underline the broad applicability of the proposed framework,
we set up three model problems as applications: Cahn-Hilliard diffusion coupled with temperature
evolution, where we propose a new variational principle in terms of the species flux vector, as well
as thermomechanics of gradient damage and gradient plasticity. In a numerical example we study
the formation of a cross shear band.

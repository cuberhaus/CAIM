We define a notion of category enriched over an oplax monoidal category $V$, extending the usual
definition of category enriched over a monoidal category. Even though oplax monoidal structures
involve infinitely many functors $V^n\to V$, defining categories enriched over $V$ only requires
the lower arity maps $(n \leq 3)$, similarly to the monoidal case. The focal point of the enrichment
theory shifts, in the oplax case, from the notion of $V$-category (given by collections of objects
and hom-objects together with composition and unit maps) to the one of categories enriched over
$V$ (genuine categories equipped with additional structures). One of the merits of the notion of
categories enriched over $V$ is that it becomes straightforward to define enriched functors and
natural transformations. We show moreover that the resulting 2-category $\mathsf{Cat}_V$ can
be put in correspondence (via the theory of distributors) with the 2-category of modules over $V$.
We give an example of such an enriched category in the framework of operads: every cocomplete symmetric
monoidal category $C$ is enriched over the category of sequences in $C$ endowed with an oplax monoidal
structure stemming from the usual operadic composition product, whose monoids are still the operads.
As an application of the study of the 2-functor $V\mapsto\mathsf{Cat}_V$, we show that when $V$
is also endowed with a compatible lax monoidal structure - thus forming a lax-oplax duoidal category
- the 2-category $\mathsf{Cat}_V$ inherits a lax 2-monoidal structure, thereby generalising
the corresponding result when the enrichment base is a braided monoidal category. We illustrate
this result by discussing the lax-oplax structure on the category of $(R^\mathrm{e}, R^\mathrm{e})$-bimodules,
whose bimonoids are the bialgebroids. We also comment on the relations with other enrichment theories
(monoidal, multicategories, skew and lax).

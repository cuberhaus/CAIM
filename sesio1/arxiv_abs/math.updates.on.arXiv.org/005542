This paper is motivated by the following question: what are the unavoidable induced subgraphs of
graphs with large treewidth? Aboulker et al. made a conjecture which answers this question in graphs
of bounded maximum degree, asserting that for all $k$ and $\Delta$, every graph with maximum degree
at most $\Delta$ and sufficiently large treewidth contains either a subdivision of the $(k\times
k)$-wall or the line graph of a subdivision of the $(k\times k)$-wall as an induced subgraph. We prove
two theorems supporting this conjecture, as follows. 1. For $t\geq 2$, a $t$-theta is a graph consisting
of two nonadjacent vertices and three internally disjoint paths between them, each of length at
least $t$. A $t$-pyramid is a graph consisting of a vertex $v$, a triangle $B$ disjoint from $v$ and
three paths starting at $v$ and disjoint otherwise, each joining $v$ to a vertex of $B$, and each of
length at least $t$. We prove that for all $k,t$ and $\Delta$, every graph with maximum degree at most
$\Delta$ and sufficiently large treewidth contains either a $t$-theta, or a $t$-pyramid, or the
line graph of a subdivision of the $(k\times k)$-wall as an induced subgraph. This affirmatively
answers a question of Pilipczuk et al. asking whether every graph of bounded maximum degree and sufficiently
large treewidth contains either a theta or a triangle as an induced subgraph (where a theta means
a $t$-theta for some $t\geq 2$). 2. A subcubic subdivided caterpillar is a tree of maximum degree
at most three whose all vertices of degree three lie on a path. We prove that for every $\Delta$ and
subcubic subdivided caterpillar $T$, every graph with maximum degree at most $\Delta$ and sufficiently
large treewidth contains either a subdivision of $T$ or the line graph of a subdivision of $T$ as an
induced subgraph.

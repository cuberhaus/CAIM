Given a target distribution $\mu \propto e^{-\mathcal{H}}$ to sample from with Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}$,
in this paper we propose and analyze new Metropolis-Hastings sampling algorithms that target an
alternative distribution $\mu^f_{1,\alpha,c} \propto e^{-\mathcal{H}^{f}_{1,\alpha,c}}$,
where $\mathcal{H}^{f}_{1,\alpha,c}$ is a landscape-modified Hamiltonian which we introduce
explicitly. The advantage of the Metropolis dynamics which targets $\pi^f_{1,\alpha,c}$ is that
it enjoys reduced critical height described by the threshold parameter $c$, function $f$, and a
penalty parameter $\alpha \geq 0$ that controls the state-dependent effect. First, we investigate
the case of fixed $\alpha$ and propose a self-normalized estimator that corrects for the bias of
sampling and prove asymptotic convergence results and Chernoff-type bound of the proposed estimator.
Next, we consider the case of annealing the penalty parameter $\alpha$. We prove strong ergodicity
and bounds on the total variation mixing time of the resulting non-homogeneous chain subject to
appropriate assumptions on the decay of $\alpha$. We illustrate the proposed algorithms by comparing
their mixing times with the original Metropolis dynamics on statistical physics models including
the ferromagnetic Ising model on the hypercube or the complete graph and the $q$-state Potts model
on the two-dimensional torus. In these cases, the mixing times of the classical Glauber dynamics
are at least exponential in the system size as the critical height grows at least linearly with the
size, while the proposed annealing algorithm, with appropriate choice of $f$, $c$, and annealing
schedule on $\alpha$, mixes rapidly with at most polynomial dependence on the size. The crux of the
proof harnesses on the important observation that the reduced critical height can be bounded independently
of the size that gives rise to rapid mixing.

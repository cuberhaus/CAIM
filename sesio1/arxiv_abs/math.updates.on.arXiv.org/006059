Neumann series underlie both Krylov methods and algebraic multigrid smoothers. A low-synch modified
Gram-Schmidt (MGS)-GMRES algorithm is described that employs a Neumann series to accelerate the
projection step. A corollary to the backward stability result of Paige et al. (2006) demonstrates
that the truncated Neumann series approximation is sufficient for convergence of GMRES. The lower
triangular solver associated with the correction matrix $T_m = (\: I + L_m \:)^{-1}$ may then be replaced
by a matrix-vector product with $T_m = I - L_m$. Next, Neumann series are applied to accelerate the
classical R\"uge-Stuben algebraic multigrid preconditioner using both a polynomial Gauss-Seidel
or incomplete ILU smoother. The sparse triangular solver employed in these smoothers is replaced
by an inner iteration based upon matrix-vector products. Henrici's departure from normality of
the associated iteration matrices leads to a better understanding of these series. Connections
are made between the (non)normality of the $L$ and $U$ factors and nonlinear stability analysis,
as well as the pseudospectra of the coefficient matrix. Furthermore, re-orderings that preserve
structural symmetry also reduce the departure from normality of the upper triangular factor and
improve the relative residual of the triangular solves. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this
approach on many-core architectures, the proposed solver and preconditioner are applied to the
pressure continuity equation for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations of fluid motion.
The pressure solve time is reduced considerably with no change in the convergence rate and the polynomial
Gauss-Seidel smoother is compared with a Jacobi smoother. Numerical and timing results are presented
for Nalu-Wind and the PeleLM combustion codes, where ILU with iterative triangular solvers is shown
to be much more effective than polynomial Gauss-Seidel.

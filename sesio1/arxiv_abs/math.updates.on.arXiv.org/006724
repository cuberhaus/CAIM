We introduce and study a multiparameter colored partition category $\mathcal{CPar}(\textbf{x})$
by extending the construction of the partition category, over an algebraically closed field $\Bbbk$
of characteristic zero and for a multiparameter $\textbf{x}\in \Bbbk^{r}$. The morphism spaces
in $\mathcal{CPar}(\textbf{x})$ have bases in terms of partition diagrams whose parts are colored
by elements of the multiplicative cyclic group $C_r$. We show that the endomorphism spaces of $\mathcal{CPar}(\textbf{x})$
and additive Karoubi envelope of $\mathcal{CPar}(\textbf{x})$ are generically semisimple.
The category $\mathcal{CPar}(\textbf{x})$ is rigid symmetric strict monoidal and we give a presentation
of $\mathcal{CPar}(\textbf{x})$ as a monoidal category. The path algebra of $\mathcal{CPar}(\textbf{x})$
admits a triangular decomposition with Cartan subalgebra being equal to the direct sum of the group
algebras of complex reflection groups $G(r,n)$. We compute the structure constants for the classes
of simple modules in the split Grothendieck ring of the category of modules over the path algebra
of the downward partition subcategory of $\mathcal{CPar}(\textbf{x})$ in two ways. Among other
things, this gives a closed formula for the product of the reduced Kronecker coefficients in terms
of the Littlewood--Richardson coefficients for $G(r,n)$ and certain Kronecker coefficients
for the wreath product $(C_r \times C_r)\wr S_n$. For $r=1$, this formula reduces to a formula for
the reduced Kronecker coefficients given by Littlewood. We also give two analogues of the Robinson--Schensted
correspondence for colored partition diagrams and, as an application, we classify the equivalence
classes of Green's left, right and two-sided relations for the colored partition monoid in terms
of these correspondences.

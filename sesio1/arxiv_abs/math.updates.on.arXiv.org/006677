Commuting pairs of algebraic structures on a set have been studied by several authors and may be described
equivalently as algebras for the tensor product of Lawvere theories, or more basically as certain
bifunctors that here we call bifold algebras. The much less studied notion of commutant for Lawvere
theories was first introduced by Wraith and generalizes the notion of centralizer clone in universal
algebra. Working in the general setting of enriched algebraic theories for a system of arities,
we study the interaction of the concepts of bifold algebra and commutant. We show that the notion
of commutant arises via a universal construction in a two-sided fibration of bifold algebras over
various theories. On this basis, we study special classes of bifold algebras that are related to
commutants, introducing the notions of commutant bifold algebra and balanced bifold algebra.
We establish several adjunctions and equivalences among these categories of bifold algebras and
related categories of algebras over various theories, including commutative, contracommutative,
saturated, and balanced algebras. We also survey and develop examples of commutant bifold algebras,
including examples that employ Pontryagin duality and a theorem of Ehrenfeucht and {\L}o\'s on
reflexive abelian groups. Along the way, we develop a functorial treatment of fundamental aspects
of bifold algebras and commutants, including tensor products of theories and the equivalence of
bifold algebras and commuting pairs of algebras. Because we work relative to a (possibly large)
system of arities in a closed category $\mathcal{V}$, our main results are applicable to arbitrary
$\mathcal{V}$-monads on a finitely complete $\mathcal{V}$, the enriched theories of Borceux
and Day, the enriched Lawvere theories of Power relative to a regular cardinal, and other notions
of algebraic theory.

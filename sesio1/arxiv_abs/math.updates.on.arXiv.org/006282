Inspired by blockchains, we introduce a dynamically growing model of rooted Directed Acyclic Graphs
(DAGs) referred to as the asynchronous composition model, subject to i.i.d. random delays $(\xi_t)$
with finite mean. The new vertex at time $t$ is connected to vertices chosen from the graph $G_{(t-\xi_t)_+}$
according to a construction function $f$ and the graph is updated by taking union with the graph $G_{t-1}$.
This process corresponds to adding new blocks in a blockchain, where the delays arise due to network
communication. The main question of interest is the end structure of the asynchronous limit of the
graph sequence as time increases to infinity. We consider the following construction functions
of interest, a) Nakamoto construction $f_{\mathrm{Nak}}$, in which a vertex is uniformly selected
from those furthest from the root, resulting in a tree, and b) mixture of construction functions
$(f_k)_{1\le k\le \infty}$, where in $f_k$ a random set of $k$ leaves (all if there are less than $k$
in total) is chosen without replacement. The main idea behind the analysis is decoupling the time-delay
process from the DAG process and constructing an appropriate regenerative structure in the time-delay
process giving rise to Markovian behavior for a functional of the DAG process. We establish that
the asynchronous limits for $f_\mathrm{Nak}, (f_k)_{k \ge 2}$, and any non-trivial mixture $f$
are one-ended, while the asynchronous limit for $f_1$ has infinitely many ends, almost surely.
We also study fundamental growth properties of the longest path for the sequence of graphs for $f_\mathrm{Nak}$.
In addition, we prove a phase transition on the (time and sample-path dependent) probability of
choosing $f_1$ such that the asynchronous limit either has one or infinitely many ends. Finally,
we show that the construction $f_\infty$ is an appropriate limit of the $(f_k)_k$.

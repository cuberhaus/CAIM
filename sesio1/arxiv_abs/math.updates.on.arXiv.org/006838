Following attempts at an analytic proof of the Pentagonal Number Theorem, we report on the discovery
of a general principle leading to an unexpected cancellation of oscillating sums. After stating
the motivation, and our theorem, we apply it to prove several results on the Prouhet-Tarry-Escott
Problem, integer partitions, and the distribution of prime numbers. Regarding the Prouhet-Tarry-Escott
problem, we show that \begin{align*} \sum_{|\ell|\leq x}(4x^2-4\ell^2)^{2r}-\sum_{|\ell|<x}(4x^2-(2\ell+1)^2)^{2r}=\text{polynomial
w.r.t. } x \text{ with degree }2r-1. \end{align*} This can perhaps be proved using properties of
Bernoulli polynomials, but the claim fell out of our method in a more natural and motivated way. Using
this result, we solve an approximate version of the PTE Problem, and in doing so our work in the approximate
case exceeds the bounds one can prove using a pigeonhole argument, which seems remarkable. Also,
we prove that $$ \sum_{\ell^2 < n} (-1)^\ell p(n-\ell^2)\ \sim\ (-1)^n 2^{-3/4} n^{-1/4} \sqrt{p(n)},
$$ where $p(n)$ is the usual partition function. We get the following "Weak pentagonal number theorem",
in which we can replace the partition function $p(n)$ with Chebyshev $\Psi$ function: $$ \sum_{0
< \ell < \sqrt{xT}/2} \Psi([e^{\sqrt{x - \frac{(2\ell)^2}{T}}},\ e^{\sqrt{x - \frac{(2\ell-1)^2}{T}}}])\
=\Psi(e^{\sqrt{x}})\left(\frac{1}{2} + O\left (e^{-0.196\sqrt{x}}\right)\right), $$ where
$T=e^{0.786\sqrt{x}}$, where $\Psi([a,b]) := \sum_{n\in [a,b]} \Lambda(n)$ and $\Psi(x) = \Psi([1,x])$,
where $\Lambda$ is the von Mangoldt function. Note that this last equation (sum over $\ell$) is stronger
than one would get using a strong form of the Prime Number Theorem and also a naive use of the Riemann
Hypothesis in each interval, since the widths of the intervals are smaller than $e^{\frac{1}{2}
\sqrt{x}}$, making the RH estimate ``trivial".

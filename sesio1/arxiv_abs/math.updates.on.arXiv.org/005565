In this paper we construct an explicit map from planar bicolored (plabic) trivalent graphs representing
a given irreducible positroid cell $S$ in the totally non-negative Grassmannian $Gr^{\mbox{TNN}}(k,n)$
to the spectral data for the relevant class of real regular Kadomtsev-Petviashvili II (KP) solutions,
thus completing search of real algebraic-geometric data for the KP equation started in [4,6]. The
spectral curve is modeled on Krichever construction for degenerate finite-gap solutions, and
is a rationally degenerate $M$-curve, $\Gamma$, dual to the graph. The divisors are real regular
KP divisors in the ovals of $\Gamma$, i.e. they fulfill the conditions for selecting real regular
finite--gap solutions KPII solutions in [25]. Since the soliton data are described by points in
$S$, we establish a bridge between real regular finite-gap KP solutions [25] and real regular multi-line
KP solitons which are known to be parameterized by points in $Gr^{\mbox{TNN}}(k,n)$ [18,43]. We
use the geometric characterization of spaces of relations on plabic networks introduced in [7]
to prove the invariance of this construction with respect to the many gauge freedoms on the network.
Such systems of relations were proposed in [53] for the computation of scattering amplitudes on
on--shell diagrams $N=4$ SYM \cite{AGP1} and govern the totally non--negative amalgamation of
the little positive Grassmannians, $Gr^{\mbox{TP}}(1,3)$ and $Gr^{\mbox{TP}}(2,3)$, into
any given positroid cell $S$. In our setting they rule the reality and regularity properties of the
KP divisor. Finally, we explain the transformation of the curve and the divisor both under Postnikov
moves and reductions and under amalgamation of positroid cells, and apply our construction to some
examples.

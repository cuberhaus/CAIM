Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) is an unsupervised machine learning method that has attracted
considerable attention in recent years owing to its equation-free structure, ability to easily
identify coherent spatio-temporal structures in data, and effectiveness in providing reasonably
accurate predictions for certain problems. Despite these successes, the application of DMD to
certain problems featuring highly nonlinear transient dynamics remains challenging. In such
cases, DMD may not only fail to provide acceptable predictions but may indeed fail to recreate the
data in which it was trained, restricting its application to diagnostic purposes. For many problems
in the biological and physical sciences, the structure of the system obeys a compartmental framework,
in which the transfer of mass within the system moves within states. In these cases, the behavior
of the system may not be accurately recreated by applying DMD to a single quantity within the system,
as proper knowledge of the system dynamics, even for a single compartment, requires that the behavior
of other compartments is taken into account in the DMD process. In this work, we demonstrate, theoretically
and numerically, that, when performing DMD on a fully coupled PDE system with compartmental structure,
one may recover useful predictive behavior, even when DMD performs poorly when acting compartment-wise.
We also establish that important physical quantities, as mass conservation, are maintained in
the coupled-DMD extrapolation. The mathematical and numerical analysis suggests that DMD may
be a powerful tool when applied to this common class of problems. In particular, we show interesting
numerical applications to a continuous delayed-SIRD model for Covid-19, and to a problem from additive
manufacturing considering a nonlinear temperature field and the resulting change of material
phase from powder, liquid, and solid states.

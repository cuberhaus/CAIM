We propose and study a new multilevel method for the numerical approximation of a Gibbs distribution
$\pi$ on R d , based on (over-damped) Langevin diffusions. This method both inspired by [PP18] and
[GMS + 20] relies on a multilevel occupation measure, i.e. on an appropriate combination of R occupation
measures of (constant-step) discretized schemes of the Langevin diffusion with respective steps
$\gamma$r = $\gamma$02 --r , r = 0,. .. , R. For a given diffusion, we first state a result under general
assumptions which guarantees an $\epsilon$-approximation (in a L 2-sense) with a cost proportional
to $\epsilon$ --2 (i.e. proportional to a Monte-Carlo method without bias) or $\epsilon$ --2 | log
$\epsilon$| 3 under less contractive assumptions. This general result is then applied to over-damped
Langevin diffusions in a strongly convex setting, with a study of the dependence in the dimension
d and in the spectrum of the Hessian matrix D 2 U of the potential U : R d $\rightarrow$ R involved in the
Gibbs distribution. This leads to strategies with cost in O(d$\epsilon$ --2 log 3 (d$\epsilon$
--2)) and in O(d$\epsilon$ --2) under an additional condition on the third derivatives of U. In particular,
in our last main result, we show that, up to universal constants, an appropriate choice of the diffusion
coefficient and of the parameters of the procedure leads to a cost controlled by ($\lambda$ U $\lor$1)
2 $\lambda$ 3 U d$\epsilon$ --2 (where$\lambda$U and $\lambda$ U respectively denote the supremum
and the infimum of the largest and lowest eigenvalue of D 2 U). In our numerical illustrations, we
show that our theoretical bounds are confirmed in practice and finally propose an opening to some
theoretical or numerical strategies in order to increase the robustness of the procedure when the
largest and smallest eigenvalues of D 2 U are respectively too large or too small.

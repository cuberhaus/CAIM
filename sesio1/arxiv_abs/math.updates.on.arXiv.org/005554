We lay the foundations of the first-order model theory of Coxeter groups. Firstly, with the exception
of the $2$-spherical non-affine case (which we leave open), we characterize the superstable Coxeter
groups of finite rank, which we show to be essentially the Coxeter groups of affine type. Secondly,
we characterize the Coxeter groups of finite rank which are domains, a central assumption in the
theory of algebraic geometry over groups, which in many respects (e.g. $\lambda$-stability) reduces
the model theory of a given Coxeter system to the model theory of its associated irreducible components.
In the second part of the paper we move to specific definability questions in right-angled Coxeter
groups (RACGs) and $2$-spherical Coxeter groups. In this respect, firstly, we prove that RACGs
of finite rank do not have proper elementary subgroups which are Coxeter groups, and prove further
that reflection independent ones do not have proper elementary subgroups at all. Secondly, we prove
that if $(W, S)$ is a right-angled Coxeter system of finite rank, then $W$ is a prime model of its theory
if and only if the monoid $Sim(W, S)$ of $S$-self-similarities of $W$ is finitely generated, and
use this to prove that if $W$ is a universal Coxeter group of finite rank at least two, then $Th(W)$
does not have a prime model. Thirdly, we prove that in reflection independent right-angled Coxeter
groups of finite rank the Coxeter elements are type-determined. We then move to $2$-spherical Coxeter
groups, proving that if $(W, S)$ is irreducible, $2$-spherical even and not affine, then $W$ is a
prime model of its theory, and that if $W_{\Gamma}$ and $W_{\Theta}$ are as in the previous sentence,
then $W_{\Gamma}$ is elementary equivalent to $W_{\Theta}$ if and only if $\Gamma \cong \Theta$,
thus solving the elementary equivalence problem for most of the $2$-spherical Coxeter groups.

In this paper, we consider a general class of two-stage distributionally robust optimization (DRO)
problems which includes prominent problem instances such as task scheduling, the assemble-to-order
system, and supply chain network design. The ambiguity set is constrained by fixed marginal distributions
that are not necessarily discrete. We develop a numerical algorithm for computing approximately
optimal solutions of such problems. Through replacing the marginal constraints by a finite collection
of linear constraints, we derive a relaxed-version of the two-stage DRO problem which serves as
its upper bound. We can control the error incurred by the relaxation to be arbitrarily close to 0.
Subsequently, we develop duality results tailored to this setting and transform the inf-sup problem
into an inf-inf problem. This leads to a numerical algorithm for two-stage DRO problems with marginal
constraints which solves a linear semi-infinite optimization problem via a cutting-plane method.
Besides an approximately optimal solution, the proposed algorithm computes both an upper bound
and a lower bound for the optimal value of the problem. The difference between the computed bounds
provides us with a direct estimate of the sub-optimality of the computed solution. Most importantly,
one is able to choose the inputs of the algorithm such that the sub-optimality is controlled to be
arbitrarily small. In our numerical examples, we apply the proposed algorithm to task scheduling,
the assemble-to-order system, and supply chain network design. The ambiguity sets in these problems
involve a large number of marginals, which include both discrete and continuous distributions.
The numerical results showcase that the proposed algorithm computes high-quality robust decisions
along with their corresponding sub-optimality estimates with practically reasonable magnitudes
that are not over-conservative.

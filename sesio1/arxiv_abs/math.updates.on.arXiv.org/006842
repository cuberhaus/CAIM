In this work, we analyse space-time reduced basis methods for the efficient numerical simulation
of haemodynamics in arteries. The classical formulation of the reduced basis (RB) method features
dimensionality reduction in space, while finite differences schemes are employed for the time
integration of the resulting ordinary differential equation (ODE). Space-time reduced basis
(ST-RB) methods extend the dimensionality reduction paradigm to the temporal dimension, projecting
the full-order problem onto a low-dimensional spatio-temporal subspace. Our goal is to investigate
the application of ST-RB methods to the unsteady incompressible Stokes equations, with a particular
focus on stability. High-fidelity simulations are performed using the Finite Element (FE) method
and BDF2 as time marching scheme. We consider two different ST-RB methods. In the first one - called
ST--GRB - space-time model order reduction is achieved by means of a Galerkin projection; a spatio-temporal
supremizers enrichment procedure is introduced to guarantee stability. The second method - called
ST-PGRB - is characterized by a Petrov-Galerkin projection, stemming from a suitable minimization
of the FOM residual, that allows to automatically attain stability. The classical RB method - denoted
as SRB-TFO - serves as a baseline for theoretical development. Numerical tests have been conducted
on an idealized symmetric bifurcation geometry and on the patient-specific one of a femoropopliteal
bypass. The results show that both ST-RB methods provide accurate approximations of the high-fidelity
solutions, while considerably reducing the computational cost. In particular, the ST-PGRB method
exhibits the best performance, as it features a better computational efficiency while retaining
accuracies in accordance with theoretical expectations.

Let f(1)=2, f(2)=4, and let f(n+1)=f(n)! for every integer n \geq 2. Edmund Landau's conjecture
states that the set P(n^2+1) of primes of the form n^2+1 is infinite. Landau's conjecture implies
the following unproven statement \Phi: card(P(n^2+1))<\omega ==> P(n^2+1) \subseteq [2,(((24!)!)!)!].
Let B denote the system of equations: {x_i!=x_k: i,k \in {1,...,9}} \cup {x_i \cdot x_j=x_k: i,j,k
\in {1,...,9}}. We write some system U \subseteq B of 9 equations which has exactly two solutions
in positive integers x_1,...,x_9, namely (1,...,1) and (f(1),...,f(9)). No known system S \subseteq
B with a finite number of solutions in positive integers x_1,...,x_9 has a solution (x_1,...,x_9)
\in (N\{0})^9 satisfying max(x_1,...,x_9)>f(9). For every known system S \subseteq B, if the finiteness/infiniteness
of the set {(x_1,...,x_9) \in (N\{0})^9: (x_1,...,x_9) solves S} is unknown, then the statement
\exists x_1,...,x_9 \in N\{0} ((x_1,...,x_9) solves S) \wedge (max(x_1,...,x_9)>f(9)) remains
unproven. We write some system A \subseteq B of 8 equations. Let \Lambda denote the statement: if
the system A has at most finitely many solutions in positive integers x_1,...,x_9, then each such
solution (x_1,...,x_9) satisfies x_1,...,x_9 \leq f(9). The statement \Lambda is equivalent
to the statement \Phi. It heuristically justifies the statement \Phi. This justification does
not yield the finiteness/infiniteness of P(n^2+1). We present a new heuristic argument for the
infiniteness of P(n^2+1), which is not based on the statement \Phi. The distinction between constructively
defined algorithms and algorithms whose existence is provable in ZFC inspires theorems and open
problems that concern decidable sets X \subseteq {\mathbb N} and cannot be formalized in mathematics
understood as an a priori science as they refer to the current knowledge on X.

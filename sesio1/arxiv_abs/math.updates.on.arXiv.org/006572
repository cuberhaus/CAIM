Computational homogenization is the gold standard for concurrent multi-scale simulations (e.g.,
FE2) in scale-bridging applications. Experimental and synthetic material microstructures are
often represented by 3D image data. The computational complexity of simulations operating on such
three-dimensional high-resolution voxel data comprising billions of unknowns induces the need
for algorithmically and numerically efficient solvers. The inability of voxelized 3D geometries
to capture smooth material interfaces accurately, along with the necessity for complexity reduction,
motivates a special local coarse-graining technique called composite voxels [Kabel,M. et al.
(2015)]. Composite voxels condense multiple fine-scale voxels into a single voxel obeying a theory-inspired
constitutive model by employing laminate theory. Composite voxels enhance local field quality
at a modest computational cost. Our contribution comprises the generalization towards composite
boxels (ComBo) that are nonequiaxed, a feature that can pay off for materials with a preferred direction.
A novel image-based normal detection algorithm is devised which improves the accuracy by around
30\% against the orientation cf. [Kabel,M. et al. (2015) ]. Further, the use of ComBo for finite strain
simulations is studied in detail. An efficient implementation is proposed, and an essential back-projection
algorithm preventing physically inadmissible states is developed, which improves robustness.
Various examples show the efficiency of ComBo and the proposed algorithmic enhancements for nonlinear
mechanical problems. The general usability is emphasized by examining and comparing the performance
of myriad Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based solvers including a detailed description of the new
Doubly-Fine Material Grid (DFMG). All of the employed schemes benefit from the ComBo discretization.

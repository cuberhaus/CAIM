Vehicular communications are the key enabler of traffic reduction and road safety improvement
referred to as cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) communications. Considering the numerous
transmitting entities in next generation cellular networks, most existing resource allocation
algorithms are impractical or non-effective to ensure reliable C-V2X communications which lead
to safe intelligent transportation systems. We study a centralized framework to develop a low-complexity,
scalable, and practical resource allocation scheme for dense C-V2X communications. The NP-hard
sum-rate maximization resource allocation problem is formulated as a mixed-integer non-linear
non-convex optimization problem considering both cellular vehicular links (CVLs) and non-cellular
VLs (NCVLs) quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. By assuming that multiple NCVLs can simultaneously
reuse a single cellular link (CL), we propose two low-complexity sub-optimal matching-based algorithms
in four steps. The first two steps provide a channel gain-based CVL priority and CL assignment followed
by an innovative scalable min-max channel-gain-based CVL-NCVL matching. We propose an analytically
proven closed-form fast feasibility check theorem as the third step. The objective function is
transformed into a difference of convex (DC) form and the power allocation problem is solved optimally
using majorization-minimization (MaMi) method and interior point methods as the last step. Numerical
results verify that our schemes are scalable and effective for dense C-V2X communications. The
low-complexity and practicality of the proposed schemes for dense cellular networks is also shown.
Furthermore, it is shown that the proposed schemes outperform other methods up to %6 in terms of overall
sum-rate in dense scenarios and have a near optimal performance.

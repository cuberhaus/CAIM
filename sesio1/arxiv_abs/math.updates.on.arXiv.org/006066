Boundary feedback stabilization of a critical, nonlinear Jordan--Moore--Gibson--Thompson
(JMGT) equation is considered. JMGT arises in modeling of acoustic waves involved in medical/engineering
treatments like lithotripsy, thermotherapy, sonochemistry, or any other procedures using High
Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU). It is a well-established and recently widely studied model
for nonlinear acoustics (NLA): a third--order (in time) semilinear Partial Differential Equation
(PDE) with the distinctive feature of predicting the propagation of ultrasound waves at \textit{finite}
speed due to heat phenomenon know as \textit{second sound} which leads to the hyperbolic character
of heat propagation. In practice, the JMGT dynamics is largely used for modeling the evolution of
the acoustic velocity and, most importantly, the acoustic pressure as sound waves propagate through
certain media. %Due to its sensitivity to different media, such model (or similar) is often used
for medical/engineering treatments such as lithotripsy, thermotherapy, sonochemistry, or any
other procedures using High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU). In this work, \emph{critical}
refers to (usual) case where media--damping effects are non--existent or non--measurable and
therefore cannot be relied upon for stabilization purposes. In this paper the issue of boundary
stabilizability of originally unstable (JMGT) equation is resolved. Motivated by modeling aspects
in HIFU technology, boundary feedback is supported only on a portion of the boundary, while the remaining
part of the boundary is left free (available to control actions) . Since the boundary conditions
imposed on the "free" part of the boundary fail to satisfy Lopatinski condition (unlike Dirichlet
boundary conditions), the analysis of uniform stabilization from the boundary becomes very subtle
and requires careful geometric considerations.

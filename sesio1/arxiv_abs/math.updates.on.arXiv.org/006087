The Mertens function, $M(x) := \sum_{n \leq x} \mu(n)$, is defined as the summatory function of the
classical M\"obius function for $x \geq 1$. The inverse function $g^{-1}(n) := (\omega+1)^{-1}(n)$
taken with respect to Dirichlet convolution is defined in terms of the strongly additive function
$\omega(n)$ that counts the number of distinct prime factors of the integers $n \geq 2$ without multiplicity.
For large $x$ and $n \leq x$, we associate a natural combinatorial significance to the magnitude
of the distinct values of $|g^{-1}(n)|$ that depends directly on the exponent patterns in the prime
factorizations of the integers $2 \leq n \leq x$ viewed as multisets. That is, the distinct values
of the unsigned inverse function are repeated at any $n \geq 2$ with the precise additive configuration
of the exponents in the prime factorization of $n$ regardless of the multiplicative products of
primes that serve as the placeholders for the exponents of the distinct prime factors. We conjecture
two forms of deterministic Erd\H{o}s-Kac theorem analogs that characterize the distributions
of each of the unsigned sequences $$C_{\Omega}(n) := (\Omega(n))! \times \prod_{p^{\alpha}||n}
\frac{1}{\alpha!}, n \geq 2,$$ and $|g^{-1}(n)|$ over $n \leq x$ as $x \rightarrow \infty$. Discrete
convolutions of the partial sums $$G^{-1}(x) := \sum_{n \leq x} \lambda(n) |g^{-1}(n)|,$$ with
the prime counting function $\pi(x)$ determine exact formulas and new characterizations of the
asymptotic behavior of $M(x)$. In this way, we prove another characteristic link of the Mertens
function to the distribution of the partial sums $L(x) := \sum_{n \leq x} \lambda(n)$ and connect
these two classical summatory functions with explicit non-centrally normal probability distributions
at large $x$.

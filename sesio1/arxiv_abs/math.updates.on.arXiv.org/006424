Antenna arrays have a long history of more than 100 years and have evolved closely with the development
of electronic and information technologies, playing an indispensable role in wireless communications
and radar. With the rapid development of electronic and information technologies, the demand for
all-time, all-domain, and full-space network services has exploded, and new communication requirements
have been put forward on various space/air/ground platforms. To meet the ever increasing requirements
of the future sixth generation (6G) wireless communications, such as high capacity, wide coverage,
low latency, and strong robustness, it is promising to employ different types of antenna arrays
with various beamforming technologies in space/air/ground communication networks, bringing
in advantages such as considerable antenna gains, multiplexing gains, and diversity gains. However,
enabling antenna array for space/air/ground communication networks poses specific, distinctive
and tricky challenges, which has aroused extensive research attention. This paper aims to overview
the field of antenna array enabled space/air/ground communications and networking. The technical
potentials and challenges of antenna array enabled space/air/ground communications and networking
are presented first. Subsequently, the antenna array structures and designs are discussed. We
then discuss various emerging technologies facilitated by antenna arrays to meet the new communication
requirements of space/air/ground communication systems. Enabled by these emerging technologies,
the distinct characteristics, challenges, and solutions for space communications, airborne
communications, and ground communications are reviewed. Finally, we present promising directions
for future research in antenna array enabled space/air/ground communications and networking.

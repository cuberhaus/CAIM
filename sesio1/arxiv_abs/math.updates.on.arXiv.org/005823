We construct homomorphic images of $su(n,n)^{\mathbb C}$ in Weyl Algebras ${\mathcal H}_{2nr}$.
More precisely, and using the Bernstein filtration of ${\mathcal H}_{2nr}$, $su(n,n)^{\mathbb
C}$ is mapped into degree $2$ elements with the negative non-compact root spaces being mapped into
second order creation operators. Using the Fock representation of ${\mathcal H}_{2nr}$, these
homomorphisms give all unitary highest weight representations of $su(n,n)^{\mathbb C}$ thus
reconstructing the Kashiwara--Vergne List for the Segal--Shale--Weil representation. Just
as in the derivation of the their list, we construct a representation of $u(r)$ in the Fock space commuting
with $su(n,n)^{\mathbb C}$, and this gives the multiplicities. The construction also gives an
easy proof that the ideals of $(r+1)\times (r+1)$ minors are prime ($r\leq n-1)$. The quotients
of all polynomials by such ideals carry the more singular of the representations. As a consequence,
these representations can be realized in spaces of solutions to Maxwell type equations. We actually
go one step further and determine exactly which representations from our list are missing some ${\mathfrak
k}^{\mathbb C}$-types, thereby revealing exactly which covariant differential operators have
unitary null spaces. We prove the analogous results for ${\mathcal U}_q(su(n,n)^{\mathbb C})$.
The Weyl Algebras are replaced by the Hayashi--Weyl Algebras ${\mathcal H}{\mathcal W}_{2nr}$
and the Fock space by a $q$-Fock space. Further, determinants are replaced by $q$-determinants,
and a commuting representation of ${\mathcal U}_q(u(r))$ in the $q$-Fock space is constructed.
For this purpose a Drinfeld Double is used. We mention one difference: The quantized negative non-compact
root spaces, while still of degree 2, are no longer given entirely by second order creation operators.

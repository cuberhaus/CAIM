Visible light communication (VLC) is envisioned as a core component of future wireless communication
networks due to, among others, the huge unlicensed bandwidth it offers and the fact that it does not
cause any interference to existing radio frequency (RF) communication systems. Most research
on RF and VLC coexistence has focused on hybrid designs where data transmission to any user could
originate from either an RF or a VLC access point (AP). However, hybrid RF/VLC systems fail to exploit
the distinct transmission characteristics of RF and VLC systems to fully reap the benefits they
can offer. Aggregated RF/VLC systems, in which any user can be served simultaneously by both RF and
VLC APs, have recently emerged as a more promising and robust design for the coexistence of RF and
VLC systems. To this end, this paper, for the first time, investigates AP assignment, subchannel
allocation (SA), and transmit power allocation (PA) to optimize the energy efficiency (EE) of aggregated
RF/VLC systems while considering the effects of interference and VLC line-of-sight link blockages.
A novel and challenging EE optimization problem is formulated for which an efficient joint solution
based on alternating optimization is developed. More particularly, an energy-efficient AP assignment
algorithm based on matching theory is proposed. Then, a low-complexity SA scheme that allocates
subchannels to users based on their channel conditions is developed. Finally, an effective PA algorithm
is presented by utilizing the quadratic transform approach and a multi-objective optimization
framework. Extensive simulation results reveal that: 1) the proposed joint AP assignment, SA,
and PA solution obtains significant EE, sum-rate, and outage performance gains with low complexity,
and 2) the aggregated RF/VLC system provides considerable performance improvement compared to
hybrid RF/VLC systems.

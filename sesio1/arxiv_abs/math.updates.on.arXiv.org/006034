We consider the capacitated three-level lot-sizing and replenishment problem with a distribution
structure (3LSPD-C), recently proposed in the literature. In 3LSPD-C, a single production plant
delivers items to the warehouses from where they are distributed to their corresponding retailers.
There is a capacity on the total amount the plant can produce in each period, whereas there are no capacities
on transportation. The goal of the problem consists in determining an integrated three-echelon
production and distribution plan minimizing the total cost, which is composed of fixed costs for
production and transportation setups as well as variable inventory holding costs. Additionally,
we consider a generalization of the problem which also establishes storage capacities on the warehouses
and/or retailers, given the importance of such characteristics in practical industrial and commercial
environments. Such extension is denoted generalized capacitated three-level lot-sizing and
replenishment problem with a distribution structure (G3LSPD-C). We propose a hybrid mixed integer
programming (MIP) heuristic consisting of a relax-and-fix approach to generate initial feasible
solutions and a fix-and-optimize improvement procedure grounded on varying-size neighborhoods
to obtain high-quality solutions. Computational experiments are performed to analyze the potential
cost reductions achieved using the new hybrid heuristic when compared with a state-of-the-art
MIP formulation. The results show that the proposed hybrid heuristic can match or improve the solution
quality obtained by the MIP formulation for the majority of the 3LSPD-C instances. Additionally,
such superior behavior remains valid when the approaches are applied to the more general G3LSPD-C.
Furthermore, we investigate the economic impacts of the storage capacities and how they affect
the performance of our newly proposed hybrid heuristic.

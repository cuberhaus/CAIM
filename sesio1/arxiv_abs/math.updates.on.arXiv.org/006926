Let $G$ be a classical group defined over a local field $F$ of characteristic zero. For any irreducible
admissible representation $\pi$ of $G(F)$, which is of Casselman-Wallach type if $F$ is archimedean,
if $\pi$ has a generic local $L$-parameter, we define the arithmetic wavefront set ${\rm WF_{ari}}(\pi)$
of $\pi$, which is a subset of $F$-rational nilpotent orbits of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}(F)$
of $G(F)$, by the arithmetic structures of the enhanced $L$-parameter $(\varphi,\chi)$ of $\pi$.
Those arithmetic structures are found by using our consecutive descents of enhanced $L$-parameters
based on the rationality of the local Langlands correspondence and the local Gan-Gross-Prasad
conjecture. The basic structures of ${\rm WF_{ari}}(\pi)^{\rm max}$ are described by a few conjectures.
Conjecture 5.11 asserts that ${\rm WF_{ari}}(\pi)^{\rm max}$ yields a unique $F$-stable nilpotent
orbit $\mathcal{O}^{\rm st}(\varphi,\chi)$ in $\mathfrak{g}(F)$ and the set ${\rm WF_{ari}}(\pi)^{\rm
max}$ can be completely determined by the consecutive descents of enhanced $L$-parameters. Theorem
7.14 and Theorem 9.2 confirm much refined $F$-rational structure on ${\rm WF_{ari}}(\pi)^{\rm
max}$ than what Conjecture 5.11 says when $F$ is archimedean. Conjecture 5.18 enriches the theory
of wavefront sets for representations of $G(F)$ in general, namely, \[ {\rm WF_{wm}}(\pi)^{\rm
max}={\rm WF_{ari}}(\pi)^{\rm max}={\rm WF_{tr}}(\pi)^{\rm max} \] when $\pi$ has a generic
local $L$-parameter, where the algebraic wavefront set ${\rm WF_{wm}}(\pi)$ is defined by C. Moeglin
and J.-L. Waldspurger in [MW87] using generalized Whittaker models, and the analytic wavefront
set ${\rm WF_{tr}}(\pi)$ is defined by R. Howe in [H81] using distribution characters, and also
by [H74, HC78, BV80]. Conjecture 5.18 is verified for families of interesting cases in this paper.

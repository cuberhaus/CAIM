We report a detailed analysis on the emergence of bursting in a recently developed neural mass model
that takes short-term synaptic plasticity into account. The one being used here is particularly
important, as it represents an exact meanfield limit of synaptically coupled quadratic integrate
& fire neurons, a canonical model for type I excitability. In absence of synaptic dynamics, a periodic
external current with a slow frequency {\epsilon} can lead to burst-like dynamics. The firing patterns
can be understood using techniques of singular perturbation theory, specifically slow-fast dissection.
In the model with synaptic dynamics the separation of timescales leads to a variety of slow-fast
phenomena and their role for bursting is rendered inordinately more intricate. Canards are one
of the main slow-fast elements on the route to bursting. They describe trajectories evolving nearby
otherwise repelling locally invariant sets of the system and are found in the transition region
from subthreshold dynamics to bursting. For values of the timescale separation nearby the singular
limit {\epsilon} = 0, we report peculiar jump-on canards, which block a continuous transition to
bursting. In the biologically more plausible regime of {\epsilon} this transition becomes continuous
and bursts emerge via consecutive spike-adding transitions. The onset of bursting is of complex
nature and involves mixed-type like torus canards, which form the very first spikes of the burst
and revolve nearby fast-subsystem repelling limit cycles. We provide numerical evidence for the
same mechanisms to be responsible for the emergence of bursting in the quadratic integrate & fire
network with plastic synapses. The main conclusions apply for the network, owing to the exactness
of the meanfield limit.

Nonlinear differential equations model diverse phenomena but are notoriously difficult to solve.
While there has been extensive previous work on efficient quantum algorithms for linear differential
equations, the linearity of quantum mechanics has limited analogous progress for the nonlinear
case. Despite this obstacle, we develop a quantum algorithm for dissipative quadratic $n$-dimensional
ordinary differential equations. Assuming $R < 1$, where $R$ is a parameter characterizing the
ratio of the nonlinearity and forcing to the linear dissipation, this algorithm has complexity
$T^2 q~\mathrm{poly}(\log T, \log n, \log 1/\epsilon)/\epsilon$, where $T$ is the evolution time,
$\epsilon$ is the allowed error, and $q$ measures decay of the solution. This is an exponential improvement
over the best previous quantum algorithms, whose complexity is exponential in $T$. While exponential
decay precludes efficiency, driven equations can avoid this issue despite the presence of dissipation.
Our algorithm uses the method of Carleman linearization, for which we give a novel convergence theorem.
This method maps a system of nonlinear differential equations to an infinite-dimensional system
of linear differential equations, which we discretize, truncate, and solve using the forward Euler
method and the quantum linear system algorithm. We also provide a lower bound on the worst-case complexity
of quantum algorithms for general quadratic differential equations, showing that the problem
is intractable for $R \ge \sqrt{2}$. Finally, we discuss potential applications, showing that
the $R < 1$ condition can be satisfied in realistic epidemiological models and giving numerical
evidence that the method may describe a model of fluid dynamics even for larger values of $R$.

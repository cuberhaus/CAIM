Global spectral analysis (GSA) is used as a tool to test the accuracy of numerical methods with the
help of canonical problems of convection and convection-diffusion equation which admit exact
solutions. Similarly, events in turbulent flows computed by direct numerical simulation (DNS)
are often calibrated with theoretical results of homogeneous isotropic turbulence due to Kolmogorov,
as given in Turbulence -U. Frisch, Cambridge Univ. Press, UK (1995). However, numerical methods
for the simulation of this problem are not calibrated, as by using GSA of convection and/or convection-diffusion
equation. This is with the exception in "A critical assessment of simulations for transitional
and turbulence flows-Sengupta, T.K., In Proc. of IUTAM Symp. on Advances in Computation, Modeling
and Control of Transitional and Turbulent Flows, pp 491-532, World Sci. Publ. Co. Pte. Ltd., Singapore
(2016)", where such a calibration has been advocated with the help of convection equation. For turbulent
flows, an extreme event is characterized by the presence of length scales smaller than the Kolmogorov
length scale, a heuristic limit for the largest wavenumber present without being converted to heat.
With growing computer power, recently many simulations have been reported using a pseudo-spectral
method, with spatial discretization performed in Fourier spectral space and a two-stage, Runge-Kutta
(RK2) method for time discretization. But no analyses are reported to ensure high accuracy of such
simulations. Here, an analysis is reported for few multi-stage Runge-Kutta methods in the Fourier
spectral framework for convection and convection-diffusion equations. We identify the major
source of error for the RK2-Fourier spectral method using GSA and also show how to avoid this error
and specify numerical parameters for achieving highest accuracy possible to capture extreme events
in turbulent flows.

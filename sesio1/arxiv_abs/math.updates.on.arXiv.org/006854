Predicting the adaptation of populations to a changing environment is crucial to assess the impact
of human activities on biodiversity. Many theoretical studies have tackled this issue by modeling
the evolution of quantitative traits subject to stabilizing selection around an optimum phenotype,
whose value is shifted continuously through time. In this context, the population fate results
from the equilibrium distribution of the trait, relative to the moving optimum. Such a distribution
may vary with the shape of selection, the system of reproduction, the number of loci, the mutation
kernel or their interactions. Here, we develop a methodology that provides quantitative measures
of population maladaptation and potential of survival directly from the entire profile of the phenotypic
distribution, without any a priori on its shape.We investigate two different models of reproduction
(asexual and infinitesimal sexual models of inheritance), with general forms of selection.In
particular, we recover that fitness functions such that selection weakens away from the optimum
lead to evolutionary tipping points, with an abrupt collapse of the population when the speed of
environmental change is too high. Our unified framework furthermore allows highlighting the underlying
mechanisms that lead to this phenomenon. More generally, it allows discussing similarities and
discrepancies between the two reproduction models, the latter being ultimately explained by different
constraints on the evolution of the phenotypic variance. We demonstrate that the mean fitness in
the population crucially depends on the shape of the selection function in the sexual infinitesimal
model, in contrast with the asexual model.In the asexual model, we also investigate the effect of
the mutation kernel and we show that kernels with higher kurtosis tend to reduce maladaptation and
improve fitness, especially in fast changing environments.

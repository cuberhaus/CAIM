In $d$ dimensions, approximating an arbitrary function oscillating with frequency $\lesssim
k$ requires $\sim k^d$ degrees of freedom. A numerical method for solving the Helmholtz equation
(with wavenumber $k$ and in $d$ dimensions) suffers from the pollution effect if, as $k\to\infty$,
the total number of degrees of freedom needed to maintain accuracy grows faster than this natural
threshold (i.e., faster than $k^d$ for domain-based formulations, such as finite element methods,
and $k^{d-1}$ for boundary-based formulations, such as boundary element methods). It is well known
that the $h$-version of the finite element method (FEM) (where accuracy is increased by decreasing
the meshwidth $h$ and keeping the polynomial degree $p$ fixed) suffers from the pollution effect,
and research over the last $\sim$ 30 years has resulted in a near-complete rigorous understanding
of how quickly the number of degrees of freedom must grow with $k$ (and how this depends on both $p$
and properties of the scatterer). In contrast to the $h$-FEM, at least empirically, the $h$-version
of the boundary element method (BEM) does $\textit{not}$ suffer from the pollution effect (recall
that in the boundary element method the scattering problem is reformulated as an integral equation
on the boundary of the scatterer, with this integral equation then solved numerically using a finite-element-type
approximation space). However, the current best results in the literature on how quickly the number
of degrees of freedom for the $h$-BEM must grow with $k$ fall short of proving this. In this paper,
we prove that the $h$-version of the Galerkin method applied to the standard second-kind boundary
integral equations for solving the Helmholtz exterior Dirichlet problem does not suffer from the
pollution effect when the obstacle is nontrapping (i.e., does not trap geometric-optic rays).

We consider an infinite, planar, Delaunay graph which is obtained by locally deforming the embedding
of a general, isoradial graph, w.r.t. a real deformation parameter $\epsilon$. This entails a careful
analysis of edge-flips induced by the deformation and the Delaunay constraints. Using Kenyon's
exact and asymptotic results for the Green's function on an isoradial graph, we calculate the leading
asymptotics of the first and second order terms in the perturbative expansion of the log-determinant
of the Beltrami-Laplace operator $\Delta(\epsilon)$, the David-Eynard K\"ahler operator $\mathcal{D}(\epsilon)$,
and the conformal Laplacian $\underline{\Delta}(\epsilon)$ on the deformed graph. We show that
the scaling limits of the second order {\it bi-local} term for both the Beltrami-Laplace and David-Eynard
operators exist and coincide, with a value independent of the choice of initial isoradial graph.
Our results allow to define a discrete analogue of the stress energy tensor for each of the three operators.
Furthermore we can identify a central charge ($c$) in the case of both the Beltrami-Laplace and David-Eynard
operators. While the scaling limit is consistent with the stress-energy tensor and value of the
central charge for the Gaussian free field (GFF), the discrete central charge value of $c=-2$ for
the David-Eynard operator is, however, at odds with the value of $c=-26$ expected by Polyakov's
theory of 2D quantum gravity; moreover there are problems with convergence of the scaling limit
of the discrete stress energy tensor for the David-Eynard operator. The bi-local term for the conformal
Laplacian involves anomalous terms corresponding to the creation of discrete {\it curvature dipoles}
in the deformed Delaunay graph; we examine the difficulties in defining a convergent scaling limit
in this case. Connections with some discrete statistical models at criticality are explored.

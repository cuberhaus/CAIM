Since spectrum below 6 GHz bands does not suffice to meet the high bandwidth requirements of 5G use
cases, 5G networks expand their operation to mmWave bands with multi-GHz of available spectrum.
However, operation at mmWave bands raises two challenges: high penetration loss and susceptibility
to objects blocking the line-of-sight. As a remedy, transmitters point their antennas to their
receivers using beamforming to contain the signal in the direction of the intended receiver. To
avoid loss of connectivity due to blockers or other factors such as rain, users can be connected to
multiple base stations (BS). While these two features, beamforming and multi-connectivity, can
mitigate the challenges of mmWave bands, it is not trivial to find the optimal user association which
can maintain the minimum rate requirements of the users. In this paper, we first formulate a throughput-maximizing
user association scheme considering beamforming and multi-connectivity, and investigate the
behavior of the optimal scheme to devise a simple, yet efficient heuristic that does not require
global network information. Our proposal, dubbed beam-align, which only uses local information
at a BS, performs close to the optimal in terms of per-user capacity and user satisfaction levels
and has only polynomial complexity. Our numerical analysis shows that beam-align outperforms
the frequently-used association schemes based on SNR. To investigate the performance of beam-align
also under various challenging settings, we consider three scenarios: presence of blockers, different
levels of rain intensity, and presence of clustered users. From simulations, we observe that beam-align
is robust against different conditions, as it maintains a stable performance under the studied
scenarios.

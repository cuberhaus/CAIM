In this paper, we develop a unified dynamic intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) beamforming framework
to boost the sum computation rate of an IRS-aided mobile edge computing (MEC) system, where each
device follows a binary offloading policy. Specifically, the task of each device has to be either
executed locally or offloaded to MEC servers as a whole with the aid of given number of IRS beamforming
vectors available. By flexibly controlling the number of IRS reconfiguration times, the system
can achieve a balance between the performance and associated signalling overhead. We aim to maximize
the sum computation rate by jointly optimizing the computational mode selection for each device,
offloading time allocation, and IRS beamforming vectors across time. Since the resulting optimization
problem is non-convex and NP-hard, there are generally no standard methods to solve it optimally.
To tackle this problem, we first propose a penalty-based successive convex approximation algorithm,
where all the associated variables in the inner-layer iterations are optimized simultaneously
and the obtained solution is guaranteed to be locally optimal. Then, we further derive the offloading
activation condition for each device by deeply exploiting the intrinsic structure of the original
optimization problem. According to the offloading activation condition, a low-complexity algorithm
based on the successive refinement method is proposed to obtain high-quality solutions, which
is more appealing for practical systems with a large number of devices and IRS elements. Moreover,
the optimal condition for the proposed low-complexity algorithm is revealed. Numerical results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms and also unveil the fundamental performance-cost
tradeoff of the proposed dynamic IRS beamforming framework.

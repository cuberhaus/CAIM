The rational billiards (RB) are classically pseudointegrable, i.e. their trajectories in the
phase space lie on multi-tori. Each such a multi-torus can be unfolded into elementary polygon pattern
(EPP). A rational billiards Riemann surface (RBRS) corresponding to each RB is then an infinite
mosaic made by a periodic distribution of EPP. Periods of RBRS are directly related to periodic orbits
of RB. It is shown that any stationary solutions (SS) to the Schr\"odinger equation (SE) in RB can
be extended on the whole RBRS. The extended stationary wave functions (ESS) are then periodic on
RBRS with its periods. Conversely, for each system of boundary conditions (i.e. the Dirichlet or
the the Neumann ones or their mixture) consistent with EPP one can find so called stationary pre-solutions
(SPS) of the Schr\"odinger equation defined on RBRS and respecting its periodic structure together
with their energy spectra. Using SPS one can easily construct SS of RB for most boundary conditions
on it by a trivial algebra over SPS. It proves therefore that the energy spectra defined by the boundary
conditions for SS corresponding to each RB are totally determined by $2g$ independent periods of
RBRS being homogeneous functions of these periods. RBRS can be constructed exclusively due to the
rationality of the polygon billiards considered. Therefore the approach developed in the present
paper can be seen as a new way in obtaining SS to SE in RB. SPS can be constructed explicitly for a class
of RB which EPP can be decomposed into a set of periodic orbit channel (POC) parallel to each other
(POCDRB). For such a class of RB the respective RBRS can be built as a standard multi-sheeted Riemann
surface with a periodic structure. For POCDRB a discussion of the existence of the superscar states
(SSS) can be done thoroughly.

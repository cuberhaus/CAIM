Orbital angular momentum (OAM) at radio frequency (RF) provides a novel approach of multiplexing
a set of orthogonal modes on the same frequency channel to achieve high spectral efficiencies (SEs).
However, the existing research on OAM wireless communications is mainly focused on pointto-point
transmission in the line-of-sight (LoS) scenario. In this paper, we propose an overall scheme of
the downlink multi-user OAM (MU-OAM) wireless backhaul based on uniform circular arrays (UCAs)
for broadcasting networks, which can achieve the joint spatial division and coaxial multiplexing
(JSDCM). A salient feature of the proposed downlink MU-OAM wireless backhaul systems is that the
channel matrices are completely characterized by the position of each small base station (SBS),
independent of the numbers of subcarriers and antennas, which avoids estimating large channel
matrices required by the traditional downlink multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO)
wireless backhaul systems. Thereafter, we propose an OAM-based multiuser distance and angle of
arrival (AoA) estimation method, which is able to simultaneously estimate the positions of multiple
SBSs with a flexible number of training symbols. With the estimated distances and AoAs, a MU-OAM
preprocessing scheme is applied to eliminate the co-mode and inter-mode interferences in the downlink
MU-OAM channel. At last, the proposed methods are extended to the downlink MU-OAM-MIMO wireless
backhaul system equipped with uniform concentric circular arrays (UCCAs), for which much higher
spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) than traditional MU-MIMO systems can be achieved.
Both mathematical analysis and simulation results validate that the proposed scheme can effectively
eliminate both interferences of the practical downlink MU-OAM channel and approaches the performance
of the ideal MU-OAM channel.

Innovation in the physical layer of communication systems has traditionally been achieved by breaking
down the transceivers into sets of processing blocks, each optimized independently based on mathematical
models. Conversely, deep learning (DL)-based systems are able to handle increasingly complex
tasks for which no tractable models are available. This thesis aims at comparing different approaches
to unlock the full potential of DL in the physical layer. First, we describe a neural network (NN)-based
block strategy, where an NN is optimized to replace a block in a communication system. We apply this
strategy to introduce a multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) detector that builds
on top of an existing DL-based architecture. Second, we detail an end-to-end strategy, in which
the transmitter and receiver are modeled as an autoencoder. This approach is illustrated with the
design of waveforms that achieve high throughputs while satisfying peak-to-average power ratio
(PAPR) and adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR) constraints. Lastly, we propose a hybrid strategy,
where multiple DL components are inserted into a traditional architecture but are trained to optimize
the end-to-end performance. To demonstrate its benefits, we propose a DL-enhanced MU-MIMO receiver
that both enable lower bit error rates (BERs) compared to a conventional receiver and remains scalable
to any number of users. Each approach has its own strengths and shortcomings. While the first one
is the easiest to implement, its individual block optimization does not ensure the overall system
optimality. On the other hand, systems designed with the second approach are computationally complex
but allow for new opportunities such as pilotless transmissions. Finally, the combined flexibility
and end-to-end performance gains of the third approach motivate its use for short-term practical
implementations.

Dyadic data is often encountered when quantities of interest are associated with the edges of a network.
As such it plays an important role in statistics, econometrics and many other data science disciplines.
We consider the problem of uniformly estimating a dyadic Lebesgue density function, focusing on
nonparametric kernel-based estimators which take the form of U-process-like dyadic empirical
processes. We provide uniform point estimation and distributional results for the dyadic kernel
density estimator, giving valid and feasible procedures for robust uniform inference. Our main
contributions include the minimax-optimal uniform convergence rate of the dyadic kernel density
estimator, along with strong approximation results for the associated standardized $t$-process.
A consistent variance estimator is introduced in order to obtain analogous results for the Studentized
$t$-process, enabling the construction of provably valid and feasible uniform confidence bands
for the unknown density function. A crucial feature of U-process-like dyadic empirical processes
is that they may be "degenerate" at some or possibly all points in the support of the data, a property
making our uniform analysis somewhat delicate. Nonetheless we show formally that our proposed
methods for uniform inference remain robust to the potential presence of such unknown degenerate
points. For the purpose of implementation, we discuss uniform inference procedures based on positive
semi-definite covariance estimators, mean squared error optimal bandwidth selectors and robust
bias-correction methods. We illustrate the empirical finite-sample performance of our robust
inference methods in a simulation study. Our technical results concerning strong approximations
and maximal inequalities are of potential independent interest.

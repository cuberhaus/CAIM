The albatross optimized flight maneuver -- known as Dynamic Soaring (DS) -- is nothing but wonder
of physics, biology, and engineering. In an ideal DS cycle, this fascinating bird can travel in the
desired flight direction, for free, by harvesting energy from the wind, and hence, it achieves a
neutral energy cycle. This phenomenon has triggered a momentous interest among aeronautical,
control and robotic engineering communities; if DS is mimicked, we have arrived at a new class of
UAVs that are very energy-efficient during part (or the full) duration of their flight. However,
the DS problem is highly nonlinear, under-actuated, and dependent on the wind profiles. This has
resulted in decades of DS control literature that, while making progress in addressing the control
problem, seem not to be aligned well with the nature of the DS phenomenon itself. The control works
associated with DS in the literature rely heavily on constrained optimal control algorithms, control
designs that require a mathematical expression of the objective function, and predefined wind
profile models. Clearly, a functioning controller for DS that allows meaningful bio-mimicry of
the albatross, needs to be autonomous, real-time, stable, and capable of tolerating the absence
of the expression of the objective function (similar to what the bird does). The qualifications
of such controller are the very same characteristics of ESC systems. In this paper, we show that ESC
systems existing in control literature for decades are a natural characterization of the DS problem.
We provide the DS problem setup, design, stability, and simulation results of the introduced ESC
systems. The results, supported by comparison with optimal control solvers, emphasize that the
DS phenomenon is a natural expression of ESC systems in nature and that DS can be performed autonomously
and in real-time with stability guarantees.

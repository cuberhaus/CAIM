The accurate and efficient evaluation of potentials with singular or weakly-singular kernels
is of great importance for the numerical solution of partial differential equations. When the integration
domain of the potential is irregular and is discretized by an unstructured mesh, the function spaces
of near field and self-interactions are non-compact, and, thus, their computations cannot be easily
accelerated. In this paper, we propose several novel and complementary techniques for accelerating
the evaluation of potentials over unstructured meshes. Firstly, we observe that the standard approximation
of the near field by a ball or a triangle often leads to an over-estimated near field. We rigorously
characterize the geometry of the near field, and show that this analysis can be used to reduce the
number of near field interaction computations dramatically. Secondly, as the near field can be
made arbitrarily small by increasing the order of the far field quadrature rule, the expensive near
field interaction computation can be efficiently offloaded onto the FMM-based far field interaction
computation, which leverages the computational efficiency of highly optimized parallel FMM libraries.
Finally, we observe that the usual arrangement in which the interpolation nodes are placed on the
same mesh over which the potential is integrated results in an artificially large number of near
field interaction calculations, since the discretization points tend to cluster near the boundaries
of mesh elements. We show that the use of a separate staggered mesh for interpolation effectively
reduces the cost of near field and self-interaction computations. Besides these contributions,
we present a robust and extensible framework for the evaluation and interpolation of 2-D volume
potentials over complicated geometries. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques with
several numerical experiments.

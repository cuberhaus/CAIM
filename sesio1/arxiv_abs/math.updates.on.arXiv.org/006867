We consider a class of discrete-time random walks with directed unit steps on the integer line. The
direction of the steps is reversed at the time instants of events in a discrete-time renewal process
and is maintained at uneventful time instants. This model represents a discrete-time semi-Markovian
generalization of the telegraph process. We derive exact formulae for the propagator using generating
functions. We prove that for geometrically distributed waiting times in the diffusive limit, this
walk converges to the classical telegraph process. We consider the large-time asymptotics of the
expected position: For waiting time densities with finite mean the walker remains in the average
localized close to the departure site whereas escapes for fat-tailed waiting-time densities (i.e.
densities with infinite mean) by a sublinear power-law. We explore anomalous diffusion features
by accounting for the `aging effect' as a hallmark of non-Markovianity where the discrete-time
version of the `aging renewal process' comes into play. By deriving pertinent distributions of
this process we obtain explicit formulae for the variance when the waiting-times are Sibuya-distributed.
In this case and generally for fat-tailed waiting time PDFs emerges a $t^2$-ballistic superdiffusive
scaling in the large time limit. In contrast if the waiting time PDF between the step reversals is
light-tailed (`narrow' with finite mean and variance) the walk exhibits normal diffusion and for
`broad' waiting time PDFs (with finite mean and infinite variance) superdiffusive large time scaling.
We also consider time-changed versions where the walk is subordinated to a continuous-time point
process such as the time-fractional Poisson process. This defines a new class of biased continuous-time
random walks exhibiting several regimes of anomalous diffusion.

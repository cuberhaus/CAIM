This paper studies a sequential task offloading problem for a multiuser mobile edge computing (MEC)
system. We consider a dynamic optimization approach, which embraces wireless channel fluctuations
and random deep neural network (DNN) task arrivals over an infinite horizon. Specifically, we introduce
a local CPU workload queue (WD-QSI) and an MEC server workload queue (MEC-QSI) to model the dynamic
workload of DNN tasks at each WD and the MEC server, respectively. The transmit power and the partitioning
of the local DNN task at each WD are dynamically determined based on the instantaneous channel conditions
(to capture the transmission opportunities) and the instantaneous WD-QSI and MEC-QSI (to capture
the dynamic urgency of the tasks) to minimize the average latency of the DNN tasks. The joint optimization
can be formulated as an ergodic Markov decision process (MDP), in which the optimality condition
is characterized by a centralized Bellman equation. However, the brute force solution of the MDP
is not viable due to the curse of dimensionality as well as the requirement for knowledge of the global
state information. To overcome these issues, we first decompose the MDP into multiple lower dimensional
sub-MDPs, each of which can be associated with a WD or the MEC server. Next, we further develop a parametric
online Q-learning algorithm, so that each sub-MDP is solved locally at its associated WD or the MEC
server. The proposed solution is completely decentralized in the sense that the transmit power
for sequential offloading and the DNN task partitioning can be determined based on the local channel
state information (CSI) and the local WD-QSI at the WD only. Additionally, no prior knowledge of
the distribution of the DNN task arrivals or the channel statistics will be needed for the MEC server.

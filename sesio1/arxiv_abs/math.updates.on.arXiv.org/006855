In this paper, we investigate the robust resource allocation design for secure communication in
an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system. A multi-antenna dual-functional radar-communication
(DFRC) base station (BS) serves multiple single-antenna legitimate users and senses for targets
simultaneously, where already identified targets are treated as potential single-antenna eavesdroppers.
The DFRC BS scans a sector with a sequence of dedicated beams, and the ISAC system takes a snapshot
of the environment during the transmission of each beam. Based on the sensing information, the DFRC
BS can acquire the channel state information (CSI) of the potential eavesdroppers. Different from
existing works that focused on the resource allocation design for a single snapshot, in this paper,
we propose a novel optimization framework that jointly optimizes the communication and sensing
resources over a sequence of snapshots with adjustable durations. To this end, we jointly optimize
the duration of each snapshot, the beamforming vector, and the covariance matrix of the AN for maximization
of the system sum secrecy rate over a sequence of snapshots while guaranteeing a minimum required
average achievable rate and a maximum information leakage constraint for each legitimate user.
The resource allocation algorithm design is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem,
where we account for the imperfect CSI of both the legitimate users and the potential eavesdroppers.
To make the problem tractable, we derive a bound for the uncertainty region of the potential eavesdroppers'
small-scale fading based on a safe approximation, which facilitates the development of a block
coordinate descent-based iterative algorithm for obtaining an efficient suboptimal solution.

In Part I of this article we generalize the Linearized Doubling (LD) approach, introduced in earlier
work by NK, by proving a general theorem stating that if $\Sigma$ is a closed minimal surface embedded
in a Riemannian three-manifold $(N,g)$ and its Jacobi operator has trivial kernel, then given a
suitable family of LD solutions on $\Sigma$, a minimal surface $\breve{M}$ resembling two copies
of $\Sigma$ joined by many small catenoidal bridges can be constructed by PDE gluing methods. (An
LD solution $\varphi$ on $\Sigma$ is a singular solution of the Jacobi equation with logarithmic
singularities which in the construction are replaced by catenoidal bridges.) We also determine
the first nontrivial term in the expansion for the area $|\breve{M}|$ of $\breve{M}$ in terms of
the sizes of its catenoidal bridges and confirm that it is negative; $|\breve{M}| < 2 | \Sigma|$ follows.
We demonstrate the applicability of the theorem by first constructing new doublings of the Clifford
torus. We then construct in Part II families of LD solutions for general $(O(2)\times \mathbb{Z}_2)$-symmetric
backgrounds $(\Sigma, N,g)$. Combining with the theorem in Part I this implies the construction
of new minimal doublings for such backgrounds. (Constructions for general backgrounds remain
open.) This generalizes our earlier work for $\Sigma=\mathbb{S}^2 \subset N=\mathbb{S}^3$ providing
new constructions even in that case. In Part III, applying the results of Parts I and II -- appropriately
modified for the catenoid and the critical catenoid -- we construct new self-shrinkers of the mean
curvature flow via doubling the spherical self-shrinker or the Angenent torus, new complete embedded
minimal surfaces of finite total curvature in the Euclidean three-space via doubling the catenoid,
and new free boundary minimal surfaces in the unit ball via doubling the critical catenoid.

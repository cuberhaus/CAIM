A class of models that have been widely used are the exponential random graph (ERG) models, which
form a comprehensive family of models that include independent and dyadic edge models, Markov random
graphs, and many other graph distributions, in addition to allow the inclusion of covariates that
can lead to a better fit of the model. Another increasingly popular class of models in statistical
network analysis are stochastic block models (SBMs). They can be used for the purpose of grouping
nodes into communities or discovering and analyzing a latent structure of a network. The stochastic
block model is a generative model for random graphs that tends to produce graphs containing subsets
of nodes characterized by being connected to each other, called communities. Many researchers
from various areas have been using computational tools to adjust these models without, however,
analyzing their suitability for the data of the networks they are studying. The complexity involved
in the estimation process and in the goodness-of-fit verification methodologies for these models
can be factors that make the analysis of adequacy difficult and a possible discard of one model in
favor of another. And it is clear that the results obtained through an inappropriate model can lead
the researcher to very wrong conclusions about the phenomenon studied. The purpose of this work
is to present a simple methodology, based on Hypothesis Tests, to verify if there is a model specification
error for these two cases widely used in the literature to represent complex networks: the ERGM and
the SBM. We believe that this tool can be very useful for those who want to use these models in a more
careful way, verifying beforehand if the models are suitable for the data under study.

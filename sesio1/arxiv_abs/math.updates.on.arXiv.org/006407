A spectral Favard theorem for oscillatory bounded banded lower Hessenberg matrices is found. To
motivate the relevance of the oscillatory character, the spectral Favard theorem for bounded Jacobi
matrices is revisited and it is shown that after an adequate shift of the Jacobi matrix one gets an
oscillatory matrix. The large knowledge on the spectral and factorization properties of oscillatory
and totally nonnegative matrices leads to a spectral representation, a spectral Favard theorem
for these Hessenberg matrices, in terms of sequences of multiple orthogonal polynomials of types
II and I with respect to a set of positive Lebesgue-Stieltjes measures. Using bidiagonal factorization
when certain nonnegative continued fraction is positive, the regular oscillatory case. It is shown
that oscillatory Toeplitz banded Hessenberg matrices are regular. The spectral Favard theorem
for regular oscillatory bounded banded Hessenberg matrices is applied to Markov chains with tetradiagonal
transition matrices, i.e. beyond birth and death. In the finite case, the Karlin-McGregor spectral
representation is given, it is shown that the random walks are recurrent and explicit expressions
in terms of the orthogonal polynomials for the stationary distributions are given. Similar results
are obtained for the countable infinite Markov chain. Now the Markov chain is not necessarily recurrent,
it is characterized in terms of the first measure. Ergodicity of the Markov chain is discussed in
terms of the existence of a mass at $1$, which is an eigenvalue and corresponding right and left eigenvectors
are given. Finally, the fact that any oscillatory matrix is $LU$ factorizable in terms of bidiagonal
matrices leads to a stochastic factorization of the Markov transition matrix.

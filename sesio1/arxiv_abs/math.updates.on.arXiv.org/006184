The increasing availability of data presents an opportunity to calibrate unknown parameters which
appear in complex models of phenomena in the biomedical, physical and social sciences. However,
model complexity often leads to parameter-to-data maps which are expensive to evaluate and are
only available through noisy approximations. This paper is concerned with the use of interacting
particle systems for the solution of the resulting inverse problems for parameters. Of particular
interest is the case where the available forward model evaluations are subject to rapid fluctuations,
in parameter space, superimposed on the smoothly varying large scale parametric structure of interest.
{A motivating example from climate science is presented, and ensemble Kalman methods (which do
not use the derivative of the parameter-to-data map) are shown, empirically, to perform well. Multiscale
analysis is then used to analyze the behaviour of interacting particle system algorithms when rapid
fluctuations, which we refer to as noise, pollute the large scale parametric dependence of the parameter-to-data
map. Ensemble Kalman methods and Langevin-based methods} (the latter use the derivative of the
parameter-to-data map) are compared in this light. The ensemble Kalman methods are shown to behave
favourably in the presence of noise in the parameter-to-data map, whereas Langevin methods are
adversely affected. On the other hand, Langevin methods have the correct equilibrium distribution
in the setting of noise-free forward models, whilst ensemble Kalman methods only provide an uncontrolled
approximation, except in the linear case. Therefore a new class of algorithms, ensemble Gaussian
process samplers, which combine the benefits of both ensemble Kalman and Langevin methods, are
introduced and shown to perform favourably.

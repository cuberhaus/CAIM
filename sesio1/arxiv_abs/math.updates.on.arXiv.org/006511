The online semi-random graph process is a one-player game which starts with the empty graph on $n$
vertices. At every round, a player (called Builder) is presented with a vertex $v$ chosen uniformly
at random and constructs an edge of his choice that is incident to $v$. Inspired by recent advances,
we define a family of generalised online semi-random models. Then, we analyse a particular instance
that shares similar features with the original semi-random graph process and study the hitting
times of classical graph properties. More formally, in our model the process also starts with the
empty graph on $n$ vertices. At the beginning of each round, Builder is offered a spanning tree $T$
of $K_n$ chosen uniformly at random and independently from the previous rounds. He then chooses
an edge from $T$ and adds it (if not yet present) to the already constructed graph. We show that an "optimal"
strategy ensures whp that the hitting time of a graph with minimum degree $k = o(n^{1/2})$ is given
by $\tfrac{kn}{2} + \tfrac{(2\pi n)^{1/2}}{4} + o(n^{1/2})$ and we also provide an upper bound
of $\tfrac{kn}{2} + O(\max\{k, n^{1/2}\})$ when $k = o(n)$. While this yields a lower bound for creating
a perfect matching (resp. a Hamiltonian cycle), we describe strategies for Builder to attain these
properties whp in $\tfrac{n}{2} + O((\log n) n^{1/2})$ (resp. in $n + O((\log n) n^{1/2})$) rounds.
We also study the hitting time of an $H$-factor for a fixed graph $H$ possessing an additional tree-like
property, and show that it is given by the trivial deterministic lower bound up to lower order terms.
Another contribution of the work is to show that Builder may cover all $n$ vertices by copies of any
given graph $H$ in $d_{\min}(H) n + o(n)$ rounds whp, where $d_{\min}(H)$ is the minimum degree of
a vertex in $H$, which is a factor of 2 away from a corresponding deterministic lower bound.

The intention of this article is to illustrate the use of invariants coming from Floer-type theories,
as well as global topological methods, for practical purposes. Our intended audience is scientists
interested in orbits of Hamiltonian systems (e.g. the three-body problem). In this paper, we illustrate
the use of the GIT sequence introduced by the first and third authors, consisting of a sequence of
spaces and maps between them. Roughly speaking, closed orbits of an arbitrary Hamiltonian system
induce points in these spaces, and so their topology imposes restrictions on the existence of regular
orbit cylinders, as well as encodes information on all types of bifurcations. We also consider the
notion of the SFT-Euler characteristic, as the Euler characteristic of the local Floer homology
groups associated to a closed orbit of a Hamiltonian system. This number stays invariant before
and after a bifurcation, and can be computed in explicit terms from the eigenvalues of the reduced
monodromy matrix. This makes it useful for practical applications, e.g. for predicting the existence
of orbits for optimization and space mission design. For the case of symmetric orbits (i.e. preserved
by an antisymplectic involution), which may be thought both as open or closed strings, we further
consider the notion of the real Euler characteristic, as the Euler characteristic of the corresponding
Lagrangian Floer homology group. We illustrate the practical use of these invariants, together
with the GIT sequence, via numerical work based on the cell-mapping method, for the Jupiter-Europa
and the Saturn-Enceladus systems. These are currently systems of interest, as they fall in the agenda
of space agencies like NASA and ESA, as these icy moons are considered candidates for harbouring
conditions suitable for extraterrestrial life.

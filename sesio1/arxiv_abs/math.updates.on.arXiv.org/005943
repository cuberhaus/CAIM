In this paper, we explore the connection between secret key agreement and secure omniscience within
the setting of the multiterminal source model with a wiretapper who has side information. While
the secret key agreement problem considers the generation of a maximum-rate secret key through
public discussion, the secure omniscience problem is concerned with communication protocols
for omniscience that minimize the rate of information leakage to the wiretapper. The starting point
of our work is a lower bound on the minimum leakage rate for omniscience, $R_{\mathop{\mathrm{L}}}$,
in terms of the wiretap secret key capacity, $C_{\mathop{\mathrm{W}}}$. Our interest is in identifying
broad classes of sources for which this lower bound is met with equality, in which case we say that
there is a duality between secure omniscience and secret key agreement. We show that this duality
holds in the case of certain finite linear source (FLS) models, such as two-terminal FLS models and
pairwise independent network models on trees with a linear wiretapper. Duality also holds for any
FLS model in which $C_{\mathop{\mathrm{W}}}$ is achieved by a perfect linear secret key agreement
scheme. We conjecture that the duality in fact holds unconditionally for any FLS model. On the negative
side, we give an example of a (non-FLS) source model for which duality does not hold if we limit ourselves
to communication-for-omniscience protocols with at most two (interactive) communications.
Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of our lower bound on $R_{\mathop{\mathrm{L}}}$ by using
it to derive equivalent conditions for the positivity of $C_{\mathop{\mathrm{W}}}$ in the multiterminal
model. This extends a recent result of Gohari, G\"{u}nl\"{u} and Kramer (2020) obtained for the
two-user setting.

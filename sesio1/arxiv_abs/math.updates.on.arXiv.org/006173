We study edge-labelings of the complete bidirected graph $\overset{\tiny\leftrightarrow}{K}_n$
with functions from the set $[d] = \{1, \dots, d\}$ to itself. We call a cycle in $\overset{\tiny\leftrightarrow}{K}_n$
a fixed-point cycle if composing the labels of its edges results in a map that has a fixed point, and
we say that a labeling is fixed-point-free if no fixed-point cycle exists. For a given $d$, we ask
for the largest value of $n$, denoted $R_f(d)$, for which there exists a fixed-point-free labeling
of $\overset{\tiny\leftrightarrow}{K}_n$. Determining $R_f(d)$ for all $d >0$ is a natural Ramsey-type
question, generalizing some well-studied zero-sum problems in extremal combinatorics. The problem
was recently introduced by Chaudhury, Garg, Mehlhorn, Mehta, and Misra, who proved that $d \leq
R_f(d) \leq d^4+d$ and showed that the problem has close connections to EFX allocations, a central
problem of fair allocation in social choice theory. In this paper we show the improved bound $R_f(d)
\leq d^{2 + o(1)}$, yielding an efficient ${{(1-\varepsilon)}}$-EFX allocation with $n$ agents
and $O(n^{0.67})$ unallocated goods for any constant $\varepsilon \in (0,1/2]$; this improves
the bound of $O(n^{0.8})$ of Chaudhury, Garg, Mehlhorn, Mehta, and Misra. Additionally, we prove
the stronger upper bound $2d-2$, in the case where all edge-labels are permulations. A very special
case of this problem, that of finding zero-sum cycles in digraphs whose edges are labeled with elements
of $\mathbb{Z}_d$, was recently considered by Alon and Krivelevich and by M\'{e}sz\'{a}ros and
Steiner. Our result improves the bounds obtained by these authors and extends them to labelings
from an arbitrary (not necessarily commutative) group, while also simplifying the proof.

This work revisits the joint beamforming (BF) and antenna selection (AS) problem, as well as its
robust beamforming (RBF) version under imperfect channel state information (CSI). Such problems
arise in scenarios where the number of the radio frequency (RF) chains is smaller than that of the
antenna elements at the transmitter, which has become a critical consideration in the era of large-scale
arrays. The joint (R)BF\&AS problem is a mixed integer and nonlinear program, and thus finding {\it
optimal solutions} is often costly, if not outright impossible. The vast majority of the prior works
tackled these problems using continuous optimization-based approximations -- yet these approximations
do not ensure optimality or even feasibility of the solutions. The main contribution of this work
is threefold. First, an effective {\it branch and bound} (B\&B) framework for solving the problems
of interest is proposed. Leveraging existing BF and RBF solvers, it is shown that the B\&B framework
guarantees global optimality of the considered problems. Second, to expedite the potentially
costly B\&B algorithm, a machine learning (ML)-based scheme is proposed to help skip intermediate
states of the B\&B search tree. The learning model features a {\it graph neural network} (GNN)-based
design that is resilient to a commonly encountered challenge in wireless communications, namely,
the change of problem size (e.g., the number of users) across the training and test stages. Third,
comprehensive performance characterizations are presented, showing that the GNN-based method
retains the global optimality of B\&B with provably reduced complexity, under reasonable conditions.
Numerical simulations also show that the ML-based acceleration can often achieve an order-of-magnitude
speedup relative to B\&B.

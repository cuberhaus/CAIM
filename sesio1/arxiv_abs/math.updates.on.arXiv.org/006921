This paper will give both the necessary and sufficient conditions required to find a counter-example
to the Goldbach Conjecture by using an algebraic approach where no knowledge of the gaps between
prime numbers is needed. It will then be shown that it is impossible for such a counter-example to
exist. To begin, let $2a$ be a counter-example to the Goldbach Conjecture where $a \in \mathbb{N}$,
non-prime, and $a > 3$. It will be shown using the closure property of the integers, along with the
Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, that finding a counter-example to the Goldbach Conjecture
is equivalent to stating that for any prime $p_i < a$ there must exist some unique $q_i, \alpha_i \in
\mathbb{N}$ where $2a = q_i +p_i$ and $\prod_{i = 1}^{\pi(a)}q_i = \prod_{i = 1}^{\pi(a)}p_i^{\alpha_i}$.
The final step will be to prove that there are no integer solutions when $a > 3$ for the two equations
above. A similar method will be employed to prove every even number is the difference of two primes.
We start by assuming that there exists some $2a$, where $a \in \mathbb{N}$ and $a > 3$, which is not
the difference of two primes where one prime is less than $a$. Again, using of the closure property
of the integers, along with the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, gives an equivalent relationship
for a counter-example $2a$ to exist. This relationship states that for any prime $p_i \leq a$, there
exists some unique $q_i, \alpha_i \in \mathbb{N}$ where $2a = q_i - p_i$ and $\prod_{i = 1}^{\pi(a)}q_i
= (a + 1)^{\beta(a +1)} \prod_{i = 1}^{\pi(a)}p_i^{\alpha_i}$ with the condition that the function
$\beta(a + 1)$ is equal to one if $a + 1$ is prime and zero otherwise. It will then be demonstrated that
no integer solutions exist to the two equations above for $a > 3$. Once these theorems have been established
Polignac's Conjecture will follow as a consequence.

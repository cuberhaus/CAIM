What are simplest ways to construct a finite group from its atomic constituents? To understand part-whole
relations between finite simple groups and the global structure of finite groups, we axiomatize
complexity measures on finite groups. From the Jordan-H\"older theorem and Frobenius-Lagrange
embedding in an iterated wreath product, any finite group $G$ can be constructed from a unique collection
of simple groups, its Jordan-H\"older factors, each with well-defined multiplicities through
iterated extension. What is the least number of levels needed in such a hierarchical construction
if a level is allowed to include several of these atomic pieces? To answer this question rigorously,
we give a natural set of hierarchical complexity axioms for finite groups, and prove these axioms
are satisfied by a unique maximal complexity function $\mathbf{cx}$. We prove this function is
the same as the minimal number of "spans of gems" (direct products of simple groups) in a subnormal
series with all factors of this type. This hierarchical complexity is thus effectively computable,
and bounded below by all other complexity measures satisfying the axioms, including generalizations
of derived length and Fitting height. For solvable groups, the unique maximal group complexity
measure satisfying the axioms agrees with the restriction of the one for all finite groups, and in
addition satisfies an embedding axiom. In both cases, the complexity of a group is bounded above
and below by various natural functions. In particular, hierarchical complexity is sharply bounded
above by socle length, with a canonical decomposition. Examples illustrate applications of the
bounds and axiomatic methods in determining complexity of groups. We show also that minimal decompositions
need not be unique in terms of what components occur nor their ordering. The complexity axioms are
also shown to be independent.

This is an investigation into a classification of embeddings of a surface in Euclidean $3$-space.
Specifically, we consider $\mathbb{R}^3$ as having the product structure $\mathbb{R}^2 \times
\mathbb{R}$ and let $\pi:\mathbb{R}^2 \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^2$ be the natural projection
map onto the Euclidean plane. Let $ \varepsilon : S_g \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^2 \times \mathbb{R}$
be a smooth embedding of a closed oriented genus $g$ surface such that the set of critical points for
the map $\pi \circ \varepsilon$ is a smooth (possibly multi-component) $1$-manifold, $\mathscr{C}
\subset S_g$. We say $\mathscr{C}$ is the crease set of $\varepsilon$ and two embeddings are in the
same isotopy class if there exists an isotopy between them that has $\mathscr{C}$ being an invariant
set. The case where $\pi \circ \varepsilon|_\mathscr{C}$ restricts to an immersion is readily
accessible, since the turning number function of a smooth curve in $\mathbb{R}^2$ supplies us with
a natural map of components of $\mathscr{C}$ into $\mathbb{Z}$. The Gauss-Bonnet Theorem beautifully
governs the behavior of $\pi \circ \varepsilon (\mathscr{C})$, as it implies $\chi(S_g) = 2 \sum_{\gamma
\in \mathscr{C}} t(\pi \circ \varepsilon (\gamma))$, where $t$ is the turning number function.
Focusing on when $S_g \cong S^2$, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for when a disjoint
collection of curves $\mathscr{C} \subset S^2$ can be realized as the crease set of an embedding
$\varepsilon: S^2 \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^2 \times \mathbb{R}$. From there, we give the classification
of all isotopy classes of embeddings when $\mathscr{C} \subset S^2$ and $|\mathscr{C}|=3$ -- a
simple yet enlightening case. As a teaser of future work, we give an application to knot projections
and discuss directions for further investigation.

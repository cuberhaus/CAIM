In the present work we tackle the problem of finding the optimal price tariff to be set by a risk-averse
electric retailer participating in the pool and whose customers are price-sensitive. We assume
that the retailer has access to a sufficiently large smart-meter dataset from which it can statistically
characterize the relationship between the tariff price and the demand load of its clients. Three
different models are analyzed to predict the aggregated load as a function of the electricity prices
and other parameters, as humidity or temperature. More specifically, we train linear regression
(predictive) models to forecast the resulting demand load as a function of the retail price. Then
we will insert this model in a quadratic optimization problem which evaluates the optimal price
to be offered. This optimization problem accounts for different sources of uncertainty including
consumer's response, pool prices and renewable source availability, and relies on a stochastic
and risk-averse formulation. In particular, one important contribution of this work is to base
the scenario generation and reduction procedure on the statistical properties of the resulting
predictive model. This allows us to properly quantify (data-driven) not only the expected value
but the level of uncertainty associated with the main problem parameters. Moreover, we consider
both standard forward based contracts and the recently introduced power purchase agreement contracts
as risk-hedging tools for the retailer. The results are promising as profits are found for the retailer
with highly competitive prices and some possible improvements are shown if richer datasets could
be available in the future. A realistic case study and multiple sensitivity analyses have been performed
to characterize the risk-aversion behavior of the retailer considering price-sensitive consumers.

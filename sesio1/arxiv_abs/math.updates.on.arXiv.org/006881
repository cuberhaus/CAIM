Local differential privacy has recently received increasing attention from the statistics community
as a valuable tool to protect the privacy of individual data owners without the need of a trusted third
party. Similar to the classical notion of randomized response, the idea is that data owners randomize
their true information locally and only release the perturbed data. Many different protocols for
such local perturbation procedures can be designed. In most estimation problems studied in the
literature so far, however, no significant difference in terms of minimax risk between purely non-interactive
protocols and protocols that allow for some amount of interaction between individual data providers
could be observed. In this paper we show that for estimating the integrated square of a density, sequentially
interactive procedures improve substantially over the best possible non-interactive procedure
in terms of minimax rate of estimation. In particular, in the non-interactive scenario we identify
an elbow in the minimax rate at $s=\frac34$, whereas in the sequentially interactive scenario the
elbow is at $s=\frac12$. This is markedly different from both, the case of direct observations,
where the elbow is well known to be at $s=\frac14$, as well as from the case where Laplace noise is added
to the original data, where an elbow at $s= \frac94$ is obtained. We also provide adaptive estimators
that achieve the optimal rate up to log-factors, we draw connections to non-parametric goodness-of-fit
testing and estimation of more general integral functionals and conduct a series of numerical experiments.
The fact that a particular locally differentially private, but interactive, mechanism improves
over the simple non-interactive one is also of great importance for practical implementations
of local differential privacy.

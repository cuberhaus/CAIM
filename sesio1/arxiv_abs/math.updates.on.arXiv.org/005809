A collection of distinct sets is called a sunflower if the intersection of any pair of sets equals
the common intersection of all the sets. Sunflowers are fundamental objects in extremal set theory
with relations and applications to many other areas of mathematics as well as theoretical computer
science. A central problem in the area due to Erd\H{o}s and Rado from 1960 asks for the minimum number
of sets of size $r$ needed to guarantee the existence of a sunflower of a given size. Despite a lot of
recent attention including a polymath project and some amazing breakthroughs, even the asymptotic
answer remains unknown. We study a related problem first posed by Duke and Erd\H{o}s in 1977 which
requires that in addition the intersection size of the desired sunflower be fixed. This question
is perhaps even more natural from a graph theoretic perspective since it asks for the Tur\'an number
of a hypergraph made by the sunflower consisting of $k$ edges, each of size $r$ and with common intersection
of size $t$. For a fixed size of the sunflower $k$, the order of magnitude of the answer has been determined
by Frankl and F\"{u}redi. In the 1980's, with certain applications in mind, Chung, Erd\H{o}s and
Graham and Chung and Erd\H{o}s considered what happens if one allows $k$, the size of the desired
sunflower, to grow with the size of the ground set. In the three uniform case $r=3$ the correct dependence
on the size of the sunflower has been determined by Duke and Erd\H{o}s and independently by Frankl
and in the four uniform case by Buci\'{c}, Dragani\'{c}, Sudakov and Tran. We resolve this problem
for any uniformity, by determining up to a constant factor the $n$-vertex Tur\'an number of a sunflower
of arbitrary uniformity $r$, common intersection size $t$ and with the size of the sunflower $k$
allowed to grow with $n$.

We study the Hamiltonian formulation of gauge field theories on manifolds with corners, and develop
a method to characterize their symplectic reduction whenever the theory admits a local momentum
map for the gauge group action. This is achieved by adapting reduction by stages to the case of Hamiltonian
actions of gauge groups associated to gauge subgroups that emerge from the presence of corners.
We start from a decomposition of the local momentum map into a bulk term called constraint map, and
a boundary term called flux map. The first stage, or constraint reduction, views the constraint
as the zero locus of a momentum map for a normal subgroup $\mathcal{G}_\circ\subset\mathcal{G}$
(the constraint gauge group). The second stage, or flux superselection, interprets the flux map
as the momentum map for the residual action of the flux gauge group $\mathcal{G}/\mathcal{G}_\circ$.
Equivariance is controlled by cocycles of the flux gauge group. Whereas the only physically admissible
value of the constraint map is zero, the flux map is (largely) unconstrained. Consequently, the
reduction by stages generally outputs a Poisson space with symplectic leaves corresponding to
level sets of the flux map, and thus to the coadjoint (or affine) orbits of the flux gauge group. We
call such symplectic leaves flux superselection sectors, for they provide a classical analogue
of (and a road map to) the phenomenon of quantum superselection. Finally, we construct a symplectic
(action) Lie algebroid over a Poisson manifold of corner fields, $\mathsf{A}_{\partial}\to\mathcal{P}_{\partial}$.
This encodes the corner/flux gauge symmetries and provides a description of flux superselection
intrinsic to the corner submanifold which in many cases of interest is local. We work out in detail
the example of Yang-Mills theory, and briefly discuss other applications to Chern-Simons theory
and $BF$ theory.

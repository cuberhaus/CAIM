In this report-article, the general setup to classify and construct Arnold-Beltrami Flows on three-dimensional
torii, previously introduced by one of us, is further pursued. The idea of a Universal Classifying
Group (UCG) is improved. In particular, we construct for the first time such group for the hexagonal
lattice. Mastering the cubic and hexagonal instances, we can cover all cases. We upgrade Beltrami
flows to a special type of periodic solutions of the NS equations, presenting the relation between
the classification of these flows with the classification of contact structures. The recent developments
in contact and symplectic geometry, considering singular contact structures, in the framework
of b-manifolds, is also reviewed and we show that the choice of the critical surface for the b-deformation
seems to be strongly related to its group-theoretical structures. This opens directions of investigation
towards a classification of the critical surfaces or boundaries in terms of the UCG and subgroups.
Furthermore, as a result of this research programme a complete set of MATHEMATICA Codes (for the
cubic and hexagonal cases) have been produced that are able to construct Beltrami Flows with an arbitrarily
large number of parameters and analyze their hidden symmetry structures. Indeed the main goal is
the systematic organization of the parameter space into group irreps. The two Codes are a further
result, being the unavoidable basis for further investigations. The presented exact solutions
illustrate the new conceptions and ideas here discussed. The main message is: the more symmetric
is the Beltrami Flow, the highest the probability of an on-set of chaotic trajectories. In various
applications we need chaos on small scales and a more orderly motion on larger ones. Merging elementary
chaotic solutions with large directional ordered flows is the target for future research.

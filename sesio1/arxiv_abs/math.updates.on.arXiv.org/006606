We present two accurate and efficient algorithms for solving the incompressible, irrotational
Euler equations with a free surface in two dimensions with background flow over a periodic, multiply-connected
fluid domain that includes stationary obstacles and variable bottom topography. One approach
is formulated in terms of the surface velocity potential while the other evolves the vortex sheet
strength. Both methods employ layer potentials in the form of periodized Cauchy integrals to compute
the normal velocity of the free surface, are compatible with arbitrary parameterizations of the
free surface and boundaries, and allow for circulation around each obstacle, which leads to multiple-valued
velocity potentials but single-valued stream functions. We prove that the resulting second-kind
Fredholm integral equations are invertible, possibly after a physically motivated finite-rank
correction. In an angle-arclength setting, we show how to avoid curve reconstruction errors that
are incompatible with spatial periodicity. We use the proposed methods to study gravity-capillary
waves generated by flow around several elliptical obstacles above a flat or variable bottom boundary.
In each case, the free surface eventually self-intersects in a splash singularity or collides with
a boundary. We also show how to evaluate the velocity and pressure with spectral accuracy throughout
the fluid, including near the free surface and solid boundaries. To assess the accuracy of the time
evolution, we monitor energy conservation and the decay of Fourier modes and compare the numerical
results of the two methods to each other. We implement several solvers for the discretized linear
systems and compare their performance. The fastest approach employs a graphics processing unit
(GPU) to construct the matrices and carry out iterations of the generalized minimal residual method
(GMRES).

In this paper we prove that solutions to several shape optimization problems in the plane, with a
convexity constraint on the admissible domains, are polygons. The main terms of the shape functionals
we consider are either E f ($\Omega$), the Dirichlet energy of the Laplacian in the domain $\Omega$,
or $\lambda$ 1 ($\Omega$), the first eigenvalue of the Dirichlet-Laplacian. Usually, one considers
minimization of such functionals (often with measure constraint), as for example for the famous
Saint-Venant and Faber-Krahn inequalities. By adding the convexity constraint (and possibly
other constraints to ensure existence of an optimal shape) one allows to consider the rather unusual
and difficult question of maximizing these functionals. This paper follows a series of papers by
the authors, where the leading idea is that a certain concavity property of the shape functional
that is minimized leads optimal shapes to locally saturate the convexity constraint, which geometrically
means that they are polygonal. In these previous papers, the leading term in the shape functional
usually was the opposite of the perimeter, for which the aforementioned concavity property was
rather easy to obtain through computations of its second order shape derivative. By carrying classical
shape calculus, a similar concavity property can be observed for the opposite of E f or $\lambda$
1 , for shapes that are smooth and convex. The main novelty in the present paper is indeed the proof
of a weak convexity property of E f and $\lambda$ 1 when it is only known that the shape is planar and
convex, which means we have to consider rather non-smooth shapes. This work involves new computations
and estimates of the second order shape derivative of E f and $\lambda$ 1 that are interesting in themselves.

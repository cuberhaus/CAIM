We concern a family $\{(u_{\varepsilon},v_{\varepsilon})\}_{\varepsilon > 0}$ of solutions
of the Lane-Emden system on a smooth bounded convex domain $\Omega$ in $\mathbb{R}^N$ \[\begin{cases}
-\Delta u_{\varepsilon} = v_{\varepsilon}^p &\text{in } \Omega,\\ -\Delta v_{\varepsilon}
= u_{\varepsilon}^{q_{\varepsilon}} &\text{in } \Omega,\\ u_{\varepsilon},\, v_{\varepsilon}
> 0 &\text{in } \Omega,\\ u_{\varepsilon} = v_{\varepsilon} =0 &\text{on } \partial\Omega \end{cases}\]
for $N \ge 4$, $\max\{1,\frac{3}{N-2}\} < p < q_{\varepsilon}$ and small \[\varepsilon := \frac{N}{p+1}
+ \frac{N}{q_{\varepsilon}+1} - (N-2) > 0.\] This system appears as the extremal equation of the
Sobolev embedding $W^{2,(p+1)/p}(\Omega) \hookrightarrow L^{q_{\varepsilon}+1}(\Omega)$,
and is also closely related to the Calder\'on-Zygmund estimate. Under the a natural energy condition
\[\sup_{\varepsilon > 0} \left(\|u_{\varepsilon}\|_{W^{2,{p+1 \over p}}(\Omega)} + \|v_{\varepsilon}\|_{W^{2,{q_{\varepsilon}+1
\over q_{\varepsilon}}}(\Omega)}\right) < \infty,\] we prove that the multiple bubbling phenomena
may arise for the family $\{(u_{\varepsilon},v_{\varepsilon})\}_{\varepsilon > 0}$, and establish
a detailed qualitative and quantitative description. If $p < \frac{N}{N-2}$, the nonlinear structure
of the system makes the interaction between bubbles so strong, so the determination process of the
blow-up rates and locations is completely different from that of the classical Lane-Emden equation.
If $p \ge \frac{N}{N-2}$, the blow-up scenario is relatively close to (but not the same as) that of
the classical Lane-Emden equation, and only one-bubble solutions can exist. Even in the latter
case, the standard approach does not work well, which forces us to devise a new method. Using our analysis,
we also deduce a general existence theorem valid on any smooth bounded domains.

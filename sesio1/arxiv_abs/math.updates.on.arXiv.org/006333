We examine several classical concepts from topology and functional analysis, using methods of
commutative algebra. We show that these various concepts are all controlled by BC R-rings and their
maximal spectra. A BC R-ring is a ring A that is isomorphic to the ring of bounded continuous R-valued
functions on some compact topological space X. These rings are not topologized. We prove that the
category of BC R-rings is dual to the category of compact topological spaces. Next we prove that for
every topological space X the ring of bounded continuous functions on it is a BC R-ring. These theorems
combined yield an algebraic construction of the Stone-Cech Compactification of an arbitrary topological
space. There is a similar notion of BC C-ring. Every BC C-ring A has a canonical involution. The canonical
hermitian subring of A is a BC R-ring, and this is an equivalence of categories from BC C-rings to BC
R-rings. Let K be either R or C. We prove that a BC K-ring A has a canonical norm on it, making it into a
Banach K-ring. We then prove that the forgetful functor is an equivalence from Banach^* K-rings
(better known as commutative unital C^* K-algebras) to BC K-rings. The quasi-inverse of the forgetful
functor endows a BC K-ring with its canonical norm, and the canonical involution when K = C. Stone
topological spaces, also known as profinite topological spaces, are traditionally related to
boolean rings - this is Stone Duality. We give a BC ring characterization of Stone spaces. From that
we obtain a very easy proof of the fact that the Stone-Cech Compactification of a discrete space is
a Stone space. Most of the results in this paper are not new. However, most of our proofs seem to be new
- and our methods could potentially lead to genuine progress related to these classical topics.

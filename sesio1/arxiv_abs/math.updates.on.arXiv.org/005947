Let $A$ denote the Steenrod algebra at the prime 2 and let $k = \mathbb Z_2.$ An open problem of homotopy
theory is to determine a minimal set of $A$-generators for the polynomial ring $P_q = k[x_1, \ldots,
x_q] = H^{*}(k^{q}, k)$ on $q$ generators $x_1, \ldots, x_q$ with $|x_i|= 1.$ Equivalently, one
can write down explicitly a basis for the graded vector space $Q^{\otimes q} := k\otimes_{A} P_q$
in each non-negative degree $n.$ This is the content of the classical "hit problem" in literature
[30]. Based on this problem, we are interested in the $q$-th cohomological transfer $Tr_q^{A}$
of Singer [39], which is one of the useful tools for describing mod-2 cohomology of the algebra $A.$
This transfer is a linear map from the space of $GL_q(k)$-coinvariant $k\otimes _{GL_q(k)} P((P_q)_n^{*})$
of $Q^{\otimes q}$ to the $k$-cohomology group of the Steenrod algebra, ${\rm Ext}_{A}^{q, q+n}(k,
k).$ Here $GL_q(k)$ is the general linear group of degree $q$ over the field $k,$ and $P((P_q)_n^{*})$
is the primitive part of $(P_q)^{*}_n$ under the action of $A.$ Singer conjectured that $Tr_q^{A}$
is a monomorphism, but this remains unanswered for all $q\geq 4.$ The present paper is to devoted
to the investigation of this conjecture for the rank 4 case. More specifically, basing the techniques
of the hit problem of four variables, we explicitly determine the structure of $k\otimes _{GL_4(k)}
P((P_4)_{n}^{*})$ in some generic degrees $n.$ Applying these results and a representation of
$Tr_4^{A}$ over the lambda algebra, we notice that Singer's conjecture is true for the rank 4 transfer
in those degrees $n$. Also, we give some conjectures on the dimensions of $k\otimes_{GL_q(k)} ((P_4)_n^{*})$
for the remaining degrees $n.$ As a consequence, Singer's conjecture holds for $Tr_4^{A}.$ This
study and our previous results have been provided a panorama of the behavior of the fourth cohomological
transfer.

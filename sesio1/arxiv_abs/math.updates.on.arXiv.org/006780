Given integers $1 \le k_1 < \cdots < k_l \le n-1$, let Fl($k_1, \dots, k_l$; $n$) denote the type A partial
flag variety consisting of all chains of subspaces $(V_{k_1} \subset \cdots \subset V_{k_l})$
inside $\mathbb{R}^n$, where each $V_k$ has dimension $k$. Lusztig (1994, 1998) introduced the
totally positive part of Fl($k_1, \dots, k_l$; $n$) as the subset of partial flags which can be represented
by a totally positive $n\times n$ matrix, and defined the totally nonnegative part as the closure
of the totally positive part. On the other hand, following Postnikov (2007), we define the Pl\"{u}cker-positive
and Pl\"{u}cker-nonnegative parts of Fl($k_1, \dots, k_l$; $n$) as the subsets where all Pl\"{u}cker
coordinates are positive and nonnegative, respectively. It follows from the definitions that
Lusztig's total positivity implies Pl\"{u}cker positivity, and it is natural to ask when these
two notions of positivity agree. Rietsch (2009) proved that they agree in the case of the Grassmannian
Fl($k$; $n$), and Chevalier (2011) showed that the two notions are distinct for Fl($1,3$; $4$).
We show that in general, the two notions agree if and only if $k_1, \dots, k_l$ are consecutive integers.
We give an elementary proof of this result (including for the case of Grassmannians) based on classical
results in linear algebra and the theory of total positivity. We also show that the cell decomposition
of the totally nonnegative part of Fl($k_1, \dots, k_l$; $n$) coincides with its matroid decomposition
if and only if $k_1, \dots, k_l$ are consecutive integers, which was previously only known for complete
flag varieties, Grassmannians, and Fl($1,3$; $4$). Finally, we determine which notions of positivity
are compatible with a natural action of the cyclic group of order $n$ that rotates the index set.

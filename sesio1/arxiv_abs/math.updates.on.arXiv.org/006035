We rigorously examine the ergodic properties of quantum lattice models with short range interactions,
in the C* algebra formulation of statistical mechanics. Ergodicity results, in the context of group
actions on C* algebras, assume that the algebra is asymptotically abelian, which is not the case
for time evolution. The Lieb-Robinson bound tells us that the spatial extent of the time evolution
of operators is exponentially small outside a light-cone, defined by the Lieb-Robinson velocity.
More precisely, this means that the algebra of observables is asymptotically abelian only in a space-like
region. This implies a form of ergodicity outside the light-cone, but what happens within it? We
show that the long-time average of connected correlation functions of observables, along space-time
rays of almost every speed, vanishes. This holds in any state that is invariant under space-time
translations and that satisfies weak clustering properties in space. Further, we show that the
long-time limit of the n-th moment, with respect to the state, of a ray-averaged observable converges
to the n-th power of its ensemble average, which means that there are no fluctuations of ray averages
in the long time limit. This is a statement of ergodicity. The ray averages can also be performed in
a way that accounts for oscillations, showing that correlations (and moments) of the ray averaged
observables cannot sustainably oscillate in the long time limit. Finally, we show that in the GNS
representation of the algebra of observables, for any KMS state with the above properties, the long-time
limit of the ray averaged commutator converges (in the strong operator topology (SOT)) to 0 and the
ray average of any observable converges (in the SOT) to a multiple of the identity. This indicates
that observables get "thinner" almost everywhere within the light-cone.

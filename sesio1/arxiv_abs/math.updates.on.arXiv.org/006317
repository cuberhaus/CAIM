Full-waveform inversion (FWI) is a seismic imaging method that provides quantitative inference
about subsurface properties with a wavelength-scale resolution. Its frequency-domain formulation
is computationally efficient when processing only a few discrete frequencies. However, classical
FWI, which is formulated on the reduced-parameter space, requires starting the inversion with
a sufficiently-accurate initial model and low frequency to prevent being stuck in local minima
due to cycle skipping. FWI with extended search space has been proposed to mitigate this issue. It
contains two main steps: first, data-assimilated (DA) wavefields are computed by allowing for
wave-equation errors to match the data at receivers closely. Then, subsurface parameters are estimated
from these wavefields by minimizing the wave-equation errors. The DA wavefields are the least-squares
solution of an overdetermined system gathering the wave and observation equations. The numerical
bandwidth of the resulting normal-equation system is two times that of the wave-equation system,
which can be a limiting factor for 3D large-scale applications. Therefore, computing highly accurate
DA wavefields at a reasonable computational cost is an issue in extended FWI. This issue is addressed
here by rewriting the normal system such that its solution can be computed by solving the time-harmonic
wave equation several times in sequence. Moreover, the computational burden of multi-right-hand
side (RHS) simulations is mitigated with a sketching method. Finally, we solve the time-harmonic
wave equation with the convergent Born series method, which conciliates accuracy and computational
efficiency. Application of the new extended FWI algorithm on the salt benchmark shows that it reconstructs
at a reasonable cost subsurface models that are similar to those obtained with the classical extended
FWI.

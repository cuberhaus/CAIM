We consider the vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands (VRPSD), a problem in which customer
demands are known in distribution at the route planning stage and revealed during route execution
upon arrival at each customer. A long-standing open question on the VRPSD concerns the benefits
of allowing, during route execution, partial reordering of the planned customer visits. Given
the practical importance of this question and the growing interest on the VRPSD under optimal restocking,
we study the VRPSD under a recourse policy known as the switch policy. The switch policy is a canonical
reoptimization policy that permits only pairs of successive customers to be reordered. We consider
this policy jointly with optimal preventive restocking and introduce a branch-cut-and-price
algorithm to compute optimal a priori routing plans. This algorithm features pricing routines
where value functions represent the expected cost-to-go along planned routes for all possible
states and reordering decisions. To ensure pricing tractability, we adopt a strategy that combines
elementary pricing with completion bounds of varying complexity, and solve the pricing problem
without relying on dominance rules. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of the algorithm for solving instances with up to 50 customers. Notably, they also give us new insights
into the value of reoptimization. The switch policy enables significant cost savings over optimal
restocking when the planned routes come from an algorithm built on a deterministic approximation
of the data, an important scenario given the difficulty of finding optimal VRPSD solutions. The
benefits are smaller when comparing optimal a priori VRPSD solutions obtained for both recourse
policies. As it appears, further cost savings may require joint reordering and reassignment of
customer visits among vehicles when the context permits.

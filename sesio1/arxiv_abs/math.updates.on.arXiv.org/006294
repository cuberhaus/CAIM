Let $\Omega$ be an open set with Ahlfors-David regular boundary satisfying the corkscrew condition.
When $\Omega$ is connected in some quantitative form one can establish that for any real elliptic
operator with bounded coefficients, the quantitative absolute continuity of elliptic measures
is equivalent to the fact that all bounded null solutions satisfy Carleson measure estimates. In
turn, in the same setting these equivalent properties are stable under Fefferman-Kenig-Pipher
perturbations. However, without connectivity, there is no Fefferman-Kenig-Pipher perturbation
result available. In this paper, we work with a corona decomposition associated with the elliptic
measure and show that it is equivalent to the fact that bounded null solutions satisfy partial/weak
Carleson measure estimates, or to the fact that the Green function is comparable to the distance
to the boundary in the corona sense. This characterization has profound consequences. We extend
Fefferman-Kenig-Pipher's perturbation to non-connected settings. For the Laplacian, these
corona decompositions or, equivalently, the partial/weak Carleson measure estimates are meaningful
enough to characterize the uniform rectifiability of the boundary. As a consequence, we obtain
that the boundary of the set is uniformly rectifiable if bounded null solutions for any Fefferman-Kenig-Pipher
perturbation of the Laplacian satisfy Carleson measure estimates. For Kenig-Pipher operators
any of the properties of the characterization is stable under transposition or symmetrization
of the matrices of coefficients. As a result, we obtain that Carleson measure estimates for bounded
null-solutions of non-symmetric variable operators satisfying an $L^1$-Kenig-Pipher condition
occur if and only if the boundary of the open set is uniformly rectifiable. Our results generalize
previous work in settings where quantitative connectivity.

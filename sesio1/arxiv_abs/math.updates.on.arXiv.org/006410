We study in a real Hilbert space continuous in time dynamics as well as numerical algorithms for the
problem of approaching the set of zeros of a single-valued monotone and continuous operator $V$.
The starting point is a second order dynamical system that combines a vanishing damping term with
the time derivative of $V$ along the trajectory. Our method exhibits fast convergence rates of order
$o \left( \frac{1}{t\beta(t)} \right)$ for $\|V(z(t))\|$, and $\beta(\cdot)$ is a nondecreasing
function satisfiyng a growth condition, and also for the restricted gap function, which is a measure
of optimality for variational inequalities. We also prove the weak convergence of the trajectory
to a zero of $V$. Temporal discretizations generate implicit and explicit numerical algorithms,
which can be both seen as accelerated versions of the Optimistic Gradient Descent Ascent (OGDA)
method, for which we prove that the generated sequence of iterates shares the asymptotic features
of the continuous dynamics. In particular we show for the implicit numerical algorithm convergence
rates of order $o \left( \frac{1}{k\beta_k} \right)$ for $\|V(z^k)\|$ and the restricted gap function,
where $(\beta_k)_{k \geq 0}$ is a nondecreasing sequence satisfying a growth condition. For the
explicit numerical algorithm we show by additionally assuming that the operator $V$ is Lipschitz
continuous convergence rates of order $o \left( \frac{1}{k} \right)$ for $\|V(z^k)\|$ and the
restricted gap function. All convergence rate statements are last iterate convergence results;
in addition to these we prove for both algorithms the convergence of the iterates to a zero of $V$.
To our knowledge, our study exhibits the best known convergence rate results for monotone equations.
Numerical experiments indicate the overwhelming superiority of our explicit numerical algorithm
over other methods for monotone equations.

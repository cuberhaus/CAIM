This paper investigates the scheduling problem of a fleet of electric vehicles, providing mobility
as a service to a set of time-specified customers, where the operator needs to solve the routing and
charging problem jointly for each EV. Hereby we consider incentive-aware customers and propose
that the operator offers monetary incentives to customers in exchange for time flexibility. In
this way, the fleet operator can achieve a routing and charging schedule with lower costs, whilst
the customers receive monetary compensation for their flexibility. Specifically, we first propose
a bi-level optimization model whereby the fleet operator optimizes the routing and charging schedule
accounting for the spatio-temporal varying charging price, jointly with a monetary incentive
to reimburse the delivery time flexibility experienced by the customers. Concurrently the customers
choose their own time flexibility by minimizing their own cost. Second, we cope with the computational
burden coming from this nonlinear bi-level optimization model with an accurate reformulation
approach consisting of the KKT optimality conditions, a Big-M-based linearization method, and
the zero duality gap of convex optimization problems. This way, we convert the proposed problem
into a single-level optimization problem, which can be solved by a strengthened generalized Benders
decomposition method holding a faster convergence rate than the generalized Benders decomposition
method. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed mathematical model, we carry out numerous
simulation experiments by using the VRP-REP data of Belgium. The numerical results showcase that
the proposed mathematical model can reduce the delivery fees for the customers together with the
cost of operation incurred by the fleet operator.

In a widely-studied class of multi-parametric optimization problems, the objective value of each
solution is an affine function of real-valued parameters. Then, the goal is to provide an optimal
solution set, i.e., a set containing an optimal solution for each non-parametric problem obtained
by fixing a parameter vector. For many multi-parametric optimization problems, however, an optimal
solution set of minimum cardinality can contain super-polynomially many solutions. Consequently,
no polynomial-time exact algorithms can exist for these problems even if $\textsf{P}=\textsf{NP}$.
We propose an approximation method that is applicable to a general class of multi-parametric optimization
problems and outputs a set of solutions with cardinality polynomial in the instance size and the
inverse of the approximation guarantee. This method lifts approximation algorithms for non-parametric
optimization problems to their parametric version and provides an approximation guarantee that
is arbitrarily close to the approximation guarantee of the approximation algorithm for the non-parametric
problem. If the non-parametric problem can be solved exactly in polynomial time or if an FPTAS is
available, our algorithm is an FPTAS. Further, we show that, for any given approximation guarantee,
the minimum cardinality of an approximation set is, in general, not $\ell$-approximable for any
natural number $\ell$ less or equal to the number of parameters, and we discuss applications of our
results to classical multi-parametric combinatorial optimizations problems. In particular,
we obtain an FPTAS for the multi-parametric minimum $s$-$t$-cut problem, an FPTAS for the multi-parametric
knapsack problem, as well as an approximation algorithm for the multi-parametric maximization
of independence systems problem.

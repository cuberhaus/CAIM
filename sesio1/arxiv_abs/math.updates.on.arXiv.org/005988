Recent experimental advances in Floquet engineering and controlling dissipation in open systems
have brought about unprecedented flexibility in tailoring novel phenomena without any static
and Hermitian analogues, as epitomized by the various Floquet and non-Hermitian topological phases.
While topological classifications of either Hermitian (including both static and periodic driving)
or time-independent non-Hermitian systems based on the underlying symmetries have been well established
in the past several years, a coherent understanding and classification of Floquet non-Hermitian
(FNH) topological phases have not been achieved yet. Here we systematically classify FNH topological
bands for arbitrary symmetry classes and spatial dimensions using $K$-theory. The classification
distinguishes two different scenarios of spectrum gaps (dubbed as angle-gapped and angle-gapless)
of the Floquet evolution operator, culminating into two periodic tables, each containing 54-fold
distinct FNH symmetry classes, respectively. Our scheme reveals novel FNH topological phases
without any static or Floquet Hermitian counterparts and naturally produces the periodic tables
of Floquet Hermitian topological insulators and Floquet unitaries as two special cases of our classification.
The framework can also be applied to characterize the topological phases of bosonic systems. We
provide concrete examples of one and two-dimensional fermionic and bosonic systems and elucidate
the meaning of the topological invariants and their physical consequences. Our work lays the foundation
of a comprehensive exploration of FNH topological bands and opens a broad avenue toward uncovering
unique phenomena and functionalities emerging from the synthesis of periodic driving, non-Hermiticity,
and band topology.

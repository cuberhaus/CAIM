One of the major issues in the computational mechanics is to take into account the geometrical complexity.
To overcome this difficulty and to avoid the expensive mesh generation, geometrically unfitted
methods, i.e. the numerical methods using the simple computational meshes that do not fit the boundary
of the domain, and/or the internal interfaces, have been widely developed. In the present work,
we investigate the performances of an unfitted method called $\phi$-FEM that converges optimally
and uses classical finite element spaces so that it can be easily implemented using general FEM libraries.
The main idea is to take into account the geometry thanks to a level set function describing the boundary
or the interface. Up to now, the $\phi$-FEM approach has been proposed, tested and substantiated
mathematically only in some simplest settings: Poisson equation with Dirichlet/Neumann/Robin
boundary conditions. Our goal here is to demonstrate its applicability to some more sophisticated
governing equations arising in the computational mechanics. We consider the linear elasticity
equations accompanied by either pure Dirichlet boundary conditions or by the mixed ones (Dirichlet
and Neumann boundary conditions co-existing on parts of the boundary), an interface problem (linear
elasticity with material coefficients abruptly changing over an internal interface), a model
of elastic structures with cracks, and finally the heat equation. In all these settings, we derive
an appropriate variant of $\phi$-FEM and then illustrate it by numerical tests on manufactured
solutions. We also compare the accuracy and efficiency of $\phi$-FEM with those of the standard
fitted FEM on the meshes of similar size, revealing the substantial gains that can be achieved by
$\phi$-FEM in both the accuracy and the computational time.

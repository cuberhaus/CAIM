Starting from first principles of wave propagation, we consider a multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) representation of a communication system between two spatially-continuous volumes. This
is the concept of holographic MIMO communications. The analysis takes into account the electromagnetic
interference, generated by external sources, and the constraint on the physical radiated power.
The electromagnetic MIMO model is particularized for a pair of parallel line segments in line-of-sight
conditions. Inspired by orthogonal-frequency division-multiplexing, we assume that the spatially-continuous
transmit currents and received fields are represented using the Fourier basis functions. In doing
so, a wavenumber-division multiplexing (WDM) scheme is obtained, which is not optimal but can be
efficiently implemented. The interplay among the different system parameters (e.g., transmission
range, wavelength, and sizes of source and receiver) in terms of number of communication modes and
level of interference among them is studied with conventional tools of linear systems theory. Due
to the non-finite support (in the spatial domain) of the electromagnetic channel, WDM cannot provide
non-interfering communication modes. The interference decreases as the receiver size grows,
and goes to zero only asymptotically. Different digital processing architectures, operating
in the wavenumber domain, are thus used to deal with the interference. The simplest implementation
provides the same spectral efficiency of a singular-value decomposition architecture with water-filling
when the receiver size is comparable to the transmission range. The developed framework is also
used to represent a classical MIMO system and to make comparisons. It turns out that the latter achieves
better performance only when a higher number of radio-frequency chains is used.

We present efforts to control the chaotic, nonlinear, forced van der Pol system using physics-informed
deep operator control (PIDOC) compared to benchmark methods including idealized nonlinear feed-forward
(FF) control, linearized feedback control (FB), and feed-forward-plus-feedback combined (C).
The aim is to implement circular trajectories in the state space of the van der Pol system. A designed
benchmark problem is used for testing the behavioral differences of the disparate controllers
and then investigating controlled schemes and systems of various extents of nonlinearities. All
methods exhibit a transient initialization accompanying arbitrary initialization points. The
feedforward control successfully converges to the desired trajectory, and PIDOC executes good
controls with higher stochasticity observed for higher-order terms based on the phase portraits,
while linearized feedback control and combined feed-forward plus feedback failed. Varying trajectory
amplitudes revealed that feed-forward, linearized feedback control, and combined feed-forward
plus feedback control all fail for unity nonlinear damping gain. Traditional control methods display
a robust fluctuation for higher-order terms. For some various nonlinearities, PIDOC failed to
implement the desired trajectory, instead of becoming "trapped" in the phase of small radius, yet
idealized nonlinear feedforward successfully implemented controls. PIDOC exhibits generally
lower relative errors for varying targeted trajectories. However, PIDOC also shows evidently
higher computational burden compared with traditional control theory methods, with at least more
than 30 times longer control time compared with benchmark idealized nonlinear feed-forward control.
This manuscript proposes a comprehensive comparative study for future controller employment
considering deterministic and machine learning approaches.

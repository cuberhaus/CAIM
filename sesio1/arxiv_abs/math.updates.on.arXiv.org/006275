In this paper, we focus on the variety DHMSH of dually hemimorphic semi-Heyting algebras from a logical
point of view. Firstly, we present a Hilbert-style axiomatization of a new logic called Dually hemimorphic
semi-Heyting logic (DHMSH, for short), as an expansion of semi-intuitionistic logic SI (also called
SH) introduced by the first author by adding a weak negation (to be interpreted as a dual hemimorphism).
We then prove that it is implicative in the sense of Rasiowa and that it is complete with respect to
the variety DHMSH. It is deduced that the logic DHMSH is algebraizable in the sense of Blok and Pigozzi,
with the variety DHMSH as its equivalent algebraic semantics and that the lattice of axiomatic extensions
of DHMSH is dually isomorphic to the lattice of subvarieties of DHMSH. A new axiomatization for Moisil's
logic is also obtained. Secondly, we characterize the axiomatic extensions of DHMSH in which the
Deduction Theorem holds. Thirdly, we present several new logics, extending the logic DHMSH, corresponding
to several important subvarieties of the variety DHMSH. These include logics corresponding to
the varieties generated by two-element, three-element and some four-element dually quasi-De
Morgan semi-Heyting algebras, as well as a new axiomatization for the 3-valued Lukasiewiczlogic.
Surprisingly, many of these logics turn out to be connexive logics, a few of which are presented in
this paper. Fourthly, we present axiomatizations for two infinite sequences of logics namely,
De Morgan-Goedel logics and dually pseudocomplemented Goedel logics, Fifthly, axiomatizations
are also provided for logics corresponding to many subvarieties of regular dually quasi-De Morgan
Stone semi-Heyting algebras, of regular De Morgan semi-Heyting algebras of level 1, and of JI-distributive
semi-Heyting algebras of level 1. We conclude the paper with some open problems.

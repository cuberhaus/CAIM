Studies of disordered heterogeneous media and galaxy cosmology share a common goal: analyzing
the distribution of particles at `microscales' to predict physical properties at `macroscales',
whether for a liquid, composite material, or entire Universe. The former theory provides an array
of techniques to characterize a wide class of microstructures; in this work, we apply them to the
distributions of galaxies. We focus on the lower-order correlation functions, `void' and `particle'
nearest-neighbor functions, pair-connectedness functions, percolation properties, and a scalar
order metric. Compared to homogeneous Poisson and typical disordered systems, the cosmological
simulations exhibit enhanced large-scale clustering and longer tails in the nearest-neighbor
functions, due to the presence of quasi-long-range correlations. On large scales, the system appears
`hyperuniform', due to primordial density fluctuations, whilst on the smallest scales, the system
becomes almost `antihyperuniform', and, via the order metric, is shown to be a highly correlated
disordered system. Via a finite scaling analysis, we show that the percolation threshold of the
galaxy catalogs is significantly lower than for Poisson realizations; this is consistent with
the observation that the galaxy distribution contains larger voids. However, the two sets of simulations
share a fractal dimension, implying that they lie in the same universality class. Finally, we consider
the ability of large-scale clustering statistics to constrain cosmological parameters using
simulation-based inference. Both the nearest-neighbor distribution and pair-connectedness
function considerably tighten bounds on the amplitude of cosmological fluctuations at a level
equivalent to observing twenty-five times more galaxies. These are a useful alternative to the
three-particle correlation, and are computable in much reduced time. (Abridged)

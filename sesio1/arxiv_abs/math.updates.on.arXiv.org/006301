In this survey, we review the classical Hamilton Jacobi theory from a geometric point of view in different
geometric backgrounds. We propose a Hamilton Jacobi equation for different geometric structures
attending to one particular characterization: whether they fulfill the Jacobi and Leibniz identities
simultaneously, or if at least they satisfy one of them. In this regard, we review the case of time
dependent and dissipative physical systems as systems that fulfill the Jacobi identity but not
the Leibnitz identity. Furthermore, we review the contact evolution Hamilton Jacobi theory as
a split off the regular contact geometry, and that actually satisfies the Leibniz rule instead of
Jacobi. Furthermore, we include a novel result, which is the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for conformal
Hamiltonian vector fields as a generalization of the well known Hamilton Jacobi on a symplectic
manifold, that is retrieved in the case of a zero conformal factor. The interest of a geometric Hamilton
Jacobi equation is the primordial observation that if a Hamiltonian vector field can be projected
into a configuration manifold by means of a 1-form dW, then the integral curves of the projected vector
field can be transformed into integral curves of the Hamiltonian vector field provided that W is
a solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Geometrically, the solution of the Hamilton Jacobi
equation plays the role of a Lagrangian submanifold of a certain bundle. Exploiting these features
in different geometric scenarios we propose a geometric theory for multiple physical systems depending
on the fundamental identities that their dynamic satisfies. Different examples are pictured to
reflect the results provided, being all of them new, except for one that is reassessment of a previously
considered example.

The space-time behaviors of 3D bipolar Navier-Stokes-Poisson system (BNSP) with unequal viscosities
and unequal pressure functions are given. As we know, the space-time estimate of electric field
\nabla\phi is the most important one in deducing generalized Huygens' principle for BNSP since
this estimate only can be obtained by the relation \nabla\phi=\frac{\nabla}{\Delta}(\rho-n)
from the Poisson equation. Thus, it requires to prove that the space-time estimate of \rho-n only
contains diffusion wave. The appearance of these unequal coefficients results that one cannot
follow ideas for the special case in \cite{wu4}, where the original system was rewritten as a Navier-Stokes
system (NS) and a unipolar Navier-Stokes-Poisson system (NSP) after a suitable linear combination
of unknowns. Additionally this linear combination brings some special structure for nonlinear
terms, and this special structure was also used to get desired space-time estimate for \rho-n. More
importantly, Green's function of the subsystem NSP does not contain Huygens' wave is equally important
in the proof in \cite{wu4}. However, for the general case here, the benefits from this linear combination
don't exist any longer. First, we have to directly consider an 8\times8 Green's matrix. Second,
all of entries in Green's function in low frequency actually contain wave operators. This generally
produces the Huygens' wave for each entries in Green's function, as a result, one cannot achieve
that the space-time estimate of $Z\rho-n$ only contains the diffusion wave as usual. We overcome
this difficulty by making more detailed spectral analysis and developing new estimates arising
from cancellations in Green's function. Third, due to loss of the special structure of the nonlinear
terms from the linear combination, we shall develop some new nonlinear convolution estimates.

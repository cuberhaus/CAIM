Ocean eddies play an important role in the transport and mixing processes of the ocean due to their
ability to transport material, heat, salt, and other tracers across large distances. They exhibit
at least two timescales; an Eulerian lifetime associated with persistent identifiable signatures
in gridded fields such as vorticity or sea-surface height, and multiple Lagrangian or material
coherence timescales that are typically much shorter. We propose a method to study the multi-timescale
material transport, leakage, and entrainment by eddies with their surroundings by constructing
sequences of finite-time coherent sets, computed as superlevel sets of dominant eigenfunctions
of dynamic Laplace operators. The dominant eigenvalues of dynamic Laplace operators defined on
time intervals of varying length allows us to identify a maximal coherence timescale that minimizes
the rate of mass loss over a domain, per unit flow time. We apply the method to examine the persistence
and material coherence of an Agulhas ring, an ocean eddy in the South Atlantic ocean, using particle
trajectories derived from a $0.1^\circ$ global numerical ocean simulation. Using a sequence of
sliding windows, the method is able to identify and track a persistent eddy feature for a time much
longer than the maximal coherence timescale, and with considerably larger material transport
than the corresponding eddy feature identified from purely Eulerian information. Furthermore,
the median residence times of fluid in the identified feature far exceed the timescale over which
fully material motion is guaranteed. Through residence time calculations, we find that this particular
eddy does not exhibit a long-lived coherent inner core and that the bulk of material transport is
performed by the quasi-coherent outer ring of the eddy.

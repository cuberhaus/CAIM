A surprising result of Pillai and Meng (2016) showed that a transformation $\sum_{j=1}^n w_j X_j/Y_j$
of two iid centered normal random vectors, $(X_1,\ldots, X_n)$ and $(Y_1,\ldots, Y_n)$, $n>1$,
for any weights $0\leq w_j\leq 1$, $ j=1,\ldots, n$, $\sum_{j=1}^n w_j=1$, has a Cauchy distribution
regardless of any correlations within the normal vectors. The correlations appear to lose out in
the competition with the heavy tails. To clarify how extensive this phenomenon is, we analyze two
other transformations of two iid centered normal random vectors. These transformations are similar
in spirit to the transformation considered by Pillai and Meng (2016). One transformation involves
absolute values: $\sum_{j=1}^n w_j X_j/|Y_j|$. The second involves randomly stopped Brownian
motions: $\sum_{j=1}^n w_j X_j\bigl(Y_j^{-2}\bigr)$, where $\bigl\{\bigl( X_1(t),\ldots,
X_n(t)\bigr), \, t\geq 0\bigr\},\ n>1,$ is a Brownian motion with positive variances; $(Y_1,\ldots,
Y_n)$ is a centered normal random vector with the same law as $( X_1(1),\ldots, X_n(1))$ and independent
of it; and $X(Y^{-2})$ is the value of the Brownian motion $X(t)$ evaluated at the random time $t=Y^{-2}$.
All three transformations result in a Cauchy distribution if the covariance matrix of the normal
components is diagonal, or if all the correlations implied by the covariance matrix equal 1. However,
while the transformation Pillai and Meng (2016) considered produces a Cauchy distribution regardless
of the normal covariance matrix. the transformations we consider here do not always produce a Cauchy
distribution. The correlations between jointly normal random variables are not always overwhelmed
by the heaviness of the marginal tails. The mysteries of the connections between normal and Cauchy
laws remain to be understood.

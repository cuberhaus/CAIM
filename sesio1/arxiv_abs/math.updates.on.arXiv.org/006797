Eigenvalues of Wigner matrices has been a major topic of investigation. A particularly important
subclass of such random matrices is formed by the adjacency matrix of an Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graph
$\mathcal{G}_{n,p}$ equipped with i.i.d. edge-weights. An observable of particular interest
is the largest eigenvalue. In this paper, we study the large deviations behavior of the largest eigenvalue
of such matrices, a topic that has received considerable attention over the years. We focus on the
case $p = \frac{d}{n}$, where most known techniques break down. So far, results were known only for
$\mathcal{G}_{n,\frac{d}{n}}$ without edge-weights (Krivelevich and Sudakov, '03), (Bhattacharya,
Bhattacharya, and Ganguly, '21) and with Gaussian edge-weights (Ganguly and Nam, '21). In the present
article, we consider the effect of general weight distributions. More specifically, we consider
the entries whose tail probabilities decay at rate $e^{-t^\alpha}$ with $\alpha>0$, where the
regimes $0<\alpha<2$ and $\alpha>2$ correspond to tails heavier and lighter than the Gaussian
tail respectively. While in many natural settings the large deviations behavior is expected to
depend crucially on the entry distribution, we establish a surprising and rare universal behavior
showing that this is not the case when $\alpha > 2.$ In contrast, in the $\alpha< 2$ case, the large
deviation rate function is no longer universal and is given by the solution to a variational problem,
the description of which involves a generalization of the Motzkin-Straus theorem, a classical
result from spectral graph theory. As a byproduct of our large deviation results, we also establish
new law of large numbers results for the largest eigenvalue. In particular, we show that the typical
value of the largest eigenvalue exhibits a phase transition at $\alpha = 2$, i.e. the Gaussian distribution.

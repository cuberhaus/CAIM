We observe $n$ pairs of independent random variables $X_{1}=(W_{1},Y_{1}),\ldots,X_{n}=(W_{n},Y_{n})$
and assume, although this might not be true, that for each $i\in\{1,\ldots,n\}$, the conditional
distribution of $Y_{i}$ given $W_{i}$ belongs to a given exponential family with real parameter
$\theta_{i}^{\star}=\boldsymbol{\theta}^{\star}(W_{i})$ the value of which is an unknown
function $\boldsymbol{\theta}^{\star}$ of the covariate $W_{i}$. Given a model $\boldsymbol{\overline\Theta}$
for $\boldsymbol{\theta}^{\star}$, we propose an estimator $\boldsymbol{\widehat \theta}$
with values in $\boldsymbol{\overline\Theta}$ the construction of which is independent of the
distribution of the $W_{i}$. We show that $\boldsymbol{\widehat \theta}$ possesses the properties
of being robust to contamination, outliers and model misspecification. We establish non-asymptotic
exponential inequalities for the upper deviations of a Hellinger-type distance between the true
distribution of the data and the estimated one based on $\boldsymbol{\widehat \theta}$. We deduce
a uniform risk bound for $\boldsymbol{\widehat \theta}$ over the class of H\"olderian functions
and we prove the optimality of this bound up to a logarithmic factor. Finally, we provide an algorithm
for calculating $\boldsymbol{\widehat \theta}$ when $\boldsymbol{\theta}^{\star}$ is assumed
to belong to functional classes of low or medium dimensions (in a suitable sense) and, on a simulation
study, we compare the performance of $\boldsymbol{\widehat \theta}$ to that of the MLE and median-based
estimators. The proof of our main result relies on an upper bound, with explicit numerical constants,
on the expectation of the supremum of an empirical process over a VC-subgraph class. This bound can
be of independent interest.

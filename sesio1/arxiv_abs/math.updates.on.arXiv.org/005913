In the context of transition towards cleaner and sustainable energy production, microgrids have
become an effective way for tackling environmental pollution and energy crisis issues. With the
increasing penetration of renewables, how to coordinate demand response and renewable generations
is a critical and challenging issue in the field of microgrid scheduling. To this end, a bi-level
scheduling model is put forward for isolated microgrids with consideration of multi-stakeholders
in this paper, where the lower- and upper-level models respectively aim to the minimization of user
cost and microgrid operational cost under real-time electricity pricing environments. In order
to solve this model, this research combines Jaya algorithm and interior point method (IPM) to develop
a hybrid analysis-heuristic solution method called Jaya-IPM, where the lower- and upper- levels
are respectively addressed by the IPM and the Jaya, and the scheduling scheme is obtained via iterations
between the two levels. After that, the real-time prices updated by the upper-level model and the
electricity plans determined by the lower-level model will be alternately iterated between the
upper- and lower- levels through the real-time pricing mechanism to obtain an optimal scheduling
plan. The test results show that the proposed method can coordinate the uncertainty of renewable
generations with demand response strategies, thereby achieving a balance between the interests
of microgrid and users; and that by leveraging demand response, the flexibility of the load side
can be fully exploited to achieve peak load shaving while maintaining the balance of supply and demand.
In addition, the Jaya-IPM algorithm is proven to be superior to the traditional hybrid intelligent
algorithm (HIA) and the CPLEX solver in terms of optimization results and calculation efficiency.

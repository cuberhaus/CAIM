In this work, we consider the task of faithfully simulating a quantum measurement, acting on a joint
bipartite quantum state, in a distributed manner. In the distributed setup, the constituent sub-systems
of the joint quantum state are measured by two agents, Alice and Bob. A third agent, Charlie receives
the measurement outcomes sent by Alice and Bob. Charlie uses local and pairwise shared randomness
to compute a bivariate function of the measurement outcomes. The objective of three agents is to
faithfully simulate the given distributed quantum measurement acting on the given quantum state
while minimizing the communication and shared randomness rates. We demonstrate a new achievable
information-theoretic rate-region that exploits the bivariate function using random structured
POVMs based on asymptotically good algebraic codes. The algebraic structure of these codes is matched
to that of the bivariate function that models the action of Charlie. The conventional approach for
this class of problems has been to reconstruct individual measurement outcomes corresponding
to Alice and Bob, at Charlie, and then compute the bivariate function, achieved using mutually independent
approximating POVMs based on random unstructured codes. In the present approach, using algebraic
structured POVMs, the computation is performed on the fly, thus obviating the need to reconstruct
individual measurement outcomes at Charlie. Using this, we show that a strictly larger rate region
can be achieved. One of the challenges in analyzing these structured POVMs is that they exhibit only
pairwise independence and induce only uniform single-letter distributions. To address this,
we use nesting of algebraic codes and develop a covering lemma applicable to pairwise-independent
POVM ensembles. Combining these techniques, we provide a multi-party distributed faithful simulation
and function computation protocol.

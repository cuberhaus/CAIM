This paper considers the immediate blowup of classical solutions to the vacuum free boundary problem
of non-isentropic compressible Navier--Stokes equations, where the viscosities and the heat
conductivity could be constants, or more physically, the degenerate, temperature-dependent
functions which vanish on the vacuum boundary (i.e., $\mu=\bar{\mu} \theta^{\alpha}, ~ \lambda=\bar{\lambda}
\theta^{\alpha},~ \kappa=\bar{\kappa} \theta^{\alpha}$, for constants $0\leq \alpha\leq
1/(\gamma-1)$, $\bar{\mu}>0,~2\bar{\mu}+n\bar{\lambda}\geq0,~\bar{\kappa}\geq 0$, and
adiabatic exponent $\gamma>1$). In our previous study (Liu and Yuan, Math. Models Methods Appl.
Sci. (9) 12, 2019), with three-dimensional spherical symmetry and constant shear viscosity, vanishing
bulk viscosity and heat conductivity, we established a class of global-in-time large solutions,
with bounded entropy and entropy derivatives, under the condition the decaying rate of the initial
density to the vacuum boundary is of any positive power of the distance function to the boundary.
In this paper we prove that such classical solutions do not exist for any small time for non-vanishing
bulk viscosity, provided the initial velocity is expanding near the boundary. When the heat conductivity
does not vanish, it is automatically satisfied that the normal derivative of the temperature of
the classical solution across the free boundary does not degenerate; meanwhile, the entropy of
the classical solution immediately blowups if the decaying rate of the initial density is not of
$1/(\gamma-1)$ power of the distance function to the boundary. The proofs are obtained by the analyzing
the boundary behaviors of the velocity, entropy and temperature, and investigating the maximum
principles for parabolic equations with degenerate coefficients.

We consider the effects of thermal noise on the Batchelor-Kraichnan theory of high Schmidt-number
mixing in the viscous-dissipation range of turbulent flows. Using fluctuating hydrodynamics
for a binary fluid mixture at low Mach numbers, we justify linearization around the deterministic
Navier-Stokes solution in the dissipation range. For the latter solution we adopt the standard
Kraichnan model and derive asymptotic high-Schmidt limiting equations for the concentration
field, in which the thermal velocity fluctuations are exactly represented by a Gaussian random
velocity which is white in time. We obtain the exact solution for the concentration spectrum in this
high-Schmidt limiting model, showing that the Batchelor prediction in the viscous-convective
range is unaltered. Thermal noise dramatically renormalizes the bare diffusivity in this range,
but the effect is the same as in laminar flow and thus hidden phenomenologically. However, in the
viscous-diffusive range at scales below the Batchelor length (typically micron scales) the predictions
based on deterministic Navier-Stokes equations are drastically altered by thermal noise. Whereas
the classical theories predict rapidly decaying spectra in the viscous-diffusive range, we obtain
a $k^{-2}$ power-law spectrum starting just below the Batchelor length. This spectrum corresponds
to non-equilibrium giant concentration fluctuations, due to the imposed concentration variations
advected by thermal velocity fluctuations which are experimentally well-observed in quiescent
fluids. At higher wavenumbers, the concentration spectrum instead goes to a $k^2$ equipartition
spectrum due to equilibrium molecular fluctuations. We work out detailed predictions for water-glycerol
and water-fluorescein mixtures. Finally, we discuss broad implications for turbulent flows and
novel applications of our methods to experimentally accessible laminar flows.

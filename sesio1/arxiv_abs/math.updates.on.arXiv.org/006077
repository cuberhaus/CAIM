Let $G$ be a connected reductive group acting on a complex vector space $V$ and projective space ${\mathbb
P}V$. Let $x\in V$ and ${\cal H}\subseteq {\cal G}$ be the Lie algebra of its stabilizer. Our objective
is to understand points $[y]$, and their stabilizers which occur in the vicinity of $[x]$. We construct
an explicit ${\cal G}$-action on a suitable neighbourhood of $x$, which we call the local model at
$x$. We show that Lie algebras of stabilizers of points in the vicinity of $x$ are parameterized by
subspaces of ${\cal H}$. When ${\cal H}$ is reductive these are Lie subalgebras of ${\cal H}$. If
the orbit of $x$ is closed this also follows from Luna's theorem. Our construction involves a map
connected to the local curvature form at $x$. We apply the local model to forms, when the form $g$ is
obtained from the form $f$ as the leading term of a one parameter family acting on $f$. We show that
there is a flattening ${\cal K}_0$ of ${\cal K}$, the stabilizer of $f$ which sits as a subalgebra
of ${\cal H}$, the stabilizer $g$. We specialize to the case of forms $f$ whose $SL(X)$-orbits are
affine, and the orbit of $g$ is of co-dimension $1$. We show that (i) either ${\cal H}$ has a very simple
structure, or (ii) conjugates of the elements of ${\cal K}$ also stabilize $g$ and the tangent of
exit. Next, we apply this to the adjoint action. We show that for a general matrix $X$, the signatures
of nilpotent matrices in its projective orbit closure (under conjugation) are determined by the
multiplicity data of the spectrum of $X$. Finally, we formulate the path problem of finding paths
with specific properties from $y$ to its limit points $x$ as an optimization problem using local
differential geometry. Our study is motivated by Geometric Complexity Theory proposed by the second
author and Ketan Mulmuley.

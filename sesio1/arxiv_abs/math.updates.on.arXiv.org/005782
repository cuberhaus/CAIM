Railroad bridge engineers are interested in the displacement of railroad bridges when the train
is crossing the bridge for engineering decision making of their assets. Measuring displacements
under train crossing events is difficult. If simplified reference-free methods would be accurate
and validated, owners would conduct objective performance assessment of their bridge inventories
under trains. Researchers have developed new sensing technologies (reference-free) to overcome
the limitations of reference point-based displacement sensors. Reference-free methods use accelerometers
to estimate displacements, by decomposing the total displacement in two parts: a high-frequency
dynamic displacement component, and a low-frequency pseudo-static displacement component.
In the past, researchers have used the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory formula to estimate the pseudo-static
displacement assuming railroad bridge piles and columns can be simplified as cantilever beams.
However, according to railroad bridge managers, railroad bridges have a different degree of fixity
for each pile of each bent. Displacements can be estimated assuming a similar degree of fixity for
deep foundations, but inherent errors will affect the accuracy of displacement estimation. This
paper solves this problem expanding the 1 Degree of Freedom (1DOF) solution to a new 2 Degrees of Freedom
(2DOF), to collect displacements under trains and enable cost-effective condition-based information
related to bridge safety. Researchers developed a simplified beam to demonstrate the total displacement
estimation using 2DOF and further conducted experimental results in the laboratory. The estimated
displacement of the 2DOF model is more accurate than that of the 1DOF model for ten train crossing
events. With only one sensor added to the ground of the pile, this method provides owners with approximately
40% more accurate displacements.

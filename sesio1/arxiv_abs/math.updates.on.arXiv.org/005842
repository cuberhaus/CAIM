The exoskeleton technology has been rapidly advancing in the recent past due to its multitude of
applications in assisted living, military, healthcare, firefighting, and industries. With the
projected increase in the diverse uses of exoskeletons in the next few years in these application
domains and beyond, it is crucial to study, interpret, and analyze user perspectives, public opinion,
reviews, and feedback related to exoskeletons, for which a comprehensive dataset is necessary.
The Internet of Everything (IOE) era of today's living, characterized by people spending more time
on the Internet than ever before, holds the potential for developing such a dataset by the mining
of relevant web behavior data from social media communications, which have increased exponentially
in the last few years. Twitter, one such social media platform, is highly popular amongst all age
groups, who communicate on diverse topics including but not limited to news, current events, politics,
emerging technologies, family, relationships, and career opportunities, via tweets, while sharing
their views, opinions, perspectives, and feedback towards the same. To address this research challenge
by utilizing the potential of the IOE style of living, this paper makes multiple scientific contributions
to this field. First, it presents a novel approach of mining tweets that is not bound by any restrictions
on the number of days during which the tweets can be mined. Second, by application of this approach,
it presents an open-access dataset of approximately 20,000 tweets related to exoskeletons, that
were posted over a period of 231 days. Finally, based on an exploratory review of 108 emerging works
in this field and its interrelated disciplines, the paper discusses multiple interdisciplinary
applications of this dataset and presents 100 research questions for researchers to study, analyze,
evaluate, and investigate.

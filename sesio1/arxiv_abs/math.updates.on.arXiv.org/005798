Classes of branched surfaces extend the classes of surfaces or 2-dimensional manifolds satisfying
suitable properties and defined in various manners. Reeb spaces of smooth maps of suitable classes
into surfaces whose codimensions are negative are regarded as branched surfaces. They are the spaces
of all connected components of preimages and natural quotient spaces of the manifolds of the domains.
They are defined for general smooth maps and important topological objects in differential topology.
They also play important roles in applied or applications of mathematics such as projections in
data analysis and visualizations. The present paper concerns global topologies of branched surfaces
and explicit construction of canonically obtained maps from the branched surfaces into surfaces
of the targets via fundamental operations. The class of these induced maps extends the class of smooth
immersions of compact surfaces into surfaces with no boundaries. It is also regarded as a variant
of the class of so-called generic smooth maps between these surfaces. We study so-called "geography"
of such maps as a natural, important and new study and also study global topological properties of
the branched surfaces such as embeddability into 3-dimensional closed and connected manifolds
as a well-known variant of embeddability of graphs into surfaces. The author has also believed that
understanding global topologies of Reeb spaces of suitable smooth maps are important and obtained
several Reeb spaces with information on global algebraic topological or differential topological
properties. The present study can be also regarded as a study on these objects in 2-dimensional cases
for {\it simple} fold maps, generalized versions of so-called Morse functions and can be seen a new
work motivated by various theory of Morse functions and higher dimensional variants.

A generalized downlink multi-antenna non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) transmission framework
is proposed with the novel concept of cluster-free successive interference cancellation (SIC).
In contrast to conventional NOMA approaches, where SIC is successively carried out within the same
cluster, the key idea is that the SIC can be flexibly implemented between any arbitrary users to achieve
efficient interference elimination. Based on the proposed framework, a sum rate maximization
problem is formulated for jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming and the SIC operations between
users, subject to the SIC decoding conditions and users' minimal data rate requirements. To tackle
this highly-coupled mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, an alternating direction
method of multipliers-successive convex approximation (ADMM-SCA) algorithm is developed. The
original problem is first reformulated into a tractable biconvex augmented Lagrangian (AL) problem
by handling the non-convex terms via SCA. Then, this AL problem is decomposed into two subproblems
that are iteratively solved by the ADMM to obtain the stationary solution. Moreover, to reduce the
computational complexity and alleviate the parameter initialization sensitivity of ADMM-SCA,
a Matching-SCA algorithm is proposed. The intractable binary SIC operations are solved through
an extended many-to-many matching, which is jointly combined with an SCA process to optimize the
transmit beamforming. The proposed Matching-SCA can converge to an enhanced exchange-stable
matching that guarantees the local optimality. Numerical results demonstrate that: i) the proposed
Matching-SCA algorithm achieves comparable performance and a faster convergence compared to
ADMM-SCA; ii) the proposed generalized framework realizes scenario-adaptive communications
and outperforms traditional multi-antenna NOMA approaches in various communication regimes.

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are envisioned to be extensively employed for assisting wireless
communications in Internet of Things (IoT) applications. On the other hand, terahertz (THz) enabled
intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is expected to be one of the core enabling technologies for
forthcoming beyond-5G wireless communications that promise a broad range of data-demand applications.
In this paper, we propose a UAV-mounted IRS (UIRS) communication system over THz bands for confidential
data dissemination from an access point (AP) towards multiple ground user equipments (UEs) in IoT
networks. Specifically, the AP intends to send data to the scheduled UE, while unscheduled UEs may
pose potential adversaries. To protect information messages and the privacy of the scheduled UE,
we aim to devise an energy-efficient multi-UAV covert communication scheme, where the UIRS is for
reliable data transmissions, and an extra UAV is utilized as a cooperative jammer generating artificial
noise (AN) to degrade unscheduled UEs detection. We then formulate a novel minimum average energy
efficiency (mAEE) optimization problem, targetting to improve the covert throughput and reduce
UAVs' propulsion energy consumption subject to the covertness requirement, which is determined
analytically. Since the optimization problem is non-convex, we tackle it via the block successive
convex approximation (BSCA) approach to iteratively solve a sequence of approximated convex sub-problems,
designing the binary user scheduling, AP's power allocation, maximum AN jamming power, IRS beamforming,
and both UAVs' trajectory planning. Finally, we present a low-complex overall algorithm for system
performance enhancement with complexity and convergence analysis. Numerical results are provided
to verify our analysis and demonstrate significant outperformance of our design over other existing
benchmark schemes.

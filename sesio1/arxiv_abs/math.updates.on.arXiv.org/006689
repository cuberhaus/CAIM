Identifying entanglement-based order parameters characterizing topological systems, in particular
topological superconductors and topological insulators, has remained a major challenge for the
physics of quantum matter in the last two decades. Here we show that the long-distance, bipartite
squashed entanglement between the edges of a many-body system, defined in terms of the edge-to-edge
quantum conditional mutual information, is the natural nonlocal order parameter for topological
superconductors in one dimension as well as in quasi one-dimensional geometries. For the Kitaev
chain in the entire topological phase, the edge-to-edge squashed entanglement is quantized to
log(2)/2, half the maximal Bell-state entanglement, and vanishes in the trivial phase. Such topological
squashed entanglement exhibits the correct scaling at the quantum phase transition, is stable
in the presence of interactions, and is robust against disorder and local perturbations. Moreover,
quantum conditional mutual information and squashed entanglement defined with respect to different
multipartitions discriminate topological superconductors from symmetry breaking magnets,
as shown by comparing the fermionic Kitaev chain and the spin-1/2 Ising model in transverse field.
For systems featuring multiple topological phases with different numbers of edge modes, like the
quasi 1D Kitaev ladder, topological squashed entanglement counts the number of Majorana excitations
and distinguishes the different topological phases of the system. In fact, we show that the edge
quantum conditional mutual information and the edge squashed entanglement remain valid detectors
of topological superconductivity even for systems, like the Kitaev tie with long-range hopping,
featuring geometrical frustration and a suppressed bulk-edge correspondence.

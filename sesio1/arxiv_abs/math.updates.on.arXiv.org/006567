The design of grid-connected distributed energy systems (DES) has been investigated extensively
as an optimisation problem in the past, but most studies do not include nonlinear constraints associated
with unbalanced alternating current (AC) power flow in distribution networks. Previous studies
that do consider AC power flow use either less complex balanced formulations applicable to transmission
networks, or iterative linearisations derived from local power flow solutions and prior knowledge
of the design. To address these limitations, this study proposes a new algorithm for obtaining DES
design decisions subject to nonlinear power flow models. The use of regularised complementarity
reformulations for operational constraints that contain binary variables is proposed. This allows
the use of large-scale nonlinear solvers that can find locally optimal solutions, eliminating
the need for linearisations and prior knowledge while improving accuracy. DES design models with
either multiphase optimal power flow (MOPF), which captures inherent phase imbalances present
in distribution networks, or balanced optimal power flow formulations (OPF) are tested using a
modified version of the unbalanced IEEE EU low-voltage network. Results are compared with a popular
linear DES design framework, which proposes an infeasible operational schedule when tested with
MOPF, while the fixed design alone produces the highest annualised costs. Despite the increased
complexity, DES with MOPF obtains the best solution, enabling a greater integration of solar capacity
and reducing total annualised cost when compared to DES with OPF. The new algorithm achieves a 19%
improvement when compared with solving a bi-level model for DES with OPF, where the entire binary
topology in the nonlinear model is fixed. The study therefore enables the acquisition of DES designs
that can work symbiotically within distribution networks.

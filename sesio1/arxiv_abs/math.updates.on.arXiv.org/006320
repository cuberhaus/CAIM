We introduce an algebraicity criteria. It has the following form: under certain conditions, an
analytic subvariety of some algebriac variety over a global field $K$, if it contains many $K$-points,
then it is algebraic over $K.$ This gives a way to show the transcendence of points via the transcendence
of analytic subvarieties. Such a situation often appears when we have a dynamical system, because
we can often produce infinitely many points from one point via iterates. Combing this criteria and
the study of invariant subvarieties, we get some results on the transcendence in arithmetic dynamics.
We get a characterization of products of B\"ottcher coordinates or products of multiplicative
canonical heights for polynomial dynamical pairs to be algebraic. For this, we studied the invariant
subvarieties for product of endomorphisms. In particular, we partially generate Medvedev-Scanlon's
classification of invariant subvarieties of split polynomial maps to separable endomorphisms
on $(\mathbb{P}^1)^N$ in any characteristic. We also get some hight dimensional partial generalization
via introducing of a notion of independence. We then study dominant endomorphisms $f$ on $\mathbb{A}^N$
over a number field of algebraic degree $d\geq 2$. We show that in most of the cases (e.g. when such
an endomorphism extends to an endomorphism on $\mathbb{P}^N$), there are many analytic curves
centered at infinity which are periodic. We show that for most of them, it is algebraic if and only
if it contains one algebraic point. We also study the periodic curves. We show that for most of $f$,
all periodic curves has degree at most $2$. When $N=2$, we get a more precise classification result.
We show that under a condition which is satisfied for a general $f$, if $f$ has infinitely many periodic
curves, then $f$ is homogenous up to a changing of origin.

Wireless communications and sensing at terahertz (THz) band are increasingly investigated as
promising short-range technologies because of the availability of high operational bandwidth
at THz. In order to address the extremely high attenuation at THz, ultra-massive multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) antenna systems have been proposed for THz communications to compensate
propagation losses. However, the cost and power associated with fully digital beamformers of these
huge antenna arrays are prohibitive. In this paper, we develop wideband hybrid beamformers based
on both model-based and model-free techniques for a new group-of-subarrays (GoSA) ultra-massive
MIMO structure in low-THz band. Further, driven by the recent developments to save the spectrum,
we propose beamformers for a joint ultra-massive MIMO radar-communications system, wherein the
base station serves multi-antenna user equipment (RX), and tracks radar targets by generating
multiple beams toward both RX and the targets. We formulate the GoSA beamformer design as an optimization
problem to provide a trade-off between the unconstrained communications beamformers and the desired
radar beamformers. To mitigate the beam split effect at THz band arising from frequency-independent
analog beamformers, we propose a phase correction technique to align the beams of multiple subcarriers
toward a single physical direction. To further decrease the ultra-massive MIMO computational
complexity and enhance robustness, we also implement deep learning solutions to the proposed model-based
hybrid beamformers. Numerical experiments demonstrate that both techniques outperform the conventional
approaches in terms of spectral efficiency and radar beampatterns, as well as exhibiting less hardware
cost and computation time.

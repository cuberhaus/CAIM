In the present thesis, we are interested in the description of the dynamics of flows on large scales.
In this context, the fluids are governed by rotational, weak compressibility and stratification
effects, whose importance is measured by adimensional numbers: the Rossby, Mach and Froude numbers.
The first part of the thesis is dedicated to the analysis of a 3D multi-scale problem called the full
Navier-Stokes-Fourier system where variations in density and temperature are considered and
in addition we take into account the Coriolis, centrifugal and gravitational forces. We study,
in the framework of weak solutions, the combined incompressible and fast rotation limits in the
regime of small Mach, Froude and Rossby numbers and for general ill-prepared initial data. In the
case when the Mach number is of higher order than the Rossby number, we prove that the limit dynamics
is described by an incompressible Oberbeck-Boussinesq type system. Conversely, when the Mach
and Rossby numbers have the same order of magnitude, we show convergence towards a quasi-geostrophic
type equation. Following "le fil rouge" of the asymptotic analysis, in the second part of the thesis,
we examine the effects of high rotation for the 2D incompressible density-dependent Euler system.
Now, the main goal is to perform the singular limit in the fast rotation regime, showing the convergence
of the Euler equations to a quasi-homogeneous type system. The proof of convergence of the two primitive
problems towards the reduced models is based on a compensated compactness argument. The key point
is to use the structure of the underlying system of Poincar\'e waves in order to identify some compactness
properties for suitable quantities. Compared to previous results, our method enables to treat
the whole range of parameters in the multi-scale problem, and also to reach and go beyond the critical
choice $Fr=\sqrt{Ma}$.

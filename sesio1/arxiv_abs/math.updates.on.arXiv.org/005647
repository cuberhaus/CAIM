The evolution of complex cellular life involved two major transitions: the encapsulation of self-replicating
genetic entities into cellular units and the aggregation of individual genes into a collectively
replicating genome. In this paper, we formulate a minimal model of the evolution of proto-chromosomes
within protocells. We model a simple protocell composed of two types of genes: a "fast gene" with
an advantage for gene-level self-replication and a "slow gene" that replicates more slowly at the
gene level, but which confers an advantage for protocell-level reproduction. Protocell-level
replication capacity depends on cellular composition of fast and slow genes. We use a partial differential
equation to describe how the composition of genes within protocells evolves over time under within-cell
and between-cell competition. We find that the gene-level advantage of fast replicators casts
a long shadow on the multilevel dynamics of protocell evolution: no level of between-protocell
competition can produce coexistence of the fast and slow replicators when the two genes are equally
needed for protocell-level reproduction. By introducing a "dimer replicator" consisting of a
linked pair of the slow and fast genes, we show analytically that coexistence between the two genes
can be promoted in pairwise multilevel competition between fast and dimer replicators, and provide
numerical evidence for coexistence in trimorphic competition between fast, slow, and dimer replicators.
Our results suggest that dimerization, or the formation of a simple chromosome-like dimer replicator,
can help to overcome the shadow of lower-level selection and work in concert with deterministic
multilevel selection to allow for the coexistence of two genes that are complementary at the protocell-level
but compete at the level of individual gene-level replication.

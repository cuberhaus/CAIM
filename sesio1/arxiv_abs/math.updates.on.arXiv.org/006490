In this paper, we study the global wellposedness of a radiation hydrodynamics model with viscosity
and thermal conductivity. It is now well-understood that, unlike the compressible Euler equations
whose smooth solutions must blow up in finite time no matter how small and how smooth the initial data
is, the dissipative structure of such a radiation hydrodynamics model can indeed guarantee that
its one-dimensional Cauchy problem admits a unique global smooth solution provided that the initial
data is sufficiently small, while for large initial data, even if the heat conductivity is taken
into account but the viscosity effect is ignored, shock type singularities must appear infinite
time for smooth solutions of the Cauchy problem of one-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics model
with thermal conductivity and zero viscosity. Thus a natural question is, if effects of both the
viscosity and the thermal conductivity are considered, does the one-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics
model with viscosity and thermal conductivity exist a unique global large solution? We give an affirmative
answer to this problem and show in this paper that the initial-boundary value problem to the radiation
hydrodynamics model in an one-dimensional periodic box T \cong R/Z with viscosity and thermal conductivity
does exist a unique global smooth solution for any large initial data. The main ingredient in our
analysis is to introduce some delicate estimates, especially an improved L^m([0, T], L^\infty(T))-estimate
on the absolute temperature for some m \in N and a pointwise estimate between the absolute temperature,
the specific volume, and the first-order spatial derivative of the macro radiation flux, to deduce
the desired positive lower and upper bounds on the density and the absolute temperature.

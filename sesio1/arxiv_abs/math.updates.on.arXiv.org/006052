A rigorous proof of no finite time blowup of the 3D Incompressible Navier Stokes equations in $\mathbb{R}^3/\mathbb{Z}^3$
has been shown by corresponding author of the present work \cite{Moschandreou0}. Smooth solutions
for the $z-$component momentum equation $u_z$ assuming the $x$ and $y$ component equations have
vortex smooth solutions have been proven to exist, however the Clay Institute Millennium problem
on the Navier Stokes equations was not proven for a general enough vorticity form and \cite{Moschandreou0},
\cite{Moschandreou} and references therein do not prove this as previously thought. The idea was
to show that Geometric Algebra can be applied to all three momentum equations by adding any two of
the three equations and thus combinatorially producing either $u_x$, $u_y$ or $u_z$ as smooth solutions
at a time. It was shown that using the Gagliardo-Nirenberg and Pr\'{e}kopa-Leindler inequalities
together with Debreu's theorem and some auxiliary theorems proven in \cite{Moschandreou0} that
there is no finite time blowup for 3D Navier Stokes equations for a constant vorticity in the $z$ direction.
In part I of the present work it is shown that using Hardy's inequality for $u^2_z$ term in the Navier
Stokes Equations that a resulting PDE emerges which can be coupled to auxiliary pde's which give
us wave equations. In Part II it is shown for the first time that the full system of 3D Incompressible
Navier Stokes equations without the above mentioned coupling consists of non-smooth solutions.
In particular if $u_x$, $u_y$ satisfy a non-constant $z$- vorticity for 3D vorticity $\vec{\omega}$,
then higher order derivatives blowup in finite time but $u_z$ remains regular. So a counterexample
of the Navier Stokes equations having smooth solutions is shown. A specific time dependent vorticity
is also considered.

Existing works on grant-free access, proposed to support massive machine-type communication
(mMTC) for the Internet of things (IoT), mainly concentrate on narrow band systems under flat fading.
However, little is known about massive grant-free access for wideband systems under frequency-selective
fading. This paper investigates massive grant-free access in a wideband system under frequency-selective
fading. First, we present an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based massive
grant-free access scheme. Then, we propose two different but equivalent models for the received
pilot signal, which are essential for designing various device activity detection and channel
estimation methods for OFDM-based massive grant-free access. One directly models the received
signal for actual devices, whereas the other can be interpreted as a signal model for virtual devices.
Next, we investigate statistical device activity detection under frequency-selective Rayleigh
fading based on the two signal models. We first model device activities as unknown deterministic
quantities and propose three maximum likelihood (ML) estimation-based device activity detection
methods with different detection accuracies and computation times. We also model device activities
as random variables with a known joint distribution and propose three maximum a posterior probability
(MAP) estimation-based device activity methods, which further enhance the accuracies of the corresponding
ML estimation-based methods. Optimization techniques and matrix analysis are applied in designing
and analyzing these methods. Finally, numerical results show that the proposed statistical device
activity detection methods outperform existing state-of-the-art device activity detection
methods under frequency-selective Rayleigh fading.

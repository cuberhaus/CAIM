This paper studies inference in randomized controlled trials with multiple treatments, where
treatment status is determined according to a "matched tuples" design. Here, by a matched tuples
design, we mean an experimental design where units are sampled i.i.d. from the population of interest,
grouped into "homogeneous" blocks with cardinality equal to the number of treatments, and finally,
within each block, each treatment is assigned exactly once uniformly at random. We first study estimation
and inference for matched tuples designs in the general setting where the parameter of interest
is a vector of linear contrasts over the collection of average potential outcomes for each treatment.
Parameters of this form include but are not limited to standard average treatment effects used to
compare one treatment relative to another. We first establish conditions under which a sample analogue
estimator is asymptotically normal and construct a consistent estimator of its corresponding
asymptotic variance. Combining these results establishes the asymptotic validity of tests based
on these estimators. In contrast, we show that a common testing procedure based on a linear regression
with block fixed effects and the usual heteroskedasticity-robust variance estimator is invalid
in the sense that the resulting test may have a limiting rejection probability under the null hypothesis
strictly greater than the nominal level. We then apply our results to study the asymptotic properties
of what we call "fully-blocked" $2^K$ factorial designs, which are simply matched tuples designs
applied to a full factorial experiment. Leveraging our previous results, we establish that our
estimator achieves a lower asymptotic variance under the fully-blocked design than that under
any stratified factorial design. A simulation study and empirical application illustrate the
practical relevance of our results.

Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is expected to revolutionize the existing integrated sensing and
communication (ISAC) system and promise a more flexible joint design. Nevertheless, the existing
works on ISAC mainly focus on exploring the performance of both functionalities simultaneously
during the entire considered period, which may ignore the practical asymmetric sensing and communication
requirements. In particular, always forcing sensing along with communication may make it is harder
to balance between these two functionalities due to shared spectrum resources and limited transmit
power. To address this issue, we propose a new integrated periodic sensing and communication mechanism
for the UAV-enabled ISAC system to provide a more flexible trade-off between two integrated functionalities.
Specifically, the system achievable rate is maximized via jointly optimizing UAV trajectory,
user association, target sensing selection, and transmit beamforming, while meeting the sensing
frequency and beam pattern gain requirement for the given targets. Despite that this problem is
highly non-convex and involves closely coupled integer variables, we derive the closed-form optimal
beamforming vector to dramatically reduce the complexity of beamforming design, and present a
tight lower bound of the achievable rate to facilitate UAV trajectory design. Based on the above
results, we propose a penalty-based algorithm to efficiently solve the considered problem. The
optimal achievable rate and the optimal UAV location are analyzed under a special case of infinity
number of antennas. Furthermore, we prove the structural symmetry between the optimal solutions
in different ISAC frames without location constraints and propose an efficient algorithm for solving
the problem with location constraints.

We study the long-term behavior of the two-thinning variant of the classical balls-and-bins model.
In this model, an overseer is provided with uniform random allocation of $m$ balls into $n$ bins in
an on-line fashion. For each ball, the overseer could reject its allocation and place the ball into
a new bin drawn independently at random. The purpose of the overseer is to reduce the maximum load
of the bins, which is defined as the difference between the maximum number of balls in a single bin
and $m/n$, i.e., the average number of balls among all bins. We provide tight estimates for three
quantities: the lowest maximum load that could be achieved at time $m$, the lowest maximum load that
could be achieved uniformly over the entire time interval $[m]:=\{1, 2, \cdots, m\}$, and the lowest
\emph{typical} maximum load that could be achieved over the interval $[m]$, where the typicality
means that the maximum load holds for $1-o(1)$ portion of the times in $[m]$. We show that when $m$
and $n$ are sufficiently large, a typical maximum load of $(\log n)^{1/2+o(1)}$ can be achieved
with high probability, asymptotically the same as the optimal maximum load that could be achieved
at time $m$. However, for any strategy, the maximal load among all times in the interval $[m]$ is $\Omega\big(\frac{\log
n}{\log\log n}\big)$ with high probability. A strategy achieving this bound is provided. An explanation
for this gap is provided by our optimal strategies as follows. To control the typical load, we restrain
the maximum load for some time, during which we accumulate more and more bins with relatively high
load. After a while, we have to employ for a short time a different strategy to reduce the number of
relatively heavily loaded bins, at the expanse of temporarily inducing high load in a few bins.

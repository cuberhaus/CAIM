The continuous-time differential Lyapunov equation is widely used in linear optimal control theory,
a branch of mathematics and engineering. In quantum physics, it is known to appear in Markovian descriptions
of linear (quadratic Hamiltonian, linear equations of motion) open quantum systems, typically
from quantum master equations. Despite this, the Lyapunov equation is seldom considered a fundamental
formalism for linear open quantum systems. In this work we aim to change that. We establish the Lyapunov
equation as a fundamental and efficient formalism for linear open quantum systems that can go beyond
the limitations of various standard quantum master equation descriptions, while remaining of
much less complexity than general exact formalisms. This also provides valuable insights for non-Hermitian
quantum physics. In particular, we derive the Lyapunov equation for the most general number conserving
linear system in a lattice of arbitrary dimension and geometry, connected to an arbitrary number
of baths at different temperatures and chemical potentials. Three slightly different forms of
the Lyapunov equation are derived via an equation of motion approach, by making increasing levels
of controlled approximations, without reference to any quantum master equation. Then we discuss
their relation with quantum master equations, positivity, accuracy and additivity issues, the
possibility of describing dark states, general perturbative solutions in terms of single-particle
eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the system, and quantum regression formulas. Our derivation gives
a clear understanding of the origin of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian describing the dynamics and
separates it from the effects of quantum and thermal fluctuations. Many of these results would have
been hard to obtain via standard quantum master equation approaches.

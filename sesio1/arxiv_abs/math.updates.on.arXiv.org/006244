In this article we consider theorems on expansions of iterated Ito and Stratonovich stochastic
integrals. These theorems open up a new direction for study of iterated Ito and Stratonovich stochastic
integrals. The expansions based on multiple and iterated Fourier-Legendre series as well as on
multiple and iterated trigonomectic Fourier series converging in the mean and pointwise are presented
in the article. Some of these theorems are connected with the iterated stochastic integrals of multiplicities
$1-5$. Also we consider two theorems on expansions of iterated Ito stochastic integrals of arbitrary
multiplicity $k$ $(k\in\mathbb{N})$ based on generalized multiple Fourier series converging
in the sense of norm in Hilbert space $L_2([t, T]^k)$ as well as two theorems on expansions of iterated
Stratonovich stochastic integrals of arbitrary multiplicity $k$ $(k\in\mathbb{N})$ based on
generalized iterated Fourier series converging pointwise. On the base of the presented theorems
we formulate three Hypotheses on expansions of iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals of
arbitrary multiplicity $k$ $(k\in\mathbb{N})$ based on generalized multiple Fourier series
converging in the sense of norm in Hilbert space $L_2([t, T]^k).$ The proof of Hypothesis $2$ is given
under the condition of convergence of trace series. The mentioned iterated Stratonovich stochastic
integrals are part of the Taylor-Stratonovich expansion. Moreover, most of the considered expansions
of iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals contain only one operation of the limit transition
and substantially simpler than their analogues for iterated Ito stochastic integrals. The results
of the article can be applied to numerical integration of Ito stochastic differential equations.
Also, the results of the article were reformulated in the form of theorems of the Wong-Zakai type
for iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals.

Most biochemical reactions in living cells are open systems interacting with environment through
chemostats to exchange energy/materials. At a mesoscopic scale, the number of each species in those
biochemical reactions can be modeled by a random time-changed Poisson processes. To characterize
macroscopic behaviors in the large volume limit, the law of large numbers in the path space determines
a mean-field limit nonlinear reaction rate equation (RRE) describing the dynamics of the concentration
of species, while the WKB expansion for the chemical master equation(CME) yields a Hamilton-Jacobi
equation(HJE) and the corresponding Lagrangian gives the good rate function in the large deviation
principle. In this paper, we propose a gauge-symmetry criteria for a class of nonequilibrium chemical
reactions including enzyme reactions, which identifies a new concept of balance within the same
reaction vector due to flux grouping degeneracy. We (i) formulate an Onsager gradient flow structure
in terms of the energy landscape given by a steady solution to the HJE; (ii) find transition paths
between multiple nonequilibrium steady states, which is given by a gauge-modified time reversed
path with associated path affinities and energy barriers. We illustrate this idea through a bistable
catalysis reaction and compute the energy barrier for the transition path connecting two nonequilibrium
steady states via its energy landscape. A simple diffusion approximations via Kramers-Moyal expansion
for CME is equivalent to a quadratic approximation for the associated Hamiltonian, only valid near
solutions to RRE. A new drift-diffusion approximation sharing the same gauge-symmetry is constructed
based on gradient flow formulation and is used to compute energy barrier for transition paths. An
optimal control problem in an undefined time horizon is formulated for the most probable path connecting
two stable states.

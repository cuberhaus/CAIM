In this work we study the stability properties of the equilibrium points of deterministic epidemic
models with nonconstant population size. Models with nonconstant population have been studied
in the past only in particular cases, two of which we review and combine. Our main result shows that
for simple "matrix epidemic models" introduced in [1], an explicit general formula for the reproduction
number and the corresponding "weak stability alternative" still holds, under small modifications,
for models with nonconstant population size, and even when the model allows for vaccination and
loss of immunity. The importance of this result is clear once we note that the models of [1] include
a large number of viral and bacterial models of epidemic propagation, including for example the
totality of homogeneous COVID-19 models. To better understand the nature of the result, we emphasize
that the models proposed in [1] and considered here are extensions of the SIR-PH model, which is essentially
characterized by a phase-type distribution that models transitions between the "disease/infectious
compartments". In these cases, the reproduction number and a certain Lyapunov function for the
disease free equilibrium are explicitly expressible. Not surprisingly, accounting for varying
demography, loss of immunity, and vaccinations lead to several challenges. One of the most important
is that a varying population size leads to multiple endemic equilibrium points: this is in contrast
with "classic models" which in general admit unique disease-free and endemic equilibria. As a special
case of our analysis, we consider a "first approximation" (FA) of our model, which coincides with
the constant-demography model often studied in the literature, and for which more explicit results
are available. Furthermore, we propose a second heuristic approximation named "intermediate
approximation" (IA).

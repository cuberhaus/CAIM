Integer programming (IP) is an important and challenging problem. Approximate methods have shown
promising performance on both effectiveness and efficiency for solving the IP problem. However,
we observed that a large fraction of variables solved by some iterative approximate methods fluctuate
around their final converged discrete states in very long iterations. Inspired by this observation,
we aim to accelerate these approximate methods by early fixing these fluctuated variables to their
converged states while not significantly harming the solution accuracy. To this end, we propose
an early fixing framework along with the approximate method. We formulate the whole early fixing
process as a Markov decision process, and train it using imitation learning. A policy network will
evaluate the posterior probability of each free variable concerning its discrete candidate states
in each block of iterations. Specifically, we adopt the powerful multi-headed attention mechanism
in the policy network. Extensive experiments on our proposed early fixing framework are conducted
to three different IP applications: constrained linear programming, MRF energy minimization
and sparse adversarial attack. The former one is linear IP problem, while the latter two are quadratic
IP problems. We extend the problem scale from regular size to significantly large size. The extensive
experiments reveal the competitiveness of our early fixing framework: the runtime speeds up significantly,
while the solution quality does not degrade much, even in some cases it is available to obtain better
solutions. Our proposed early fixing framework can be regarded as an acceleration extension of
ADMM methods for solving integer programming. The source codes are available at \url{https://github.com/SCLBD/Accelerated-Lpbox-ADMM}.

Based on the perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) approach and the quasi-two-body approximation,
we have studied the three-body decays B^{0}_{s}\rightarrow \psi(3686,3770)\emph{K}\pi, which
include the contributions of the intermediate resonances \bar{\emph{K}}^{*}_{0}(1430)^{0},
\bar{\emph{K}}^{*}(892)^{0}, \bar{\emph{K}}^{*}(1410)^{0}, \bar{\emph{K}}^{*}(1680)^{0},
and \bar{\emph{K}}^{*}_{2}(1430)^{0}. The time-like form factors corresponding to the distribution
amplitudes of the S, P, and D-wave of the kaon-pion pair have been adopted in the parameterized form,
which describe the interactions between \emph{K} and \pi in the resonance region. First, the decays
B^{0}_{s}\rightarrow \psi(2S,1D)\emph{K}^{-}\pi^{+} have been calculated followed by the
calculation of the branching ratios of the decays B^{0}_{s}\rightarrow \psi(3686,3770)\emph{K}^{-}\pi^{+}
using the 2S-1D mixing scheme. In addition, the pQCD predictions for the decays B^{0}_{s}\rightarrow
\psi(2S,1D)\emph{K}\pi and B^{0}_{s}\rightarrow \psi(3686,3770)\emph{K}\pi have been obtained
using the narrow-width approximation relation given by the Clebsch-Gorden coefficients. Our
work shows that the \bar{\emph{K}}^{*}(892)^{0} resonance is the main contributor to the total
decay, and the branching ratio and the longitudinal polarization fraction of the \psi(2S)\bar{\emph{K}}^{*}(892)^{0}
decay mode agree well with the currently available data within errors. Furthermore, the theoretical
predictions of the \psi(2S) and \psi(3686) decay modes are very close, indicating that they can
be regarded as the same meson state. Finally, the pQCD predictions for branching ratios of decays
B^{0}_{s}\rightarrow \psi(3686,3770)\emph{K}\pi are of the order of 10^{-5} and 10^{-6}, respectively,
which can be verified using the ongoing LHCb and Belle II experiments.

We develop the general laws of the theory of the almost empty anchored magnetic flux tubes (MFT) with
B~10^7G, starting from tachocline to the surface of the Sun. The main result of this theory is the
formation of the solar axions and the magnetic O-loop inside the MFT near the tachocline. In this
magnetic O-loop (based on the Kolmogorov turbulent cascade) the axions are converted to photons,
producing the axion origin photons near the tachocline. On the other hand, high-energy photons
from the radiation zone through the axion-photon oscillations in the O-loop produce the axions
of photon origin under the sunspot. This means that at such strong magnetic fields the Parker-Biermann
cooling effect of MFT develops due to the "disappearance" of the Parker's convective heat transport,
and consequently, the temperature in the lower part of the magnetic tube with the help of the axions
of photonic origin near the tachocline. As a result, a free path for photons of axion origin opens
from the tachocline to the photosphere! We show that the high-energy photons passing from the radiation
zone turn into axions, which almost completely eliminates the radiation heating of the almost empty
MFT. A certain flux of photons coming from the radiation zone through the tachocline, passes through
the "ring" of a strong magnetic tube by virtue of convective heating. It allows to determine the velocity
and the lifetime of the MFT before the reconnection, from tachocline to the surface of the Sun, as
well as the rate of the MFT reconnection near the tachocline. Finally, we show that the formation
of sunspot cycles is is the manifestation of dark matter -- solar axions in the core of the Sun, whose
modulations are controlled by the 11-year modulation of asymmetric dark matter density in the solar
interior.

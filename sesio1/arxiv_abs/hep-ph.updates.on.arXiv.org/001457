The STAR isobar data of $^{96}$Ru+$^{96}$Ru and $^{96}$Zr+$^{96}$Zr collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=
200$ GeV show that ratios of observables ($R_{\mathcal{O}}$) such as the multiplicity distribution,
$p(N_{\mathrm{ch}})$, and the harmonic flow, $v_n$, deviate from unity, when presented as a function
of centrality, $c$. These deviations have been attributed to the differences in the shape and radial
profiles between $^{96}$Ru and $^{96}$Zr nuclei. In addition, the ratios $R_{\mathcal{O}}(x)$
depend on the choice of the event activity variable $x$, which could be either $N_{\mathrm{ch}}$
or centrality. We estimate the difference $\Delta R$ between these two choices, based on the published
$p(N_{\mathrm{ch}})$, as well as those from a multiphase transport (AMPT) model with varied nuclear
structure parameters: nuclear radius ($R_0$), surface diffuseness ($a_0$), quadrupole deformation
($\beta_2$), and octupole deformation ($\beta_3$). In contrary to $R_{v_n}(c)$, $R_{v_n}(N_{\mathrm{ch}})$
is nearly independent of the analysis approaches, suggesting that nonflow effects are better controlled
by $N_{\mathrm{ch}}$ than $c$. The ratios of observables sensitive to the chiral magnetic effect
(CME) are also much closer to unity for $x=N_{\mathrm{ch}}$ than $x=c$, indicating that the ratios
calculated at the same $N_{\mathrm{ch}}$ provide a better baseline for the non-CME background.
According to the AMPT results, the dominant parameter for $\Delta R$ is $a_0$, while $R_0$ and $\beta_n$
are only important in central collisions. The published $p(N_{\mathrm{ch}})$ is also used to estimate
$\Delta R_{\left\langle p_{\mathrm{T}}\right\rangle}$ for mean transverse momentum, which
is non-negligible compared with $R_{\left\langle p_{\mathrm{T}}\right\rangle}-1$.

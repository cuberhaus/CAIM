Measuring the neutrino mixing parameter $\sin^2\theta_{13}$ to the sub-percent precision level
could be necessary in the next ten years for the precision unitary test of the PMNS matrix. In this
work, we discuss the possibility of such a measurement with reactor antineutrinos. We find that
a single liquid scintillator detector on a reasonable scale could achieve the goal. We propose to
install a detector of $\sim10$\% energy resolution at about 2.0~km from the reactors. The integrated
luminosity requirement is about 150~$kton\cdot GW\cdot year$, corresponding to 3 years' operation
of a 4~kton detector near a reactor complex of 17.4 GW thermal power like Daya Bay. Unlike the previous
$\theta_{13}$ experiments with identical near and far detectors, whose rate uncertainty is suppressed
by the near-far relative measurement and the optimal baseline is at the first oscillation maximum
of about 1.8~km, a single-detector measurement prefers to offset the baseline from the oscillation
maximum. At low statistics $< 10$~$kton\cdot GW\cdot year$, the rate uncertainty dominates the
systematics, and the optimal baseline is about 1.3~km. At higher statistics, the spectral shape
uncertainty becomes dominant, and the optimal baseline shifts to about 2.0~km. Impacts of other
factors on the precision $\sin^2\theta_{13}$ measurement are also discussed. We have assumed
that the TAO experiment will improve our understanding of the spectral shape uncertainty, which
gives the highest precision measurement of reactor antineutrino spectrum for neutrino energy
in the range of 3--6~MeV. The optimal baseline is $\sim 2.9$~km with a flat input spectral shape uncertainty
provided by the future summation model. The shape uncertainty would be the bottleneck of the $\sin^2\theta_{13}$
precision measurement, which is insensitive to the energy resolution and the precision of other
oscillation parameters.

Gradient jet tomography in high-energy heavy-ion collisions utilizes the asymmetric transverse
momentum broadening of a propagating parton in an inhomogeneous medium. Such broadening is studied
within a path integral description of the evolution of the Wigner distribution for a propagating
parton in medium. Going beyond the eikonal approximation of multiple scattering, the evolution
operator in the transverse direction can be expressed as the functional integration over all classical
trajectories of a massive particle with the light-cone momentum $\omega$ as its mass. With a dipole
approximation of the Wilson line correlation function, evolution with the light-cone time $t$
is determined by the jet transport coefficient $\hat q$ that can vary with space and time. In a uniform
medium with a constant $\hat q_0$, the analytical solution to the Wigner distribution becomes a
typical drifted Gaussian in both transverse momentum and coordinate with the diffusion width $\sqrt{\hat
q_0t}$ and $\sqrt{\hat q_0t^3/3\omega^2}$, respectively. In the case of a simple Gaussian-like
transverse inhomogeneity with a spatial width $\sigma$ on top of a uniform medium, the final asymmetrical
momentum distribution can be calculated semi-analytically. The transverse asymmetry defined
for jet gradient tomography that characterizes the asymmetrical distribution is found to linearly
correlate with the initial transverse position of the propagating parton within the domain of the
inhomogeneity. It decreases with the parton energy $\omega$, increases with the propagation time
initially and saturates when the diffusion distance is much larger than the size of the inhomogeneity
or $t^3\gg 3\omega^2\sigma^2/\hat q_0$. The transverse momentum broadening due to the inhomogeneity
also saturates at late time in contrast to the continued increase with time if the drifted diffusion
in space is ignored.

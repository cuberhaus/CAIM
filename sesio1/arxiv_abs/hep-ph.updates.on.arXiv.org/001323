The cosmological constant term, $\Lambda$, in Einstein's equations has been for three decades
a building block of the concordance or standard $\Lambda$CDM model of cosmology. Although the latter
is not free of fundamental problems, it provides a good phenomenological description of the overall
cosmological observations. However, an interesting improvement in such a phenomenological description
and also a change in the theoretical status of the $\Lambda$-term occurs upon realizing that the
vacuum energy density, $\rho_{\textrm{vac}}$, is actually a "running quantity" in quantum field
theory in curved spacetime. Several works have shown that this option can compete with the $\Lambda$CDM
with a rigid $\Lambda$term. The so-called, "running vacuum models" (RVM) are characterized indeed
by a $\rho_{\textrm{vac}}$ which is evolving with time as a series of even powers of the Hubble parameter
and its time derivatives. This form has been motivated by renormalization group arguments in previous
works. Here we review a recent detailed computation by the authors of the renormalized energy-momentum
tensor of a non-minimally coupled scalar field with the help of adiabatic regularization. The final
result is noteworthy: $\rho_{\textrm{vac}}(H)$ takes the precise structure of the RVM, namely
a constant term plus a dynamical component $\sim H^2$ (which may be detectable in the present universe)
including also higher order effects $\mathcal{O}(H^4)$ which can be of interest during the early
stages of the cosmological evolution. Besides, it is most remarkable that such renormalized form
of $\rho_{\textrm{vac}}$ does not carry dangerous terms proportional to $m^4$, the quartic powers
of the masses of the fields, which are a well-known source of exceedingly large contributions to
the vacuum energy density and are directly responsible for fine tuning in the context of the CC problem.

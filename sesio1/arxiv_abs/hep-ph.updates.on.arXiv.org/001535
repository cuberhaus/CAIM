The electric ${\alpha}_{\pi}$ and magnetic ${\beta}_{\pi}$ charged pion Compton polarizabilities
are of fundamental interest in the low-energy sector of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). They characterize
the induced dipole moments of the pion during ${\gamma}{\pi}$ Compton scattering. Pion polarizabilities
affect the shape of the ${\gamma}{\pi}$ Compton scattering angular distribution.The combination
$({\alpha}_{\pi} - {\beta}_{\pi})$ was measured by: (1) CERN COMPASS via ${\pi} Z \rightarrow
{\pi} Z {\gamma}$ radiative pion Primakoff scattering in the nuclear Coulomb field, (2) SLAC PEP
Mark-II via two-photon production of pion pairs, ${\gamma} {\gamma} \rightarrow {\pi}^+ {\pi}^-$,
and (3) Mainz Microtron MAMI via radiative pion photoproduction from the proton, ${\gamma} p \rightarrow
{\gamma} {\pi}^+ n$. Ongoing and planned pion polarizability experiments (CERN COMPASS, BESIII
at Beijing, JLab at Newport News) are also described. The Mark-II pion polarizability 95% confidence
interval is approximately $0-11 \times 10^{-4} {fm}^{3}$, based on $({\alpha}_{\pi} - {\beta}_{\pi})
= (4.4 \pm 3.2) \times 10^{-4} {fm}^{3}$. The Mainz value $({\alpha}_{\pi} - {\beta}_{\pi}) = 11.6
\times 10^{-4} {fm}^{3}$ is excluded on the basis of a dispersion relations calculation which uses
the Mainz value as input, and gives significantly too large ${\gamma} {\gamma} \rightarrow {\pi}^{0}
{\pi}^{0}$ cross sections compared to DESY Crystal Ball data. To date, only the COMPASS polarizability
measurement has acceptably small uncertainties. Its value $({\alpha}_{\pi} - {\beta}_{\pi})
= (4.0 \pm 1.8) \times 10^{-4} {fm}^{3}$ agrees well with the two-loop ChPT prediction $({\alpha}_{\pi}
- {\beta}_{\pi}) = (5.7 \pm 1.0) \times 10^{-4} {fm}^{3}$, thereby strengthening the identification
of the pion with the Goldstone boson of QCD.

The search for a particle dark matter signal in terms of radiation produced by dark matter annihilation
or decay has to cope with the extreme faintness of the predicted signal and the presence of masking
astrophysical backgrounds. It has been shown that using the correlated information between the
dark matter distribution in the Universe with the fluctuations of the cosmic radiation fields has
the potential to allow setting apart a pure dark matter signal from astrophysical emissions, since
spatial fluctuations in the radiation field due to astrophysical sources and dark matter emission
have different features. The cross-correlation technique has been proposed and adopted for dark
matter studies by looking at dark matter halos (over-densities). In this paper we extend the technique
by focusing on the information on dark matter distribution offered by cosmic voids, and by looking
specifically at the gamma-ray dark matter emission: we show that, while being under-dense and therefore
producing a reduced emission as compared to halos, nevertheless in voids the relative size of the
cross-correlation signal due to decaying dark matter vs. astrophysical sources is significantly
more favourable, producing signal-to-background ratios $S/B$ (even significantly) larger than
1 for decay lifetimes up to $2 \times 10^{30}$ s. This is at variance with the case of halos, where $S/B$
is typically (even much) smaller than 1. We show that forthcoming galaxy surveys such as Euclid combined
with future generation gamma-ray detectors with improved specifications have the ability to provide
a hint of such a signal with a predicted significance up to $4.2\sigma$ for galaxies and $2.7\sigma$
for the cosmic shear. The bound on the dark matter lifetime attainable exploiting voids is predicted
to improve on current bounds in a mass range for the WIMP of $20\div200$ GeV.

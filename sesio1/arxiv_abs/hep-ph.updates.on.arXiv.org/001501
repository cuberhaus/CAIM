Heavy quarks have been instrumental for progress in our exploration of strong interactions. Quarkonium
in particular, a heavy quark-antiquark nonrelativistic bound state, has been at the root of several
revolutions. Quarkonium is endowed with a pattern of separated energy scales qualifying it as special
probe of complex environments. Its multiscale nature has made a description in Quantum Field Theory
particularly difficult up to the advent of Nonrelativistic Effective Field Theories. We will focus
on systems made by two or more heavy quarks. After considering some historical approaches based
on the potential models and the Wilson loop approach, we will introduce the contemporary nonrelativistic
effective field theory descriptions, in particular potential Nonrelativistic QCD which entails
the Schoedinger equation as zero order problem, define the potentials as matching coefficients
and allows systematic calculations of the physical properties. The effective field theory allows
us to explore quarkonium properties in the realm of QCD. In particular it allows us to make calculations
with unprecedented precision when high order perturbative calculations are possible and to systematically
factorize short from long range contributions where observables are sensitive to the nonperturbative
dynamics of QCD. Such effective field theory treatment can be extended at finite temperature and
in presence of gluonic and light quark excitations. We will show that in this novel theoretical framework,
quarkonium can play a crucial role for a number of problems at the frontier of our research, from the
investigation of the confinement dynamics in strong interactions to the study of deconfinement
and the phase diagram of nuclear matter, to the precise determination of Standard Model parameters
up to the emergence of exotics X Y Z states of an unprecedented nature.

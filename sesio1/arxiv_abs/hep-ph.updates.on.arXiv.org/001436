In this work, a flavour theory of a neutrino mass model based on $ A_{4} $ symmetry is considered to
explain the phenomenology of neutrino mixing. The spontaneous symmetry breaking of $ A_{4} $ symmetry
in this model leads to tribimaximal mixing in the neutrino sector at a leading order. We consider
the effect of $ Z_{2} \times Z_{2}$ invariant perturbations in neutrino sector and find the allowed
region of correction terms in the perturbation matrix that is consistent with 3$ \sigma $ ranges
of the experimental values of the mixing angles. We study the entanglement of this formalism on the
other phenomenological observables, such as $ \delta_{CP} $ phase, the neutrino oscillation probability
$ P(\nu_{\mu}\rightarrow \nu_{e} )$, the effective Majorana mass $ |m_{ee} |$ and $ |m^{eff}_{\nu
e} |$. A $ Z_{2} \times Z_{2}$ invariant perturbations in this model is introduced in the neutrino
sector which leads to testable predictions of $ \theta_{13} $ and CP violation. By changing the magnitudes
of perturbations in neutrino sector, one can generate viable values of $ \delta_{CP} $ and neutrino
oscillation parameters. Next we investigate the feasibility of charged lepton flavour violation
in type-I seesaw models with leptonic flavour symmetries at high energy that leads to tribimaximal
neutrino mixing. We consider an effective theory with an $A_{4} \times Z_{2} \times Z_{2} $ symmetry,
which after spontaneous symmetry breaking at high scale which is much higher than the electroweak
scale leads to charged lepton flavour violation processes once the heavy Majorana neutrino mass
degeneracy is lifted either by renormalization group effects or by a soft breaking of the $ A_{4}
$ symmetry. In this context the implications for charged lepton flavour violation processes like
$ \mu \rightarrow e \gamma $, $ \tau \rightarrow e \gamma $, $ \tau \rightarrow \mu \gamma $ are discussed.

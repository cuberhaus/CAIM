We perform maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) for single and double flavor ultralight dark matter
(ULDM) models using the Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves (SPARC) database. These
estimates are compared to MLEs for several commonly used cold dark matter (CDM) models. By comparing
various CDM models we find, in agreement with previous studies, that the Burkert and Einasto models
tend to perform better than other commonly used CDM models. We focus on comparisons between the Einasto
and ULDM models and analyze cases for which the ULDM particle masses are: free to vary; and fixed.
For each of these analyses, we perform fits assuming the soliton and halo profiles are: summed together;
and matched at a given radius. When we let the particle masses vary, we find a negligible preference
for any particular range of particle masses, within $10^{-25}\,\text{eV}\leq m\leq10^{-19}\,\text{eV}$,
when assuming the summed models. For the matched models, however, we find that almost all galaxies
prefer particles masses in the range $10^{-23}\,\text{eV}\lesssim m\lesssim10^{-20}\,\text{eV}$.
For both double flavor models we find that most galaxies prefer approximately equal particle masses.
We find that the summed models give much larger variances with respect to the soliton-halo (SH) relation
than the matched models. When the particle masses are fixed, the matched models give median and mean
soliton and halo values that fall within the SH relation bounds, for most masses scanned. When the
particle masses are fixed in the fitting procedure, we find the best fit results for the particle
mass $m=10^{-20.5}\,\text{eV}$ (for the single flavor models) and $m_1=10^{-20.5}\,\text{eV}$,
$m_2=10^{-20.2}\,\text{eV}$ for the double flavor, matched model. We discuss how our study will
be furthered using a reinforcement learning algorithm.

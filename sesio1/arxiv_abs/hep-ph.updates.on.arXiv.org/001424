The description of final-state interactions (FSI) in the large phase space probed in neutrino experiments
poses a great challenge. In neutrino experiments, which operate under semi-inclusive conditions,
cascade models are commonly used for this task, while under exclusive conditions FSI can be treated
with relativistic optical potentials (ROP). We formulate conditions under which the ROP approach
and cascade model can be directly compared. We feed the NEUT cascade with events from a relativistic
distorted-wave impulse approximation calculation that uses the real part of an optical potential.
Cuts on the missing energy of the resulting events are applied to define a set of events that can be
directly compared to RDWIA calculations with the full optical potential. The NEUT cascade and ROP
agree for proton kinetic energies $T_p > 150$ MeV for carbon, oxygen and calcium nuclei when a realistic
nuclear density is used to introduce events in the cascade. For $T_p < 100$ MeV the ROP and NEUT cross
sections differ in shape and differences in magnitude are larger than 50 \%. Single transverse variables
allow to distinguish different approaches to FSI, but due to a large non-QE contribution the comparison
to T2K data does not give an unambiguous view of FSI. We discuss electron scattering and argue that
with a cut in missing energy FSI can be studied with minimal confounding factors in e.g. $e4\nu$.
The agreement of the ROP and NEUT for T2K conditions lends confidence to these models as a tool in oscillation
analyses for sufficiently large nucleon kinetic energies. These results urge for caution when
a cascade model is applied for small nucleon energies. The assessment of model assumptions relevant
to this region are strongly encouraged. This paper provides novel constraints on cascade models
from proton-nucleus scattering that can be easily applied to other neutrino event generators.

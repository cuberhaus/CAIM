In hadron physics, molecular-like multihadron states can interact with compact multiquark states.
The latter are modeled as bare states in the Hilbert space of a potential model. In this work, we study
several potential models relevant to the bare state, and solve their inverse scattering problems.
The first model, called "cc", is a separable potential model. We show that it can approximate (single-channel
short-range) $S$-wave near-threshold physics with an error of $\mathcal{O}(\beta^3/M_V^3)$,
where $\beta$ sets the maximum momentum of the near-threshold region and $M_V$ is the typical scale
of the potential. The second model, called "bc", serves as the bare-state-dominance approximation,
where interaction between continuum states is ignored. Under this model, even though the bare state
is always crucial for a bound state's generation, a shallow bound state naturally tends to have a
small bare-state proportion. Therefore, we need other quantities to quantify the importance of
the bare state. The last model, called "bcc", is a combination of the first two models. This model
not only serves as a correction to the bare-state-dominance approximation, but can also be used
to understand the interplay between quark and hadron degrees of freedom. This model naturally leads
to the presence of a Castillejo-Dalitz-Dyson (CDD) zero. We consider the energy decomposition
of a bound state. The potential ratio of the bare-continuum interaction to the continuum self-interaction
is proposed to understand how the bound state is generated. Model independently, an inequality
for the potential ratio is derived. Based on the model "bcc", the CDD zero can be used to estimate the
potential ratio. Finally, we apply these studies to the deuteron, $\rho$ meson, and $D_{s0}^*(2317)$,
and analyze their properties.

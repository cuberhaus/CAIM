We revisit the joint constraints in the mixed hot dark matter scenario in which both thermally produced
QCD axions and relic neutrinos are present. Upon recomputing the cosmological axion abundance
via recent advances in the literature, we improve the state-of-the-art analyses and provide updated
bounds on axion and neutrino masses. By avoiding approximate methods, such as the instantaneous
decoupling approximation, and limitations due to the limited validity of the perturbative approach
in QCD that forced to artificially divide the constraints from the axion-pion and the axion-gluon
production channels, we find robust and self-consistent limits. We investigate the two most popular
axion frameworks: KSVZ and DFSZ. From Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) light element abundances
data we find for the KSVZ axion $\Delta N_{\rm eff}<0.31$ and an axion mass bound $m_a < 0.53 $ eV (i.e.,
a bound on the axion decay constant $f_a > 1.07 \times 10^7$ GeV) both at $95\%$ CL. These BBN bounds
are improved to $\Delta N_{\rm eff}<0.14$ and $m_a< 0.16$ eV ($f_a > 3.56 \times 10^7$ GeV) if a prior
on the baryon energy density from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data is assumed. When instead
considering cosmological observations from the CMB temperature, polarization and lensing from
the Planck satellite combined with large scale structure data we find $\Delta N_{\rm eff}<0.23$,
$m_a< 0.28$ eV ($f_a > 2.02 \times 10^7$ GeV) and $\sum m_\nu < 0.16$ eV at $95\%$ CL. This corresponds
approximately to a factor of $5$ improvement in the axion mass bound with respect to the existing
limits. Very similar results are obtained for the DFSZ axion. We also forecast upcoming observations
from future CMB and galaxy surveys, showing that they could reach percent level errors for $m_a\sim
1$ eV.

The long persistent discrepancies in $b\,\to\,s\, \ell\, \ell$ quark level transitions continue
to be the ideal platform for an indirect search of new physics that lies beyond the SM. The measurements
of $R_K$, $R_{K^*}$, $P_5^{\prime}$, $\mathcal{B}(B_s\, \to\, \phi\, \mu^+\,\mu^-)$ and $\mathcal{B}(B_s\,
\to\, \mu^+\,\mu^-)$ persistently deviate from the standard model expectations. Similarly,
the new tests of lepton flavor universality performed using the isospin partners such as $B^0 \,
\to \, K_S^{0} \, \ell\,\ell$ and $B^+ \, \to \, K^{+*} \, \ell\,\ell$ exhibit the same pattern of
deviation in $R_{K_S^0}$ and $R_{K^{*+}}$ with the existing results. Motivated by these anomalies
we search for the patterns of new physics in the family of flavor changing neutral decays with neutral
leptons in the final state undergoing $b \, \to \,s\, \nu \, \bar{\nu}$ quark level transitions.
There are close relations between $b\,\to\,s\, \ell\, \ell$ and $b \, \to \,s\, \nu \, \bar{\nu}$
transitions not only in standard model but also in various beyond the standard model scenarios.
For beyond the standard model physics under the $\rm SU_L(2)$ gauge symmetry one can relate the left
handed charged leptons to the neutrinos. Moreover, there are several advantages of studying $b
\, \to \,s\, \nu \, \bar{\nu}$ transitions over $b\,\to\,s\, \ell\, \ell$ as they are free from various
hadronic uncertainties beyond the form factors such as the non-factorizable corrections and photonic
penguin contributions. Hence, we explore the consequences of $b\, \to\, s\, \mu^+\, \mu^-$ anomalies
on $B \, \to \, K^{(*)} \,\nu \, \bar{\nu}$, $B_s \to\, (\eta,\eta') \, \nu\,\bar{\nu}$ and $B_s
\, \to \, \phi \, \nu \, \bar{\nu}$ decay observables in SMEFT platform within various 1D and 2D new
physics scenarios.

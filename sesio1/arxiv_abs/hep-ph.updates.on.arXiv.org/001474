We explore the effective field theory of a vector field $X^\mu$ that has a St\"uckelberg mass. The
absence of a gauge symmetry for $X^\mu$ implies Lorentz-invariant operators are constructed directly
from $X^\mu$. Beyond the kinetic and mass terms, allowed interactions at the renormalizable level
include $X_\mu X^\mu H^\dagger H$, $(X_\mu X^\mu)^2$, and $X_\mu j^\mu$, where $j^\mu$ is a global
current of the SM or of a hidden sector. We show that all of these interactions lead to scattering amplitudes
that grow with powers of $\sqrt{s}/m_X$, except for the case of $X_\mu j^\mu$ where $j^\mu$ is a nonanomalous
global current. The latter is well-known when $X$ is identified as a dark photon coupled to the electromagnetic
current, often written equivalently as kinetic mixing between $X$ and the photon. The power counting
for the energy growth of the scattering amplitudes is facilitated by isolating the longitudinal
enhancement. We examine in detail the interaction with an anomalous global vector current $X_\mu
j_{anom}^\mu$, carefully isolating the finite contribution to the fermion triangle diagram.
We calculate the longitudinally-enhanced observables $Z \rightarrow X\gamma$ (when $m_X < m_Z$),
$f\bar{f} \rightarrow X \gamma$, and $Z\gamma \to Z\gamma$ when $X$ couples to the baryon number
current. Introducing a fake gauge-invariance by writing $X^\mu = A^\mu - \partial^\mu \pi/m_X$,
the would-be gauge anomaly associated with $A_\mu j_{anom}^\mu$ is canceled by $j_{anom}^\mu
\partial_\mu \pi/m_X$; this is the four-dimensional Green-Schwarz anomaly-cancellation mechanism
at work. Our analysis suggests there is no free lunch by appealing to St\"uckelberg for the mass of
a vector field: the price paid for avoiding a dark Higgs sector is replaced by the non-generic set
of interactions that the St\"uckelberg vector field must have to avoid amplitudes that grow with
energy.

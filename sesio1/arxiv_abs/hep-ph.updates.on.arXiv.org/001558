I briefly outline the most prominent features of a novel $SU(5)$ unification model proposal. The
particle content of the model comprises $5_H$, $24_H$, $35_H$, ${\overline{5}_F}_i$, ${10_F}_i$,
$15_F$, $\overline{15}_F$, and $24_V$, where subscripts $H$, $F$, and $V$ denote whether a given
representation contains scalars, fermions, or gauge bosons, respectively, while $i=1,2,3$.
The model employs all possible interaction terms, as allowed by the Lorentz group, the $SU(5)$ gauge
symmetry, and the aforementioned particle content, to generate the Standard Model fermion masses
through three different mechanisms. It also connects the neutrino mass generation mechanism to
the experimentally observed mass disparity between the down-type quarks and charged leptons.
The minimal structure of the model requires $24_H$ and $5_H$ not only to break $SU(5)$ and $SU(3)
\times SU(2) \times U(1)$ gauge groups, respectively, but to accomplish one additional task each.
The model furthermore predicts that neutrinos are strictly Majorana fields, that one neutrino
is purely a massless particle, and that neutrino masses are of normal ordering. The experimental
bound on the $p \rightarrow \pi^0 e^+$ lifetime limit, in conjunction with the prediction of the
model for the gauge mediated proton decays, implies that there are four new scalar multiplets at
or below a $120$\,TeV mass scale if these multiplets are mass degenerate. If these multiplets are
not mass degenerate, the quoted limit then applies, for all practical purposes, to the geometric
mean of their masses. The scalars in question transform as $(1,3,0)$, $(8,1,0)$, $(\overline{3},3,-2/3)$,
and $(\overline{6},2,1/6)$ under the Standard Model gauge group $SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)$
with calculable couplings to the Standard Model fields.

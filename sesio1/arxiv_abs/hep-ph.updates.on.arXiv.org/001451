We study the magnetic moments of the octet, decuplet, low-lying charm, and low-lying bottom baryons
with nonzero light quarks in symmetric nuclear matter using the quark-meson coupling (QMC) model,
which satisfies the constraint for the allowed maximum change (swelling) of the in-medium nucleon
size derived from the $y$-scaling data for $^3$He$(e,e')$ and $^{56}$Fe$(e,e')$. The present
QMC model also satisfies the expected allowed maximum enhancement of the nucleon magnetic moments
in nuclear matter. Moreover, it has been proven that the calculated in-medium to free proton electromagnetic
form factor (EMFF) ratios calculated within the QMC model, reproduce well the proton EMFF super
ratio extracted from $^4{\rm He}(\vec{e},e'\vec{p})^3{\rm H}$ at Jefferson Laboratory (JLab).
The medium modifications of the magnetic moments are estimated by evaluating the in-medium to free
space baryon magnetic moment ratios to compensate the MIT bag deficiency to describe the free space
octet baryon magnetic moments, where ratios are often measured directly in experiments even without
knowing the absolute values, such as the free and bound proton electromagnetic form factors, as
well as the European Muon Collaboration (EMC) effect to extract the structure function $F_2$ ratio
of the bound to free nucleons by the corresponding cross section ratio. We also present the results
calculated with the different current quark mass values for the strange and bottom quarks to see
the possible impact. Furthermore, for a practical use, we give the explicit density dependent parametrizations
for the vector potentials of the baryons and light-$(u, d)$ quarks, as well as for the effective masses
of the baryons treated in this study, and of the mesons, $\omega,\rho,K,K^*,\eta,\eta',D,D^*,B$,
and $B^*$.

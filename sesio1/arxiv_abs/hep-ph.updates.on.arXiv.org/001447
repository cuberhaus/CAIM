If dark matter (DM) is millicharged or darkly charged, collective plasma processes may dominate
momentum exchange over direct particle collisions. In particular, plasma streaming instabilities
can couple the momentum of DM to counter-streaming baryons or other DM and result in the counter-streaming
fluids coming to rest with each other, just as happens for baryonic collisionless shocks in astrophysical
systems. While electrostatic plasma instabilities (such as the two stream) are highly suppressed
by Landau damping in the cosmological situations of interest, electromagnetic instabilities
such as the Weibel can couple the momenta. Their growth rates are slower than the prior assumption
that they would grow at the plasma frequency of DM. We find that the streaming of DM in the pre-Recombination
universe is affected more strongly by direct collisions than collective processes, validating
previous constraints. However, when considering unmagnetized instabilities the properties
of the Bullet Cluster merger would be substantially altered if $[q_\chi/m_\chi] \gtrsim 10^{-4}$,
where $[q_\chi/m_\chi]$ is the charge-to-mass ratio of DM relative to that of the proton. When a
magnetic field is added consistent with cluster observations, Weibel and Firehose instabilities
result in the constraint $[q_\chi/m_\chi] \gtrsim 10^{-12}-10^{-11}$. The constraints are even
stronger in the case of a dark $U(1)$ charge, ruling out $[q_\chi/m_\chi] \gtrsim 10^{-14}$ in the
Bullet Cluster system. The strongest previous limits on millicharged DM arise from considering
the spin down of galactic disks. We show that plasma instabilities or tangled background magnetic
fields could lead to diffusive propagation of DM, weakening these spin down limits. Thus, our constraints
from considering plasma instabilities are the most stringent over much of the millicharged and
especially dark-charged parameter space.

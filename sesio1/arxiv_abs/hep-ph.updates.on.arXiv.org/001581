Of the J/$\psi$ mesons (inclusively) produced in pp collisions, a big fraction results from B decays,
increasing with transverse momentum and exceeding 50\% for $p_{\rm T} > 20$ GeV. These events must
be subtracted in measurements of the polarization of prompt J/$\psi$ mesons. While several studies
have addressed the $\psi$(2S) and $\chi_c$ impact on the determination of the polarization of the
directly-produced J/$\psi$ mesons, the theoretical and experimental knowledge of the non-prompt
polarization is very poor. Furthermore, non-prompt J/$\psi$ polarization measurements can provide
interesting information on quarkonium hadroproduction, complementing the studies of prompt
production. We review the method of measuring the polarization of non-prompt J/$\psi$ mesons (produced
in decays of unreconstructed B mesons and detected in the dilepton channel), in conditions typical
of LHC experiments studying J/$\psi$ production. Realistic model-independent scenarios are
validated with data from experiments studying $e^+e^- \to \Upsilon$(4S) interactions, converted
to the high-momentum regime using B differential cross sections measured at the LHC. The non-prompt
J/$\psi$ polarization measurements are seen to remain dependent on the event selection criteria,
even after correcting for the dilepton acceptance and efficiencies. This implies that reproducible
definitions of all relevant analysis choices must be reported with the polarization result, for
rigorous comparisons with other measurements and/or theoretical calculations. We also discuss
how the non-prompt J/$\psi$ polarization significantly depends on the relative importance of
two complementary $\mathrm{B}\to {\rm J}/\psi$ decay topologies, two-body (reasonably dominated
by singlet production) and multi-body (including octet contributions), providing, hence, valuable
information for studies of the charmonium formation mechanisms.

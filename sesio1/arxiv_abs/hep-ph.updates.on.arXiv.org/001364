The Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix element $\vert V_{cb}\vert$ is extracted from exclusive
semileptonic $B \to D^{(*)}$ decays adopting a novel unitarity-based approach which allows to
determine in a full non-perturbative way the relevant hadronic form factors (FFs) in the whole kinematical
range. By using existing lattice computations of the $B \to D^{(*)}$ FFs at small recoil from FNAL/MILC
and JLQCD Collaborations, we show that it is possible to extrapolate their behavior also at large
recoil without assuming any specific momentum dependence and without constraining their shape
using experimental data. Thus, we address the extraction of $\vert V_{cb}\vert$ from the experimental
data on the semileptonic $B \to D^{(*)} \ell \nu_\ell$ decays, obtaining $\vert V_{cb}\vert = (41.0
\pm 1.2 ) \cdot 10^{-3}$ from $B \to D$ and $\vert V_{cb}\vert = (40.6 \pm 1.6 ) \cdot 10^{-3}$ from
$B \to D^*$. Our result from $B \to D$ is based on final lattice data for the FFs and it is consistent
within $\sim 1$ standard deviation with the most recent inclusive determination $\vert V_{cb}
\vert_{incl} = (42.00 \pm 0.65) \cdot 10^{-3}$. The resulting uncertainty is comparable with those
obtained in literature using experimental data to constrain the shape of the FFs. Our result from
$B \to D^*$, though consistent with $\vert V_{cb} \vert_{incl} $, is still based on preliminary
lattice data for the FFs and its uncertainty is greater than the ones obtained in literature using
experimental data to constrain the shape of the FFs. We investigate also the issue of Lepton Flavor
Universality thanks to new theoretical estimates of the ratios $R(D^{(*)})$, namely $R(D) = 0.289(8)$
and $R(D^{*}) = 0.249(19)$. Our findings differ respectively by $\sim 1.6\sigma$ and $\sim1.8\sigma$
from the latest experimental determinations.

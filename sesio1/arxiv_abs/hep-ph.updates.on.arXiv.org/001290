The field of particle physics is at the crossroads. The discovery of a Higgs-like boson completed
the Standard Model (SM), but the lacking observation of convincing resonances Beyond the SM (BSM)
offers no guidance for the future of particle physics. On the other hand, the motivation for New Physics
has not diminished and is, in fact, reinforced by several striking anomalous results in many experiments.
Here we summarise the status of the most significant anomalies, including the most recent results
for the flavour anomalies, the multi-lepton anomalies at the LHC, the Higgs-like excess at around
96 GeV, and anomalies in neutrino physics, astrophysics, cosmology, and cosmic rays. While the
LHC promises up to 4/ab of integrated luminosity and far-reaching physics programmes to unveil
BSM physics, we consider the possibility that the latter could be tested with present data, but that
systemic shortcomings of the experiments and their search strategies may preclude their discovery
for several reasons, including: final states consisting in soft particles only, associated production
processes, QCD-like final states, close-by SM resonances, and SUSY scenarios where no missing
energy is produced. New search strategies could help to unveil the hidden BSM signatures, devised
by making use of the CERN open data as a new testing ground. We discuss the CERN open data with its policies,
challenges, and potential usefulness for the community. We showcase the example of the CMS collaboration,
which is the only collaboration regularly releasing some of its data. We find it important to stress
that individuals using public data for their own research does not imply competition with experimental
efforts, but rather provides unique opportunities to give guidance for further BSM searches by
the collaborations. Wide access to open data is paramount to fully exploit the LHCs potential.

We explore the possibility that primordial black holes (PBHs), formed early in the history of the
Universe, contain electric charge down to the present day. We find that PBHs should hold a non-zero
charge at their formation, calculating initial charges sourced by (i) Poisson fluctuations in
the number of charged particles within the volume that enters the horizon to form PBHs, and (ii) the
formation of maximally charged Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) PBHs of Planck mass via collisions in
the early universe. Although initial charges are thought to be subject to fast discharge processes,
we show that the dipolar magnetic fields sourced by spinning black holes can deviate incoming or
outgoing charges and avoid their accretion or emission, regardless of the PBH mass. In particular,
we estimate the interaction strength due to Hawking particle emission and the Schwinger process,
finding that charged, maximally spinning PBHs produce magnetic fields that are able to cancel the
Schwinger effect for all masses, and the Hawking emission for $M>1$kg PBHs. These considerations
allow PBHs to maintain their charge for extended periods. At late times, the plasma within virialised
dark matter haloes can charge a fraction of PBHs with one electron (i.e., $Q=e$) within a Hubble time
up to $M\sim10^{13}$ kg. Higher mass PBHs in haloes can acquire larger charges, reaching a scaling
of $Q/M\simeq1.15 \times 10^{-52}M\,C/\mbox{kg}$ for $M>10^{22}$ kg PBHs. Altogether these
calculations show that PBHs of all mass scales could hold charges from 2 to 10 orders of magnitude
lower than the maximal RN value, and even the extremal charge for Planck mass PBHs. The latter are
of particular interest, as they could constitute charged, stable relics that could compose the
entirety of dark matter.

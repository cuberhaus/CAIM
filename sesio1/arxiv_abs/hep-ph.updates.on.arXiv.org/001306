We have investigated the effect of nucleon and delta resonances with spins 11/2, 13/2, and 15/2 in
the kaon photoproduction process $\gamma + N \to K + Y$ by using two covariant isobar models. The formalism
for high-spin propagators and interaction Lagrangians were adopted from the works of Pascalutsa
and Vrancx et al. The unknown parameters in the amplitudes, i.e., the coupling constants and hadronic
form factor cutoffs, were obtained by fitting the calculated observables to experimental data.
In the $K\Lambda$ channels the inclusion of $N(2600)I_{1,11}$ and $N(2700)K_{1,13}$ resonances
improves the agreement between model calculations and experimental data significantly and reduces
the dominance of resonances in the model by increasing the hadronic form factor cutoff of the Born
terms. Furthermore, the inclusion of these resonances reduces the number of resonance structures
in cross sections, including the structure in the $K^0\Lambda$ differential cross section at $W\approx
1650$ MeV, which could become a hint of the narrow resonance. In the $K\Sigma$ channels the inclusion
of $N(2600)I_{1,11}$, $N(2700)K_{1,13}$, $\Delta(2420)H_{3,11}$, $\Delta(2750)I_{3,13}$,
and $\Delta(2950)K_{3,15}$ states also significantly improves the model and increases the hadronic
form factor cutoff of the Born terms. However, different from the $K\Lambda$ channels, the inclusion
of these high-spin resonances leads to more resonance structures in the $K^+\Sigma^0$ differential
cross section. This investigation reveals that the second and third peaks in the $K^+\Sigma^0$
differential cross section originate from the $\Delta(2000)F_{35}$ and $N(2290)G_{19}$ resonances,
respectively. We have also evaluated the resonance properties at the pole positions and using the
Breit-Wigner method.

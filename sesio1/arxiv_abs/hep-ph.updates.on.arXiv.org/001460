We investigate the effects of the neutrino flavor change by the neutrino self-interaction, the
shock effect and the matter effect on the neutrino-process of the core-collapsing supernova (CCSN).
For the hydrodynamics, we compare the results of a simple thermal bomb and a specified hydrodynamic
model for SN1987A. As a pre-supernova model, we take an updated model adjusted to explain the SN1987A
employing recent development of the $(n,\gamma)$ reaction rates calculated for nuclei near the
stability line $(A \sim 100)$. As for the neutrino luminosity, we adopt two different models: equivalent
neutrino luminosity and non-equivalent luminosity models. The latter is taken from the synthetic
analysis of the CCSN simulation data which compared quantitatively the results obtained by various
neutrino transport models. Relevant neutrino-induced reaction rates are calculated by a shell
model for light nuclei and a quasi-particle random phase approximation model for heavy nuclei.
For each model, we present and discuss abundances of the light nuclei ($^7$Li, $^7$Be, $^{11}$B
and $^{11}$C) and heavy nuclei ($^{92}$Nb, $^{98}$Tc, $^{138}$La and $^{180}$Ta). The light nuclei
are known to be sensitive to the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein region around O-Ne-Mg region. Through
the detailed analysis of the numerical abundances, we find that neutrino self-interaction becomes
a key ingredient in addition to the MSW effect for understanding the neutrino-process and the relevant
nuclear abundances. However, the whole results are shown to depend on the adopted neutrino luminosity
scheme. Detailed analyses of the nuclear abundances for the two possible neutrino mass hierarchies
are also performed with the data from the meteorite analyses. The normal mass hierarchy is shown
to be more compatible with the meteoritic data.

WIMPs can be captured in compact stars such as white dwarves (WDs) leading to an increase in the star
luminosity through their annihilation process. We show that when the WIMP interacts with the nuclear
targets within the WD through inelastic scattering and its mass exceeds a few tens GeV the data on
low-temperature large-mass WDs in the Messier 4 globular cluster can probe values of the mass splitting
$\delta\lesssim$ 40 MeV. Such value largely exceeds those ensuing from direct detection and from
solar neutrino searches. We apply such improved constraint to the specific DM scenario of a self-conjugate
bi-doublet in the Left-Right Symmetric Model (LRSM), where the standard $SU(2)_L$ group with coupling
$g_L$ is extended by an additional $SU(2)_R$ with coupling $g_R$. We show that bounds from WDs significantly
reduce the cosmologically viable parameter space of such scenario, in particular requiring $g_R>g_L$.
For instance, for $g_R/g_L$ = 1.8 we find the two viable mass ranges 1.2 TeV $\lesssim m_\chi\lesssim$
3 TeV and 5 TeV $\lesssim m_\chi\lesssim$ 10 TeV, when the charged $SU(2)_R$ gauge boson mass $M_{W_2}$
is lighter than $\simeq$ 12 TeV. We also discuss the ultraviolet completion of the LRSM model, when
the latter is embedded in a Grand Unified Theory. We show that such low-energy parameter space and
compatibility to proton-decay bounds require a non-trivial extension of the particle content
of the minimal model. We provide a specific example where $M_{W_2}\lesssim$ 10 TeV is achieved by
extending the LRSM at high energy with color triplets that are singlets under all other groups, and
$g_R/g_L>$1 is obtained by introducing $SU(2)_L$ triplets with no $SU(2)_R$ counterparts, i.e.
by breaking the symmetry between the multiplets of $SU(2)_L$ and $SU(2)_R$.

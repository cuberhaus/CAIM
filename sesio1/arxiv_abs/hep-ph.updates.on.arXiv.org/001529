In secluded dark sector scenario, the connection between the visible and the dark sector can be established
through a portal coupling and its presence opens up the possibility of non-adiabatic evolution
of the dark sector. To study the non-adiabatic evolution of the dark sector, we have considered a
$U(1)_{L_\mu - L_\tau} \otimes U(1)_X$ extension of the standard model (SM). Here the dark sector
is charged only under $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry whereas the SM fields are singlet under this symmetry.
Due to the presence of tree-level kinetic mixing between $U(1)_X$ and $U(1)_{L_\mu - L_\tau}$ gauge
bosons, the dark sector evolves non-adiabatically and thermal equilibrium between the visible
and dark sector is governed by the portal coupling. Depending on the values of the portal coupling
($\epsilon$), dark sector gauge coupling ($g_X$), mass of the dark matter ($m_\chi$) and mass of
the dark vector boson ($m_{Z^\prime}$), we study the temperature evolution of the dark sector as
well as the various non-equilibrium stages of the dark sector in detail. Furthermore we have also
investigated the constraints on the model parameters from various laboratory and astrophysical
searches. We have found that the parameter space for the non-adiabatic evolution of dark sector
is significantly constrained for $m_{Z^\prime}$ $\lesssim 100 \, {\rm MeV}$ from the observations
of beam dump experiments, stellar cooling etc. The relic density satisfied region of our parameter
space is consistent with the bounds from direct detection, and self interaction of dark matter (SIDM)
for the mass ratio $r \equiv m_{Z^\prime}/m_\chi = 10^{-3}$ and these bounds will be more relaxed
for larger values of $r$. However the constraints from measurement of diffuse $\gamma$-ray background
flux and cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy are strongest for $r = 10^{-1}$ and for smaller
values of $r$, they are not significant.

With the increasing precision requirements and growing spectrum of applications of Monte Carlo
simulations the evaluation of different components of such simulations and their systematic ambiguities
become of utmost interest. In the following, we will address the question of systematic errors for
Photos Monte Carlo for simulation of bremsstrahlung corrections in final states, which can not,
in principle, be identified as a decay of resonances. It is possible, because the program features
explicit and exact parametrization of phase space for multi-body plus multi-photon final states.
The Photos emission kernel for some processes consist of complete matrix element, in the remaining
cases appropriate approximation is used. Comparisons with results of simulations, from generators
based on exact phase space and exact fixed order matrix elements, can be used. For the purpose of such
validations Photos provides an option to restrict emissions to single photon only. In the current
work we concentrate on final state bremsstrahlung in $q \bar{q}(e^+e^-) \to l^+l^- l^+l^- \gamma$
and $\gamma\gamma \to l^+l^- \gamma$ processes. The reference distributions used as a cross-check
are obtained from the fixed-order MadGraph Monte Carlo simulations. For the purpose of validation
we concentrate on those phase space regions where Photos is not expected to work on the basis of its
design alone. These phase space regions of hard, non-collinear photons, do not contribute to large
logarithmic terms. We find that in these phase space regions the differences between Photos and
MadGraph results do not surpass a few percent and these regions, in turn, contribute about 10% to
the observed process rates. This is encouraging in view of the possible ambiguities for precise
calculation of realistic observables.

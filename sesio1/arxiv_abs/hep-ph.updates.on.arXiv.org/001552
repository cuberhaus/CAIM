We study the rates and direct CP violations of two-body baryonic $\bar B_{u,d,s}\to {{\rm\bf B}\overline{\rm\bf
B}}'$ and $B^-_c\to{{\rm\bf B}\overline{\rm\bf B}}'$ decays, where the final state baryons include
low-lying octet and decuplet baryons. We incorporate topological amplitude formalism and the
factorization approach. Asymptotic relations at large $m_b$ are used to simplify decay amplitudes.
Using the most up-to-date data on $\bar B^0\to p\bar p$ and $B^-\to\Lambda\bar p$ decay rates as
inputs, rates and direct CP violations of $\bar B_{u,d,s}\to {{\rm\bf B}\overline{\rm\bf B}}'$
decays are revised and predicted. It is interesting that the results on rates satisfy all existing
experimental bounds and some are close to the bounds. Factorization diagrams contribute to penguin-exchange,
exchange, annihilation and penguin-annihilation amplitudes. Although the resulting penguin-exchange
amplitudes are sizable, the rest suffer from chiral suppression. As the $\bar B_s\to p\bar p$ decay
is governed by exchange and penguin annihilation amplitudes, the rate predicted in factorization
calculation is very rare and is several orders of magnitude below the present bound. The case where
the rate can be enhanced through the enhancement on exchange or penguin-annihilation amplitudes
is discussed. The branching ratios of $B^-_c\to{{\rm\bf B}\overline{\rm\bf B}}'$ decays from
factorization calculation are found to be of the order of $10^{-14}\sim 10^{-11}$ as they are annihilation
modes. Small direct CP violations of pure penguin modes in $\Delta S=-1$ $\bar B_{u,d,s}\to{{\rm\bf
B}\overline{\rm\bf B}}'$ decays are robust predictions of the SM, while vanishing direct CP violations
of exchange modes in $\bar B_{u,d,s}\to{{\rm\bf B}\overline{\rm\bf B}}'$ decays and in all $B^-_c\to{{\rm\bf
B}\overline{\rm\bf B}}'$ decay modes are null tests of the SM.

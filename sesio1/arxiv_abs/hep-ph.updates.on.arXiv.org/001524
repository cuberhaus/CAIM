Let $\Theta$ be the Wigner time reversal operator for spin half and let $\phi$ be a Weyl spinor. Then,
for a left-transforming $\phi$, the construct $\zeta_\lambda \Theta \phi^\ast$ yields a right-transforming
spinor. If instead, $\phi$ is a right-transforming spinor, then the construct $\zeta _\rho \Theta
\phi^\ast$ results in a left-transforming spinor ($\zeta_{\lambda,\rho}$ are phase factors).
This allows us to introduce two sets of four-component spinors. Setting $\zeta_\lambda$ and $\zeta_\rho$
to $\pm i$ render all eight spinors as eigenspinor of the charge conjugation operator~$\mathcal{C}$
(called ELKO). This allows us to introduce two quantum fields. A calculation of the vacuum expectation
value of the time-ordered product of the fields and their adjoints reveals the mass dimension of
the fields to be one. Both fields are local in the canonical sense of quantum field theory. Interestingly,
one of the fields is fermionic and the other bosonic. The mass dimension of the introduced fermionic
fields and the matter fields of the Standard Model carry an intrinsic mismatch. As such, they provide
natural darkness for the new fields with respect to the Standard Model doublets. The statistics
and locality are controlled by a set of phases. These are explicitly given. Then we observe that in
$p_\mu p^\mu = m^2$, Dirac took the simplest square root of the $4\times 4$ identity matrix $I$ (in
$I \times m^2 $, while introducing $\gamma_\mu p^\mu$ as the square root of the left hand side of the
dispersion relation), and as such he implicitly ignored the remaining fifteen. When we examine
the remaining roots, we obtain additional bosonic and fermionic dark matter candidates of spin
half. We point out that by early nineteen seventies, Dirac had suspected the existence of spin half
bosons, in the same space as his fermions. Abstract truncated.

The existence of Beyond Standard Model (BSM) physics is firmly suggested by both experimental observations
(Dark Matter, neutrino masses) and theoretical arguments. In the hypothesis that the scale of new
physics is considerably higher than the energies probed at colliders, we can parametrise modified
interactions induced by BSM effects among SM particles in a model-independent framework, the Standard
Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Searches for indirect evidence of new physics are conceptually
different from the direct ones that have characterised the first part of the LHC program, and both
experimental and phenomenological studies are needed in order to maximise the chances of uncovering
a BSM signal. In this thesis, several phenomenological aspects of the SMEFT are discussed, both
at present and future colliders. A characteristic feature of modified interactions is that they
can induce unitarity violating effects which can be exploited to gain sensitivity. In this direction,
a thorough study of the top quark electroweak sector will be presented, focusing on 2 to 2 scatterings
and their embeddings in physical processes at colliders. This analysis allows us to identify several
final states that have a good potential to explore the SMEFT parameter space and that could be particularly
relevant in a global analysis. One of the key features of the SMEFT is indeed that deviations from
the SM interactions are correlated and global interpretations are therefore of fundamental importance.
A combined interpretation of the Higgs, top and diboson data from the LHC is here presented and the
interplay between the various datasets discussed. Finally, the physics potential of a futuristic
muon collider will be analysed, focusing in particular on the prospects to determine the Higgs self-interactions,
a task that is arduous even in proposed 100 TeV proton colliders.

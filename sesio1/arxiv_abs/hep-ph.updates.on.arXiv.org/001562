We investigate the transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) spectra of identified hadrons in minimum-bias
proton-proton (pp) collisions at a centre-of-mass energy ($\sqrt{s}$) of 0.9, 2.76, 5.02, 7 and
13 TeV in the framework of Tsallis-blast wave (TBW) model. It is found that the model describes well
the particle spectra up to 10 GeV/c. The radial flow ($\langle \beta \rangle$) increases with the
collision energy. The degrees of non-equilibrium ($q$) and the Tsallis temperature parameter
($T$) show a similar behaviour, but with a much weaker trend. With this dependence of the freeze-out
parameters on the collision energy, we evaluate $\langle \beta \rangle$, $T$ and $q$ in pp collisions
at $\sqrt{s}=$ 8 and 14 TeV and predict the particle spectra at these two energies. Moreover, in order
to investigate the multiplicity dependence of the freeze-out parameters, the TBW model is extended
to the spectra at different charged-particle multiplicity classes in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=$
7 and 13 TeV. It is observed that at both energies the radial flow increases with the multiplicity
while the degree of non-equilibrium shows an opposite behaviour, which is similar to that observed
in proton-nucleus (pA) and nucleus-nucleus (AA) collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
energies. However, the Tsallis temperature parameter increases with the multiplicity, which
is opposite to the trend in pA and AA collisions. At similar multiplicities, the radial flow in pp
collisions is stronger than those in pA and AA collisions, indicating that the size of the colliding
system has significant effects on the final state particle dynamics. Finally, we apply an additional
flow correction to the Tsallis temperature parameter and find that the doppler-corrected temperature
parameter almost scales with the multiplicity in a uniform way, despite the difference in the colliding
system and collision energy.

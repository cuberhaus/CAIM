Any axionlike particle (ALP) intrinsically possesses flavorful couplings to the standard model
(SM) fermions arising as a consequence of the right-handed flavor rotation within the SM. In this
paper we discuss this intrinsically flavored ALP, and explore the correlation of a minimal set of
the couplings in a view of coherence in flavor physics observables. We focus particularly on the
tau-lepton flavor violation (LFV). The ALP is assumed to be tau-philic on a current-eigenstate
basis, a la Pecci-Quinn. The ALP has the intrinsic flavorful coupling structure for fermions, which
allows coupling also to muon and electron only in a right-handed specific manner. Several LFV processes
are generated including radiative tau decays and also anomalous magnetic moments of electron and
muon. We first pay attention to two separated limits: electron scenario with the ALP coupled to tau
which mixes only with right-handed electron, and muon scenario as the muonic counterpart of the
electron scenario. It turns out that those scenarios are highly constrained by experimental limits,
to require a mu or electron - tau flipped feature in the mass eigenbasis when coupled to the ALP. We
then examine a hybrid scenario, and find a fully viable parameter space on the ALP mass-photon coupling
plane, which limits the ALP mass to be (1.7 - 10) GeV and the ALP decay constant $f_a$ to be (12.8 - 67.9)
GeV. We find that the same-sign multilepton signal at Belle II is a smoking-gun to probe the present
ALP signal, and the polarization asymmetry in LFV radiative $\tau$ decay is a punchline, which definitely
predicts preference of the right-handed polarization, in sharp contrast to the SM plus massive
Dirac neutrinos having the highly left-handed preference, and also other light-new physics candidates.
Possible model-building to underlie the present third-generation specific ALP is also briefly
addressed.

The field of machine learning has drawn increasing interest from various other fields due to the
success of its methods at solving a plethora of different problems. An application of these has been
to train artificial neural networks to solve differential equations without the need of a numerical
solver. This particular application offers an alternative to conventional numerical methods,
with advantages such as lower memory required to store the solutions, parallelization, and in some
cases less overall computational cost than its numerical counterparts. In this work, we train artificial
neural networks to represent a bundle of solutions of the differential equations that govern the
background dynamics of the Universe for four different models. The models we have chosen are $\Lambda
\mathrm{CDM}$, the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametric dark energy model, a quintessence
model with an exponential potential, and the Hu-Sawicki $f\left(R\right)$ model. We used the solutions
that the networks provide to perform statistical analyses to estimate the values of each model's
parameters with observational data; namely, estimates of the Hubble parameter from Cosmic Chronometers,
the Supernovae type Ia data from the Pantheon compilation, and measurements from Baryon Acoustic
Oscillations. The results we obtain for all models match similar estimations done in the literature
using numerical solvers. In addition, we estimated the error of the solutions by comparing them
to the analytical solution when there is one, or to a high-precision numerical solution when there
is not. Through those estimations we found that the error of the solutions was at most $\sim1\%$ in
the region of the parameter space that concerns the $95\%$ confidence regions that we found using
the data, for all models and all statistical analyses performed in this work.

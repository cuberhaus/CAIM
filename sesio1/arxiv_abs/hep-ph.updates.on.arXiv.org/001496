We investigate the neutrino flavor change effects due to neutrino self-interaction, shock wave
propagation as well as matter effect on the neutrino process of the core-collapsing supernova.
For the hydrodynamics, we use two models: a simple thermal bomb model and a specified hydrodynamic
model for SN1987A. As a pre-supernova model, we take an updated model adjusted to explain the SN1987A
employing recent development of the $(n,\gamma)$ reaction rates for nuclei near the stability
line $(A \sim 100)$. As for the neutrino luminosity, we adopt two different models: equivalent neutrino
luminosity and non-equivalent luminosity models. The latter is taken from the synthetic analyses
of the CCSN simulation data which involved quantitatively the results obtained by various neutrino
transport models. Relevant neutrino-induced reaction rates are calculated by a shell model for
light nuclei and a quasi-particle random phase approximation model for heavy nuclei. For each model,
we present abundances of the light nuclei ($^7$Li, $^7$Be, $^{11}$B and $^{11}$C) and heavy nuclei
($^{92}$Nb, $^{98}$Tc, $^{138}$La and $^{180}$Ta) produced by the neutrino-process. The light
nuclei abundances turn out to be sensitive to the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein region around
ONeMg region while the heavy nuclei are mainly produced prior to the MSW region. Through the detailed
analyses of the numerical abundances, we find that neutrino self-interaction becomes a key ingredient
in addition to the MSW effect for understanding the neutrino process and the relevant nuclear abundances.
However, the whole results are shown to depend on the adopted neutrino luminosity scheme. Detailed
evaluations of the nuclear abundances for the two possible neutrino mass hierarchies are performed
with the comparison to the available meteorite analyses data. The normal mass hierarchy is shown
to be more compatible with the meteoritic data.

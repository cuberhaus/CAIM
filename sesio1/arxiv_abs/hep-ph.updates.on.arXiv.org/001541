The Hubble constant estimated from the CMB measurements shows large disagreement with the locally
measured value. This inconsistency is called the Hubble tension and is vastly studied in recent
years. Early Dark Energy (EDE) gives a few percent contribution to the total energy density of the
universe only at an epoch before the recombination, and it is considered as a promising solution
to the tension. A simple realization of EDE is given by dynamics of a scalar field, called the EDE scalar,
and models including the EDE scalar are extensively studied in the literature. In this paper, we
present a novel EDE scenario based on higher-dimensional gauge theories. An extra component of
gauge fields associated with a compact extra dimension behaves as the EDE scalar at low-energy and
has a periodic potential, which has a similar form as potentials for pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons
(PNGB). In a five-dimensional U(1) gauge theory, we show that a scalar field that originates from
the gauge field can give EDE through its dynamics in a PNGB type potential with a suitable choice of
parameters in the theory. We focus on the scenario where EDE is explained by the scalar field and clarify
constraints on the fundamental parameters of the gauge theory, such as the gauge coupling, the compactification
scale, and the mass parameters for matter fields. We also find that a sufficient dilution of EDE requires
non-trivial relations among U(1) charges of matter fields. With specific matter contents, we numerically
solve the time evolution of the scalar field and confirm that its energy density behaves as an EDE.
In our scenario, the parameters of the gauge theory and predicted properties of EDE are related to
each other. Thus, the cosmological restrictions on the EDE properties provide insights into higher-dimensional
gauge theories.

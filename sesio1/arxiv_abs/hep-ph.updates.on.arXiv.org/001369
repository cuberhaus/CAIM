We consider the interplay of the Early Dark Energy (EDE) model, the Swampland Distance Conjecture
(SDC), and cosmological parameter tensions. EDE is a proposed resolution of the Hubble tension
relying upon a near-Planckian scalar field excursion, while the SDC predicts an exponential sensitivity
of masses of other fields to such an excursion, $m\propto e^{-c|\Delta \phi|/M_{\rm pl}}$ with
$c\sim{\cal O}(1)$. Meanwhile, EDE is in tension with large-scale structure (LSS) data, due to
shifts in the standard $\Lambda$CDM parameters necessary to fit the cosmic microwave background
(CMB). One might hope that a proper treatment of the model, e.g., accounting for the SDC, may ameliorate
the tension with LSS. Motivated by these considerations, we introduce the Early Dark Sector (EDS)
model, wherein the mass of dark matter is exponentially sensitive to super-Planckian field excursions
of the EDE scalar. The EDS model exhibits new phenomenology in both the early and late universe, the
latter due to an EDE-mediated dark matter self-interaction. This dark matter-philic "fifth force",
while constrained to be small, remains active in the late universe and is not screened in virialized
halos. We find that the new interaction with dark matter partially resolves the LSS tension. However,
the marginalized posteriors are nonetheless consistent with $f_{\rm EDE}=0$ at 95$\%$ CL once
the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 measurement of $S_8$ is included. We study constraints on the model
from Atacama Cosmology Telescope data, and find a factor of two improvement on the error bar on the
SDC parameter $c$, along with an increased preference for the EDE component. We discuss the implications
of these constraints for the SDC, and find the tightest observational constraints to date on a swampland
parameter, suggesting that an EDE description of cosmological data is in tension with the SDC.

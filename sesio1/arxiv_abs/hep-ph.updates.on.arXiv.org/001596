A broad range of problems associated with phase transitions in systems characterized by the strong
interaction between particles and with formation of structures is reviewed. A general phenomenological
mean-field model is constructed describing phase transitions of the first and the second order
to the $k_0=0$ and $\vec{k}_0\neq 0$ states. Due to fluctuations, the phase transition to the state
$\vec{k}_0\neq 0$ is the transition of the first order. Various specific features of the phase transitions
to the state $\vec{k}_0\neq 0$ are considered such as the anisotropic spectrum of excitations,
a possibility of the formation of various structures including running and standing waves, three-axis
structures, chiral waves, pasta phases, etc. A formal transition to hydrodynamical variables
is performed. Then focus is made on description of the dynamics of the order parameter at the phase
transitions to the states with $\vec{k}_0= 0$ and $\vec{k}_0\neq 0$. Next the non-ideal hydrodynamical
description of the phase transitions of the liquid-gas type in nuclear systems is performed. Quasiperiodic
structures are developed during the transitions. Next, the specific example of the pion condensation
phase transition to the $\vec{k}_0\neq 0$ state in dense, cold or warm nuclear matter is considered
and then the high temperature -- small baryon chemical potential system is studied, when baryons
become completely blurred and light bosons, e.g., pions, may condense either in $\vec{k}_0= 0$
or $\vec{k}_0\neq 0$ states. Then, for the scalar collective modes the phenomena of the Pomeranchuk
instability and the Bose condensation in $\vec{k}_0= 0$ or $\vec{k}_0\neq 0$ states are studied.
Next, possibility of the condensation of Bose excitations in the $\vec{k}_0\neq 0$ state in the
moving media is considered. Finally, specific purely non-equilibrium effects are demonstrated
on an example.

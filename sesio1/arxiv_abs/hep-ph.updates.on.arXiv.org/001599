The perturbative QCD (PQCD) approach based on $k_T$ factorization has made a great achievement
for the QCD calculation of the hadronic B decays. Regulating the endpoint divergence by the transverse
momentum of quarks in the propagators, one can do the perturbation calculation for kinds of diagrams
including the annihilation type diagrams. In this paper, we review the current status of PQCD factorization
calculation of two-body charmless $B\to PP, PV, VV$ decays up to the next-to-leading order (NLO)
QCD corrections. two new power suppressed terms in decaying amplitudes are also taken into account.
By using the universal input (non-perturbative) parameters, we collected the branching ratios
and ${\bf CP}$ asymmetry parameters for all the charmless two body $B$ decays, calculated in the
PQCD approach up to the NLO, including some power suppressed terms in decaying amplitudes. The results
are compared with the ones from QCD factorization approach, soft-collinear effective theory approach
and the current experimental measurements. For most considered B meson decays, the PQCD results
for branching ratios agree well with other approaches and the experimental data. The PQCD predictions
for the ${\bf CP}$ asymmetry parameters for many of the decay channels do not agree with other approaches,
but have a better agreement with the experimental data. The longstanding $K \pi $ puzzle about the
pattern of the direct CP asymmetries of the penguin-dominated $B \to K \pi $ decays can be understood
after the inclusion of the NLO contributions in PQCD. The NLO corrections and power suppressed terms
play an important role in the color suppressed and pure annihilation type $B$ decay modes. These
rare decays are more sensitive to different types of corrections, providing opportunity to examine
the factorization approach with the more precise experimental measurements.

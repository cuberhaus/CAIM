We study the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) produced by freely decaying vortical
turbulence in the early Universe. We thoroughly investigate the time correlation of the velocity
field, and hence of the anisotropic stresses producing the gravitational waves. By direct numerical
simulation, we show that the unequal time correlation function (UETC) of the Fourier components
of the velocity field is Gaussian in the time difference, as predicted by the "sweeping" decorrelation
model. We introduce a decorrelation model that can be extended to wavelengths around the integral
scale of the flow. Supplemented with the evolution laws of the kinetic energy and of the integral
scale, this provides a new model UETC of the turbulent velocity field consistent with the simulations.
We discuss the UETC as a positive definite kernel, and propose to use the Gibbs kernel for the velocity
UETC as a natural way to ensure positive definiteness of the SGWB. The SGWB is given by a 4-dimensional
integration of the resulting anisotropic stress UETC with the gravitational wave Green's function.
We perform this integration using a Monte Carlo algorithm based on importance sampling, and find
that the result matches that of the direct numerical simulations. Furthermore, the SGWB obtained
from the numerical integration and from the simulations show close agreement with a model in which
the source is constant in time and abruptly turns off after a few eddy turnover times. Based on this
assumption, we provide an approximate analytical form for the SGWB spectrum and its scaling with
the initial kinetic energy and integral scale. Finally, we use our model and numerical integration
algorithm to show that including an initial growth phase for the turbulent flow heavily influences
the spectral shape of the SGWB. This highlights the importance of a complete understanding of the
turbulence generation mechanism.

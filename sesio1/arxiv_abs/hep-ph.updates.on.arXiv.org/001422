The event of astroparticle collision at high energy was detected in 1975 during the balloon flight
in the stratosphere. The data of hundred particle tracks in x-ray films have been re-analyzed in
the style of LHC experiments. The comparison of multiple histograms with the expectations of the
Quark-Gluon String Model (QGSM) gives us the conclusion that it might be the carbon-nucleus collision
with the matter of atmosphere at the c.m.s. equivalent energy $\sqrt{s} \ge $ 5 TeV. After QGSM analysis
of these scarce data, we know the following: the value of maximal rapidity of one projectile proton
and the density of particle multiplicity in the central rapidity region. Besides this, the transverse
mass distributions have been built, which show how many protons are in every particular range of
rapidity. In such a way, we certainly can distinguish how this astroparticle interaction is similar
to or differs from the average A-A collision event at LHC. The data indicate the features of new physics
that cannot be associated with just nucleus-nucleus collision: one particle with transverse mass
16 GeV was detected and a small nucleon population has been seen in the region of projectile fragmentation.
Both facts make us convinced that there might be a baryonic DM decay. These heavy neutral baryon-antibaryon
states are to be formed at the huge gravitation pressure in giant massive objects like Black Holes.
Relativistic jets are spreading baryonic DM in space. Finally, we conclude that the cosmic ray experiments
on the high altitudes in the atmosphere are, on one hand, good supplements to the LHC measurements.
On the other hand, they are able to discover events of the very first collision of astroparticles
with the atmosphere in the full kinematical region, while colliders are studying nuclear interactions
only in a central rapidity region.

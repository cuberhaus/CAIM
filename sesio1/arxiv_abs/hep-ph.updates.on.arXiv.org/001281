The class of semi-hard reactions represents a promising venue where to enhance our knowledge of
strong interactions and deepen the aspects related to this theory in kinematical regimes so far
unexplored. In particular, the high energies reached in electron-proton and in proton-proton
collisions first at HERA and then at the LHC, allow us to study scattering amplitudes of hard and semi-hard
processes in perturbative QCD. The structure of this thesis can be considered twofold. On one hand,
the possibility to distinguish those channels where at least two final-state particles are emitted
with large separation in rapidity and with an untagged system, permits to test the BFKL dynamics
as resummation energy logarithms in the $t$-channel. In the BFKL formalism, the Mueller--Navelet
jets process has been one of the most investigated reactions. With the idea of deepening our understanding
of the BFKL approach, a new channel is proposed: the inclusive production of a light charged hadron
and a jet with high transverse momentum widely separated in rapidity. The importance of this process
relies in the possibility to probe a complementary region to one analyzed for the Mueller--Navelet
jets. Additionally, another reaction is proposed: the heavy-quark pairs hadroproduction. On
the other hand, also the class of processes featured by the detection of a single forward object in
lepton-proton collision offers the opportunity to develop intriguing phenomenological studies.
In particular, the exclusive leptoproduction of light vector mesons, $\rho$ and $\phi$, is exhaustively
investigated. In this context, the study of helicity-dependent observables allows us to discriminate
among several unintegrated gluon distribution models, whose original definition naturally encodes
the BFKL-equation evolution dynamics. This kind of parton density allows us to get access to the
hadronic structure at small-$x$.

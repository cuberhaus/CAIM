The electroweak (EW) sector of the Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM),
assuming the lightest neutralino as Dark Matter (DM) candidate, can account for a variety of experimental
results. In particular it can account for the discrepancy between the experimental result for the
anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $(g-2)_{\mu}$, and its Standard Model (SM) prediction.
The new "MUON G-2" result, combined with the older BNL result on $(g-2)_{\mu}$, yields a deviation
from the SM prediction of $\Delta a_{\mu} = (25.1 \pm 5.9) \times 10^{-10}$, corresponding to $4.2~\sigma$.
Using this updated bound, together with the other constraints, we calculate the MSSM prediction
for the mass of the $W$ boson, $M_W$. We assume contributions only from the EW sector, with the colored
sector of the MSSM taken to be heavy. We investigate five scenarios, distinguished by the mechanisms
which yield a relic DM density in agreement with the latest Planck bounds. We find that with the new
$(g-2)_{\mu}$ result taken into account and depending on the scenario, values up to $M_W^{\mathrm{MSSM}}
\lesssim 80.376~\mathrm{GeV}$ are reached. The largest values are obtained for wino DM and in the
case of slepton co-annihilation, where points well within the $1\,\sigma$ range of the experimental
world average of $M_W^{\mathrm{exp}} = 80.379 \pm~0.012~\mathrm{GeV}$ are reached, whereas
the SM predicts a too small value of $M_W^{\mathrm{SM}} = 80.353~\mathrm{GeV}$. We analyze the
dependence of $M_W^{\mathrm{MSSM}}$ on the relevant masses of the EW superpartners and demonstrate
that future $M_W$ measurements, e.g. at the ILC, could distinguish between various MSSM realizations.
Sizable contributions to $M_W^{\mathrm{MSSM}}$ are associated with a relatively light $\tilde{\chi}^0_1$,
accompanied by either a light chargino or a light smuon, setting interesting targets for future
collider searches.

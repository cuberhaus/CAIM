The mass spectra and wave functions of both $1S$ and $2S$ state heavy pseudoscalar ($P$) and vector
($V$) mesons are analyzed within the light-front quark model. Important empirical constraints
employed in our analysis of the mass spectra and wave functions are the experimental mass-gap relation,
$\Delta M_P > \Delta M_V$, where $\Delta M_{P(V)}=M^{2S}_{P(V)}-M^{1S}_{P(V)}$ and the hierarchy
of the decay constants, $f_{1S}>f_{2S}$, between $1S$ and $2S$ meson states. We maintain the orthogonality
of the trial wave functions of the $1S$ and $2S$ states in our variational calculation of the Hamiltonian
with the Coulomb plus confining potentials and treat the hyperfine interaction perturbatively
for the heavy-heavy and heavy-light $P$ and $V$ mesons due to the nature of the heavy quark symmetry.
Realizing that the empirical constraints cannot be satisfied without mixing of the $1S$ and $2S$
states, we find the lower bound of the mixing angle $\theta$ between $1S$ and $2S$ states as $\theta_c
= {\rm cot}^{-1}(2\sqrt{6})/2\simeq 6^{\circ}$ and obtain the optimum value of the mixing angle
around $12^\circ$ to cover both the charm and bottom flavors of the heavy quark. The mixing effects
are found to be more significant to the $2S$ state mesons than to the $1S$ state mesons. The properties
of $1S$ and $2S$ state mesons including the mass spectra, decay constants, twist-2 distribution
amplitudes, and electromagnetic form factors are computed. Our results are found to be in a good
agreement with the available data and lattice simulations. In particular, the $2S$ state pseudoscalar
$D_s$ meson is predicted to have a mass of $2600$ MeV, which is very close to the mass of the newly discovered
$D_{s0}(2590)^+$ meson by the LHCb Collaboration. This supports the interpretation of the observed
state as a radial excitation of the $D^+_s$ meson.

A non-perturbative lattice regularization of chiral fermions and bosons with anomaly-free symmetry
$G$ in 1+1D spacetime is proposed. More precisely, we ask "whether there is a local short-range quantum
Hamiltonian with a finite Hilbert space for a finite system realizing onsite symmetry $G$ defined
on a 1D spatial lattice, such that its low energy physics produces a 1+1D anomaly-free chiral matter
theory of symmetry $G$?" In particular, we propose that the 3$_L$-5$_R$-4$_L$-0$_R$ U(1) chiral
fermion theory, with two left-moving fermions of charge-3 and 4, and two right-moving fermions
of charge-5 and 0 at low energy, can be put on a 1D spatial lattice where the U(1) symmetry is realized
as an onsite symmetry, if we include properly designed multi-fermion interactions with intermediate
strength. In general, we propose that any 1+1D U(1)-anomaly-free chiral matter theory can be defined
as a finite system on a 1D lattice with onsite symmetry by using a quantum Hamiltonian with continuous
time, but without suffering from Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem's fermion-doubling, if we include
properly-designed interactions between matter fields. We propose how to design such interactions
by looking for extra symmetries via bosonization/fermionization. We comment on the new ingredients
and the differences of ours compared to Ginsparg-Wilson fermion, Eichten-Preskill, and Chen-Giedt-Poppitz
(CGP) models, and suggest modifying CGP model to have successful mirror-decoupling. We show a topological
non-perturbative proof of the equivalence relation between the 't Hooft anomaly matching conditions
and the boundary fully gapping rules (e.g. Haldane's stability conditions for Luttinger liquid)
of U(1) symmetry. We expect that our result holds universally regardless of spatial Hamiltonian
or Lagrangian/spacetime path integral formulation. Numerical tests are demanding tasks but highly
desirable for future work.

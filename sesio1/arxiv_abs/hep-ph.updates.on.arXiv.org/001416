Hawking radiation as a quantum phenomenon is generally attributed to the existence of the event
horizon of a black hole. However, we demonstrate in this paper that there is indeed ingoing Hawking-like
radiation associated with apparent horizons of the first cosmological black hole solution in the
framework of Scalar-Tensor-Vector Gravity (STVG) theory living in the Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker
(FLRW) background. Such radiation can be attributed also to the cosmological apparent horizon
of the FLRW universe and even to the cosmological event horizon of de Sitter spacetime. We see how
STVG theory as a good theory for explaining black holes both on local and global scales affect the
Hawking effect. Based on semiclassical approximation, we follow Hamilton-Jacobi and Parikh-Wilczek
tunneling methods, respectively with and without back-reaction effects. We find out that back-reaction
effects make a correlation between the emission modes in Parikh-Wilczek tunneling formalism,
which can address the information paradox. We obtain the corresponding Hawking-like temperature
as a function of inverse powers of apparent horizons radiuses of the cosmological black hole in STVG
theory. We analyze the influence of the STVG parameter associated with a deviation of the STVG theory
from General Theory of Relativity (GR) on both apparent horizons and the Hawking-like temperature
of the cosmological black hole. We show that increasing the STVG parameter results in appearing
the Hawking-like temperature in later cosmic times with some smaller values. Also, we follow the
Hamilton-Jacobi approach beyond semiclassical approximation to involve all quantum correction
terms in the deduced semiclassical outcomes for the cosmological black hole in the STVG theory.

We evaluate the three-gluon vertex with one vanishing external momentum within the Curci-Ferrari
(CF) model at two-loop order and compare our results to Landau-gauge lattice simulations of the
same vertex function for the SU(2) and SU(3) gauge groups in four dimensions. This extends previous
works that considered similarly the two-loop ghost and gluon two-point functions as well as the
two-loop ghost-antighost-gluon vertex (with vanishing gluon momentum). The parameters of the
model being adjusted by fitting the two-point functions to lattice data, our evaluation of the three-gluon
vertex arises as a pure prediction. We find that two-loop corrections systematically improve the
agreement between the model and the lattice data as compared to earlier one-loop calculations,
with a better agreement in the SU(3) case as already seen in previous studies. We also study the renormalization
scheme dependence of our calculation. In all cases, this dependence diminishes when two-loop corrections
are included, which is consistent with the perturbative CF paradigm. Finally, we study the low momentum
regime of the three-gluon vertex in relation with the possibility of zero-crossing. Within the
CF model, we show that the leading infrared behavior of the exact vertex is given by the same linear
logarithm that arises at one-loop order, multiplied by the all orders cubic ghost dressing function
at zero-momentum (we provide similar exact results for other vertex functions). We argue that this
property remains true within the FP framework under the assumption that the resummed gluon propagator
features a decoupling behavior. This shows that the zero-crossing is a property of the exact three-gluon
vertex function. Within the CF model, we find however that the scale of the zero-crossing is considerably
reduced when going from one- to two-loop order. This seems consistent with some recent lattice simulations.

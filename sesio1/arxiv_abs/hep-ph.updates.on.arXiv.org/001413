Suppression of jet spectra or jet quenching in high-energy heavy-ion collisions is caused by jet
energy loss in the dense medium. The azimuthal anisotropy of jet energy loss in non-central heavy-ion
collisions can lead to jet anisotropy which in turn can provide insight into the path-length dependence
of jet quenching. This is investigated within the Linear Boltzmann Transport (LBT) model which
simulates both elastic scattering and medium-induced gluon radiation based on perturbative QCD
for jet shower and medium recoil partons as well as radiated gluons as they propagate through the
quark-gluon plasma (QGP). The dynamical evolution of the QGP in each event of heavy-ion collisions
is provided by the (3+1)D CLVisc hydrodynamic model with fully fluctuating initial conditions.
This framework has been shown to describe the suppression of single inclusive jet spectra well.
We calculate in this study the elliptic ($v_{2}^{\rm jet}$) and triangular ($v_{3}^{\rm jet}$)
anisotropy coefficients of the single inclusive jet spectra in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC energies.
We investigate the colliding energy, centrality, jet transverse momentum dependence of the jet
anisotropy, as well as their event-by-event correlation with the flow coefficients of the soft
bulk hadrons. An approximate linear correlation between jet and bulk $v_2$ is found. Effect of the
bulk $v_n$ fluctuation on $v_n^{\rm jet}$ is found negligible. The jet-induced medium excitation,
which is influenced by radial flow, is shown to enhance $v_{2}^{\rm jet}$ and the enhancement increases
with the jet cone size. The jet elliptic anisotropy $v_{2}^{\rm jet}$ is also found to be slightly
enhanced by the shear viscosity of the bulk medium in comparison to the LBT results when jets propagate
through an ideal hydrodynamic QGP medium.

We consider the $B^0_s \to \mu^{+} \mu^{-} \gamma$ effective lifetime, and the related CP-phase
sensitive quantity $A_{\Delta\Gamma_s}^{\mu \mu \gamma}$, as a way to obtain qualitatively new
insights on the current $B$-decay discrepancies. Through a fit comparing pre- to post-Moriond-2021
data we identify a few theory benchmark scenarios addressing these discrepancies, and featuring
large CP violation in addition. We then explore the possibility of telling apart these scenarios
with $A_{\Delta\Gamma_s}^{\mu \mu \gamma}$, once resonance-modeling and form-factor uncertainties
are taken into account. We do so in both regions of low and high invariant di-lepton mass-squared
$q^2$. For low $q^2$, we show how to shape the integration range in order to reduce the impact of the
$\phi$-resonance modelling on the $A_{\Delta\Gamma_s}^{\mu \mu \gamma}$ prediction. For high
$q^2$, we find that the corresponding pollution from broad-charmonium resonances has a surprisingly
small effect on $A_{\Delta\Gamma_s}^{\mu \mu \gamma}$. This is due to a number of cancellations,
that can be traced back to the complete dominance of semi-leptonic operator contributions for high
$q^2$ -- at variance with low $q^2$ -- and to $A_{\Delta\Gamma_s}^{\mu \mu \gamma}$ behaving like
a ratio-of-amplitudes observable. Our study suggests that $A_{\Delta\Gamma_s}^{\mu \mu \gamma}$
is -- especially at high $q^2$ -- a potentially valuable probe of short-distance CP-violating effects
in the very same Wilson coefficients that are associated to current $b \to s$ discrepancies. Its
discriminating power, however, relies on progress in form-factor uncertainties. Interestingly,
high $q^2$ is the region where $B^0_s \to \mu^{+} \mu^{-} \gamma$ is already being accessed experimentally,
and the region where form factors are more accessible through non-perturbative QCD methods.

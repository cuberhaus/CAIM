The primordial Lithium Problem is intimately connected to the assumption that ${}^{7}{\rm Li}$
observed in metal-poor halo stars retains its primordial abundance, which lies significantly
below the predictions of standard big-bang nucleosynthesis. Two key lines of evidence have argued
that these stars have not significantly depleted their initial ${}^{7}{\rm Li}$: i) the lack of
dispersion in Li abundances measured at low metallicity; and ii) the detection of the more fragile
${}^{6}{\rm Li}$ isotope in at least two halo stars. The purported ${}^{6}{\rm Li}$ detections
were in good agreement with predictions from cosmic-ray nucleosynthesis which is responsible
for the origin of ${}^{6}{\rm Li}$. This concordance left little room for depletion of ${}^{6}{\rm
Li}$ depletion, and implied that the more robust ${}^{7}{\rm Li}$ largely evaded destruction.
Recent (re)-observations of halo stars challenge the evidence against ${}^{7}{\rm Li}$ depletion:
i) lithium abundances now show significant dispersion, and ii) sensitive ${}^{6}{\rm Li}$ searches
now reveal only firm upper limits to the ${}^{6}{\rm Li}/{}^{7}{\rm Li}$ ratio. The tight new ${}^{6}{\rm
Li}$ upper limits generally fall far below the predictions of cosmic-ray nucleosynthesis, implying
that substantial ${}^{6}{\rm Li}$ depletion has occurred--by factors up to 50. We show that in stars
with ${}^{6}{\rm Li}$ limits and thus lower bounds on ${}^{6}{\rm Li}$ depletion, an equal amount
of ${}^{7}{\rm Li}$ depletion is more than sufficient to resolve the primordial ${}^{7}{\rm Li}$
Problem. This picture is consistent with stellar models in which ${}^{7}{\rm Li}$ is less depleted
than ${}^{6}{\rm Li}$, and strengthen the case that the Lithium Problem has an astrophysical solution.
We conclude by suggesting future observations that could test these ideas. (abridged)

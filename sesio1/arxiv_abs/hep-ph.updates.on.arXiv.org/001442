The standard cosmological model is based on the fundamental assumptions of a spatially homogeneous
and isotropic universe on large scales. An observational detection of a violation of these assumptions
at any redshift would immediately indicate the presence of new physics. We quantify the ability
of the Euclid mission, together with contemporary surveys, to improve the current sensitivity
of null tests of the canonical cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and the cold dark matter (LCDM) model
in the redshift range $0<z<1.8$. We considered both currently available data and simulated Euclid
and external data products based on a LCDM fiducial model, an evolving dark energy model assuming
the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization or an inhomogeneous Lema\^{\i}tre-Tolman-Bondi
model with a cosmological constant $\Lambda$ (LLTB), and carried out two separate but complementary
analyses: a machine learning reconstruction of the null tests based on genetic algorithms, and
a theory-agnostic parametric approach based on Taylor expansion and binning of the data, in order
to avoid assumptions about any particular model. We find that in combination with external probes,
Euclid can improve current constraints on null tests of the LCDM by approximately a factor of three
when using the machine learning approach and by a further factor of two in the case of the parametric
approach. However, we also find that in certain cases, the parametric approach may be biased against
or missing some features of models far from LCDM. Our analysis highlights the importance of synergies
between Euclid and other surveys. These synergies are crucial for providing tighter constraints
over an extended redshift range for a plethora of different consistency tests of some of the main
assumptions of the current cosmological paradigm.

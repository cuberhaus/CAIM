We used the modified Hagedron function and analyzed the experimental data measured by the BRAHMS,
STAR, PHENIX and ALICE Collaborations in Copper-Copper, Gold-Gold, deuteron-Gold, Lead-Lead,
proton-Lead and proton-proton collisions, and extracted the related parameters (kinetic freeze-out
temperature, transverse flow velocity, kinetic freeze-out volume, mean transverse momentum
and initial temperature) from the transverse momentum spectra of the particles (non-strange and
strange particles). We observed that all the above parameters decrease from central to peripheral
collisions, except transverse flow velocity which remains unchanged from central to peripheral
collisions. The kinetic freeze-out temperature depends on the cross-section interaction of the
particle such that larger cross-section of the particle corresponds to smaller T0, and reveals
the two kinetic freeze-out scenario, while the initial temperature depends on the mass of the particle
and it increase with the particle mass. The transverse flow velocity and mean transverse momentum
depends on the mass of the particle and the former decrease while the later increase with the particle
mass. In addition, the kinetic kinetic freeze-out volume also decrease with particle mass which
reveals the volume differential freeze-out scenario and indicates different freeze-out surfaces
for different particles. We also extracted the entropy index-parameter n and the parameter N0,
and the former remains almost unchanged while the later decrease from central to peripheral collisions.
Furthermore, the kinetic freeze-out temperature, transverse flow velocity, kinetic freeze-out
volume, initial temperature, mean transverse momentum and the parameter N0 at LHC are larger than
that of RHIC, and they show their dependence on the collision cross-section as well as on collision
energy at RHIC and LHC.

We reassess the viability of a cosmological model including a fourth additional sterile neutrino
species that self-interacts through a new pseudoscalar degree of freedom. We perform a series of
extensive analyses fitting various combinations of cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from
Planck, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and the South Pole Telescope (SPT), both alone and
in combination with Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) and Supernova Ia (SnIa) observations. We
show that the scenario under study, although capable to resolve the Hubble tension without worsening
the so-called $S_8$ tension about the growth of cosmic structures, is severely constrained by high-multipole
polarization data from both Planck and SPT. Intriguingly, when trading Planck TE-EE data for those
from ACT, we find a $\gtrsim 3 \sigma$ preference for a non-zero sterile neutrino mass, $m_s=3.6^{+1.1}_{-0.6}$
eV (68 % C.L.), compatible with the range suggested by longstanding short-baseline (SBL) anomalies
in neutrino oscillation experiments. The pseudoscalar model provides indeed a better fit to ACT
data compared to $\Lambda$CDM ($\Delta\chi^2 \simeq -5$, $\Delta \rm{AIC}=-1.3$), although
in a combined analysis with Planck the $\Lambda$CDM model is still favoured, as the preference for
a non-zero sterile neutrino mass is mostly driven by ACT favouring a higher value for the primordial
spectral index $n_s$ with respect to Planck. We show that the mild tension between Planck and ACT
is due to the different pattern in the TE and EE power spectra on multipoles between $350 \lesssim
\ell \lesssim 1000$. We also check the impact of marginalizing over the gravitational lensing information
in Planck data, showing that the model does not solve the CMB lensing anomaly. Future work including
higher precision data from current and upcoming CMB ground-based experiments will be crucial to
test these results.

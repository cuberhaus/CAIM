The $\Upsilon$ and $\eta_b$ as well as $B^*$ meson mass shifts (scalar potentials) are estimated
for the first time in symmetric nuclear matter. The main interest is, whether or not the strengths
of the bottomonium-nuclear matter and charmonium-nuclear matter interactions are similar or
very different, in the range of a few tens of MeV at the nuclear matter saturation density. This is
because, each ($\Upsilon,J/\Psi$) and ($\eta_c,\eta_b$) meson group is usually assumed to have
very similar properties based on the heavy charm and bottom quark masses. The estimate for the $\Upsilon$
is made using an SU(5) effective Lagrangian density, by studying the $BB$, $BB^*$, and $B^*B^*$
meson loop contributions for the self-energy in free space and in nuclear medium. As a result, only
the $BB$ meson loop contribution is included as our minimal prediction. As for the $\eta_b$, is included
only the $BB^*$ meson loop contribution in the self-energy, to be consistent with the minimal prediction
for the $\Upsilon$. The in-medium masses of the $B$ and $B^{*}$ mesons appearing in the self-energy
loops are calculated by the quark-meson coupling model. Form factors are used to regularize the
loop integrals with a wide range of the cutoff mass values. The results suggest that both $\Upsilon$
and $\eta_b$ should form bound states with a variety of nuclei considered in this study, for which
the $\Upsilon$-nucleus and $\eta_b$-nucleus bound state energies are calculated. The results
also show an appreciable difference between the bottomonium-nuclear matter and charmonium-nuclear
matter interaction strengths. Are also studied the $\Upsilon$ and $\eta_b$ mass shifts in a heavy
quark (heavy meson) symmetry limit. In addition, an initial study was done to investigate the influence
of the choice of the form factor on our predictions.

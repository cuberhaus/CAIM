In the hydrodynamic model description of heavy ion collisions, the final-state anisotropic flow
$v_n$ are linearly related to the strength of the multi-pole shape of the distribution of nucleons
in the transverse plane $\varepsilon_n$, $v_n\propto \varepsilon_n$. The $\varepsilon_n$,
for $n=1,2,3,4$, are sensitive to the shape of the colliding ions, characterized by the quadrupole
$\beta_2$, octupole $\beta_3$ and hexadecapole $\beta_4$ deformations. This sensitivity is
investigated analytically and also in a Monte Carlo Glauber model. One observes a robust linear
relation, $\langle\varepsilon_n^2\rangle = a_n'+b_n'\beta_n^2$, for events in a fixed centrality.
The $\langle\varepsilon_1^2\rangle$ has a contribution from $\beta_3$ and $\beta_4$, and $\langle\varepsilon_3^2\rangle$
from $\beta_4$. In the ultra-central collisions, there are little cross contributions between
$\beta_2$ and $\varepsilon_3$ and between $\beta_3$ and $\varepsilon_2$, but clear cross contributions
are present in non-central collisions. Additionally, $\langle\varepsilon_n^2\rangle$ are
insensitive to non-axial shape parameters such as the triaxiality. This is good news because the
measurements of $v_2$, $v_3$ and $v_4$ can be used to constrain simultaneously the $\beta_2$, $\beta_3$,
and $\beta_4$ values. This is best done by comparing two colliding ions with similar mass numbers
and therefore nearly identical $a_n'$, to obtain simple equation that relates the $\beta_n$ of
the two species. This opens up the possibility to map the shape of the atomic nuclei at a timescale
($<10^{-24}$s) much shorter than probed by low-energy nuclear structure physics ($<10^{-21}$s),
which ultimately may provide information complementary to those obtained in the nuclear structure
experiments.

Studying semi-hard processes in the large center-of-mass energy limit gives us an opportunity
to further test perturbative QCD in an unexplored kinematical configuration, contributing to
a better understanding of the dynamics of strong interactions. For semi-hard reactions in kinematics
at large center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}$, the BFKL resummation of energy logarithms comes into
play, since large energy logarithms compensate the smallness of QCD coupling $\alpha_s$ and must
therefore be accounted for to all perturbative orders. Tracing the path toward performing precision
calculations via BFKL resummation of high-energy logarithms, in this thesis we present phenomenological
analyses for distinct inclusive processes, highlighting the recognized problem of instabilities
under higher-order corrections and energy-scales variations, that would abort any possibility
to investigate semi-hard reactions with high-precision at natural energy-scales. At the same
time, we present new reactions that seem to act as fair stabilizers of the high-energy series. First,
the inclusive production at the LHC of a charged light hadron and of a jet, featuring a wide separation
in rapidity, is presented making use of optimization methods to fix energy-scale. We report some
predictions, tailored on the CMS and CASTOR acceptances. Then, we propose as a novel probe channel
for the manifestation of the BFKL dynamics, the inclusive hadroproduction of a Higgs boson and of
a jet, featuring large transverse momenta and well separated in rapidity. Finlay, we propose the
inclusive semi-hard production of two bottom-flavored hadrons, as well as of a single bottom-flavored
hadron accompanied by a light jet, as novel channels for targeting stabilization effects of the
high-energy resummation under higher-order corrections.

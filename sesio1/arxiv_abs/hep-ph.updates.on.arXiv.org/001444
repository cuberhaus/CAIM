Axion-like particles (ALPs) are very light, neutral, spin zero bosons predicted by many theories
which try to complete the standard model of elementary particles. ALPs interact primarily with
two photons and can generate photon-ALP oscillations in the presence of an external magnetic field.
They are attracting increasing interest since photon-ALP oscillations produce deep consequences
in astrophysics particularly in the very-high-energy (VHE) band. Two hints for the existence of
an ALP have recently been proposed. In this paper, we study another effect of the photon-ALP interaction:
the change of the polarization state of photons. In particular, we study the propagation of the photon-ALP
beam starting where photons are produced - we consider photons generated in a galaxy cluster or in
the jet of a blazar - crossing several magnetized media (blazar jet, host galaxy, galaxy cluster,
extragalactic space, Milky Way) up to their arrival at the Earth, where photons can be detected.
In the presence of photon-ALP interaction, we analyze the photon survival probability $P_{\gamma
\to \gamma}$ and the corresponding photon degree of linear polarization $\Pi_L$ for observed energies
in the range $(1-10^{15}) \, \rm eV$. We observe that photons, which are expected as unpolarized
in the absence of ALPs, are made partially polarized by photon-ALP interaction. Our findings about
the X-ray and high-energy bands can be tested by current and planned observatories like IXPE, Polstar,
COSI, e-ASTROGAM and AMEGO. We also discover a peculiar feature in the VHE band, where photons at
energies above $ \sim 1 \, \rm TeV$ are fully polarized because of photon-ALP interaction. A possible
detection of this feature would represent a proof for the existence of an ALP, but, unfortunately,
current technologies do not allow yet to detect photon polarization up to so high energies.

The recent Fermilab muon $g-2$ result and the same for electron due to fine-structure constant measurement
through ${}^{133}{\rm Cs}$ matter-wave interferometry are probed in relation to MSSM with non-holomorphic
(NH) trilinear soft SUSY breaking terms, referred as NHSSM. Supersymmetric contributions to charged
lepton $(g-2)_l$ can be enhanced via the new trilinear terms involving a wrong Higgs coupling with
left and right-handed scalars. Unlike many MSSM based analyses, the model does not require a light
electroweakino, or light sleptons, or unequal left and right slepton masses, or a very large higgsino
mass parameter. The first part of the analysis involves $(g-2)_\mu$ constraint along with limits
from Higgs mass, B-physics, collider data, direct detection of dark matter (DM) while focusing
on a higgsino DM which is underabundant in nature. We then impose the constraint from electron $g-2$
where a large Yukawa threshold corrections (an outcome of NHSSM) and opposite signs of trilinear
NH coefficients associated with $\mu$ and $e$ fields are used to satisfy the dual limits of $\Delta
{a_\mu}$ and $\Delta {a_e}$ (where the latter comes with negative sign). Varying Yukawa threshold
corrections further provide the necessary flavor-dependent enhancement of $\Delta {a_e}/m_e^2$
compared to that of $\Delta {a_\mu}/m_\mu^2$. A larger Yukawa threshold correction through $A^\prime_e$
for $y_e$ also takes away the direct proportionality of $a_e$ with respect to $\tan\beta$. With
a finite intercept, $a_e$ becomes only an increasing function of $\tan\beta$. We identified the
available parameter space in the two cases while also applying the ATLAS data on slepton pair production
in the plane of slepton mass parameter and the mass of the lightest neutralino.

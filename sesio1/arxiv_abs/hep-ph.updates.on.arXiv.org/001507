Black hole shadow and gravitational lensing play important roles in testing gravitational theories
in the strong field regime. As the first-order modifications from quantum gravity, the nonlocality
can be manifested by black hole shadow and gravitational lensing. For example, the cut-off parameter
introduced by nonlocality will affect the shape and size of the black hole shadow, and also affect
the deflection angle of light rays. In this paper, we mainly investigate the effects of the nonlocality
on the black hole shadow and the gravitational lensing for two types of rotating black holes in nonlocal
gravity. It is found that the size of the black hole shadow decreases with the cut-off parameter since
the nonlocality weakens the gravitational constant, and the shape of the shadow gets more deformed
with the increase of the cut-off parameter. However, if the rotation parameter is small, the shape
of the shadow is almost a circle even though the cut-off parameter approaches its maximum. The energy
emission rate in both models is also studied. The results show that there is a peak for each curve and
the peak decreases and shifts to the low frequency with the increase of the cut-off parameter. Besides,
we also explore the shadow of both types of black holes surrounded by a nonmagnetized pressureless
plasma which satisfies the separability condition. It is found that the plasma has a frequency-dependent
dispersive effect on the size and shape of the black hole shadow. For the gravitational lensing,
we find that the cut-off parameter of model A makes a positive contribution to the deflection angle,
which can be compared with the contribution of the rotation parameter, while the cut-off parameter
of model B makes a negative contribution which can be ignored. These results may be helpful for probing
nonlocal gravity in future observations.

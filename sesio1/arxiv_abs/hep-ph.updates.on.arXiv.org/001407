The event of astroparticle collision at high energy was detected in 1975 during the balloon flight
in the stratosphere. The data of hundred particle tracks in x-ray films have been re-analyzed in
the style of LHC experiments: rapidity distributions of charged particles and transverse mass
spectra of multi-particle production have been built. The comparison of multiple histograms with
the expectations of the Quark-Gluon String Model (QGSM) gives us the conclusion that it might be
the carbon nucleus collision with the matter of atmosphere at the c.m.s. equivalent energy $\sqrt{s}
\ge $ 5 TeV. After QGSM analysis of these scarce data, we know the following: the value of maximal rapidity
of one projectile proton and the density of particle multiplicity in the central rapidity region.
Besides this, the transverse mass distributions show us how many protons are produced in every particular
range of rapidity. In such a way, we certainly can distinguish how this astroparticle interaction
is similar to or differs from the average A-A collision event at LHC. The data indicate some features
of new physics: one particle with transverse mass 16 GeV was detected. This fact and the absence of
enough protons in the forward rapidity region make us convinced that there was a baryonic DM collision.
These neutral baryon-antibaryon states are formated in space at the huge mass density near giant
massive objects like Black Holes. Finally, we conclude that the cosmic ray experiments on the high
altitude in the atmosphere are, on one hand, good supplements to the LHC measurements. On the other
hand, they are able to discover events of new astroparticle collision in the full kinematical region,
while LHC isn't. Such experiments, which can detect the very first collision with the atmosphere,
should be continued in the stratosphere with the application of new advanced electronic methods.

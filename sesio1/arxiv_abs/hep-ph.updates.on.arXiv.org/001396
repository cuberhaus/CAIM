We investigate the transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) spectra of identified hadrons in minimum-bias
proton-proton (pp) collisions at 0.9, 2.76, 5.02, 7 and 13 TeV in the framework of Tsallis-blast
wave model. In this model, the average radial flow velocity $\langle \beta \rangle$ and the Tsallis
temperature $T$ are common for all hadrons, while the degrees of non-equilibrium $q$ are, respectively,
universal for mesons and baryons when a combined fit is performed to the $p_{\rm T}$ spectra of different
particles at a given energy. It is found that the model can well describe the particle spectra up to
10 GeV/c. $\langle \beta \rangle$ increases with the collision energy. $q$ and $T$ show a similar
behaviour, but with a much weaker trend. With the dependence of the freeze-out parameters on the
energy, we evaluate $\langle \beta \rangle$, $T$ and $q$ in pp collisions at 8 and 14 TeV and predict
the particle spectra at these two energies. We then extend the model to the identified particle spectra
at different charged-particle multiplicities in pp collisions at 7 TeV and 13 TeV. At both energies
the radial flow increases with the multiplicity while the degree of non-equilibrium shows an opposite
behaviour, which is similar to that observed in pA and AA collisions at the LHC energies. However,
the Tsallis temperature increases with the multiplicity, which is opposite to the trend in pA and
AA collisions. At similar multiplicities, the radial flow in pp collisions is stronger than those
in pA and AA collisions, indicating that the size of the colliding system has significant effects
on the final state particle dynamics. Finally, we apply an additional flow correction to the Tsallis
temperature and found that the thermal temperature almost scales with the multiplicity in a uniform
way, despite the difference in the colliding system and energy.

In 2020 the XENON1T experiment observed an excess of events with an electron recoil energy $E_R$
in the range of $2\,$--$\,3\,$keV. Such an excess can arise from a variety of sources such as solar
axions or a neutrino magnetic moment, but also from inelastic scattering of dark matter off the xenon
atoms. The recoil energy of the electron then depends on the mass difference of the dark particles.
In this paper we show that the annual modulation of both the event rate and the electron recoil energy
provide important additional information that allows to distinguish among different theoretical
explanations of the signal. To this end, we first extend the formalism of annual modulation to electronic
recoils, inelastic dark matter scattering and the electron recoil energy. We then study a concrete
theoretical model with two Dirac fermions and a dark photon. We take into account all relevant cosmological
and experimental constraints on this model and apply it to the XENON1T and and XENONnT experiments
with realistic detection thresholds, efficiencies and energy resolutions, fitting the main physical
parameters of the model, i.e. the mass splitting and the electron scattering cross section. The
discriminatory power of the additional information from the annual modulation of both the signal
rate and the electron recoil energy is then demonstrated for XENONnT with a simplified model based
on these main physical parameters. This more sensitive procedure compared to time-only modulation
analyses can also serve as a template for other theoretical models with different dark matter candidates,
mediators and cosmology. For the $U(1)$ model with two Dirac fermions fitting the XENON1T excess
and the experimental conditions of XENONnT, taking into account the annual variation of the signal
rate and recoil energy allows for a faster and more precise determination of the free model parameters.

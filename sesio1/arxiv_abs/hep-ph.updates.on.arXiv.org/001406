Precise determination of top-quark pairs is an essential tool for understanding the overall consistency
of the standard model (SM) expectations, understanding limited New Physics (NP) models, through
spin-spin correlation and polarization parameters, and has a critical impact on the analyses strategies
at upcoming LHC programs. In this work, we review and discuss various state-of-the-art Monte Carlo
(MC) methodologies as \textsc{MadGraph5}\_aMC@NLO, \textsc{Sherpa}, \textsc{Powheg-Box}
and \textsc{Pythia8}, which are Matrix Element (ME)$/$Parton Shower (PS) matching generators
including a complete set of spin correlation and polarization in top quark pair production with
dileptonic final states. This is the first such study that not only compares the effects of different
MC event generator approaches on spin density matrix elements and polarization parameters, but
also investigates the effects of leading order (LO) and next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy in
QCD, and electroweak (EW) corrections via \textsc{Sherpa}. Moreover, as a continuation of the
work, the prospects for possible NP scenarios through top-quark spin-spin correlation and polarization
measurements for Supersymmetry (R parity conserved and violated models) and Dark Matter (top quarks
associated mediator) models during upcoming LHC runs are briefly outlined. We find that all SM MC
predictions for the defined set of variables are generally consistent with the experimental data
and theoretical predictions within the uncertainty variations. Besides, for the distributions
of the $\cos\varphi$, laboratory-frame observables ($\cos\varphi_{lab}$ and $|\Delta\phi_{ll}|$)
and the observables generated by parity (P) and charge-parity (CP) conserving interactions, we
conclude some clues that the considered signals and beyond may well be separated from experimental
data and located above the SM predictions.

The asymmetry of baryon/antibaryon production has been measured in many proton-proton, pion-proton
and electron-proton experiments. In the framework of Quark-Gluon String Model (QGSM) the energy
dependence of asymmetry tells us about the value of $\alpha_{SJ}$(0), the intercept of String Junction
Regge trajectory. In previous QGSM study, the value of intercept has been estimated as 0.5 < $\alpha_{SJ}$(0)
< 0.9. Here, SJ behaviors are accumulated in the model based on topological expansion in order to
build a neutral object with zero baryon charge. By the way, QCD mass falling under the event horizon
of Black Hole (BH) should be symmetric, or in other words, have no charge information. The baryon
junctions are easily combinable with antibaryon ones in hexagons. Topologically, hexagon net
can coherently cover only the torus surface. The net on the torus has discrete number of baryon/antibaryon
junctions. This is only parameter that marks the mass/energy level of this object. It looks like
DM particle, is not it? In high energy collisions at LHC, such pomeron loops are to be produced approximately
in 1.2 percent of inelastic events. Furthermore, the torus configurations of matter have been revealed
in many bright events in space. As an example, Chandra experiment has detected such dense "doughnut"
near the event horizon of Super Massive Black Hole (SMBH), which X-ray radiation is screened on 40
percent's. This topological symmetry model of DM seems rather realistic and can help us to deal with
an "arm wrestling" between the stiffness of toroid structure of QCD matter and the pressure of gravitational
singularity at extremely heavy masses. On the other hand, the instabilities in structure of matter
in SMBHs can cause the bursts of giant relativistic hadron jets with the masses of order the own BH
mass.

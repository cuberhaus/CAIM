We present a likelihood analysis of the general two Higgs doublet model, using the most important
currently measured flavour observables, in view of the anomalies in charged current tree-level
and neutral current one-loop rare decays of $B$ mesons in $b\to c l \overline{\nu}$ and $b\to s\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$
transitions, respectively. We corroborate that the model explains the latter and it is able to simultaneously
fit the experimental values of the $R(D)$ ratio at $1\sigma$, but it can not accommodate the $R(D^{*})$
and $F_{L}(D^{*})$ observables. We find that the fitted values for the angular observables in $b\to
s\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ transitions exhibit better agreement with the general two Higgs double model
in comparison to the SM. We also make predictions for future collider observables $\mathrm{BR}(t\to
ch)$, $\mathrm{BR}(h\to bs)$, $\mathrm{BR}(h\to \tau\mu)$, $\mathrm{BR}(B_{s}\rightarrow\tau^{+}\tau^{-})$,
$\mathrm{BR}(B^{+}\rightarrow K^{+}\tau^{+}\tau^{-})$ and the flavour violating decays of
the $\tau$ lepton, $\mathrm{BR}(\tau\rightarrow3\mu)$ and $\mathrm{BR}(\tau\to\mu\gamma)$.
The model predicts values of $\mathrm{BR}(t\to ch)$, $\mathrm{BR}(B_{s}\rightarrow\tau^{+}\tau^{-})$
and $\mathrm{BR}(B^{+}\rightarrow K^{+}\tau^{+}\tau^{-})$ that are out of reach of future experiments,
but its predictions for $\mathrm{BR}(h\to bs)$ and $\mathrm{BR}(h\to \tau\mu)$ are within the
future sensitivity of the HL-LHC or the ILC. We also find that the predictions for the $\tau\rightarrow3\mu$
and $\tau\to\mu\gamma$ decays are well within the projected limits of the Belle II experiment.
Finally, using the latest measurement of the Fermilab Muon $g-2$ Collaboration, we performed a
simultaneous fit to $\Delta a_{\mu}$ constrained by the charged anomalies, finding solutions
at the $1\sigma$ level. Once the neutral anomalies are included, however, a simultaneous explanation
is unfeasible.

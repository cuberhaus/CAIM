Gauge boson self-couplings are completely defined by the non-Abelian gauge symmetry of the Standard
Model (SM), thus direct search for these couplings are extremely significant in understanding
the gauge structure of the SM. The possible deviation from the SM predictions of gauge boson self-couplings
would be a sign of the presence of new physics beyond the SM. In this work, we study the sensitivities
on the anomalous couplings defined by dimension-8 operators related to the $ZZ\gamma\gamma$ and
$Z\gamma\gamma\gamma$ quartic vertices through the process $e^+e^- \to Z\gamma\gamma$ with
Z-boson decaying to charged leptons at the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC). We analyze the center-of-mass
energy of 3 TeV, integrated luminosities of ${\cal L}=1, 4, 5$ $\rm ab^{-1}$, systematic uncertainties
of $\delta_{sys}=0\%, 5\%, 10\%$, and unpolarized and polarized electron beams for extraction
of expected sensitivity on the anomalous $f_ {T,j}/\Lambda^4$ couplings at $95\%$ confidence
level, which are especially sensitive to the $Z\gamma\gamma$ channel. It is clear from the results
that if the systematic error is improved, we expect better limits on the couplings. The best limits
obtained on the anomalous quartic couplings for the process $e^+e^- \to Z\gamma\gamma$ with $\sqrt{s}=
3$ TeV, ${\cal L}=5$ $\rm ab^{-1}$ and $\delta_{sys}=0\%$ can be approximately improved up to about
two times better than the limits obtained with $\delta_{sys}=10\%$. Our sensitivities on the anomalous
quartic couplings with $\delta_{sys}=0\%$ can set more stringent sensitivity by two orders of
magnitude concerning the best sensitivity derived from the current experimental limits. Finally,
with initial electron beam polarization, the sensitivity of the anomalous quartic couplings improves
by almost a factor of 1.2.

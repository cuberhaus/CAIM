We revisit the evolution of generalised parton distributions (GPDs) in momentum space. We formulate
the evolution kernels at one-loop in perturbative QCD (pQCD) in a form suitable for numerical implementation
and that allows for an accurate study of their properties. This leads to the first open-source implementation
of GPD evolution equations able to cover the entire kinematic region and allowing for heavy-quark-threshold
crossings. The numerical implementation of the GPD evolution equations is publicly accessible
through the APFEL++ evolution library and is available within the PARTONS framework. Our formulation
makes use of the operator definition of GPDs in light-cone gauge renormalised in the $\overline{\mbox{MS}}$
scheme. For the sake of clarity, we recompute the evolution kernels at one-loop in pQCD, confirming
previous calculations. We obtain general conditions on the evolution kernels deriving from the
GPD sum rules and show that our formulation obeys these conditions. We analytically show that our
calculation reproduces the DGLAP and the ERBL equations in the appropriate limits and that it guarantees
the continuity of GPDs. We numerically check that the evolved GPDs fulfil DGLAP and ERBL limits,
continuity, and polynomiality. We benchmark our numerical implementation against analytical
evolution in conformal space. Finally, we perform a numerical comparison to an existing implementation
of GPD evolution finding a general good agreement on the kinematic region accessible to the latter.
This work provides a pedagogical description of GPD evolution equations which benefits from a renewed
interest as future colliders, such as the electron-ion colliders in the US and in China, are being
designed. It also paves the way to the extension of GPD evolution codes to higher accuracies in pQCD
desirable for precision phenomenology at these facilities.

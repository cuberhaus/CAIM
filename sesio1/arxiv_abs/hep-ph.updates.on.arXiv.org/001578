One of the basic propositions of quantum field theory is Lorentz invariance. The spontaneous breaking
of Lorentz symmetry at a more fundamental theory at high energy scale can manifest itself at the low
energy extension of standard model perturbatively via effective field theories. The present and
future Long-baseline neutrino experiments can give a scope to observe such a Planck-suppressed
physics of Lorentz Invariance Violation. The proposed long baseline experiment P2O extending
from Protvino to ORCA with a baseline of 2595 km, is expected to provide good sensitivities to unresolved
issues, especially neutrino mass ordering. P2O can offer good statistics even with a moderate beam
power and runtime, owing to the very large ($\sim 6$ Mt) detector volume at ORCA. Here we discuss in
detail how the individual LIV parameters affect neutrino oscillation at the P2O and DUNE baseline
at the level of probability and derive analytical expressions to understand interesting degeneracies
and other features. We estimate $\Delta \chi^{2}$ sensitivities to the LIV parameters, analyzing
their correlations among each other, and also with the standard oscillation parameters. We calculate
these results for P2O alone and also carry out a combined analysis of P2O with DUNE. We point out crucial
features in the sensitivity contours and explain them qualitatively with the help of the relevant
probability expressions derived here. Finally, we estimate constraints on the individual LIV
parameters at a confidence level (C.L.) of $95\%$ with the combined (P2O+DUNE) analysis and highlight
the improvement over the existing constraints. We also find out that the additional degeneracy
induced by the LIV parameter $a_{ee}$ around $-22 \times 10^{-23}$ GeV is lifted by the combined
analysis at $95\%$ C.L.

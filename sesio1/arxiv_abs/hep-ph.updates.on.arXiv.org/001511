We study the phenomenological consequences of two-zero textures of \textit{inverse} neutrino
mass matrix($M_{\nu}^{-1}$). There are fifteen possibilities to have two-zero textures of $M_{\nu}^{-1}$.
In order to study complete phenomenology of the model, we confront these textures with the latest
neutrino data including large mixing angle(LMA) and \textit{dark}-large mixing angle(DLMA)
degenerate solutions, later of which originates if neutrinos exhibit non-standard interactions
with matter. Out of fifteen possibilities only seven($B_2,B_4,C_1,C_3,D_1,D_2,E_1$) are found
to be in consonance with LMA and/or DLMA solutions. In general, we find that the textures for which
$(M_{\nu}^{-1})_{11}=0$ are disallowed. The textures $B_2$, $B_4$, $C_1$, $C_3$ and $D_2$ textures
are found to be allowed under both LMA and DLMA descriptions. Also, these textures are necessarily
$CP$ violating. However, the textures which are not consistent with DLMA paradigm, for example
$D_1$ and $E_1$, allow both $CP$ conserving and violating solutions. The generic feature of the
class of model discussed in the present work is the existence of neutrino mass hierarchy degeneracy
in a particular texture. Interestingly, amongst all the seven texture, textures with $(M_{\nu}^{-1})_{23}=0$
are found to be either disallowed or are consistent with LMA($D_1$ and $E_1$) description only.
Except for textures $D_1$ and $E_1$, the predicted $3\sigma$ lower bound on $|M_{ee}|$ is $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$
which is within the sensitivity reach of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay experiments. For example, the
non-observation of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay down to these high sensitivities will refute all the
textures except $D_1$ and $E_1$. Furthermore, we have proposed a flavor model, based on discrete
non-Abelian flavor group $A_4$, wherein such textures of $M_{\nu}^{-1}$ can be realized within
Type-I seesaw setting.

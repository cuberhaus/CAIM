The Galactic center excess (GCE) remains one of the most intriguing discoveries from the Fermi Large
Area Telescope (LAT) observations. We revisit the characteristics of the GCE by first producing
a new set of high-resolution galactic diffuse gamma-ray emission templates, which are ultimately
due to cosmic-ray interactions with the interstellar medium. Using multi-messenger observations
we constrain the properties of the galactic diffuse emission. The broad properties of the GCE that
we find in this work are qualitatively unchanged despite the introduction of this new set of templates,
though its quantitative features appear mildly different than those obtained in previous analyses.
In particular, we find a high-energy tail at higher significance than previously reported. This
tail is very prominent in the northern hemisphere, and less so in the southern hemisphere. This strongly
affects one prominent interpretation of the excess: known millisecond pulsars are incapable of
producing this high-energy emission, even in the relatively softer southern hemisphere, and are
therefore disfavored as the sole explanation of the GCE. The annihilation of dark matter particles
of mass $40^{+10}_{-7}$ GeV (95$\%$ CL) to $b$ quarks with a cross-section of $\sigma v = 1.4^{+0.6}_{-0.3}
\times 10^{-26}$ cm$^{3}$s$^{-1}$ provides a good fit to the excess especially in the relatively
cleaner southern sky. Dark matter of the same mass range annihilating to $b$ quarks or heavier dark
matter particles annihilating to heavier Standard Model bosons can combine with millisecond pulsars
to provide a good fit to the southern hemisphere emission. As part of this paper, we make publicly
available all of our templates and the data covariance matrix we have generated to account for systematic
uncertainties.[abridged]

Background: The transverse densities $\rho_{1, 2}(b)$ describe the distributions of electric
charge and magnetic moment at fixed light-front time and connect the nucleon's elastic form factors
with its partonic structure. The dispersive representation of the form factors $F_{1, 2}(t)$ expresses
the densities in terms of exchanges of hadronic states in the $t$-channel and permits their analysis
using hadronic physics methods. Purpose: Compute the densities at peripheral distances $b = \mathcal{O}(M_\pi^{-1})$,
where they are generated predominantly by the two-pion states in the dispersive representation.
Quantify the uncertainties. Methods: Dispersively improved chiral effective field theory (DI$\chi$EFT)
is used to calculate the isovector spectral functions $\textrm{Im}\, F_{1, 2}(t)$ on the two-pion
cut. The method includes $\pi\pi$ interactions ($\rho$ resonance) through elastic unitarity
and provides realistic spectral functions up to $t \approx$ 1 GeV$^2$. Higher-mass states are parametrized
by effective poles and constrained by sum rules (charges, radii, superconvergence relations).
The densities $\rho_{1, 2}(b)$ are obtained from their dispersive representation. Uncertainties
are quantified by varying the spectral functions. The method respects analyticity and ensures
the correct $b \rightarrow \infty$ asymptotic behavior of the densities. Results: Accurate densities
are obtained at all distances $b \gtrsim 0.5$ fm, with correct behavior down to $b \rightarrow 0$.
The region of distances is quantified where transverse nucleon structure is governed by the two-pion
state. The light-front current distributions in the polarized nucleon are computed and discussed.
Conclusions: Peripheral nucleon structure can be computed from first principles using DI$\chi$EFT.
The method can be extended to generalized parton distributions and other nucleon form factors.

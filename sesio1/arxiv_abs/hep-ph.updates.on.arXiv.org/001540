A central goal in experimental high energy physics is to detect new physics signals that are not explained
by known physics. In this paper, we aim to search for new signals that appear as deviations from known
Standard Model physics in high-dimensional particle physics data. To do this, we determine whether
there is any statistically significant difference between the distribution of Standard Model
background samples and the distribution of the experimental observations, which are a mixture
of the background and a potential new signal. Traditionally, one also assumes access to a sample
from a model for the hypothesized signal distribution. Here we instead investigate a model-independent
method that does not make any assumptions about the signal and uses a semi-supervised classifier
to detect the presence of the signal in the experimental data. We construct three test statistics
using the classifier: an estimated likelihood ratio test (LRT) statistic, a test based on the area
under the ROC curve (AUC), and a test based on the misclassification error (MCE). Additionally,
we propose a method for estimating the signal strength parameter and explore active subspace methods
to interpret the proposed semi-supervised classifier in order to understand the properties of
the detected signal. We also propose a Score test statistic that can be used in the model-dependent
setting. We investigate the performance of the methods on a simulated data set related to the search
for the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. We demonstrate that the semi-supervised
tests have power competitive with the classical supervised methods for a well-specified signal,
but much higher power for an unexpected signal which might be entirely missed by the supervised tests.

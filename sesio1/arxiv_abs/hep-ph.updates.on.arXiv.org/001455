(abridged) We continue the study of $\Lambda$SFDM cosmologies, which differ from $\Lambda$CDM
in that CDM is replaced by scalar field dark matter (SFDM) by calculating the evolution of the background
Universe, as well as linear perturbations, focusing on scalar modes. We consider models with complex
scalar field with a repulsive, quartic self-interaction (SI), and models without SI, referred
to as fuzzy dark matter (FDM). To this end, we modify the Boltzmann code CLASS, to incorporate the
physics of complex SFDM which has as one of its characteristics that its equation of state is maximally
stiff in the very early Universe, dominating then over all the other cosmic components, even over
radiation. We calculate CMB and matter power spectra as well as unconditional Press-Schechter
halo mass functions for various models, expanding previous literature that were either limited
to the background, or to a semi-analytical approach to SFDM density perturbations neglecting the
early stiff phase. Comparing our results of each, SFDM and FDM, with real-field ultralight axion
models (ULAs) without SI, we characterize the differences between the respective background evolution
and linear structure growth. Our calculations strengthen previous findings in recent literature,
i.e. the suppression of structure is higher than originally expected in SFDM, questioning its ability
to explain the small-scale problems on dwarf-galactic scales. Also we find that the kinetic energy
due to the phase of the complex field leads to marked differences between SFDM/FDM versus ULAs. The
mild falloff in the SFDM power spectrum toward high $k$ is similar to that of CDM but based on different
effects, namely the rapidly shrinking Jeans mass for SFDM as opposed to the Meszaros effect for CDM.
In addition, we find that the sharp cutoff in the ULA power spectrum is also followed by a mild falloff,
albeit at very small power.

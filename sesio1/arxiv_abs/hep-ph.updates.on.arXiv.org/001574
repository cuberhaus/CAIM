In the presence of an electromagnetic background plane-wave field, electron, positron, and photon
states are not stable, because electrons and positrons emit photons and photons decay into electron-positron
pairs. This decay of the particle states leads to an exponential damping term in the probabilities
of single nonlinear Compton scattering and nonlinear Breit-Wheeler pair production. In this paper
we investigate analytically and numerically the probabilities of nonlinear Compton scattering
and nonlinear Breit-Wheeler pair production including the particle states' decay. For this we
first compute spin- and polarization-resolved expressions of the probabilities, provide some
of their asymptotic behaviors and show that the results of the total probabilities are independent
of the spin and polarization bases. Then, we present several plots of the total and differential
probabilities for different pulse lengths and for different spin and polarization quantum numbers.
We observe that it is crucial to take into account the damping of the states in order for the probabilities
to stay always below unity and we show that the damping factors also scale with the intensity and pulse
duration of the background field. In the case of nonlinear Compton scattering we show numerically
that the total probability behaves like a Poissonian distribution for sufficiently low initial
electron energies such that the photon recoil is negligible. In all considered cases, the kinematic
conditions are such that the final particles momenta transverse to the propagation direction of
the plane wave are always much smaller than the particles energies and the main spread of the momentum
distribution on the transverse plane is along the direction of the plane-wave electric field.

We analyse the four-body $B\rightarrow \phi(\rightarrow K\bar K)K^*(\rightarrow K\pi)$ decays
in the perturbative QCD approach,where the invariant mass of $K\bar K$($K\pi$) system is limited
in a window of $\pm 15$ MeV ($\pm150$ MeV) around the $\phi(K^*(892))$ mass.In addition to the P wave
resonances,two important S wave backgrounds in the selected invariant mass region are also accounted
for. Angular momentum conservation allows six helicity amplitudes to contribute,including three
P waves, two single S waves,and one double S wave. We calculated the branching ratio for each component
and found sizable S wave contributions,coincide with the experimental observation.The obtained
branching ratios of $B^{0(+)}\rightarrow \phi K^{*0(+)}$ are comparable with the previous predictions
and support the measurements, whereas the predicted $\mathcal{B}(B^0_s\rightarrow \phi \bar
K^{*0})$ is smaller than the world average. The longitudinal polarizations are predicted to be
around 0.7,consistent with previous PQCD results but larger than the data. Aside from the direct
CP asymmetries,the true and fake triple product asymmetries(TPAs) are calculated in this work.
In the case of neutral modes, both direct CP asymmetries and true TPAs are expected to be zero due to
the vanishing weak phase difference. The direct CP asymmetries for the $B^+$ mode are predicted
to be tiny,since the tree contributions are suppressed with respect to the penguin ones. The true
asymmetries have shown no significant deviations from zero.In contrast,large fake asymmetries
are observed in these decays,indicating the presence of significant final state interactions.We
give the predictions of the S wave induced TPAs for the first time,which is consistent with LHCb data
and would be checked with future measurements from Belle and BABAR experiments if the S wave components
can be properly taken into account in angular analysis.

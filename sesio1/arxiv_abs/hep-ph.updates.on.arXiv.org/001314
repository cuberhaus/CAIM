In this study, computational analysis of neutral Higgs bosons $h$, $H$ and $A$ is carried out within
the parameter space of Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) type-I in exact alignment limit of $\sin{(\beta
- \alpha)} = 1$ at compact linear collider. Assuming Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) scenario where
the electron-positron beams will be collided at $\sqrt{s}$ = 1.5 TeV. Two different values of predicted
integrated luminosities are used in our calculations, 1000 $fb^{-1}$ and 2500 $fb^{-1}$. Three
signal processes $e^+ e^- \rightarrow Zhh \rightarrow jjb\bar{b}b\bar{b}$, $e^+ e^- \rightarrow
ZHH \rightarrow jjb\bar{b}b\bar{b}$ and $e^+ e^- \rightarrow Zhh \rightarrow jjb\bar{b}b\bar{b}$
are selected for analysis. The polarized colliding beams are used to enhance the signal production
cross-section. Low $\tan{\beta}$ and equal Higgs masses regime is chosen in favor of Hadronic decay
of $Z$ boson and $H \rightarrow b\bar{b}$. Different signal scenarios are selected and event generation
is performed for each process separately. The $W$, $Z$ bosons, and top quark backgrounds are also
analyzed. Signal significance is computed at each Higgs mass hypothesis for three signal processes.
After a comprehensive study, we did not find sizeable amount of signal events on top of the background
but still, signal significance is found larger than 1 without taking into account the detector effects
and systematics. The maximum calculated value of signal significance is observed in the range of
150 $\leq$ $m_H$ $\leq$ 250 GeV for $Zhh$ while for $ZHH$ the range is 175 $\leq$ $m_H$ $\leq$ 200 GeV
at 1000 $fb^{-1}$ and 175 $\leq$ $m_H$ $\leq$ 225 GeV region at 2500 $fb^{-1}$. Similarly, for $ZAA$
process, the significance is highest at $m_A$ = 175 GeV for both 1000 and 2500 $fb^{-1}$.

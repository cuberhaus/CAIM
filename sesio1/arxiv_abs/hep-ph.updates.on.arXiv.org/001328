Our knowledge on the active three-neutrino mixing angles ($\theta_{12}$, $\theta_{13}$, and
$\theta_{23}$) and the Dirac CP phase $\delta_{CP}$ is becoming accurate day-by-day enabling
us to test the unitarity of the PMNS matrix with high precision. Future long-baseline experiments
will play an important role in this direction. In this work, we study the impact of possible non-unitary
neutrino mixing (NUNM) in the context of next-generation long-baseline experiments DUNE and T2HKK/JD+KD
having one detector in Japan (T2HK/JD) and a second detector in Korea (KD). We estimate the sensitivities
of these setups to place model-independent constraints on various NUNM parameters. We demonstrate
the possible correlations between NUNM parameters and oscillations parameters $\theta_{23}$
and $\delta_{CP}$. Our numerical results, supported by approximate analytical expressions of
oscillation probabilities in matter, reveal that JD+KD has better sensitivities for $|\alpha_{21}|$
and $\alpha_{22}$ than DUNE, due to its larger statistics in appearance channel and less systematic
uncertainties in disappearance channel, respectively. For $|\alpha_{31}|$, $|\alpha_{32}|$,
and $\alpha_{33}$, DUNE gives better constraints than JD+KD, due to its larger matter effect and
wider neutrino energy spectrum. For $\alpha_{11}$, both DUNE and JD+KD give similar bounds. We
also show how much the bounds on the NUNM parameters can be improved by combining the prospective
data from DUNE and JD+KD setups. Due to zero-distance effects, the near detectors in both DUNE and
JD+KD, can further improve the limits on $|\alpha_{21}|$ considerably, while giving slightly
better constraints for $\alpha_{11}$ and $\alpha_{22}$. Finally, we observe that $\nu_\tau$
events in DUNE can improve the constraints on $|\alpha_{32}|$ and $\alpha_{33}$.

We consider the renormalization-group evolution of the matrix element of $\langle 0| \bar{q}(z)_\beta
[z,0]b(0)_\alpha| \bar{B}\rangle$, which can be used to define the distribution amplitudes for
$B$ meson and widely applied in studies of $B$ meson decays. The contribution to the renormalization
constant of the non-local operator $\bar{q}(z)_\beta [z,0]b(0)_\alpha$ is considered up to one-loop
order in QCD. Since the quark fields in this operator are not directly coupled fields, momentum can
not flow freely through this non-local operator. Momentum involved in this operator can be treated
stringently in coordinate space. We find that the ultraviolet divergences regulated by dimensional
parameter $\epsilon$ cancel with each other, and the evolution effect vanishes. The matrix element
$\langle 0| \bar{q}(z)_\beta [z,0]b(0)_\alpha| \bar{B}\rangle$ escapes from the renormalization-group
evolution. We then apply the matrix element in calculating $B\to\pi$ transition form factor, where
the matrix element is obtained by using the $B$ meson wave function calculated in QCD-inspired potential
model. By comparing with experimental data for the semileptonic decay of $B\to \pi \ell\nu$ and
light-cone sum rule calculation, we analyse the perturbative and non-perturbative contributions
to $B\to\pi$ transition form factor in the frame work of perturbative QCD approach. We find that
the effectiveness of the suppression of Sudakov factor to soft contribution depends on the end-point
behavior of $B$ meson wave function, and with the $B$-meson wave function used in this work, soft
contribution can not be well suppressed. The hard contribution to the $B\to\pi$ transition form
factor is about 59\%, and soft contribution can be as large as 41\% in the naive calculation. To make
the perturbative calculation reliable, a soft momentum cutoff in the calculation and soft form
factor have to be introduced.

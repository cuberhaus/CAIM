We propose a phenomenological model of the Dirac neutrino mass matrix based on the Fridberg-Lee
neutrino mass model at a special point. In this case, the Fridberg-Lee model reduces to the Democratic
mass matrix with the $S_3$ permutation family symmetry. The Democratic mass matrix has an experimentally
unfavored degenerate mass spectrum on the base of tribimaximal mixing matrix. We rescue the model
to find a nondegenerate mass spectrum by adding the breaking mass term as preserving the twisted
Fridberg-Lee symmetry. The tribimaximal mixing matrix can be also realized. Exact tribimaximal
mixing leads to $\theta_{13}=0$. However, the results from Daya Bay and RENO experiments have established
a nonzero value for $\theta_{13}$. Keeping the leading behavior of $U$ as tribimaximal, we use Broken
Democratic neutrino mass model. We characterize a perturbation mass matrix which is responsible
for a nonzero $\theta_{13}$ along with CP violation, besides the solar neutrino mass splitting
has been resulted from it. We consider this work in two stages: In the first stage, we obtain the perturbation
mass matrix with real components which breaks softly the $\mu-\tau$ symmetry and this leads to a
nonzero value for $\theta_{13}$. In the second stage, we extend the perturbation mass matrix to
a complex symmetric matrix which leads to CP violation. Therefore obtain a realistic neutrino mixing
matrix with $\theta_{23}=45^\circ$. We obtain the solar mass splitting, the ordering of the neutrino
masses is inverted. Using only two sets of the experimental data, we can fix all of the parameters
of mass matrix and predict the masses of neutrinos and phases. These predictions include the following:
$m_{1}\approx(4.82-4.93)10^{-2}eV $, $|m_2|\approx(4.90-5.01)10^{-2} eV$, $m_3\approx0$
and, $\phi\approx(0.687^\circ-10.31^\circ)$ as the origin of the Majorana phases.

We present results of the first lattice QCD calculation of three-flavored heavy dibaryons both
in the flavor-symmetric and antisymmetric channels. These dibaryons have spin zero, and are constructed
using various possible combinations of quark flavors with at least one of them as the charm or the
bottom quark, i.e., namely, $H_c(cudcud), H_b(budbud), H_{bcs}(bcsbcs)$, $H_{csl}(cslcsl),
H_{bsl}(bslbsl)$ and $H_{bcl}(bclbcl)$; $l\in u,d$. We compute the ground state masses of these
dibaryons and the calculations are performed on three $N_f=2+1+1$ HISQ gauge ensembles of the MILC
collaboration, with lattice spacings $a =$ 0.1207, 0.0888 and 0.0582 fm. A relativistic overlap
action is employed for the valence light to charm quarks while a non-relativistic-QCD Hamiltonian
with improved coefficients is used for the bottom quarks. Unlike the doubly heavy tetraquarks,
one and two-flavored heavy dibaryons, for which lattice QCD calculations have predicted deeply
bound strong-interactions-stable states, for these $H_c, H_b, H_{csl},H_{bsl}$ dibaryons we
do not find any such deeply bound state. However, for $H_{bcs}$, our results indicate the presence
of an energy level $29\pm 24$ MeV below the lowest two-baryon threshold, which could be relevant
for its future experimental searches. Moreover, we find that the energy difference between the
ground state of $H_{bcl}$ and its lowest threshold increases when $m_l>m_s$. Taken together, our
findings indicate the possibility of the existence of the $H_{bcs}$ dibaryon while all other physical
three-flavored dibaryons are much closer to their thresholds suggesting either they are weakly
bound or unbound, resolving which requires further detail study. Our results also point that the
binding of a dibaryon configuration becomes stronger with the increase of its valence quark masses
which suggests an interesting aspect of strong interactions at multiple scales.

In hadron physics, molecular-like multi-hadron states can interact with compact multi-quark
states. The latter are modelled as bare states in the Hilbert space of a potential model. In this work,
we study several potential models relevant to the bare state, and solve their inverse scattering
problems. The first model labelled as `cc' is a separable potential model. We show that it can approximate
S-wave near-threshold physics with an error of $\mathcal{O}(\beta^3/M_V^3)$, where $\beta$
sets the maximum momentum of the near-threshold region and $M_V$ is the typical scale of the potential.
The second model labelled as `bc' serves as the bare-state-dominance approximation, where interaction
between continuum states is ignored. Under this model, we show that a shallow bound state naturally
tends to have a small bare-state proportion (which is one minus the compositeness), even if the bare
state is crucial for the bound state's generation. Therefore the bare-state proportion, or the
compositeness, cannot figure out the importance of the bare state. The last model labelled as `bcc'
is a combination of the former two models. This model not only serves as a correction to the bare-state-dominance
approximation, but also can be used to understand the interplay between quark and hadron degrees
of freedom. This model naturally leads to the presence of a Castillejo-Dalitz-Dyson (CDD) zero.
We consider the energy decomposition of a bound state. The potential ratio of the bare-continuum
interaction to the continuum self-interaction is proposed to understand how the bound state is
generated. Model-independently, an inequality for the potential ratio is derived. Based on the
model `bcc', the CDD zero can be used to estimate the potential ratio. At last, we apply these studies
to the deuteron, $\rho$ meson, and $D_{s0}^*(2317)$, and analyze the properties of them.

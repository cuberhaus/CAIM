Our Universe is expected to finally approach a de Sitter universe whose horizon is considered to
be in thermal equilibrium. In the present article, both the energy stored on the horizon and its thermodynamic
fluctuations are examined through the holographic equipartition law. First, it is confirmed that
a flat Friedmann--Robertson--Walker universe approaches a de Sitter universe, using a cosmological
model close to lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) models. Then, based on the holographic equipartition
law, the energy density of the Hubble volume is calculated from the energy on the Hubble horizon of
a de Sitter universe. The energy density for a de Sitter universe is constant and the order of the energy
density is consistent with the order of that for the observed cosmological constant. Second, thermodynamic
fluctuations of energy on the horizon are examined, assuming stable fluctuations around thermal
equilibrium states. A standard formulation of the fluctuations for a canonical ensemble is applied
to the Hubble horizon of a de Sitter universe. The thermodynamic fluctuations of the energy are found
to be a universal constant corresponding to the Planck energy, regardless of the Hubble parameter.
In contrast, the relative fluctuations of the energy can be characterized by the ratio of the one-degree-of-freedom
energy to the Planck energy. At the present time, the order of the relative fluctuations should be
within the range of a discrepancy derived from a discussion of the cosmological constant problem,
namely a range approximately from $10^{-60}$ to $10^{-123}$. The present results may imply that
the energy stored on the Hubble horizon is related to a kind of effective dark energy, whereas the
energy that can be `maximumly' stored on the horizon may behave as if it were a kind of effective vacuum-like
energy in an extended holographic equipartition law.

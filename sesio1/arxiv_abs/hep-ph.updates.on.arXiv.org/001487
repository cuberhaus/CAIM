There has been much work in recent years pertaining to viability studies for the intranuclear observation
of neutron-antineutron transformations. These studies begin firstly with the design and implementation
of an event generator for the simulation of this rare process, where one hopes to retain as much of
the underlying nuclear physics as possible in the initial state, and then studying how these effects
may perturb the final state observable particles for detector efficiency studies following simulated
reconstruction. There have been several searches for intranuclear neutron-antineutron transformations,
primarily utilizing the ${}^{16}_{8}$O nucleus, and completed within large underground water
Cherenkov detectors such as Super-Kamiokande. The latest iteration of a generator is presented
here for use in such an experiment. This generator includes several new features, including a new
radial (position) annihilation probability distribution and related intranuclear suppression
factor for ${}^{16}_{8}$O, as well as a highly general, modern nuclear multifragmentation model
with photonic de-excitations. The latter of these may allow for improved identification of the
signal using large underground detectors such as Super-Kamiokande and the future Hyper-Kamiokande,
potentially increasing the overall signal efficiencies of these rare searches. However, it should
be noted that certain fast photonic de-excitations may be washed out by $\pi^0$ decays to photons.
These new features implemented in these $\bar{n}$\isotope[15][8]{O} simulations increase the
overall physical realism of the model, and are easily portable to other future searches such as to
extranuclear $\bar{n}{}^{12}_{6}$C for the ESS NNBAR experiment, as well as intranuclear $\bar{n}{}^{39}_{18}$Ar
used in DUNE.

We study quantum fields on an arbitrary, rigid background with boundary. We derive the action for
a scalar in the holographic basis that separates the boundary and bulk degrees of freedom. A relation
between Dirichlet and Neumann propagators valid for any background is obtained from this holographic
action. As a simple application, we derive an exact formula for the flux of bulk modes emitted from
the boundary in a warped background. We also derive a formula for the Casimir pressure on a $(d-1)$-brane
depending only on the boundary-to-bulk propagators, and apply it in AdS. Turning on couplings and
using the holographic basis, we evaluate the one-loop boundary effective action in AdS by means
of the heat kernel expansion. We extract anomalous dimensions of single and double trace CFT operators
generated by loops of heavy scalars and nonabelian vectors, up to third order in the large squared
mass expansion. From the boundary heat kernel coefficients we identify CFT operator mixing and
corrections to OPE data, in addition to the radiative generation of local operators. We integrate
out nonabelian vector fluctuations in AdS$_{4,5,6}$ and obtain the associated holographic Yang-Mills
$\beta$ functions. Turning to the expanding patch of dS, following recent proposals, we provide
a boundary effective action generating the perturbative cosmological correlators using analytical
continuation from dS to EAdS. We obtain the "cosmological" heat kernel coefficients in the scalar
case and work out the divergent part of the dS$_4$ effective action which renormalizes the cosmological
correlators. We find that bulk masses and wavefunction can logarithmically run as a result of the
dS$_4$ curvature, and that operators on the late time boundary are radiatively generated. More
developments are needed to extract all one-loop information from the cosmological effective action.

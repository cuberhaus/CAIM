As accelerator-neutrino oscillation experiments improve oscillation parameter constraints,
control over systematic uncertainties on the incoming neutrino flux and interaction models is
increasingly important. The intense beams offered by modern experiments permit a variety of options
to constrain the flux using in situ "standard candle" measurements. These standard candles must
use very well understood processes to avoid introducing bias. One option discussed in this context
is the "low-$\nu$" method, designed to isolate neutrino interactions where there is low energy-transfer
to the nucleus, such that the cross section is expected to be approximately constant as a function
of neutrino energy. The shape of the low-energy transfer event sample can then be used to extract
the flux shape. Applications of the method at high neutrino energies (many tens of GeV) are well understood.
However, the applicability of the method at the few-GeV energies of current and future accelerator
neutrino experiments remains unclear due to the presence of nuclear and form-factor effects. In
this analysis we examine the prospects for improving constraints on accelerator neutrino fluxes
with the low-$\nu$ method in an experiment-independent way, using (anti)neutrino interactions
on argon and hydrocarbon targets from the GENIE, NEUT, NuWro and GiBUU event generators. The results
show that flux constraints from the low-$\nu$ method would be severely dependent on the specific
interaction model assumptions used in an analysis for neutrino energies less than 5 GeV. The spread
of model predictions show that a low-$\nu$ analysis is unlikely to offer much improvement on typical
neutrino flux uncertainties, even with a perfect detector. Notably -- running counter to the assumption
inherent to the low-$\nu$ method -- the model-dependence increases with decreasing energy transfer
for experiments in the few-GeV region.

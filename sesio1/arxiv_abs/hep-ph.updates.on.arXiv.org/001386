We investigate the transport of charge and heat in a baryon asymmetric hot QCD medium in the presence
of a magnetic field. When the magnetic field strength becomes weak, some novel phenomenological
aspects emerge in the transport phenomena, particularly: A) The degeneracy in left- and right-handed
chiral modes of quarks gets lifted. B) Hall effect in both electrical and thermal transport develops.
Both the transport coefficients assume a tensorial structure, where diagonal elements represent
the longitudinal conductivities ($\sigma_{\text{Ohmic}}$ and $\kappa_{0}$) and off-diagonal
elements represent their Hall counterparts ($\sigma_{\text{Hall}}$ and $\kappa_{1}$). The
$B$ dependent quasiparticle parton masses serve as an input for the evaluation of charge and thermal
transport properties of the medium, quantified by the electrical and Hall conductivities, and
the longitudinal and transverse thermal conductivities. The Ohmic conductivity ($\sigma_{\text{Ohmic}}$)
decreases whereas the Hall conductivity ($\sigma_{\text{Hall}}$) increases with magnetic field
strength. There is also a rise in both the conductivities with increase in quark chemical potential.
The coefficient $\kappa_0$ decreases with magnetic field whereas $\kappa_1$ increases with magnetic
field similar to the trends followed by the Ohmic and Hall conductivities. The degree of baryonic
asymmetry positively amplifies both $\kappa_0$ and $\kappa_1$. The value of the Knudsen number
($\Omega_0$ and $\Omega_1$) is found to be less than unity for the entire temperature range considered.
Further, we find that the Lorenz number $\left(\frac{\kappa_0}{\sigma_{\text{Ohmic}}T}\right)$
and Hall Lorenz number $\left(\frac{\kappa_1}{\sigma_{\text{Hall}}T}\right)$ do not remain
constant with temperature, rather increase, hence violating the Wiedemann-Franz law.

In these lecture notes we will discuss recent progress in extracting spectral and transport properties
from lattice QCD. We will focus on results of probes of the thermal QCD medium as well as transport
coefficients which are important ingredients for hydrodynamic and transport models that describe
the evolution of the produced medium. These include electromagnetic probes, like the rates of emitted
photons and dileptons, quarkonium spectral functions as well as transport coefficients like the
electrical conductivity or heavy flavor diffusion coefficients of the quark gluon plasma (QGP).
All these real time quantities are encoded in the vector meson spectral function. A direct determination
of the spectral functions is not possible in Euclidean lattice QCD calculations but they can be analytically
continued from imaginary to real time. Therefore it is possible to relate the spectral function
to the corresponding Euclidean correlation functions. In the following sections we will discuss
the procedure to determine the required correlation functions and the extraction of the spectral
functions from lattice QCD correlators. We will illustrate the concepts and methods to obtain spectral
functions and related physical observables from continuum extrapolated correlation functions.
We will focus here on results obtained from continuum extrapolated lattice correlation functions,
which requires large and fine lattices, which so far was only possible in quenched approximation.
We will only give a brief introduction to lattice QCD and refer to the textbooks [1,2,3,4] and lecture
notes [5] for more detailed introductions to lattice field theory. For the topics addressed in this
lecture note we also like to refer to the overview articles on QCD thermodynamics and the QCD phase
transition [5,6,7] and quarkonium in extreme conditions [8].

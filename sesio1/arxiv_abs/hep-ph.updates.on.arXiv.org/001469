Energetic quarks liberated from hadrons in nuclear deep-inelastic scattering propagate through
the nuclear medium, interacting with it via several processes. These include quark energy loss
and nuclear interactions of forming hadrons. One manifestation of these interactions is the enhanced
emission of low-energy charged particles, referred to as grey tracks. We use the theoretical components
of the BeAGLE event generator to interpret grey track signatures of parton transport and hadron
formation by comparing its predictions to E665 data. We extend the base version of BeAGLE by adding
four different options for describing parton energy loss. The E665 data we used consists of multiplicity
ratios for fixed-target scattering of 490 GeV muons on Xe normalized to deuterium as a function of
the number of grey tracks. We compare multiplicity ratios for E665 grey tracks to the predictions
of BeAGLE, varying the options and parameters to determine which physics phenomena can be identified
by these data. We find that grey tracks are unaffected by modifications of the forward production.
Thus their production must be dominated by interactions with hadrons in the backward region. This
offers the advantage that selecting certain particles in the forward region is unlikely to bias
a centrality selection. We see a strong correlation between the number of grey tracks and the in-medium
path length. Our energy loss model does not reproduce the suppression observed in the projectile
region. We see an underprediction of the proton production rate in backward kinematics, suggesting
that a stronger source of interaction with the nuclear medium is needed for accurate modeling. These
results lay an important foundation for future spectator tagging studies at both Jefferson Lab
and at the Electron-Ion Collider, where neutron and proton grey track studies will be feasible down
to very small momenta.

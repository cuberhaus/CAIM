The molecular assignments to the three $P_c$ states and the similar production mechanism between
the $\Lambda_b\to P_c+K$ and $B\to XYZ+K$ convince us the $B$ decaying to a charmonium state plus
light mesons could be the appropriate production process to search for the charmoniumlike molecular
tetraquarks. In this work, we systematically study the interactions between a charmed (charmed-strange)
meson and an anti-charmed (anti-charm-strange) meson, which include the $D^{(*)}\bar{D}^{(*)}$,
$\bar{D}^{(*)}\bar{D}_1$, $D^{(*)}\bar{D}_2^*$, $D_s^{(*)}\bar{D}_s^{(*)}$, ${D}_s^{(*)}\bar{D}_{s0}^*$,
$D_s^{(*)}\bar{D}_{s1}^{\prime}$, ${D}_s^{(*)}\bar{D}_{s1}$, $D_s^{(*)}\bar{D}_{s2}^*$
systems. After adopting the one-boson-exchange effective potentials, our numerical results
indicate that, on one hand, there can exist a serial of isoscalar charmoniumlike $\mathcal{D}\bar{\mathcal{D}}$
and $\mathcal{D}_s\bar{\mathcal{D}}_s$ molecular states, on the other hand, we can fully exclude
the charged charmoniumlike states as the isovector charmoniumlike molecules. Meanwhile, we discuss
the two-body hidden-charm decay channels for the obtained $\mathcal{D}\bar{\mathcal{D}}$ and
$\mathcal{D}_s\bar{\mathcal{D}}_s$ molecules, especially the $D^{*}\bar{D}^{*}$ molecular
tetraquarks. By analyzing the experimental data collected from the $B\to XYZ+K$ and the mass spectrum
and two-body hidden-charm decay channels for the obtained $\mathcal{D}\bar{\mathcal{D}}$ and
$\mathcal{D}_s\bar{\mathcal{D}}_s$ molecules, we find several possible hints of the existence
of the charmoniumlike molecular tetraquarks, i.e., a peculiar characteristic mass spectrum of
the isoscalar $D^*\bar{D}^*$ molecular systems can be applied to identify the charmoniumlike
molecule. We look forward to the future experiments like the LHCb, Belle II, and BESIII Collaborations
can test our results with more precise experimental data.

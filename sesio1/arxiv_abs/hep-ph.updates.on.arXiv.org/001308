When combining the recent measurement $(g-2)_\mu$ of muon from Fermilab and the previous result
from BNL, the deviation from the standard model (SM) prediction increased to 4.2$\sigma$ level.
This anomaly is a strong hint of new physics which generates extensive theoretical studies of new
physics beyond the SM. There are also recent new data enforcing anomalies in the measurement of $R_{K}$
from $B \to K \bar \mu \mu$ and increasing the confidence level to 3.1$\sigma$ for $b\to s \bar \mu
\mu$ induced $B$ anomalies. These anomalies indicate that there may be new interaction specifically
related to muon and all these anomalies are related. Gauged flavor specific $U(1)_{B_q-L_\mu}$
to explain the $(g-2)_\mu$ or the $B$ anomalies have been proposed in the literature. The new gauge
boson $Z'$ interaction with muon provides ingredient to solve the $(g-2)_\mu$ anomaly. The original
$Z'$ interaction with a specific quark generation in the weak basis can develop mixing between different
generations in mass eigen-state basis providing ingredients for solving the $B$ anomalies. It
is tempting to see whether such models can explain both anomalies simultaneously. We revisit challenges
for such models attempting to explain the $(g-2)_\mu$ and $B$ anomalies separately or simultaneously.
We find although for $U(1)_{B_q-L_\mu}$ models there is still parameter space to provide solutions
for separately explaining the $(g-2)_\mu$ and $B$ anomalies, there is no parameter space for such
models to solve both the anomalies simultaneously, after taking into account existing constraints
from radiative $\tau$ decays, $\tau \to 3 \mu$, neutrino trident and $B_s - \bar B_s$ data. The effects
of $U(1)_Y$ and $U(1)_{B_q-L_\mu}$ kinetic mixing on these anomalies are also studied. We find
that these effects cannot do much to bring the two anomalies together to be solved simultaneously.

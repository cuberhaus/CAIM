The study of pion production and the effects of final state interactions (FSI) are important for
data analysis in all neutrino experiments. For energies at which current neutrino experiments
are being operated, a significant contribution to pion production is made by resonance production
process. After its production, if a pion is absorbed in the nuclear matter, the event may become indistinguishable
from quasi-elastic scattering process and acts as a background. The estimation of this background
is very essential for oscillation experiments and requires good theoretical models for both pion
production at primary vertex and after FSI. Due to FSI, the number of final state pions is significantly
different from the number produced at primary vertex. As the neutrino detectors can observe only
the final state particles, the correct information about the particles produced at the primary
vertex is overshadowed by FSI. To overcome this difficulty, a good knowledge of FSI is required which
may be provided by theoretical models incorporated in Monte Carlo (MC) neutrino event generators.
In this work, we will present simulated events for two different MC generators - GENIE and NuWro,
for pion production in $\nu_{\mu}$CC interactions on $^{40}$Ar target in DUNE experimental set
up. A brief outline of theoretical models used by generators is presented. The results of pion production
are presented in the form of tables showing the occupancy of primary and final state pion topologies
with 100$\%$ detector resolution and with kinetic energy detector threshold cuts. We observe that
NuWro (v-19.02.2) is more transparent (less responsive) to absorption and charge exchange processes
as compared to GENIE (v-3.00.06), pions are more likely to be absorbed than created during their
intranuclear transport and there is need to improve detector technology to improve the detector
threshold for better results.

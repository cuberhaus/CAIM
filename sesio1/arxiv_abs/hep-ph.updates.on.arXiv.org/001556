We perform numerical analysis of double-pinched Borel-Laplace QCD sum rules for the strangeless
semihadronic $\tau$-decay data of ALEPH Collaboration in the (V+A)-channel. The $D=0$ contribution
to the theoretical contour integral in the sum rules is evaluated by two related (truncated) Fixed
Order perturbation theory methods (FO and ${\widetilde {\rm FO}}$), and by Principal Value (PV)
of the Borel integration. We use for the full Adler function the Operator Product Expansion (OPE)
with the terms of dimension $D=0, 4, 6$. The $D=6$ OPE contribution in this work, with two terms, is
improved in comparison with our previous works [1, 2], in the sense that it involves the recently
known noninteger values $\gamma^{(1)}(O_6^{(j)})/\beta_0$ of the effective leading-order
anomalous dimensions. The higher order terms of the $D=0$ part of the Adler function are generated
in a renormalon-motivated approach, in such a way that the resulting renormalon ambiguities originating
from the infrared renormalons at $u=2, 3$ can be cancelled by the corresponding $D=4, 6$ OPE contributions
of the Adler function. The Borel-Laplace sum rules are then used to extract, at each truncation index
$N_t$ in the considered methods (FO, ${\widetilde {\rm FO}}$, PV), the values of the coupling $\alpha_s$
and of the condensates $\langle O_4 \rangle$, $\langle O_6^{(1)} \rangle$ and $\langle O_6^{(2)}
\rangle$. The optimal values of the index $N_t$, in each method, is then determined by requiring
the local insensitivity of the resulting double-pinched momenta $a^{(2,0)}$ and $a^{(2,1)}$.
Averaging over the three methods, the extracted value of the ${\bar {\rm MS}}$ coupling is $\alpha_s(m_{\tau}^2)
= 0.3179^{+0.0051}_{-0.0087}$, corresponding to $\alpha_s(M_Z^2)=0.1184^{+0.0007}_{-0.0011}$.

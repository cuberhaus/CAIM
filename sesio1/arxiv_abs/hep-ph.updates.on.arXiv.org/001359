We study the allowed primordial black hole (PBH) dark matter abundance in the mixed dark matter scenarios
consisting of PBHs and self-annihilating weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) with a
velocity dependent annihilation cross section. We first briefly illustrate how the WIMP dark matter
halo profile changes for the velocity suppressed p-wave annihilation scenarios, compared with
the familiar s-wave annihilation scenarios, and then discuss the PBH mass dependent upper bound
on the allowed PBH dark matter abundance. The WIMPs can accrete onto a PBH to form an ultracompact
minihalo with a spiky density profile. Such a spike is moderated in the central region of a halo because
the WIMPs are annihilated away and this moderation is less effective for a smaller annihilation
cross section. The WIMP core density becomes larger while the core radius becomes smaller for a velocity
suppressed p-wave annihilation cross section than those for the s-wave annihilation scenarios.
The annihilation cross section is dependent on the velocity which varies across the halo, and, in
addition to the change of the WIMP density profile, another interesting feature is the PBH mass dependent
bound on PBH dark matter abundance. This is in stark contrast to the s-wave annihilation scenarios
where the PBH abundance bound is independent of the PBH mass. The allowed PBH dark matter fraction
(with respect to the total dark matter abundance) is of order $f_{PBH}\lesssim {\cal O}(10^{-7})(M_{\odot}/M_{PBH})^{(-6+2\gamma_{sp})/(3\gamma_{sp}+3)}$
for the thermal relic p-wave dark matter with the mass $100$ GeV where $\gamma_{sp}$ is the slope
index of the spike profile, to be compared with $f_{PBH}\lesssim {\cal O}(10^{-9})$ for the corresponding
thermal relic s-wave dark matter scenarios.

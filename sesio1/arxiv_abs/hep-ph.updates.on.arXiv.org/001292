Weak $B^-\rightarrow D^0, \pi^0$ and $D^-\rightarrow {K}^0, \pi^0$ transition form factors are
described in both the space- and time-like momentum transfer regions, within a constituent-quark
model. Neutrino-meson scattering and semileptonic weak decays are formulated within the point
form of relativistic quantum mechanics to end up with relativistic invariant process amplitudes
from which meson transition currents and form factors are extracted in an unambiguous way. For space-like
momentum transfers, form factors depend on the frame in which the $W M M^\prime$ vertex is considered.
Such a frame dependence is expected from a pure valence-quark picture, since a complete, frame independent
description of form factors is supposed to include non-valence contributions. The most important
of such contributions are the $Z$-graphs, which are, however, suppressed in the infinite-momentum
frame ($q^2<0$). On the other hand, they can play a significant role in the Breit frame ($q^2<0$)
and in the direct decay calculation ($q^2>0$), as a comparison with the infinite-momentum-frame
form factors (analytically continued to $q^2>0$) reveals. Numerical results for the analytically
continued infinite-momentum-frame form factors agree very well with lattice data in the time-like
momentum transfer region and the experimental value for the slope of the $F^+_{B\rightarrow D}$
transition form factor at zero recoil is reproduced satisfactorily. These predictions satisfy
heavy-quark-symmetry constraints and their $q^2$ dependence is well approximated by a pole fit,
reminiscent of a vector-meson-dominance-like decay mechanism. We discuss how such a decay mechanism
can be accommodated within an extension of our constituent-quark model, by allowing for a non-valence
component in the meson wave functions. We also address the question of wrong cluster properties
inherent in the Bakamjian-Thomas formulation.

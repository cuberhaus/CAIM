As experimental searches for WIMP dark matter continue to yield null results, models beyond the
WIMP paradigm have proliferated in order to elude ever improving observational constraints, among
them that of sub-GeV dark matter mediated by a massive vector portal (a dark photon) associated with
a new dark $U(1)$ gauge symmetry. It has been previously noted that for a significant range of the
parameter space of this class of models, the annihilation of dark matter particles into a pair of
dark photons can dominate the freeze-out process even when this process is kinematically forbidden
for dark matter at rest -- this is known as the "forbidden dark matter" (FDM) regime. Prior studies
of this regime, however, assume that any "dark Higgs" associated with breaking the dark $U(1)$ and
imparting mass to the dark photon is decoupled from the dark matter and as such plays no role in the
freeze-out process. In this paper, we explore the effects of a dark Higgs on sub-GeV dark matter phenomenology
in this FDM regime by considering the simplest possible construction in which there exist non-trivial
dark matter-dark Higgs couplings: a model with a single complex scalar DM candidate coupled directly
to the dark Higgs field. We find that for a wide range of parameter space, the dark Higgs can alter the
resulting relic abundance by many orders of magnitude, and that this effect can remain significant
even for a small dark matter-dark Higgs coupling constant. Considering measurements from direct
detection and measurements of the CMB, we further find that points in this model's parameter space
which recreate the appropriate dark matter relic abundance suffer only mild constraints from other
sources at present, but may become accessible in near-future direct detection experiments.

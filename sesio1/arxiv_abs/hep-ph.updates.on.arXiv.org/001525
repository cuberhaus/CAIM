In the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), operators involving the top quark are generally
difficult to probe, and can generate sizable loop contributions to the electroweak precision observables,
measured by past and future lepton colliders. Could the high precision of the electroweak measurements
compensate the loop suppression and provide competitive reaches on these operators? Would the
inclusion of these contributions introduce too many additional parameters for a meaningful global
electroweak analysis to be done? In this paper, we perform a detailed phenomenological study to
address these two important questions. Focusing on eight dimension-6 operators that generate
anomalous couplings between the electroweak gauge bosons and the third-generation quarks, we
calculate their one loop contributions to the $e^+e^- \to f\bar{f}$ processes both on and off the
Z-pole and the $e^-e^+ \to WW$ process. A global analysis is performed with these eight operators
and the ones that contribute to the above processes at tree level, using the measurements at LEP,
SLC and several low energy experiments. We find that, while the current electroweak precision measurements
are sensitive to the one-loop effects of the top-quark operators, it is difficult to separate them
from the operators that contribute at the tree level, making a global analysis rather challenging.
Under more assumptions, competitive reaches could be obtained in a global fit. Another important
finding of our study is that the two operators that generate dipole interactions of the bottom quark
have significant impacts in the Z-pole measurements and should not be omitted. We also discuss the
implication of the recently reported W-boson mass measurement at CDF to our results. Finally, we
estimate the reaches of future lepton colliders in probing the top-quark operators with precision
electroweak measurements.

The increase of strange-particle yields relative to pions versus charged-particle multiplicity
in proton-proton (pp) collisions at the LHC is usually described by microscopic or hydrodynamical
models as a result of the increasing density of produced partons or strings and their interactions.
Instead, we consider the multiple partonic interaction (MPI) picture originally developed in
the context of the PYTHIA event generator. We find that strangeness enhancement in PYTHIA is hidden
by a large excess of low-$p_{\rm T}$ multi-strange baryons, which mainly results from the hadronization
of $u$-quark, $d$-quark and gluon ($udg$) strings. Strange baryons produced in strings formed
from parton showers initiated by strange quarks ($s$-fragmentation), however, describe well
the spectral shapes of $\Xi$ and $\Omega$ baryons and their multiplicity dependence. Since the
total particle yield contains contributions from soft and hard particle production, which cannot
be experimentally separated, we argue that the correct description of the $p_{\rm T}$-spectra
is a minimum requirement for meaningful comparisons of multiplicity dependent yield measurements
to MPI based calculations. We demonstrate that the $s$-fragmentation component describes the
increase of average $p_{\rm T}$ and yields with multiplicity seen in the data, including the approximate
multiplicity scaling for different collision energies. When restricted to processes that reproduce
the measured $p_{\rm T}$-spectra, the MPI framework exhibits a smooth evolution from strictly
proportional multiplicity scaling ($K_{\rm S}^0$, $\Lambda$, where the $udg$-hadronization
component dominates) to linearity ($s$-fragmentation) and on to increasingly non-linear behavior
($c$-, $b$-quark and high-$p_{\rm T}$ jet fragmentation), hence providing a unified approach
for particle production in pp collisions.

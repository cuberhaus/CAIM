Detecting dark matter (DM) relic via freeze-in is difficult in laboratories due to smallness of
the couplings involved. However, a non-standard cosmological history of the Universe, prior to
Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), can dramatically change this scenario. In this context, we study
the freeze-in production of dark matter in classically scale invariant $U(1)_X$ gauge extension
of the Standard Model (SM), recently dubbed as the \textit{Scale Invariant FIMP Miracle}. We assume
an additional species dominates the energy density of the Universe at early times, causing the expansion
rate at a given temperature to be larger than that in the standard radiation-dominated case. We find,
the \textit{out-of-equilibrium} scattering processes involving particles in the thermal bath
lead to significantly suppressed DM production in this era, thereby enhancing the couplings between
the visible and the dark sector (by several orders of magnitude) to satisfy the observed DM abundance,
and improving the detection prospects for freeze-in in turn. Scale invariance of the underlying
theory leaves only four free parameters in the model: the DM mass $m_X$, the gauge coupling $g_X$,
the temperature of transition $T_R$ from early scalar-dominated to radiation-dominated era and
the power-law dependence $n$ of this temperature. We show, within this minimal set-up, experiments
like FASER, MATHUSLA, DUNE, SHiP will be probing various cosmological models depending on the choice
of $\{n,\,T_R\}$ that also satisfy the PLANCK observed relic density bound. Moreover, due to the
presence of a naturally light scalar mediator, the direct detection of the DM at XENON1T, PandaX-4T
or XENONnT becomes relevant for Higgs-scalar mixing $\sin\theta\simeq\{10^{-5}-10^{-3}\}$,
thus providing complementary probes for freeze-in, as well as for non-standard cosmological pre-BBN
era.

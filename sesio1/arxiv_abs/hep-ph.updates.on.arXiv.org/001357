Gluino-SUGRA ($\tilde{g}$SUGRA), which is an economical extension of the predictive mSUGRA,
adopts much heavier gluino mass parameter than other gauginos mass parameters and universal scalar
mass parameter at the unification scale. It can elegantly reconcile the experimental results on
the Higgs boson mass, the muon $g-2$, the null results in search for supersymmetry at the LHC and the
results from B-physics. In this work, we propose several new ways to generate large gaugino hierarchy
(i.e. $M_3\gg M_1,M_2$) for $\tilde{g}$SUGRA model building and then discuss in detail the implications
of the new muon $g-2$ results with the updated LHC constraints on such $\tilde{g}$SUGRA scenarios.
We obtain the following observations: (i) For the most interesting $M_1=M_2$ case at the GUT scale
with a viable bino-like dark matter, the $\tilde{g}$SUGRA can explain the muon $g-2$ anomaly at
$1\sigma$ level and be consistent with the updated LHC constraints for $6\leq M_3/M_1 \leq 9$ at
the GUT scale; (ii) For $M_1:M_2=5:1$ at the GUT scale with wino-like dark matter, the $\tilde{g}$SUGRA
model can explain the muon $g-2$ anomaly at $2\sigma$ level and be consistent with the updated LHC
constraints for $3\leq M_3/M_1 \leq 3.2$ at the GUT scale; (iii) For $M_1:M_2=3:2$ at the GUT scale
with mixed bino-wino dark matter, the $\tilde{g}$SUGRA model can explain the muon $g-2$ anomaly
at $1\sigma$ level and be consistent with the updated LHC constraints for $6.9\leq M_3/M_1 \leq
7.5$ at the GUT scale. Although the choice of heavy gluino will always increase the FT involved, some
of the $1\sigma/2\sigma$ survived points of $\Delta a_\mu^{combine}$ can still allow low EWFT
of order several hundreds and be fairly natural. Constraints from (dimension-five operator induced)
proton decay are also discussed.

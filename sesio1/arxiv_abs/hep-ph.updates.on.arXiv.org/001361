Hopping parameter expansion is a useful tool to investigate heavy dynamical quarks in lattice QCD,
while the range of its applicability has been sometimes questioned. We study the convergence and
the valid range of the hopping parameter expansion in the determination of the critical point (critical
quark mass) of QCD with heavy quarks at finite temperature and density. On lattices with sufficiently
large spatial extent, the terms in the hopping parameter expansion are classified into Wilson loop
terms and Polyakov-type loop terms. We first study the case of the worst convergence in which all
the gauge link variables are unit matrices and thus the Wilson loops and the Polyakov-type loops
get their maximum values. We perform explicit calculation up to more than 100th order of the hopping
parameter expansion. We show that the hopping parameter expansion is convergent up to the chiral
limit of free Wilson quarks. We then perform a Monte-Carlo simulation to measure correlation among
Polyakov-type loop terms up to the 20th order of the hopping parameter expansion. In previous studies,
strong correlation between the leading order Polyakov loop term and the next-to-leading order
bent Polyakov loop terms was reported and used to construct an effective theory to incorporate the
next-to-leading order effect by a shift of the leading order coupling parameter. We establish that
the strong correlation among Polyakov-type loop terms holds also at higher orders of the hopping
parameter expansion, and extend the effective theory to incorporate higher-order effects up to
high orders. Using the effective theory, we study the truncation error of the hopping parameter
expansion. We find that the previous next-to-leading order result of the critical point for $N_t=4$
are well reliable. For $N_t \ge 6$, we need to incorporate higher-order effects in the effective
theory.

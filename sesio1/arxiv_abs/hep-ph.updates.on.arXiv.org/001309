We reemphasize the strong dependence of the branching ratios $B(K^+\to\pi^+\nu\bar\nu)$ and
$B(K_L\to\pi^0\nu\bar\nu)$ on $|V_{cb}|$ that is stronger than in rare $B$ decays, in particular
for $K_L\to\pi^0\nu\bar\nu$. Thereby the persistent tension between inclusive and exclusive
determinations of $|V_{cb}|$ weakens the power of these theoretically clean decays in the search
for new physics (NP). We demonstrate how this uncertainty can be practically removed by considering
within the SM suitable ratios of the two branching ratios between each other and with other observables
like the branching ratios for $K_S\to\mu^+\mu^-$, $B_{s,d}\to\mu^+\mu^-$ and $B\to K(K^*)\nu\bar\nu$.
We use as basic CKM parameters $V_{us}$, $|V_{cb}|$ and the angles $\beta$ and $\gamma$ in the unitarity
triangle (UT). This avoids the use of the problematic $|V_{ub}|$. A ratio involving $B(K^+\to\pi^+\nu\bar\nu)$
and $B(B_s\to\mu^+\mu^-)$ while being $|V_{cb}|$-independent exhibits sizable dependence
on the angle $\gamma$. It should be of interest for several experimental groups in the coming years.
We point out that the $|V_{cb}|$-independent ratio of $B(B^+\to K^+\nu\bar\nu)$ and $B(B_s\to\mu^+\mu^-)$
from Belle II and LHCb signals a $1.8\sigma$ tension with its SM value. As a complementary test of
the Standard Model, we propose to extract $|V_{cb}|$ from different observables as a function of
$\beta$ and $\gamma$. We illustrate this with $\epsilon_K$, $\Delta M_d$ and $\Delta M_s$ finding
tensions between these three determinations of $|V_{cb}|$ within the SM. From $\Delta M_s$ and
$S_{\psi K_S}$ alone we find $|V_{cb}|=41.8(6)\times 10^{-3}$ and $|V_{ub}|=3.65(12)\times
10^{-3}$. We stress the importance of a precise measurement of $\gamma$. We obtain most precise
SM predictions for considered branching ratios of rare K and B decays to date.

We first review the decade-old, broad collider physics research program dubbed energy-peaks.
We consider the energy distribution of a massless particle in the lab frame arising from the two-body
decay of a heavy particle produced unpolarized, whose boost distribution is arbitrary. Remarkably,
the location of the peak of this child particle's energy distribution is identical to its single-valued
energy in the rest frame of the parent, which is a function of the parent's mass and that of the other
decay product. We summarize generalizations to other types of decay and a variety of applications
to BSM. The energy-peak idea can also furnish a measurement of the top quark via the energy of the bottom
quark from its decay, which, based on the "parent-boost-invariance," is less sensitive to details
of the production mechanism of the top quark (cf.~most other methods assume purely SM production
of the top quarks, hence are subject to uncertainties therein, including a possible BSM contribution).
The original proposal along this line was to simply use the $b$-jet energy as a very good approximation
to the bottom quark energy. This method has been successfully implemented by the CMS collaboration.
However, the $b$-jet energy-peak method is afflicted by the jet-energy scale (JES) uncertainty.
Fortunately, this drawback can be circumvented by using the decay length of a $B$-hadron contained
in the $b$-jet as a proxy for the bottom quark energy. An interesting proposal is to then appropriately
dovetail the above two ideas resulting in a "best of both worlds" determination of the top quark mass,
i.e., based on a measurement of the $B$-hadron decay length, but improved by the energy-peak concept:
this would be free of JES uncertainty and largely independent of the top quark production model.
We summarize here the results of such an analysis which is to appear in a forthcoming paper.

Nuclei with an octupole deformation have a non-zero electric octupole moment, electric dipole
moment (EDM), Schiff moment and magnetic quadrupole moment (MQM) in the intrinsic frame which rotates
with the nucleus. In a state with definite angular momentum in the laboratory frame, these moments
are forbidden by parity (P) and time reversal invariance (T) conservation, meaning their expectation
values vanish due to nuclear rotation. However, nuclei with an octupole deformation have doublets
of close opposite parity rotational states with the same spin, which are mixed by T,P-odd nuclear
forces. This mixing produces the orientation of the nuclear axis along nuclear spin and all moments
existing in the intrinsic frame appear in the laboratory frame (provided the nuclear spin I is sufficiently
large to allow such moment). Such a mechanism produces enhanced T,P-violating nuclear moments.
This enhancement also takes place in nuclei with a soft octupole vibration mode. Schiff moments
in such nuclei have been calculated in previous works. In the present paper we consider the magnetic
quadrupole moment which appears in isotopes with nuclear spin $I \geq 1$. Magnetic interaction
between the nuclear MQM and electrons produces an atomic EDM and T,P-violating nuclear spin - molecular
axis interaction constants for molecules in electronic states with non-zero electron angular
momentum. Measurements of these constants may be used to test CP-violation theories and search
for axion dark matter in atomic, molecular and solid state experiments. Potential candidate nuclei
include 153Eu, 161Dy, 221Fr, 223Fr, 223Ra, 223Rn, 225Ac, 227Ac, 229Th, 229Pa, 233U and 235U. We
subsequently consider molecules containing these nuclei (EuO, EuN+, RaF, AcO, AcN+, AcF+, ThO
and ThF+).

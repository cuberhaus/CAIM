Experimental observations and theoretical arguments point out that Dark Matter (DM) particles
are one of the most prominent component of the Universe. This motivated the pioneer DAMA experiment
to investigate the presence of these particles in the galactic halo, by exploiting the model independent
signature of the DM annual modulation of the rate and very highly radio-pure apparatus in underground
site. In this paper the results obtained by other two annual cycles of DAMA/LIBRA-phase2 are presented
and the long-standing model-independent annual modulation effect measured by DAMA deep underground
at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory (LNGS) of the I.N.F.N. with different experimental configurations
is summarized. The improved experimental configuration of DAMA/LIBRA-phase2, $\simeq$ 250 kg
highly radio-pure NaI(Tl), allowed to lower the software energy threshold. The total exposure
of DAMA/LIBRA-phase2 over 8 annual cycles is 1.53 ton $\times$ yr. DAMA/LIBRA-phase2 confirms
the evidence of a signal that meets all the requirements of the model independent Dark Matter annual
modulation signature, at 11.8 $\sigma$ C.L. in the energy region (1-6) keV. In the energy region
between 2 and 6 keV, where data are also available from DAMA/NaI and DAMA/LIBRA-phase1 (2.86 ton
$\times$ yr), the achieved C.L. is 13.7 $\sigma$; the modulation amplitude of the single-hit scintillation
events is: $(0.01014 \pm 0.00074)$ cpd/kg/keV, the measured phase is $(142.4 \pm 4.2)$ days and
the measured period is $(0.99834 \pm 0.00067)$ yr, all these values are well in agreement with those
expected for DM particles. No systematics or side reaction able to mimic the exploited DM signature
(i.e. to account for the whole measured modulation amplitude and to simultaneously satisfy all
the requirements of the signature), has been found or suggested by anyone throughout some decades
thus far.

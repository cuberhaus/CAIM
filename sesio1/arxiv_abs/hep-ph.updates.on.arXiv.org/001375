Recently Belle-II collaboration reported new measurements for the branching ratios with the first
observing two processes of $\mathcal{B}(\Xi_c^0\to\Lambda^0 K^0_S)$, $\mathcal{B}(\Xi_c^0\to\Sigma^0
K^0_S)$ and update data for $\mathcal{B}(\Xi_c^0\to\Sigma^+ K^-)$. Combined with other known
data on charmless two body decays of anti-triplet charmed baryons, a lot of information can be derived
with the assistance of $SU(3)$ flavour symmetry. Using $SU(3)$ relations between different decay
modes, the new Belle-II data would predict $\mathcal{B}(\Xi_{c}^{0}\to p \pi^{-})=(5.817\pm1.79)\%$,
$\mathcal{B}(\Xi_{c}^{0}\to p K^{-})=\mathcal{B}(\Xi_{c}^{0}\to \Sigma^{+} \pi^{-})=(1.113\pm0.349)\times
10^{-4}$ which can be tested in the future. Earlier data show that the relation between $\Xi^0_c
\to \Xi^- \pi^+$ and $\Xi^0_c \to \Xi^- K^+$ decays is violated at a larger than 1$\sigma$ level which
casts doubt on the validity of $SU(3)$ symmetry. This needs more careful studies. To this end, we
find that a global fit is now possible with the addition of new Bell-II data if the $SU(3)$ irreducible
amplitudes are all real. We find that our global fit gives a reasonable $\chi^2/d.o.f=0.744$ which
indicates data fit $SU(3)$ predictions well. The deviation for the relation between $\Xi^0_c \to
\Xi^- \pi^+$ and $\Xi^0_c \to \Xi^- K^+$ is reduced to within 1$\sigma$ level. We give several comments
on the feature of global fit regarding the branching ratios, relations between different decays
and decays involve $K^0$ and $\bar K^0$. Many of the unknown branching ratios and polarization asymmetry
parameters of anti-triplet charmed baryon for charmless two body decays are predicted to be accessible
by experiments at Belle-II, BES-III, and LHCb. The validity of $SU(3)$ for charmless two body hadronic
decays can be more accurately tested.

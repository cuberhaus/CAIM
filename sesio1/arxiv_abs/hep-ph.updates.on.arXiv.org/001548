This conceptual design report provides a detailed account of the European Spallation Source neutrino
Super Beam (ESS$\nu$SB) feasibility study. This facility has been proposed after the measurements
reported in 2012 of a relatively large value of the neutrino mixing angle $\theta_{13}$, which raised
the possibility of observing potential CP violation in the leptonic sector with conventional neutrino
beams. The measured value of $\theta_{13}$ also privileges the $2^{nd}$ oscillation maximum for
the discovery of CP violation instead of the more typically studied $1^{st}$ maximum. The sensitivity
at this $2^{nd}$ oscillation maximum is about three times higher than at the $1^{st}$ one, which
implies a reduced influence of systematic errors. Working at the $2^{nd}$ oscillation maximum
requires a very intense neutrino beam with an appropriate energy. The world's most intense pulsed
spallation neutron source, the European Spallation Source (ESS), will have a proton linac operating
at 5\,MW power, 2\,GeV kinetic energy and 14~Hz repetition rate (3~ms pulse duration, 4\% duty cycle)
for neutron production. In this design study it is proposed to double the repetition rate and compress
the beam pulses to the level of microseconds in order to provide an additional 5~MW proton beam for
neutrino production. The physics performance has been evaluated for such a neutrino super beam,
in conjunction with a megaton-scale underground water Cherenkov neutrino detector installed
at a distance of 360--550\,km from ESS. The ESS proton linac upgrades, the accumulator ring required
for proton-pulse compression, the target station design and optimisation, the near and far detector
complexes, and the physics potential of the facility are all described in this report. The ESS linac
will be operational by 2025, at which point the implementation of upgrades for the neutrino facility
could begin.

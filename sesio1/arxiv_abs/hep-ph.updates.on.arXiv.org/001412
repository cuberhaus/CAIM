In typical statistical mechanical systems the grand canonical partition function at finite volume
is proportional to a polynomial of the fugacity $e^{\mu/T}$. The zero of this Lee-Yang polynomial
closest to the origin determines the radius of convergence of the Taylor expansion of the pressure
around $\mu=0$. The computationally cheapest formulation of lattice QCD, rooted staggered fermions,
with the usual definition of the rooted determinant, does not admit such a Lee-Yang polynomial.
We argue that the radius of convergence is then bounded by the spectral gap of the reduced matrix of
the unrooted staggered operator. This is a cutoff effect that potentially affects all estimates
of the radius of convergence with the standard staggered rooting. We suggest a new definition of
the rooted staggered determinant at finite chemical potential that allows for a definition of a
Lee-Yang polynomial, and, therefore of the numerical study of Lee-Yang zeros. We also describe
an algorithm to determine the Lee-Yang zeros and apply it to configurations generated with the 2-stout
improved staggered action at $N_t = 4$. We perform a finite-volume scaling study of the leading Lee-Yang
zeros and estimate the radius of convergence of the Taylor expansion extrapolated to an infinite
volume. We show that the limiting singularity is not on the real line, thus giving a lower bound on
the location of any possible phase transitions at this lattice spacing. In the vicinity of the crossover
temperature at zero chemical potential, the radius of convergence turns out to be $\mu_B/T \approx
2$ and roughly temperature independent. Our simulations are performed at strange quark chemical
potential $\mu_s=0$, but the method can be straightforwardly extended to strangeness chemical
potential $\mu_S=0$ or strangeness neutrality.

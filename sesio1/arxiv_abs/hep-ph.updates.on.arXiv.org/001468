Non-Abelian structure of the Standard Model predicts the self-interactions of gauge bosons triple
gauge couplings (TGC) and quartic gauge couplings (QGC). On the other hand, it is also important
to determine the deviations from Standard Model (SM) via anomalous triple gauge couplings (aTGC)
and anomalous quartic gauge couplings (aQGC) to test the nature of the Standard Model (SM) and to
see the effects of new physics arising from the beyond standard model (BSM). In this study, we focus
on the $e^-p \to j Z\gamma \nu_e \to j (l^{+} l^{-})\gamma \nu_e$ process to examine the $WWZ\gamma$
anomalous quartic gauge couplings (aQGC) at the Future Circular Collider-hadron electron (FCC-he)
with center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=5.29$ TeV using with a model-independent way in the effective
theory approach. A Cut-based method are applied to analyse the signal and relevant SM background.
Using with the total cross-sections, we constrained on the anomalous $ f_ {T,i=0,1,2,5,6,7}/\Lambda^4$
couplings arising from dimension-8 operators at $95\%$ Confidence Level (C.L.) for the dilepton
decay of the $Z$-boson. The results are composed with integrated luminosities of ${\cal L}=1,2$
and $3$ $\rm ab^{-1}$ under the systematic uncertainties of $\%0$, $\%5$ and $\%10$. In the calculations,
we use the form factor to eleminate the effects of the violation of unitarity. With this, we obtained
the limits for the energy scale of the form factor $\Lambda_{FF}=1$ TeV together with $\Lambda_{FF}=\infty$.
In addition to all this, we use the adventages of $ep$ collisions for analysing the process with much
cleaner environment and lower background effects comparing with the $pp$ collisions. The obtained
sensitivities on $ f_ {T,i=0,1,2,5,6,7}/\Lambda^4$ are comparable with the experimental results
and related phenomenological studies in the literature.

We proceed to study the $CP$ asymmetry in the angular distributions of $\tau\to K_S\pi\nu_\tau$
decays within a general effective field theory framework including four-fermion operators up
to dimension-six. It is found that, besides the commonly considered scalar-vector interference,
the tensor-scalar interference can also produce a non-zero $CP$ asymmetry in the angular distributions.
Bounds on the effective couplings of the non-standard scalar and tensor interactions are obtained
under the combined constraints from the measured $CP$ asymmetries and the branching ratio of $\tau^-\to
K_S\pi^-\nu_\tau$ decay, with $\mathrm{Im}[\hat{\epsilon}_S]=-0.008\pm0.027$ and $\mathrm{Im}[\hat{\epsilon}_T]=0.03\pm0.12$,
at the scale $\mu_\tau=2~\mathrm{GeV}$ in the $\mathrm{\overline{MS}}$ scheme. Using the best-fit
values, we also find that the distributions of the $CP$ asymmetries can deviate significantly from
the SM expectation in almost the whole $K\pi$ invariant-mass region. Nevertheless, the current
bounds are still plagued by large experimental uncertainties, but will be improved with more precise
measurements from Belle II as well as the proposed Tera-Z and STCF facilities. Assuming further
that the non-standard scalar and tensor interactions originate from a weakly-coupled heavy new
physics well above the electroweak scale, the $SU(2)_L$ invariance of the resulting SMEFT Lagrangian
would indicate that very strong limits on $\mathrm{Im}[\hat{\epsilon}_S]$ and $\mathrm{Im}[\hat{\epsilon}_T]$
could also be obtained from the neutron electric dipole moment and the $D^0-\bar{D}^0$ mixing.
With the bounds from these processes taken into account, it is then found that, unless there exist
extraordinary cancellations between the new physics contributions, neither the scalar nor the
tensor interaction can produce any significant effects on the $CP$ asymmetries in the processes
considered.

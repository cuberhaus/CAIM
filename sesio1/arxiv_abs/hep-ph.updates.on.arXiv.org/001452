Homestake, Gallex and GNO data reveal variability of the solar neutrino flux. Kamiokande records
for 1996-2001 reveal oscillations at 9.43 and 12.6 yr$^{-1}$, well within a range (6-16 yr$^{-1}$)
that, according to helioseismology, may be related to internal solar rotation. A nuclear-decay
experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory (for 1982-86) reveals strong oscillations at 11.2
and 13.2 yr$^{-1}$. Similar oscillations are found in nuclear-decay measurements conducted by
A. Parkhomov. By contrast, S. Pomme points out that nuclear-decay experiments at standards laboratories
tend not to exhibit variability. The most extensive series of nuclear-decay measurements comes
from an experiment initiated by G. Steinitz at the Geological Survey of Israel (2007-16), which
recorded 340,000 radon-related measurements from each of 3 gamma detectors and 3 environmental
sensors. Analysis of a subset of 85,000 hourly gamma measurements reveals a number of oscillation
frequencies compatible with influences of internal solar rotation. There is no correlation between
the gamma and environmental measurements. The solar internal magnetic field may lead to neutrino
modulation by the RSFP (Resonant Spin-Flavor Precession) mechanism. A triplet of oscillations
(7.43, 8.43 and 9.43 yr$^{-1}$) may be attributed to an internal region (presumably the core) with
a sidereal rotation rate of 8.43 yr$^{-1}$ and a rotation axis roughly orthogonal to that of the photosphere.
This suggests that the Sun had its origin in more than one stage of condensation of interplanetary
material (one on top of another), which could lead to present-day layers with different metallicities,
rotation rates and axes. The peak modulation occurs near local midnight in early June, suggestive
of a role of cosmic neutrinos. These neutrinos could provide the mass attributed to dark matter for
a neutrino mass of order 0.1 eV.

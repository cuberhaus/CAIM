Neutrino experiments have measured some of the oscillation parameters with unprecedented accuracy,
yet parameters such as the lightest neutrino mass, octant of the atmospheric angle, leptonic CP-violating
phases, neutrino mass hierarchy, nature and absolute masses of the neutrinos remain to be fixed
with precision, though some data is available on them also. LBL neutrino experiments have the potential
to measure these, but are inflicted with the problem of octant degeneracy \cite{Fogli:1996pv},\cite{Barger:2001yr},
and in the measurements of experiments like NO$\nu$A, the MH sensitivity depends upon the value
of CP-violating phase $\delta_{CP}$ (also called MH-Octant-CPV entanglement). In this work,
we aim to address all these issues, in an inverse seesaw (ISS) model within the framework of $A_4$
flavour symmetry. We find the unknown parameters up to a tolerance of $ < 10^{-5}$ in numerical computation.
Keeping in view that recent global analysis has shown a preference for normal hierarchy and higher
octant of $\theta_{23}$, we discuss our results in the context of this and find that we can pinpoint
the VEV alignment of $A_4$ triplet flavon to be (1,-1,-1). Finally, we compare our very precise prediction
on $m_{ee}$ and lightest neutrino mass with the latest bounds and sensitivities of the neutrinoless
double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay experiments and our prediction lies within the allowed
region. We emphasize that when MH-Octant-CPV entanglement is resolved by more precise measurements
of future experiments, then through our results, it is possible to precisely pinpoint the favourable
VEV alignment of the triplet flavon field of $A_4$ symmetry (or vice-versa - if VEV alignment is known,
then this entanglement can be resolved). The model being a low-scale seesaw model, is interesting
as it is testable in the ongoing and future neutrino experiments, and is highly predictive too.

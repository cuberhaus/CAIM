We discuss the Bayesian approach to the solution of inverse problems and apply the formalism to analyse
the closure tests performed by the NNPDF collaboration. Starting from a comparison with the approach
that is currently used for the determination of parton distributions (PDFs) by the NNPDF collaboration,
we discuss some analytical results that can be obtained for linear problems and use these results
as a guidance for the more complicated non-linear problems. We show that, in the case of Gaussian
distributions, the posterior probability density of the parametrized PDFs is fully determined
by the results of the NNPDF fitting procedure. In the particular case that we consider, the fitting
procedure and the Bayesian analysis yield exactly the same result. Building on the insight that
we obtain from the analytical results, we introduce new estimators to assess the statistical faithfulness
of the fit results in closure tests. These estimators are defined in data space, and can be studied
analytically using the Bayesian formalism in a linear model in order to clarify their meaning. Finally
we present numerical results from a number of closure tests performed with current NNPDF methodologies.
These further tests allow us to validate the NNPDF4.0 methodology and provide a quantitative comparison
of the NNPDF4.0 and NNPDF3.1 methodologies. As PDFs determinations move into precision territory,
the need for a careful validation of the methodology becomes increasingly important: the error
bar has become the focal point of contemporary PDFs determinations. In this perspective, theoretical
assumptions and other sources of error are best formulated and analysed in the Bayesian framework,
which provides an ideal language to address the precision and the accuracy of current fits.

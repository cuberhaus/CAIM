Flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) processes such as $b \to s\ell\ell$ do not occur at tree-level
in the Standard Model (SM), which makes them sensitive probes of physics beyond the standard model
(BSM). Intriguing BSM hints in $b \to s$ transitions have been observed by multiple flavor physics
experiments, LHCb, Belle, BaBar, and Belle II. We have upgraded the widely used event generator
EvtGen to model $B\to K^* \ell^+ \ell^-$ with improved SM decay amplitudes and amplitudes for possible
BSM physics contributions, implemented in the operator product expansion in terms of Wilson coefficients;
this upgraded event generator can then be used to investigate the experimental sensitivity to the
most general BSM signal resulting from dimension-six operators. We describe the advantages and
potential of the newly developed 'Sibidanov Physics Generator' in improving sensitivity of searches
and clarifying signatures. Advantages include properly simulating BSM scenarios, interference
between SM and BSM amplitudes, and correlations between different BSM observables as well as acceptance
bias. We show that exploiting such correlations substantially improves experimental sensitivity.
As a demonstration of the proposed approach, we review the prospects for improved measurements
with $B \to K^* \ell \ell$ decays from the expected 50 ab$^{-1}$ dataset of the Belle II experiment
with a four-dimensional unbinned maximum likelihood fit. We describe new promising experimental
signatures, and novel ideas such as $\Delta$-observables, which reduce uncertainties in the SM
expectations due to QCD and resonance effects. The $\Delta$-observables appear ideally suited
for Belle II with the large data sets expected in the next decade. Belle II also has excellent sensitivity
to New Physics (NP) in the Wilson coefficients $C_7$ and $C_7'$, which appear at low $q^2$ in the di-electron
channel.

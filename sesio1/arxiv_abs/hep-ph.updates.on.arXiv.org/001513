In this decade one expects a very significant progress in measuring the branching ratios for several
rare $K$ and $B$ decays, in particular for the decays $K^+\to\pi^+\nu\bar\nu$, $K_L\to\pi^0\nu\bar\nu$,
$B_s\to\mu^+\mu^+$ and $B_d\to\mu^+\mu^+$. On the theory side a very significant progress on
calculating these branching ratios has been achieved in the last thirty years culminating recently
in rather precise SM predictions for them. It is then unfortunate that some papers still cite the
results for $K^+\to\pi^+\nu\bar\nu$ and $K_L\to\pi^0\nu\bar\nu$ presented by us in 2015. They
are clearly out of date. Similar comments apply to predictions for $B_{s,d}\to\mu^+\mu^-$. In
this note I want to stress again that, in view of the tensions between various determinations of $V_{cb}$
in tree-level decays, presently, the only trustable SM predictions for the branching ratios in
question can be obtained by eliminating their dependence on the CKM parameters with the help of $|\varepsilon_K|$,
$\Delta M_s$, $\Delta M_d$ and $S_{\psi K_S}$, evaluated in the SM. In this context I am astonished
by statements made by some computer code practitioners that setting in this strategy these four
$\Delta F=2$ observables to their experimental values is an assumption. The goal of this strategy
is not to make an overall SM fit but to predict the SM branching ratios. In the SM there are no new physics
(NP) contributions to $\Delta F=2$ transitions and no assumption on the absence of NP is needed.
Moreover, presently NP is not required to describe simultaneously the very precise data on $|\varepsilon_K|$,
$\Delta M_s$, $\Delta M_d$ and $S_{\psi K_S}$. This strategy for obtaining true SM predictions
for rare decay branching ratios is moreover not polluted by hadronic uncertainies and observed
anomalies in semi-leptonic decays used often in global analyses.

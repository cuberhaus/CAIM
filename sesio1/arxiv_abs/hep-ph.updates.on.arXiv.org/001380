New experiments to measure neutrinos in the far-forward region at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
are under design or already in preparation. Two of them, Faser-$\nu$ and SND@LHC, are expected to
be active during Run 3 and have the potential to detect neutrinos that come from high-energy collisions
in one of the LHC interaction points, extracted along the direction tangent to the beam line. Tau
neutrinos and antineutrinos come predominantly from $D_s^\pm$ production in $pp$ collisions,
followed by the leptonic decay of these mesons. Neutrino pseudorapidities in the range of $\eta>6.9$
and $\eta>8.9$ are relevant to these future experiments. At such large pseudorapidities at high
energies, theoretical predictions rely on parton distribution functions (PDFs) in a combination
of very small and large parton$-x$ values. We evaluate PDF uncertainties in a next-to-leading order
(NLO) QCD calculation of the flux of tau neutrinos plus antineutrinos produced by $D_s^\pm$ decay
in the far forward region at the LHC. The theoretical uncertainty associated with the 40 PDF sets
of the PROSA19 group amount to $\pm (20-30)$\% for the tau neutrino plus antineutrino number of charged-current
events. Scale uncertainties are much larger, resulting into a range of charged-current event predictions
from $\sim 70\%$ lower to $\sim 90\%$ higher than the central prediction. A comparison of the predictions
with those obtained using as input the central PDFs from the 3-flavour NLO PDF sets of the CT14, ABMP16
and NNPDF3.1 collaborations show that far-forward neutrino energy distributions vary by as much
as a factor of $\sim 2-4$ relative to the PROSA19 predictions at TeV neutrino energies. The Forward
Physics Facility in the high luminosity LHC era will provide data capable of constraining NLO QCD
evaluations with these PDF sets.

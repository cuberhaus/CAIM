Belle II is an experiment operating at the intensity frontier. Over the next decades, it will record
the decay of billions of bottom mesons, charm hadrons, and tau leptons produced in 10 GeV electron-positron
collisions at the SuperKEKB high-luminosity collider at KEK. These data, collected in low-background
and kinematically known conditions, will allow us to measure hundreds of parameters that test the
standard model (SM) and probe for the existence of new particles, at mass scales orders of magnitudes
higher than those studied at the energy frontier. We project our sensitivities for measurements
that are of primary relevance and where Belle II will be unique or world leading for data corresponding
to 1 to 50 ab-1. Belle II will uniquely probe non-SM contributions in sensitive b -> qqbar s decays
and charmless b -> qqbar d(u) decays, semileptonic b -> s nu nubar and s tau+ \tau- decays, fully leptonic
b -> ell nu decays, and select c -> u processes. Belle II will lead exploration of non-SM physics in
b -> c tau nu and b -> s gamma decays and will most precisely determine the quark-mixing parameters
|Vub| and |Vcb|. Belle II will measure many parameters in tau physics to precisions that will be world
leading for the foreseeable future, including the electric and magnetic dipole moments, branching
fractions for charged-lepton-flavor-violating decays, and quantities that test lepton-flavor
universality. Belle II will perform unique searches for dark-sector particles with masses in the
MeV--GeV range. We will also pursue a broad spectroscopy program for conventional and multiquark
c cbar and b bbar states and provide essential inputs to sharpen the interpretation of muon magnetic-anomaly
results. Our exploration of uncharted regions of non-SM parameter space with high precision will
reveal non-SM particles or set stringent constraints on their existence, guiding future endeavors.

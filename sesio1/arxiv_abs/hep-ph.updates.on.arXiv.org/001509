We perform the first application of the wavelet scattering transform (WST) on actual galaxy observations,
through a WST analysis of the BOSS DR12 CMASS dataset. We lay out the detailed procedure on how to capture
all necessary layers of realism for an application on data obtained from a spectroscopic survey,
including the effects of redshift-space anisotropy, non-trivial survey geometry, the shortcomings
of the dataset through a set of systematic weights and the Alcock-Paczynski distortion effect.
In order to capture the cosmological dependence of the WST, we use galaxy mocks obtained from the
state-of-the-art ABACUSSUMMIT simulations, tuned to match the anisotropic correlation function
of the BOSS CMASS sample in the redshift range $0.46<z<0.60$. Using our theory model for the WST coefficients,
as well as for the first 2 multipoles of the galaxy power spectrum, that we use as reference, we perform
a likelihood analysis of the CMASS data and obtain the posterior probability distributions of 4
cosmological parameters, $\{\omega_b,\omega_c,n_s,\sigma_8\}$, as well as the Hubble constant,
derived from a fixed value of the angular size of the sound horizon at last scattering measured by
the Planck satellite, all of which are marginalized over the 7 nuisance parameters of the Halo Occupation
Distribution model. The WST is found to deliver a substantial improvement in the values of the predicted
$1\sigma$ errors compared to the regular power spectrum, which are tighter by a factor in the range
$3-6$ in the case of flat and uninformative priors and by a factor of $4-28$, when a Big Bang Nucleosynthesis
prior is applied on the value of $\omega_b$. Furthermore, in the latter case, we obtain a 0.6% measurement
of the Hubble constant. Our results are investigative and subject to certain approximations in
our analysis, that we discuss in the text.

Prior work [arXiv:2106.16248] shows that the Standard Model (SM) naturally arises near a gapless
quantum critical region between Georgi-Glashow (GG) $su(5)$ and Pati-Salam (PS) $su(4) \times
su(2) \times su(2)$ models of quantum vacua (in a phase diagram or moduli space), by implementing
a modified $so(10)$ Grand Unification (GUT) with a Spin(10) gauge group plus a new discrete Wess-Zumino
Witten term matching a 4d nonperturbative global mixed gauge-gravity $w_2 w_3$ anomaly. In this
work, we include Barr's flipped $su(5)$ model into the quantum landscape, showing these four GUT-like
models arise near the quantum criticality near SM. Highlights include: First, we find the precise
GG or flipped $u(5)$ gauge group requires to redefine a Lie group U(5)$_{\hat q}$ with $\hat q=2$
or $3$ (instead of non-isomorphic analog $\hat q=1$ or 4), and different $\hat q$ are related by multiple
covering. Second, we show that the GG and flipped $u(5)$ are two different symmetry-breaking vacua
of the same order parameter separated by a first-order Landau-Ginzburg transition. We also show
that analogous 3+1d deconfined quantum criticalities, both between GG and PS, and between the flipped
$u(5)$ and PS, are beyond Landau-Ginzburg paradigm. Third, topological quantum criticality occurs
by tuning between the 15n vs 16n scenarios. Fourth, we explore the generalized higher global symmetries
in the SM and GUTs. Gauging the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ flip symmetry between GG and flipped $u(5)$ models,
leads to a potential categorical higher symmetry that is a non-invertible global symmetry: within
a gauge sector $(u(1) \times u(1)) \rtimes \mathbb{Z}_2$, the fusion rule of 2d topological surface
operator splits. However, the un-Higgs Spin(10) at UV retracts this categorical symmetry.

In this work we present the production of charged particles associated with high-$p_{\rm T}$ trigger
particles ($8<p_{\rm T}^{\rm trig.}<15$ GeV /$c$) at mid-pseudorapidity in proton-proton collisions
at $\sqrt{s}=5.02$\,TeV simulated with the \textsc{PYTHIA 8} Monte Carlo model. The study is performed
as a function of the relative transverse activity classifier, $R_{\rm T}$, which is the relative
charged-particle multiplicity in the transverse region ($\pi/3 <|\Delta\phi| <2\pi/3$) of the
di-hadron correlations, and it is sensitive to the Multi-Parton Interactions. The evolution of
the yield of associated particles on both the toward and the away regions with $3\leq p_{\rm T}^{\rm
assoc.}<8$ GeV/$c$ as a function of $R_{\rm T}$ is investigated. We propose a strategy which allows
for the modelling and subtraction of the Underlying Event (UE) contribution from the toward and
the away regions in challenging environments like those characterised by large $R_{\rm T}$. We
found that the signal in the away region becomes broader with increasing $R_{\rm T}$. Contrarily,
the yield increases with $R_{\rm T}$ in the toward region. This effect is reminiscent of that seen
in heavy-ion collisions, where an enhancement of the yield in the toward region for $0-5\%$ central
Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s}_{\rm NN}=2.76$\,TeV was reported. To further understand the role
of the UE and additional jet activity, the transverse region is divided into two one-sided sectors,
"trans-max" and "trans-min" selected in each event according to which region has larger or smaller
charged particle multiplicity. Based on this selection criterion, the observables are studied
as a function of $R_{\rm T}^{\rm max}$ and $R_{\rm T}^{\rm min}$, respectively. The presented results
have been published in J. Phys. G 48, no.1, 015007 (2020) and Phys. Rev. D 104, no.1, 016017 (2021).

In this paper, we study the non-perturbative effects in the neutrino magnetic moments, which are
obtained by matching the tensor operators in the low energy effective field theory extended with
right-handed neutrinos (LNEFT) onto the corresponding operators in chiral perturbation theory
with tensor external sources. These non-perturbative effects can be compared to the perturbative
ones, which are induced from one-loop mixing when performing the renormalization group evolutions
from $\mu=m_W$ down to $\mu=2~\mathrm{GeV}$. We then constrain the Wilson coefficients of the
LNEFT dipole and tensor operators separately from the neutrino-electron scattering and coherent
elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) to show the competition between these two effects,
at the renormalization scales $\mu=2~\mathrm{GeV}$ and $\mu=m_W$ in the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$
scheme. In the neutrino-electron scattering, it is found that the non-perturbative contributions
dominate for the coefficients involving up and down quarks, while they are expected to be of the same
order of magnitude as the perturbative contributions for the coefficients involving strange quark.
As for constraints in the CE$\nu$NS, the tensor operators can contribute to the process through
either direct or indirect way. As a result, the indirect contributions including non-purturbative
and perturbative parts for couplings to up and down quarks become negligible in comparison with
the direct ones, while the indirect contribution for coefficient involving strange quark is about
$15\%$ of the direct one. When using $|c_T|=3.2$ as input, all bounds for Wilson coefficients of
LNEFT operators obtained from neutrino-electron scattering in Borexino are more stringent than
the ones obtained from CE$\nu$NS in COHERENT.

The UT plots played already for three decades an important role in the tests of the SM and the determination
of the CKM parameters. As of 2022, among the four CKM parameters, $V_{us}$ and $\beta$ are already
measured with respectable precision, while this is not the case of $|V_{cb}|$ and $\gamma$. In the
case of $|V_{cb}|$ the main obstacle are the significant tensions between its inclusive and exclusive
determinations from tree-level decays. The present uncertainty in $\gamma$ of $4^\circ$ from
tree-level decays will be reduced to $1^\circ$ by the LHCb and Belle II collaborations in the coming
years. Unfortunately in the UT plots $|V_{cb}|$ is not seen and the experimental improvements in
the determination of $\gamma$ from tree-level decays at the level of a few degrees are difficult
to appreciate. In view of these deficiencies of the UT plots with respect to $|V_{cb}|$ and $\gamma$
and the central role these two CKM parameters will play in this decade, the recently proposed plots
of $|V_{cb}|$ versus $\gamma$ extracted from various processes appear to be superior to the UT plots
in the flavour phenomenology. We illustrate this idea with $\Delta M_s$, $\Delta M_d$, $\epsilon_K$
and with rare decays $B_s\to\mu^+\mu^-$, $B_d\to\mu^+\mu^-$, $K^+\to \pi^+\nu\bar\nu$ and
$K_L\to\pi^0\nu\bar\nu$. The power of $\epsilon_K$, $K^+\to\pi^+\nu\bar\nu)$ and $K_{L}\to\pi^0\nu\bar\nu)$
in the determination of $|V_{cb}|$, due to their strong dependence on $|V_{cb}|$, is transparently
exhibited in this manner. Combined with future reduced errors on $\gamma$ and $|V_{cb}|$ from tree-level
decays such plots can better exhibit possible inconsistenices between various determinations
of these two parameters, caused by new physics, than it is possible with the UT plots. This can already
be illustrated on the example of the $2.7\sigma$ anomaly in $B_s\to\mu^+\mu^-$.

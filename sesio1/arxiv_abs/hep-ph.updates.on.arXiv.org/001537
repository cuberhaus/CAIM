The vector portal/kinetic mixing simplified model of dark matter, in which thermal dark matter
of a mass ranging from a few MeV to a few GeV can be realized in association with a dark-sector $U(1)$,
relies on the appearance of a small kinetic mixing term between this dark $U(1)$ and the Standard
Model (SM) hypercharge. It is well-known that kinetic mixing of the appropriate magnitude can be
generated at one loop by the inclusion of "portal matter" fields which are charged under both the
dark $U(1)$ and the SM hypercharge, and it has been previously argued on phenomenological grounds
that fermionic portal matter fields must exhibit a very specific set of characteristics: They must
be vector-like and have the same Standard Model group representations as existing SM fermions.
A natural explanation for the presence of dark $U(1)$-charged copies of SM fermions would be to enlarge
the dark gauge group and embed the SM and the portal matter into a single dark multiplet, however,
previous attempts at accomplishing this task require significant ad hoc additions to the model
to ensure that the portal matter fields are vector-like while the SM fields are chiral, and rely on
complicated dark Higgs sectors to realize the appropriate symmetry breaking. In this paper, we
argue that embedding a portal matter model in extra dimensions can easily generate chiral SM fermions
and vector-like portal matter from a single dark bulk multiplet, while allowing for a far simpler
dark Higgs sector. We present a minimal construction of this "Kaluza-Klein portal matter" and explore
its phenomenology at the LHC, noting that even in our simple realization of the paradigm such a construction
exhibits phenomenology unique from that of more conventional theories of large extra dimensions
and 4-dimensional models of portal matter.

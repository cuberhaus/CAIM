We update cosmological constraints on two decaying dark matter models in light of BOSS-DR12 data
analyzed under the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structures (EFTofLSS) formalism, together
with Planck, Pantheon and other BOSS measurements of the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO).
In the first model, a fraction $f_{\rm dcdm}$ of cold dark matter (CDM) decays into dark radiation
(DR) with a lifetime $\tau$. In the second model (recently suggested as a potential resolution to
the $S_8$ tension), all the CDM decays with a lifetime $\tau$ into DR and a massive warm dark matter
(WDM) particle, with a fraction $\varepsilon$ of the CDM rest mass energy transferred to the DR.
Using numerical codes from the recent literature, we perform the first calculation of the mildly
non-linear (matter and galaxy) power spectra with the EFTofLSS for these two models. In the case
of DR products, we obtain the constraints $f_{\rm dcdm}\lesssim0.022$ (95\% C.L.) for lifetimes
shorter than the age of the universe, and $\tau/f_{\rm dcdm} \gtrsim 250$ Gyr in the long-lived regime
assuming $f_{\rm dcdm}\to1$. We show that Planck data contributes the most to these constraints,
with EFTofBOSS providing a marginal improvement over conventional BAO and redshift space distortions
($f\sigma_8$) data. In the case of DR and WDM decay products, we find that EFTofBOSS data significantly
improves the constraints at 68\% C.L. on the CDM lifetime with a $S_8$ prior from KiDS-1000. We show
that, in order to fit EFTofBOSS data while lowering $S_8$ to match KiDS-1000, the best-fit model
has a longer lifetime $\tau = 120$ Gyr, with a larger kick velocity $v_{\rm kick}/c \simeq \varepsilon
\simeq 1.2\%$, than that without EFTofBOSS ($\tau = 43$ Gyr, $\varepsilon =0.6\%$). We anticipate
that future surveys will provide exquisite constraints on such models.

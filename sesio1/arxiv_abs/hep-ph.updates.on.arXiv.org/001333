We revisit the possibility that the stochastic common-spectrum process recently detected by the
NANOGrav pulsar timing array experiment could be due to primordial gravitational waves (GWs).
A na\"{i}ve extrapolation down to interferometer scales of the blue GW spectrum required to explain
NANOGrav consistently with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations would strongly violate
upper limits on the stochastic GW background (SGWB) amplitude from LIGO/Virgo. In combination
with the fact that there are over 19 decades in frequency between CMB and interferometer scales,
this motivates us to move beyond the commonly adopted approximation of a pure power-law GW spectrum.
We consider a broken power-law parametrization for the SGWB spectrum, which turns from blue to red
above the break frequency: while phenomenological, this choice maps to various well-motivated
early-Universe models, including scenarios featuring non-instantaneous reheating or a non-standard
background expansion following reheating. After a detailed discussion of the contribution of
the resulting SGWB to the early-Universe radiation energy density, we constrain the broken power-law
model against a wide variety of multi-frequency cosmological and GW observations. We find that
this phenomenological model is able to explain the NANOGrav signal while remaining in agreement
with upper limits on the tensor-to-scalar ratio on CMB scales, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis constraints
on the early-Universe radiation energy density, and upper limits on the SGWB amplitude on interferometer
scales. We briefly discuss the very bright prospects for testing this model with next-generation
probes across the GW frequency landscape, which motivate further exploring connections to specific
well-motivated early-Universe models.

The Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) paradigm is one of the most popular scenarios for
Dark Matter (DM) theories that however is strongly constrained, in particular by direct detection
experiments. We stick with the WIMP hypothesis and consider a Dirac fermion candidate for DM that
interacts with the Standard Model (SM) via a spin-1 $Z'$, arising from the spontaneous breaking
of an Abelian $U(1)'_{\mu}$ gauge symmetry, under which only second generation leptons and the
DM are appropriately charged. Due to the charge assignment, the model is gauge anomalous and can
only be interpreted as an effective field theory (EFT) at low energy. The $Z'$ couples at tree level
only to the vector DM current, to the axial muon current and to left-handed muonic neutrinos, so the
WIMP-nucleon cross section is beyond the experimental reach of spin-independent (SI) direct detection
searches. We study the current bounds on this model coming from direct and indirect detection of
DM, collider searches, contributions to $(g-2)_{\mu}$ and to neutrino trident production. We
find that large regions of the parameter space remains to be explored. In the context of LHC searches,
we study the impact of a muon-exclusive signal region for the $3\mu$ + ${E}^{{\rm miss}}_T$ channel
with an invariant mass window around $m_{Z'}$. We show that this search can significantly improve
the current collider bounds. Finally, from the anomalous nature of our EFT, there remain at low energy
triboson anomalous interactions between the $Z'$ and the electroweak (EW) SM gauge bosons. We explore
the possibilities of probing these interactions at the LHC and at a 100 TeV proton collider finding
it extremely challenging. On the other hand, for a muon collider the resonant channel $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\to
Z'\to ZZ$ could be discovered in the most promising scenario with luminosity of $\mathcal{O}({\rm
few}\; 10)$ ${\rm fb}^{-1}$.

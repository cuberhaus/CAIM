We study an attractive scenario, "Sleptonic SUSY", which reconciles the $125$ GeV Higgs scalar
and the non-observation of superpartners thus far with potentially pivotal roles for slepton phenomenology:
providing viable ongoing targets for LHC discovery, incorporating a co-annihilation partner
for detectable thermal relic dark matter, and capable of mediating the existing muon $g-2$ anomaly.
This is accomplished by a modestly hierarchical spectrum, with sub-TeV sleptons and electroweakinos
and with multi-TeV masses for the other new states. We study new elements in the UV MSSM realization
of Sleptonic SUSY based on higher-dimensional sequestering and the synergy between the resulting
gaugino-mediation, hypercharge $D$-term mediation and Higgs-mediation of SUSY-breaking, so
as to more fully capture the range of possibilities. This framework stands out by harmoniously solving
the flavor, CP and $\mu - B\mu$ problems of the supersymmetric paradigm. We discuss its extension
to orbifold GUTs, including gauge-coupling and $b$-tau unification. We also develop a non-minimal
model with extra Higgs fields, in which the electroweak vacuum is more readily cosmologically stable
against decay to a charge-breaking vacuum, allowing a broader range of sleptonic spectra than in
the MSSM alone. We survey the rich set of signals possible at the LHC and future colliders, covering
both $R$-parity conservation and violation, as well as for dark matter detection. While the multi-TeV
squarks imply a Little Hierarchy Problem, intriguingly, small changes in parameter space to improve
naturalness result in dramatic phase transitions to either electroweak-preservation or charge-breaking.
In a Multiverse setting, the modest unnaturalness may then be explained by the "principle of living
dangerously".

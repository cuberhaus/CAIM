The purpose of this paper is to calculate the masses of the hadrons. More precisely the masses of the
scalar and vector mesons as well as the baryons having $\frac{3 \hslash}{2}$ and $\frac{\hslash}{2}$
spin are calculated. The standard model of particle physics, delivering excellent results in many
aspects of particle physics but fails at calculating particle masses. Therefore, for this paper
a Kaluza-Klein like model was developed based on the structure of the Standard Model. The model consists
of 10 dimensions which are: one time, three usual macroscopic space and six compactified dimensions.
Excitations - disturbances traveling with the speed of light on the 10D spacetime - are introduced.
An excitation on a compactified dimension can induce a mass in 4D spacetime; it is accompanied by
an integer, the excitation number, and has a well-defined spin. The model's free parameters are
computed using the measured masses of the charged leptons, including the upper bound of the mass
difference between electron and positron, the mesons $\pi^{0}, \pi^{+}, \rho^{0}, \phi, \psi,
\Upsilon$, the top-quark mass, and the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron. The most important
of the derived parameters are the compactification radius $\rho$, the weak coupling $\alpha_{w}$,
the strong coupling $\alpha_{s}$ and the anti-neutrino to neutrino density ratio $\delta$. The
formulas for calculating hadron masses are given and applied to approximately one hundred composite
particles, which are compiled within four separate tables. The comparison between the measured
masses of 64 hadrons and the calculations shows relative errors below $0.05$ for 50\% and below $0.1$
in 85\% of all cases. Pearson's correlation coefficient of masses measured versus calculated is
$r=0.99$ with a significance of $p<10^{-56}$. The calculation results of another 36 hadron masses,
not yet experimentally determined, are stated.

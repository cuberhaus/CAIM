Central to understanding the nonpertubative, intrinsic partonic nature of hadron structure are
the concepts of transverse momentum dependent (TMD) parton distribution and fragmentation functions.
A TMD factorization approach to the phenomenology of semi-inclusive processes that includes evolution,
higher orders, and matching to larger transverse momentum, is ultimately necessary for reliably
connecting with phenomenologically extracted nonperturbative structures, especially when
widely different scales are involved. In this paper, we will address some of the difficulties that
arise when phenomenological techniques that were originally designed for very high energy applications
are extended to studies of hadron structures, and we will solidify the connection between standard
high energy TMD implementations and the more intuitive, parton model based approaches to phenomenology
that emphasize nonperturbative hadron structure. In the process, we will elaborate on differences
between forward and backward TMD evolution, which in the context of this paper we call "bottom-up"
and "top-down" approaches, and we will explain the advantages of a bottom-up strategy. We will also
emphasize and clarify the role of the integral relations that connect TMD and collinear correlation
functions. We will show explicitly how they constrain the nonperturbative "$g$-functions" of
standard Collins-Soper-Sterman (CSS) implementations of TMD factorization. This paper is especially
targeted toward phenomenologists and model builders who are interested in merging specific nonperturbative
models and calculations (including lattice QCD) with TMD factorization at large $Q$. Our main result
is a recipe for incorporating nonperturbative models into TMD factorization, and for constraining
their parameters in a way that matches to perturbative QCD and evolution.

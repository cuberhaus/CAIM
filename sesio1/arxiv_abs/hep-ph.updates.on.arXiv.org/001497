We investigate properties of the ground-state and first radially excited four-quark mesons $X_0$
and $X_0^{\prime}$ with a diquark-antidiquark structure $[ud][\overline{c}\overline{s}]$
and spin-parities $J^{\mathrm{P} }=0^{+}$. Our aim is to reveal whether or not one of these states
can be identified with the resonance $X_0(2900)$, recently discovered by the LHCb collaboration.
We model $X_0$ and $X_0^{\prime}$ as tetraquarks composed of either axial-vector or scalar diquark
and antidiquark pairs. Their spectroscopic parameters are computed by employing the QCD two-point
sum rule method and including into analysis vacuum condensates up to dimension $ 15$. For an axial-axial
structure of $X_0^{(\prime)}$, we find partial widths of the decays $X_0^{(\prime)} \to D^{-}K^{+}$
and $X_0^{(\prime)} \to D^{0}K^{0}$, and estimate full widths of the states $X_0^{(\prime)}$.
To this end, we calculate the strong couplings at the vertices $ X_0^{(\prime)}DK $ in the framework
of the light-cone sum rule method. We use also technical approaches of the soft-meson approximation
necessary to analyze tetraquark-meson-meson vertices. Obtained results $m=(2545 \pm 160)~ \mathrm{MeV}$
and $m^{\prime}=(3320 \pm 120)~\mathrm{MeV}$ [$m_{\mathrm{S} }=(2663 \pm 110)~\mathrm{MeV}$
and $m_{\mathrm{S}}^{\prime}=(3325 \pm 85)~ \mathrm{MeV}$ for a scalar-scalar current] for
the masses of the particles $ X_0$ and $X_0^{\prime}$, as well as estimates for their full widths
$ \Gamma_{0}=(140 \pm 29)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and $\Gamma_{0}^{\prime}=(110 \pm 25)~ \mathrm{MeV}$
allow us to interpret none of them as the resonance $X_0(2900)$ . At the same time, these predictions
provide important information about ground-state and radially excited diquark-antidiquark
structures $X_0$ and $ X_0^{\prime}$, which should be objects of future experimental and theoretical
studies.

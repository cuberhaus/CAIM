T2HK is an upcoming long-baseline experiment in Japan which will have two water Cherenkov detector
tanks of 187 kt volume each at distance of 295 km from the source. An alternative project, T2HKK is
also under consideration where one of the water tanks will be moved to Korea at a distance of 1100 km.
The flux at 295 km will cover the first oscillation maximum and the flux at 1100 km will mainly cover
the second oscillation maximum. As physics sensitivity at the dual baseline rely on variation in
statistics, dependence of systematic uncertainty, effect of second oscillation maximum and matter
density, 187 kt detector volume at 295 km and 187 kt detector volume at 1100 km may not be the optimal
configuration of T2HKK. Therefore, we have tried to optimize the ratio of the detector volume at
both the locations by studying the interplay between the above mentioned parameters. For the analysis
of neutrino mass hierarchy, octant of $\theta_{23}$ and CP precision, we have considered two values
of $\delta_{\rm CP}$ as $270^\circ$ and $0^\circ$ and for CP violation we have considered the value
of $\delta_{\rm CP} = 270^\circ$. These values are motivated by the current best-fit values of this
parameter as obtained from the experiments T2K and NO$\nu$A. Interestingly we find that if the systematic
uncertainty is negligible then the T2HK setup i.e., when both the detector tanks are placed at 295
km gives the best results in terms of hierarchy sensitivity at $\delta_{\rm CP} = 270^\circ$, octant
sensitivity, CP violation sensitivity and CP precision sensitivity at $\delta_{\rm CP} = 0^\circ$.
For current values of systematic errors, we find that neither T2HK, nor T2HKK setup is giving better
results for hierarchy, CP violation and CP precision sensitivity. The optimal detector volume
which is of the range between 255 kt to 345 kt at 1100 km gives better results in those above mentioned
parameters.

We propose a scotogenic extension of the Standard Model which can provide a scalar Dark Matter candidate
in the new, theoretically previously unaddressed, intermediate region ($200\leq M_{DM}\leq
550$ GeV) and also generate light Dirac neutrino masses. In this framework, the standard model is
extended by three gauge singlet fermions, two singlet scalar fields, and one additional scalar
doublet, all of which are odd under $Z_{2} \times Z_{4}$ discrete symmetry. These additional symmetries
prevent the singlet fermions from obtaining Majorana mass terms along with providing the stability
to the dark matter candidate. It is known that in the case of the scalar singlet DM model, the only region
which is not yet excluded is a narrow region close to the Higgs resonance $m_{S} \simeq\frac{m_{h}}{2}$
- others ruled out from different experimental and theoretical bounds. In the case of the Inert doublet
model, the mass region ($\sim 60$-$80$ GeV) and the high mass region (heavier than $ 550 $ GeV) are
allowed. This motivates us to explore a parameter range in the intermediate-mass region $M_{W}\leq
M_{DM}\leq 550 $ GeV, which we do in a scotogenic extension of SM with a scalar doublet and scalar singlets.
The dark matter in our model is a mixture of singlet and doublet scalars. We constrain the allowed
parameter space of the model using Planck bound on present dark matter relic abundance, neutrino
mass, and the latest bound on spin-independent DM-nucleon scattering cross-section from XENON1T
experiment. Our model may provide a viable DM candidate in the new, previously unexplored mass range
($200\leq M_{DM}\leq 550$ GeV), if this new window for the DM candidate mass is detected in future
experiments, along with explanation of Dirac mass of neutrinos, since so far there is no strong evidence
in support of Majorana nature of neutrino mass.

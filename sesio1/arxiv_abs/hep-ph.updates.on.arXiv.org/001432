Since the $\nu_\tau(\bar\nu_\tau) A_Z \to \tau^\mp X$ reaction is notoriously difficult to be
directly measured, the information on the dynamics of this nuclear process should be extracted
from the analysis of the energy and angular distributions of the tau decay visible products. These
distributions depend on the components of the tau-polarization vector. We give, for the first time,
the general expression for the outgoing hadron (pion or rho meson) energy and angular differential
cross section for the sequential $\nu_\tau A_Z \to \tau^-(\pi^- \nu_\tau, \rho^-\nu_\tau) X$
and $\bar\nu_\tau A_Z \to \tau^+(\pi^+ \bar\nu_\tau, \rho^+ \bar\nu_\tau) X$ reactions. Though
all possible nuclear reaction mechanisms contribute to the distribution, it may be possible to
isolate/enhance one of them by implementing appropriate selection criteria. For the case of the
quasi-elastic reaction off oxygen and neutrino energies below 6 GeV, we show that the pion distributions
are sensitive to the details of the tau-polarization components. We find significant differences
between the full calculation, where the longitudinal and transverse components of the tau polarization
vector vary with the energy and the scattering angle of the produced tau, and the simplified scheme
in which the polarizations are set to one and zero (respective asymptotic values in the high energy
regime). In addition to its potential impact on neutrino oscillation analyses, this result can
be used to further test different nuclear models, since these observables provide complementary
information to that obtained by means of the inclusive nuclear weak charged-current differential
cross section. We also study the effects on the cross section of the $W_4$, $W_5$ nuclear structure
functions, which contributions are proportional to the charged lepton mass, and therefore difficult
to constrain in muon and electron neutrino experiments.

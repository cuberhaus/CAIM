We discuss axionlike particle (ALP) with simplified flavorful couplings, to explore the intrinsic
coupling correlations among flavor physics observables. We focus particularly on the tau-lepton
flavor violation (LFV). The ALP is assumed to be tau-philic on a current-eigenstate basis, a la Pecci-Quinn.
The ALP has the intrinsic flavorful coupling structure for fermions, which allows coupling also
to muon and electron only in a right-handed specific manner as a consequence of the right-handed
flavor rotation within the standard model (SM). Several LFV processes are generated including
radiative tau decays and also anomalous magnetic moments of electron and muon. We first pay attention
to two separated limits: electron scenario with the ALP coupled to tau which mixes only with right-handed
electron, and muon scenario as the muonic counterpart of the electron scenario. It turns out that
those scenarios are highly constrained by existing experimental limits from the LFV processes
and $(g-2)$s, to require emergence of a flavor symmetry for the ALP like $U(1)_{e-\tau}$ or $U(1)_{\mu-\tau}$.
We then explore a hybrid scenario combining the two separated scenarios, and find a fully viable
parameter space on the ALP mass-photon coupling plane, which limits the ALP mass to be around $(1.7
- 8)$ GeV and the ALP decay constant $f_a$ to be (10 - 50) GeV. Discrimination of the present ALP from
other light LFV particles are also discussed. We find that the polarization asymmetry in LFV radiative
$\tau$ decay is a smoking-gun, which definitely predicts preference of the right-handed polarization
due to the MFV, in sharp contrast to the SM prediction with the highly left-handed preference, and
also other light-new physics candidates with the same mass scale as the present ALP. Possible model-building
to underlie the present third-generation specific ALP is also briefly addressed.

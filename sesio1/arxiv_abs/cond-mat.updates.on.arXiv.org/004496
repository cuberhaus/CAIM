The concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking and off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO) are associated
with Bose-Einstein condensation. However, as in the system of reduced dimension the effect of quantum
fluctuation is dominating, the concept of ODLRO becomes more interesting, especially for the long-range
interaction. In the present manuscript, we study the correlation dynamics triggered by lattice
depth quench in a system of three dipolar bosons in a 1D triple-well optical lattice from the first
principle using the multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree method for bosons (MCTDHB).
Our main motivation is to explore how ODLRO develops and decays with time when the system is brought
out-of-equilibrium by a sudden change in the lattice depth. We compare results of dipolar bosons
with contact interaction. For forward quench $(V_{f} > V_{i})$, the system exhibits the collapse-revival
dynamics in the time evolution of normalized first- and second-order Glauber's correlation function,
time evolution of Shannon information entropy both for the contact as well as for the dipolar interaction
which is reminiscent of the one observed in Greiner's experiment [Nature, {415}, (2002)]. We define
the collapse and revival time ratio as the figure of merit ($\tau$) which can uniquely distinguish
the timescale of dynamics for dipolar interaction from that of contact interaction. In the reverse
quench process $(V_{i} > V_{f})$, for dipolar interaction, the dynamics is complex and the system
does not exhibit any definite time scale of evolution, whereas the system with contact interaction
exhibits collapse-revival dynamics with a definite time-scale. The long-range repulsive tail
in the dipolar interaction inhibits the spreading of correlation across the lattice sites.

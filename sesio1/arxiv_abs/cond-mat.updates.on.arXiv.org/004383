A general topic of current interest is the analysis of diffusion problems in singularly perturbed
domains with small interior targets or traps (the narrow capture problem). One major application
is to intracellular diffusion, where the targets typically represent some form of reactive biochemical
substrate. Most studies of the narrow capture problem treat the target boundaries as totally absorbing.
In this paper, we analyze the three-dimensional narrow capture problem in the more realistic case
of partially reactive target boundaries. We begin by considering classical Robin boundary conditions.
Matching inner and outer solutions of the single-particle probability density, we derive an asymptotic
expansion of the Laplace transformed flux into each reactive surface in powers of $\epsilon$, where
$\epsilon$ is the non-dimensionalized target size. In turn, the fluxes determine the splitting
probabilities and conditional first passage times (FPTs) for target absorption. We then extend
our analysis to more general types of reactive targets by combining matched asymptotic analysis
with an encounter-based formulation of diffusion-mediated surface reactions. That is, we derive
an asymptotic expansion of the joint probability density for particle position and the boundary
local time. The effects of surface reactions are then incorporated via an appropriate stopping
condition for the boundary local time. Finally, we illustrate the theory by exploring how the leading-order
contributions to the splitting probabilities and conditional mean FPTs depend on the choice of
surface reactions. In particular, we show that there is an effective renormalization of the target
radius of the form $\rho\rightarrow \rho-\widetilde{\Psi}(1/\rho)$, where $\widetilde{\Psi}$
is the Laplace transform of the stopping local time distribution.

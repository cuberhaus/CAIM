We present the {\em (symmetry-incorporating) formalism of general continuum models with boundary
conditions} and apply it to the model with the minimal number of degrees of freedom necessary to have
a well-defined boundary: a model with a two-component wave function and a linear-in-momentum Hamiltonian.
We derive the most general forms (class A) of both the Hamiltonian and boundary condition in 1D (insulator),
2D (quantum anomalous Hall insulator), and 3D (Weyl node) and analytically calculate and explore
the corresponding general bound/edge/surface-state structures. In 1D, one bound state exists
in the half of the $\text{U}(1)$ parameter space of possible boundary conditions. Considering
several dimensions simultaneously ties the models together and uncovers important relations
between them. We formulate a version of bulk-boundary correspondence that fully characterizes
the vicinity of a Weyl point: the chirality of the surface-state spectrum along a path enclosing
the projected Weyl point is equal to the Chern number of the Weyl point. We demonstrate how symmetries
are naturally incorporated into the formalism, by deriving the most general form of the model with
chiral symmetry (class AIII). We show that the (perhaps unexpected) existence of persistent bound
states in the topologically trivial 1D class-A model is not accidental and has at least two topological
explanations, by relating it to the topologically nontrivial 2D class-A (by viewing it as an effective
2D quantum anomalous Hall system) and 1D class-AIII (via deviation from the cases of chiral symmetry
in the parameter space) models. We identify this as a systematic "propagation effect", whereby
bound states from topologically nontrivial classes, where they are protected and guaranteed to
exist, propagate to the related, "adjacent" in dimension or symmetry, topologically trivial classes.

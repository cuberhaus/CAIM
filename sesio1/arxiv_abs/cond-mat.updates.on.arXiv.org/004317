Polar skyrmions are predicted to emerge from the interplay of elastic, electrostatic and gradient
energies, in contrast to the key role of the anti-symmetric Dzyalozhinskii-Moriya interaction
in magnetic skyrmions. With the discovery of topologically-stable polar skyrmions, it is of both
fundamental and practical interest to understand the microscopic nature and the possibility of
temperature- and strain-driven phase transitions in ensembles of such polar skyrmions. Here,
we explore the emergence of a two-dimensional, tetratic lattice of merons (with topological charge
of -1/2) from a skyrmion state (topological charge of -1) upon varying the temperature and elastic
boundary conditions in [(PbTiO3)16/(SrTiO3)16]8 lifted-off membranes. This topological phase
transition is accompanied by a change in chirality, from net-handedness (in skyrmionic phase)
to zero-net chirality (in meronic phase). To map these changes microscopically required developing
new imaging methods. We show how scanning convergent beam electron diffraction provides a robust
measure of the local polarization simultaneously with the strain state at sub-nm resolution, while
also directly mapping the chirality of each skyrmion. Using this, we demonstrate strain as a crucial
order parameter to drive isotropic-to-anisotropic structural transitions of chiral polar skyrmions
to non-chiral merons, validated with X-ray reciprocal space mapping and theoretical phase-field
simulations. These results revealed by our new measurement methods provide the first illustration
of systematic control of rich variety of topological dipole textures by altering the mechanical
boundary conditions, which may offer a promising way to control their functionalities in ferroelectric
nanodevices using the local and spatial distribution of chirality and order.

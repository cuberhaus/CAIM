We show how the tracer motion of tagged, distinguishable particles can effectively describe transport
in various homogeneous quantum many-body systems with constraints. We consider systems of spinful
particles on a one-dimensional lattice subjected to constrained spin interactions, such that
some or even all multipole moments of the effective spin pattern formed by the particles are conserved.
On the one hand, when all moments - and thus the entire spin pattern - are conserved, dynamical spin
correlations reduce to tracer motion identically, generically yielding a subdiffusive dynamical
exponent $z=4$. This provides a common framework to understand the dynamics of several constrained
lattice models, including models with XNOR or $tJ_z$ - constraints. We consider random unitary
circuit dynamics with such a conserved spin pattern and use the tracer picture to obtain exact expressions
for their late-time dynamical correlations. Our results can also be extended to integrable quantum
many-body systems that feature a conserved spin pattern but whose dynamics is insensitive to the
pattern, which includes for example the folded XXZ spin chain. On the other hand, when only a finite
number of moments of the pattern are conserved, the dynamics is described by a convolution of the
internal hydrodynamics of the spin pattern with a tracer distribution function. As a consequence,
we find that the tracer universality is robust in generic systems if at least the quadrupole moment
of the pattern remains conserved. In cases where only total magnetization and dipole moment of the
pattern are constant, we uncover an intriguing coexistence of two processes with equal dynamical
exponent but different scaling functions, which we relate to phase coexistence at a first order
transition.

We have carried out new neutron spectroscopic measurements on single crystals of La$_{1.6-x}$Nd$_{0.4}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$
from 0.12 to 0.26 using time-of-flight techniques. These measurements allow us to follow the evolution
of parallel spin stripe fluctuations with energies less than 33 meV, from x=0.12 to 0.26. Samples
at these hole-doping levels are known to display static (on the neutron scattering time scale) parallel
spin stripes at low temperature, with onset temperatures and intensities which decrease rapidly
with increasing x. Nonetheless, we report remarkably similar dynamic spectral weight for the corresponding
dynamic parallel spin stripes, between 5 meV to 33 meV, from the 1/8 anomaly near x=0.12, to optimal
doping near x=0.19 to the quantum critical point for the pseudogap phase near x=0.24, and finally
to the approximate end of superconductivity near x=0.26. This observed dynamic magnetic spectral
weight is structured in energy with a peak near 17 meV at all dopings studied. Earlier neutron and
resonant x-ray scattering measurements on related cuprate superconductors have reported both
a disappearance with increasing doping of magnetic fluctuations at ($\pi$, $\pi$) wavevectors
characterizing parallel spin stripe structures, and persistant paramagnon scattering away from
this wavevector, respectively. Our new results on La$_{1.6-x}$Nd$_{0.4}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ from
0.12 < x <0.26 clearly show persistent parallel spin stripe fluctuations at and around at ($\pi$,
$\pi$), and across the full range of doping studied. These results are also compared to recent theory.
Together with a rapidly declining x-dependence to the static parallel spin stripe order, the persistent
parallel spin stripe fluctuations show a remarkable similarity to the expectations of a quantum
spin glass, random t-J model, recently introduced to describe strong local correlations in cuprates.

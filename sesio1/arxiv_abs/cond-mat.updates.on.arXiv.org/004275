Mott insulators with large local Hilbert spaces (or multicomponent local Hilbert spaces) appear
widely in quantum materials and ultracold atomic systems. For the Mott insulating quantum materials
with a large local Hilbert space, the spin-only description with pairwise quadratic spin interactions
is often insufficient to capture the interaction. In the situation with active local orbital degrees
of freedom, the Kugel-Khomskii superexchange model was then proposed. We here briefly review this
historical model and discuss the modern arenas and developments beyond the original orbital context
where this model and the relevant physics emerge. These include and are not restricted to the $4d$/$5d$
transition metal compounds with the spin-orbital-entangled ${J=3/2}$ quadruplets, the rare-earth
magnets with two weakly separated crystal field doublets, breathing magnets and/or the cluster
and molecular magnets, et al. We explain the microscopic origin of the emergent Kugel-Khomskii
physics in each solid-state realization with some emphasis on the ${J=3/2}$ quadruplets, and dub
the candidate systems "${J=3/2}$ Mott insulators". For the ultracold atom contexts, we review
the Mott insulators with the large-spin ultracold alkaline and alkaline-earth atoms on the optical
lattices, where a large local Hilbert space naturally emerges. Despite a large local Hilbert space
from the atomic hyperfine spin states, the system could realize a large symmetry group such as the
Sp($N$) or the SU($N$) symmetry. These ultracold atomic systems actually lie in the large-$N$ regime
of large symmetry groups and are characterized by strong quantum fluctuations. The Kugel-Khomskii
physics and the exotic quantum ground states with the "bayone-like" physics can appear in various
limits. We conclude with our vision and outlook on this subject.

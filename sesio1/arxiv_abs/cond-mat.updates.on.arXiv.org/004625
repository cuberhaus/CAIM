A living cell uses long tubular appendages for locomotion and sensory purposes. Hence, assembling
and maintaining a protrusion of correct length is crucial for its survival and overall performance.
Usually the protrusions lack the machinery for the synthesis of building blocks and imports them
from the cell body. What are the unique features of the transport logistics which facilitate the
exchange of these building blocks between the cell and the protrusion? What kind of `rulers' and
`timers' does the cell use for constructing its appendages of correct length on time? How do the multiple
appendages coordinate and communicate among themselves during different stages of their existence?
How frequently do the fluctuations drive the length of these dynamic protrusions out of the acceptable
bounds? These questions are addressed from a broad perspective in this review which is organized
in three parts. In part-I the list of all known cell protrusions is followed by a comprehensive list
of the mechanisms of length control of cell protrusions reported in the literature. We review not
only the dynamics of the genesis of the protrusions, but also their resorption and regrowth as well
as regeneration after amputation. As a case study in part-II, the specific cell protrusion that
has been discussed in detail is eukaryotic flagellum (also known as cilium); this choice was dictated
by the fact that flagellar length control mechanisms have been studied most extensively over more
than half a century in cells with two or more flagella. Although limited in scope, brief discussions
on a few non-flagellar cell protrusions in part-III of this review is intended to provide a glimpse
of the uncharted territories and challenging frontiers of research on subcellular length control
phenomena that awaits vigorous investigations.

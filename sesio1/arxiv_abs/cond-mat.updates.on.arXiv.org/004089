One of the main bottlenecks in the pursuit of a large-scale--chip-based quantum computer is the
large number of control signals needed to operate qubit systems. As system sizes scale up, the number
of terminals required to connect to off-chip control electronics quickly becomes unmanageable.
Here, we discuss a quantum-dot spin-qubit architecture that integrates on-chip control electronics,
allowing for a significant reduction in the number of signal connections at the chip boundary. By
arranging the qubits in a two-dimensional (2D) array with $\sim$12 $\mu$m pitch, we create space
to implement locally integrated sample-and-hold circuits. This allows to offset the inhomogeneities
in the potential landscape across the array and to globally share the majority of the control signals
for qubit operations. We make use of advanced circuit modeling software to go beyond conceptual
drawings of the component layout, to assess the feasibility of the scheme through a concrete floor
plan, including estimates of footprints for quantum and classical electronics, as well as routing
of signal lines across the chip using different interconnect layers. We make use of local demultiplexing
circuits to achieve an efficient signal-connection scaling leading to a Rent's exponent as low
as $p = 0.43$. Furthermore, we use available data from state-of-the-art spin qubit and microelectronics
technology development, as well as circuit models and simulations, to estimate the operation frequencies
and power consumption of a million-qubit processor. This work presents a novel and complementary
approach to previously proposed architectures, focusing on a feasible scheme to integrating quantum
and classical hardware, and significantly closing the gap towards a fully CMOS-compatible quantum
computer implementation.

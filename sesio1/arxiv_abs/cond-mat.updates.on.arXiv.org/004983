We propose a method to calculate finite-temperature properties of a quantum many-body system for
a microcanonical ensemble by introducing a pure quantum state named here an energy-filtered random-phase
state, which is also a potentially promising application of near-term quantum computers. In our
formalism, a microcanonical ensemble is specified by two parameters, i.e., an energy of the system
and its associated energy window. Accordingly, the density of states is expressed as a sum of Gaussians
centered at the target energy with its spread corresponding to the width of the energy window. We
then show that the thermodynamic quantities such as entropy and temperature are calculated by evaluating
the trace of the time-evolution operator and the trace of the time-evolution operator multiplied
by the Hamiltonian of the system. We also describe how these traces can be evaluated using random
diagonal-unitary circuits appropriate to quantum computation. The pure quantum state representing
our microcanonical ensemble is related to a state of the form introduced by Wall and Neuhauser for
the filter diagonalization method [M. R. Wall and D. Neuhauser, J. Chem. Phys. 102, 8011 (1995)],
and therefore we refer to it as an energy-filtered random-phase state. The energy-filtered random-phase
state is essentially a Fourier transform of a time-evolved state whose initial state is prepared
as a random-phase state, and the cut-off time in the time-integral for the Fourier transform sets
the inverse of the width of the energy window. The proposed method is demonstrated numerically by
calculating thermodynamic quantities for the one-dimensional spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on small
clusters up to 28 qubits, showing that the method is most efficient for the target energy around which
the dense distribution of energy eigenstates is found.

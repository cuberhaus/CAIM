The concept of alloying multiple principal elements at high concentrations has led to the development
of High Entropy Alloys (HEAs) with exceptional mechanical properties, making them the focus of
major recent scientific endeavors. Geometrically complex HEAs with tailored microstructural
characteristics can be produced using additive manufacturing technologies such as powder bed
fusion (PBF). However, an in-depth study on the effect of process thermal conditions during PBF
is required to effectively fabricate HEAs with desirable mechanical characteristics. Thus, in
our present molecular dynamic (MD) study we have explored the implication of PBF process thermal
conditions on the mechanical characteristics of FeNiCrCoCu HEA by systematically varying laser
scan speed from 0.4 {\AA}/ps to 0.1 {\AA}/ps, unidirectional and reversing laser passes from 1 to
4, and laser power from 100 microwatts to 220 microwatts. Our investigation suggests that reducing
the laser scanning speed up to a critical velocity of 0.2 {\AA}/ps considerably improves mechanical
strengths, with further reduction creating severe surface defects. Decreased ultimate tensile
strength (UTS) is associated with the annihilation of the bulk sessile dislocations during tensile
straining marking an early yield failure. Alternately, the material's strength could be improved
by annealing with several unidirectional laser passes over the same target region, resulting in
enhanced UTS due to subtler yield points. Increasing laser power aids in ameliorating material
density ultimately leading to higher UTS even in non-dislocation-free structures. These findings
will assist researchers to understand the underlying effects and optimize process thermal parameters
to fabricate superior HEAs utilizing additive manufacturing.

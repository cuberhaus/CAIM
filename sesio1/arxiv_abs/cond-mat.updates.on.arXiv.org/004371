The Ensemble of trajectories $x(0 \leq t \leq T)$ produced by the Markov generator $M$ can be considered
as 'Canonical' for the following reasons : (C1) the probability of the trajectory $x(0 \leq t \leq
T)$ can be rewritten as the exponential of a linear combination of its relevant empirical time-averaged
observables $E_n$, where the coefficients involving the Markov generator are their fixed conjugate
parameters; (C2) the large deviations properties of these empirical observables $E_n$ for large
$T$ are governed by the explicit rate function $I^{[2.5]}_M (E_.) $ at Level 2.5, while in the thermodynamic
limit $T=+\infty$, they concentrate on their typical values $E_n^{typ[M]}$ determined by the
Markov generator $M$. This concentration property in the thermodynamic limit $T=+\infty$ suggests
to introduce the notion of the 'Microcanonical Ensemble' at Level 2.5 for stochastic trajectories
$x(0 \leq t \leq T)$, where all the relevant empirical variables $E_n$ are fixed to some values $E^*_n$
and cannot fluctuate anymore for finite $T$. The goal of the present paper is to discuss its main properties
: (MC1) when the long trajectory $x(0 \leq t \leq T) $ belongs the Microcanonical Ensemble with the
fixed empirical observables $E_n^*$, the statistics of its subtrajectory $x(0 \leq t \leq \tau)
$ for $1 \ll \tau \ll T $ is governed by the Canonical Ensemble associated to the Markov generator $M^*$
that would make the empirical observables $E_n^*$ typical ; (MC2) in the Microcanonical Ensemble,
the central role is played by the number $\Omega^{[2.5]}_T(E^*_.) $ of stochastic trajectories
of duration $T$ with the given empirical observables $E^*_n$, and by the corresponding explicit
Boltzmann entropy $S^{[2.5]}( E^*_. ) = [\ln \Omega^{[2.5]}_T(E^*_.)]/T $. This general framework
is applied to continuous-time Markov Jump processes and to discrete-time Markov chains with illustrative
examples.

Many important phenomena in quantum devices are dynamic, meaning that they cannot be studied using
time-averaged measurements alone. Experiments that measure such transient effects are collectively
known as fast readout. One of the most useful techniques in fast electrical readout is radio-frequency
reflectometry, which can measure changes in impedance (both resistive and reactive) even when
their duration is extremely short, down to a microsecond or less. Examples of reflectometry experiments,
some of which have been realised and others so far only proposed, include projective measurements
of qubits and Majorana devices for quantum computing, real-time measurements of mechanical motion
and detection of non-equilibrium temperature fluctuations. However, all of these experiments
must overcome the central challenge of fast readout: the large mismatch between the typical impedance
of quantum devices (set by the resistance quantum) and of transmission lines (set by the impedance
of free space). Here, we review the physical principles of radio-frequency reflectometry and its
close cousins, measurements of radio-frequency transmission and emission. We explain how to optimise
the speed and sensitivity of a radio-frequency measurement, and how to incorporate new tools such
as superconducting circuit elements and quantum-limited amplifiers into advanced radio-frequency
experiments. Our aim is three-fold: to introduce the readers to the technique, to review the advances
to date and to motivate new experiments in fast quantum device dynamics. Our intended audience includes
experimentalists in the field of quantum electronics who want to implement radio-frequency experiments
or improve them, together with physicists in related fields who want to understand how the most important
radio-frequency measurements work.

Despite recent experimental progress towards observing large zero-bias conductance peaks (ZBCP)
as signatures of Majorana modes, confusion remains about whether Majorana modes have been observed.
This is in part due to the theoretical prediction of fine-tuned trivial zero-bias peaks that occur
because of uncontrolled quantum dots or disorder potentials. While many aspects of the topological
phase can be somewhat fine-tuned because the topological phase space is often small, the quantized
height of ZBCPs associated with a Majorana mode is known to be robust at sufficiently low temperatures
even as the tunnel barrier is pinched off to vanishingly small normal-state conductance. In this
work, we study whether this counter-intuitive robustness of the ZBCP height can be used to distinguish
Majorana modes from non-topological ZBCPs. To this end, we introduce a dimensionless quality factor
F to quantify the robustness of the ZBCP height based on the range of normal-state conductance over
which the ZBCP height remains within a pre-specified range of quantization. By computing this quality
factor F together with the topological characteristics for a wide range of models and parameters,
we find that Majoranas are significantly more robust compared with non-topological ZBCPs in the
ideal low-temperature limit. Even at a temperature as high as the experimentally used 20 mK, we find
that we can set a threshold value of F~2 so that ZBCPs associated with a quality factor F>2 are likely
topological and F<<2 are topologically trivial. More precisely, the value of F is operationally
related to the degree of separation of the Majorana modes in the system although F uses only the experimentally
measured tunnel conductance properties. Finally, we discuss how the quality factor F measured
in a transport set-up can help estimate the quality of topological qubits made from Majorana modes.

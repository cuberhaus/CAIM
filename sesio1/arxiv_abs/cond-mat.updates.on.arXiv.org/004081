Monophasic and homogeneous Ni10Zr7 nanocrystalline alloy films were successfully grown at room
temperature by co-sputtering in an indigenously developed three-gun DC/RF magnetron sputtering
unit. The films could be produced with long-range crystallographic and chemical order in the alloy,
thus overcoming the widely acknowledged inherent proclivity of the glass forming Ni-Zr couple
towards amorphization. Crystallinity of these alloys is a desirable feature with regard to improved
efficacy in applications such as hydrogen storage, catalytic activity and nuclear reactor engineering,
to name a few. Thermal stability of this crystalline phase, being vital for transition to viable
applications, was investigated through systematic annealing of the alloy films at 473 K, 673 K and
923 K for various durations. While the films were stable at 473 K, the effect of annealing at 673 K was
to create segregation into nanocrystalline Ni (superparamagnetic) and amorphous Ni+Zr (non-magnetic)
phases. Detailed analyses of the physical and magnetic structures before and after annealing were
performed through several techniques effectual in analyzing stratified configurations and the
findings were all consistent with each other. Polarized neutron and X-ray reflectometry, grazing
incidence x-ray diffraction, time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy were used to gauge phase separation at nanometer length scales. SQUID based magnetometry
was used to investigate macroscopic magnetic properties. Simulated annealing performed on this
system using molecular dynamic calculations corroborated well with the experimental results.
This study provides a thorough understanding of the creation and thermal evolution of a crystalline
Ni-Zr alloy.

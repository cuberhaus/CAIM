Phase transitions in non-Hermitian systems are at the focus of cutting edge theoretical and experimental
research. On the one hand, parity-time- ($\cal PT$-) and anti-$\cal PT$-symmetric physics have
gained ever-growing interest, due to the existence of non-Hermitian spectral singularities called
exceptional points (EPs). On the other, topological and localization transitions in non-Hermitian
systems reveal new phenomena, e.g., the non-Hermitian skin effect and the absence of conventional
bulk-boundary correspondence. The great majority of previous studies exclusively focus on non-Hermitian
Hamiltonians, whose realization requires an {\it a priori} fine-tuned extended lattices to exhibit
topological and localization transition phenomena. In this work, we show how the non-Hermitian
localization phenomena can naturally emerge in the synthetic field moments space of zero-dimensional
bosonic anti-$\cal PT$ and $\cal PT$-symmetric quantum dimers. This offers an opportunity to simulate
localization transitions in low-dimensional systems, without the need to construct complex arrays
of, e.g., coupled cavities or waveguides. Indeed, the field moment equations of motion can describe
an equivalent (quasi-)particle moving in a one-dimensional (1D) synthetic lattice. This synthetic
field moments space can exhibit a nontrivial localization phenomena, such as non-Hermitian skin
effect, induced by the presence of highly-degenerate EPs. We demonstrate our results on the example
of an exactly solvable non-Hermitian 1D model, emerging in the moments space of an anti-$\cal PT$-symmetric
two-mode system. Our results can be directly verified in state-of-the-art optical setups, such
as superconducting circuits and toroidal resonators, by measuring photon moments or correlation
functions.

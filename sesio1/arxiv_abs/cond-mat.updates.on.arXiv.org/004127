Single crystals of La2Ni7 have been grown out of a binary, La-Ni melt. Temperature dependent, zero
magnetic field, specific heat, electrical resistivity, and low field magnetization measurements
indicate that there is a series of antiferromagnetic phase transitions at T1 = 61.0 \pm 0.2 K, T2 =
56.5 \pm 0.2 K and T3 = 42.2 \pm 0.2 K. The three specific heat anomalies found at these temperatures
qualitatively have very small entropy changes associated with them and the anisotropic M(H) data
saturate at ~ 0.12 {\mu}B/Ni; both observations strongly suggesting the AFM order is associated
with very small, itinerant, moments. Anisotropic, H||c and H{\perp}c, {\rho}(H) and M(H) isotherms
as well as constant field, {\rho}(T) and M(T) sweeps manifest signatures of multiple phase lines
and result in H-T phase diagrams that are clearly anisotropic. Analysis of M(T) and M(H) data allow
for the identification of the two lower temperature magnetically ordered states as antiferromagnetically
ordered, with the moments aligned along the crystallographic c-axis, and the higher temperature,
T2 < T < T1, state as having a finite ferromagnetic component. In addition, the metamagnetic transition
at low temperatures, for H applied along the crystallographic c-axis (H||c) appears to be a near
classic example of a spin-flop transition, resulting in a field stabilized antiferromagnetic
state with the moments ordered perpendicular to the c-axis. Although the small moment ordering,
and existence of multiple phase transitions in field and temperature, suggesting an energetic
proximity of these states, could foretell a degree of pressure sensitivity, our measurements of
R(T) for applied pressures up to 2.0 GPa indicate that there is very little pressure dependence of
T1, T2 and T3.

Using seven semiconductors/insulators with band gaps covering the range from 1 eV to 10 eV we systematically
explore the performance of two different variants of self-consistency associated with famous
Hedin's system of equations: the full self-consistency and the so called quasi-particle approximation
to it. The pros and cons of these two variants of self-consistency are sufficiently well documented
in literature for the simplest GW approximation to the Hedin's equations. Our study, therefore,
aims primarily at the level of theory beyond GW approximation, i.e. at the level of theory which includes
vertex corrections. Whereas quasi-particle self-consistency has certain advantages at GW level
(well known fact), the situation becomes quite different when vertex corrections are included.
In the variant with full self-consistency, vertex corrections (both for polarizability and for
self energy) systematically reduce the calculated band gaps making them closer to the experimental
values. In the variant with quasi-particle self-consistency, however, an inclusion of the same
diagrams has considerably larger effect and calculated band gaps become severely underestimated.
Different effect of vertex corrections in two variants of self-consistency can be related to the
Z-factor cancellation which plays positive role in quasi-particle self-consistency at GW level
of theory but appears to be destructive for the quasi-particle approximation when higher order
diagrams are included. Second result of our study is that we were able to reproduce the results obtained
with the Questaal code using our FlapwMBPT code when the same variant of self-consistency (quasi-particle)
and the same level of vertex corrections (for polarizability only, static approximation for screened
interaction, and Tamm-Dancoff approximation for the Bethe-Salpeter equation) are used.

Our studies evidence an anisotropic magnetic order below $T_N = 32$~K. Susceptibility data in small
fields of about 1~T reveal an antiferromagnetic (AFM) order for $H \perp c$, whereas for $H \parallel
c$ the data are reminiscent of a field-induced ferromagnetic (FM) structure. At low temperatures
and for $H \perp c$, the field-dependent magnetization and AC susceptibility data evidence a metamagnetic
transition at $H^+ = 5$~T, which is absent for $H \parallel c$. We assign this to a transition from
a planar cycloidal spin structure at low fields to a planar fan-like arrangement above $H^+$. A fully
FM polarized state is obtained above the saturation field of $H_{\perp S} = 23.7$~T at 2~K with a magnetization
of $M_s = 2.8$~$\mu_{\rm B}{\rm /Cr}$. For $H \parallel c$, $M(H)$ monotonously increases and saturates
at the same $M_s$ value at $H_{\parallel S} = 25.1$~T at 4.2~K. Above $T_N $, the magnetic susceptibility
and specific heat indicate signatures of two dimensional (2D) frustration related to the presence
of planar ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic exchange interactions. We found a pronounced nearly
isotropic maximum in both properties at about $T^* = 45$~K, which is a clear fingerprint of short-range
correlations and emergent spin fluctuations. Calculations based on a planar 2D Heisenberg model
support our experimental findings and suggest a predominant FM exchange among nearest and AFM exchange
among third-nearest neighbors. Only a minor contribution might be assigned to the antisymmetric
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction possible related to the non-centrosymmetric polar space
group $R3m$. Due to these competing interactions, the magnetism in AgCrSe$_{2}$, in contrast to
the oxygen based delafossites, can be tuned by relatively small, experimentally accessible, magnetic
fields, allowing us to establish the complete anisotropic magnetic $H-T$ phase diagram in detail.

A periodic array of topological spin textures, such as skyrmions and hedgehogs, is called the multiple-$Q$
spin texture, as it is represented by a superposition of multiple spin density waves. Depending
on the way of superposition, not only the magnetic but also the topological properties are modified,
leading to a variety of quantum transport and optical phenomena caused by the emergent electromagnetic
fields through the Berry phase. Among others, the phase degree of freedom of the superposed waves
is potentially important for such modifications, but its effect has not been fully elucidated thus
far. Here we perform systematic theoretical analyses of magnetic and topological properties of
the multiple-$Q$ spin textures with the phase degree of freedom. By introducing a hyperspace with
an additional dimension corresponding to the phase degree of freedom, we establish a generic framework
to deal with the phase shift in the multiple-$Q$ spin textures. Applying the framework to the two-dimensional
3$Q$ spin textures, we clarify the complete topological phase diagram while changing the phase
and magnetization, which depends on the types of the superposed waves. We also study the three-dimensional
4$Q$ spin textures and clarify even richer topological phase diagrams. In particular, we find novel
topological phase transitions associated with the previously unidentified Dirac strings on which
the hedgehogs and antihedgehogs cause pair creation and fusion. Moreover, we demonstrate that
phase shifts are caused by an external magnetic field in both 3$Q$ and 4$Q$ cases by analyzing the
numerical data in the previous studies. Our results illuminate the topological aspects of the skyrmion
and hedgehog lattices with the phase degree of freedom, which would be extended to other multiple-$Q$
textures and useful for the exploration of topologically nontrivial magnetic phases and exotic
quantum phenomena.

The extended quantum Rabi models make a significant contribution to understand the quantum nature
of the atom-light interaction. We transform two kinds of extended quantum Rabi model, anisotropic
Rabi model and asymmetric Rabi model, into rotating frame, and regard them as periodically driven
quantum systems. The analytical solutions of the quasi-energy spectrum as well as the Floquet modes
for both models are constructed by applying the Floquet theory and the high-frequency expansion,
which is applied to the non-stroboscopic dynamics of physical observables. For anisotropic Rabi
model, the quasi energy fits well with the numerical results in even the deep-strong coupling regime
if the counterrotating terms is small enough compared to the driving frequency. Avoided level crossing
occurs for quasi energy with the same parity, while the high frequency expansion fails to predict
this due to the conservation of the total excitation number. Furthermore, we present analytical
and numerical study of the long-time evolution of population and figure out the analytical method
is credible for the population dynamics. For asymmetric Rabi model, we find that the external bias
field which breaks the parity symmetry of total excitation number tends to cluster the upper and
lower branches into two bundles, and the detuning induced gap in the first temporal Brillouin zone
shows a quadratic dependence on the bias. The Fourier analysis is applied to extract the frequency
composition and the two-frequency driving behavior is revealed. Varying the bias strength will
change the equilibrium value of the oscillation, which shows how the bias competes with the detuning
and atom-field coupling in the driving dynamics. Both models prove that treating the Hamiltonian
in the rotating frame by Floquet theory gives an alternative tool in the study of interaction between
atom and light.

Ternary alloys of \textit{Ge-Sb-Te (GST)} have been extensively studied due to their unique ability
display a reversible change in their phase upon stimulation by optical pulses i.e amorphous \textit{(a-GST)}
to crystalline \textit{(c-GST)} and vice-versa. The two phases exhibit remarkably different
electrical and optical properties like conductivity, reflectivity, refractive index and optical
loss, this coupled with their high phase switching speeds, low power phase switching, large switching
cycles, large measurable optical and electrical contrast, and phase stability makes GST alloys
stand out from other phase change materials \textit{(PCM)}. GST alloys have already found extensive
use in optical disks and electronic memories due to their non-volatility and zero static power consumption,
but the precise mechanism of the phase change is not clearly understood. The phase change mechanism
has usually been attributed to the optical pulse, usually a high power short pulse laser, heating
up the \textit{c-GST} alloy to above its melting temperature (\textit{$T_m$}) after which, if
it is cooled rapidly enough to below the glass transition temperature (\textit{$T_g$}), the atoms
are fixed in place due to the drastic reduction in their mobility, resulting in a phase which exhibits
structure similar to a frozen liquid and lacks long range order i.e amorphous. If alternatively
the \textit{a-GST} is heated above \textit{$T_g$} with a intermediate power laser pulse for a significant
amount of time to induce nucleation, then this favours the shift back to the energetically favourable
crystalline phase. With the growing interest in next generation data storage technology for photonic
and neuromorphic computing, the research into understanding and improving the properties of GST
alloys has also been rekindled. In this term paper we hope to investigate and gain a deeper understanding

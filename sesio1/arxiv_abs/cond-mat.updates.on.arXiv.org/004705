Ever since the very first human-made knapped tools, the control of fracture propagation in brittle
materials has been a vector of technological development. Nowadays, a broad range of applications
relies on crack propagation control, from the mitigation of damages, e.g., from impacts in glass
screens or windshields, to industrial processes harnessing fracture to achieve clean cuts over
large distances. Yet, studying the fracture in real time is a challenging task, since cracks can
propagate up to a few km/s in materials that are often opaque. Here, we report on the in situ investigation
of cracks propagating at up to 2.5 km/s along a (001) plane of a silicon single crystal, using X-ray
diffraction megahertz imaging with intense and time-structured synchrotron radiation. The studied
system is based on the Smart Cut process, where a buried layer in a material (typically Si) is weakened
by micro-cracks and then used to drive a macroscopic crack (0.1 m) in a plane parallel to the surface
with minimal deviation (1 nm). The results we report here provide the first direct confirmation
that the shape of the crack front is not affected by the distribution of the micro-cracks, which had
been a postulate for previous studies based on post-fracture results. We further measured instantaneous
crack velocities over the centimeter-wide field-of-view, which had only been previously inferred
from sparse point measurements, and evidence the effect of local heating by the X-ray beam. Finally,
we also observed the post-crack movements of the separated wafer parts, which can be explained using
pneumatics and elasticity. Thus, this study provides a comprehensive view of controlled fracture
propagation in a crystalline material, paving the way for the in situ measurement of ultra-fast
strain field propagation.

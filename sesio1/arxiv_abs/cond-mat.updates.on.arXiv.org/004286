A real-time image reconstruction method for scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)
is proposed. The method uses the concept of integrated centre of mass (iCOM) and creates a live-updated
image based on diffraction patterns collected at each probe position during scanning. It is shown
that the method has similar characteristics to the traditional iCOM approach. However, by reformulating
the integration method, the reconstruction process can be divided into sub-units, with each unit
requiring only information from a single probe position, such that the resulting image can be updated
each time a new probe position is visited without storing any intermediate diffraction patterns.
As a certain position in the image is only influenced by its surrounding pixels in the immediate vicinity,
the image update provides interpretable images being build up while the scanning is being performed.
The results show clearer features at higher spatial frequency, such as atomic column positions.
It is also demonstrated that common post processing methods, such as a band pass filter, can be directly
integrated in the real time processing flow. By comparing with other reconstruction methods, it
is shown that the proposed method can produce high quality reconstructions with good noise robustness
at extremely low memory and computational requirements. We further present an efficient, interactive
open source implementation of the concept, compatible with frame-based, as well as event-based
camera/file types. The proposed method provides the attractive feature of immediate feedback
that microscope operators have become used to for e.g. conventional HAADF STEM imaging allowing
for rapid decision making and fine tuning to obtain the best possible images for beam sensitive samples
at the lowest possible dose.

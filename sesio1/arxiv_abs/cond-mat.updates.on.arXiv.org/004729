Co-assembly of inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) and nanostructured polymer matrix represents an
intricate interplay of enthalpic or entropic forces. Particle size largely affects the phase behavior
of the nanocomposite. Theoretical studies indicate that new morphologies would emerge when the
particles become comparable to the soft matrix's size, but this has rarely been supported experimentally.
By designing a multicomponent blend composed of NPs, block copolymer-based supramolecules, and
small molecules, a 3-D ordered lattice beyond the native BCP's morphology was recently reported
when the particle is larger than the microdomain of BCP. The blend can accommodate various formulation
variables. In this contribution, when the particle size equals the microdomain size, a symmetry-broken
phase appears in a narrow range of particle sizes and compositions, which we named the "train track"
structure. In this phase, the NPs aligned into a 3-D hexagonal lattice and packed asymmetrically
along the c axis, making the projection of the ac and the bc plane resemble train tracks. Computation
studies show that the broken symmetry reduces the polymer chain deformation and stabilizes the
metastable hexagonally perforated lamellar morphology. Given the mobility of the multicomponent
blend, the system shows a self-sorting behavior: segregating into two macroscopic phases with
different nanostructures based on only a few nanometers NP size differences. Smaller NPs form "train
track" morphology, while larger NPs form "simple hexagon" structure, where the NPs take a symmetric
hexagonal arrangement. Detailed structural evolution and simulation studies confirm the systematic-wide
cooperativity across different components, indicating the strong self-regulation of the multicomponent
system.

Heterogeneous diffusion with spatially changing diffusion coefficient arises in many experimental
systems like protein dynamics in the cell cytoplasm, mobility of cajal bodies and confined hard-sphere
fluids. Here, we showcase a simple model of heterogeneous diffusion where the diffusion coefficient
$D(x)$ varies in power-law way, i.e. $D(x) \sim |x|^{-\alpha}$ with the exponent $\alpha >-1$.
This model exhibits anomalous scaling of the mean squared displacement (MSD) of the form $\sim t^{\frac{2}{2+\alpha}}$
and weak ergodicity breaking in the sense that ensemble averaged and time averaged MSDs do not converge.
In this paper, we look at the extreme value statistics of this model and derive, for all $\alpha$,
the exact probability distributions of the maximum spatial displacement $M(t)$ and arg-maximum
$t_m(t)$ (i.e. the time at which this maximum is reached) till duration $t$. In the second part of
our paper, we analyze the statistical properties of the residence time $t_r(t)$ and the last-passage
time $t_{\ell}(t)$ and compute their distributions exactly for all values of $\alpha$. Our study
unravels that the heterogeneous version $(\alpha \neq 0)$ displays many rich and contrasting features
compared to that of the standard Brownian motion (SBm). For example, while for SBm $(\alpha =0)$,
the distributions of $t_m(t),~t_r(t)$ and $t_{\ell}(t)$ are all identical (\textit{\'{a} la}
``arcsine laws" due to L\'{e}vy), they turn out to be significantly different for non-zero $\alpha$.
Another interesting property of $t_r(t)$ is the existence of a critical $\alpha$ (which we denote
by $\alpha _c=-0.3182$) such that the distribution exhibits a local maximum at $t_r = t/2$ for $\alpha
< \alpha _c$ whereas it has minima at $t_r = t/2$ for $\alpha \geq \alpha _c$....

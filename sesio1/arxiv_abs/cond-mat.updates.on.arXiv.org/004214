The study particularly focuses on the effect of the Cr co-doping on the structural, optical and magnetic
properties of Zn0.99Fe0.01O. Zn0.99-xFe0.01CrxO (x =0, 0.01, 0.03 and 0.05) nanoparticles. Powder
x-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirms all the samples have hexagonal wurtzite structures.
The average crystallite size (D) and microstrain of the samples were calculated using the Williamson-Hall
relation and D was found to be 13 +- 1 nm for Zn0.99Fe0.01O. In Cr co-doped samples, D increase slightly
with Cr content and are given by 9 +- 1, 10 +- 1, and 11 +- 1 nm for the samples with x = 0.01, 0.03 and 0.05,
respectively; while the strain decreased with increase in Cr co-doping. Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) images of the samples indicate that particles are in the nano-regime and agglomerated.
Particle sizes are found to be 14 +- 1, 11 +- 1 and 12 +- 1 nm for Zn0.99-xFe0.01CrxO with x = 0, 0.03 and
0.05, respectively. The substitution of Fe3+ and Cr3+ at Zn2+ sites has an impact on the optical properties.
The band-gap decreases from 3.296 +- 0.002 eV to 3.258 +- 0.002 eV with increase of Cr concentration.
Photoluminescence (PL) of Zn0.96Fe0.01Cr0.03O revealed the presence of defects, the emission
peaks at 410 nm and 513 nm are attributed to Zn vacancies (VZn) and singly ionized oxygen vacancies,
respectively. The M(-H) curves of Zn0.99-xFe0.01CrxO (x = 0.03 and 0.05) measured at room temperature
using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) are found to be hysteretic, signifying room temperature
ferromagnetism (RTFM). Maximum saturation magnetization, 0.67 +- 0.01 emu.g-1, is observed in
Zn0.94Fe0.01Cr0.05O. The observed RTFM in Fe+Cr co-doped ZnO is explained by of bound magnetic
polaron (BMP) mechanism, the BMPs are formed by VZn and Vo^+ defects. This paper enhances the understanding
of the origin of RTFM in Fe+Cr co-doped ZnO nanoparticles.

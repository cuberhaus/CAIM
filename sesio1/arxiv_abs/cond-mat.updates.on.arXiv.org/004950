We present to the community a surface-definition problem, whose solution we consider to be critical
for the proper description of contacts between nominally flat surfaces [1,2]. In 2015, M\"user
and Dapp issued the Contact Mechanics Challenge, which provided complete topography data for a
fictional surface and asked theorists and modelers to compute the expected contact parameters
for such a surface. This effort was a success, but exposed one glaring flaw in the community's understanding
of the nature of contact: these models require as input a complete description of surface topography,
which is rarely or never available for real-world surfaces [3-6]. The present challenge is to experimentalists:
we will send you samples of two materials (one smoother and one rougher); you determine the surface
topography of these materials. We call on you to measure such surfaces however you wish, using contact-based
techniques, light scattering, microscopy, or other techniques. Examples of quantities of interest
are: root-mean-square (RMS) parameters; the power spectral density (PSD); or the autocorrelation
function (ACF). For the material, we have chosen chromium nitride, a wear- and corrosion-resistant
coating used in industrial applications including automotive components, cutting tools, and
die-casting. To participate, simply go to: https://contact.engineering/challenge to provide
your shipping address and other information, then samples will be shipped out to you. The only requirement
of participation is that your raw topography measurements are deposited on the free contact.engineering
web app to facilitate data sharing. The purpose of this challenge is for our community to move towards:
(a) better agreement on how to describe the multi-scale topography of experimental surfaces; and
(b) better understanding of how to apply the well-developed models and theories to real-world surfaces.

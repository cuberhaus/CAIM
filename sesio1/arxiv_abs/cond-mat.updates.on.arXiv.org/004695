Anyons in a topologically ordered phase can carry fractional quantum numbers with respect to the
symmetry group of the considered system, one example being the fractional charge of the quasiparticles
in the fractional quantum Hall effect. When such symmetry-fractionalized anyons condense, the
resulting phase must spontaneously break the symmetry and display a local order parameter. In this
paper, we study the phase diagram and anyon condensation transitions of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological
order perturbed by Ising interactions in the Toric Code. The interplay between the global Ising
symmetry and the lattice space group symmetries results in a non-trivial symmetry fractionalization
class for the anyons, and is shown to lead to two characteristically different symmetry-broken
phases. To understand the anyon condensation transitions, we use the recently introduced critical
torus energy spectrum technique to identify a line of emergent 2+1D XY* transitions ending at a fine-tuned
(Ising$^2$)* critical point. We provide numerical evidence for the occurrence of two symmetry
breaking patterns predicted by the specific symmetry fractionalization class of the anyons in
the explored phase diagram. In combination with quantum Monte Carlo simulations we measure unusually
large critical exponents for the scaling of the correlation function at the anyon condensation
transitions, and we identify lines of (weakly) first order transitions in the phase diagram. As
an important result, we discuss the phase diagram of a resulting 2+1D Ashkin-Teller model, where
we demonstrate that torus spectroscopy is capable of identifying emergent XY/O(2) critical behaviour,
thereby solving some longstanding open questions in the domain of the 3D Ashkin-Teller models.
To establish the generality of our results, we propose a field theoretical description which is
in excellent agreement with the numerical results.

In the quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) copper- and iron-based superconductors, the onset of
superconductivity is accompanied by a prominent peak in the magnetic spectrum at momenta close
to the wave-vector of the nearby antiferromagnetic state. Such a peak is well described in terms
of a spin resonance mode, i.e., a spin-1 exciton theoretically predicted for quasi-2D superconductors
with a sign-changing gap. The same theories, however, indicate that such a resonance mode should
be absent in a three-dimensional (3D) system with a spherical Fermi surface. This raises the question
of the fate of the spin resonance mode in layered unconventional superconductors that are not strongly
anisotropic, such as certain heavy-fermion compounds and potentially the newly discovered nickelate
superconductor NdNiO$_2$. Here, we use the random-phase-approximation to calculate the dynamical
spin susceptibility of 3D superconductors with a $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave gap symmetry and corrugated
cylindrical-like Fermi surfaces. By varying the out-of-plane hopping anisotropy $t_z/t$, we
demonstrate that the appearance of a spin resonance mode is determined by the topology of the hot
lines -- i.e. lines on the Fermi surface that are connected by the magnetic wave-vector. For an in-plane
antiferromagnetic wave-vector, the hot lines undergo a topological transition from open lines
to closed loops at a critical $t_z/t$ value. The closed hot lines cross the nodal superconducting
lines, making the spin resonance mode overdamped and incoherent. In contrast, for an out-of-plane
antiferromagnetic wave-vector, the hot lines remain open and the spin resonance mode remains sharp.
We discuss the experimental implications of our results for the out-of-plane dispersion of the
spin resonance mode and, more generally, for inelastic neutron scattering experiments on unconventional
superconductors.

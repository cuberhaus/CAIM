Here we explore the use of scanning diffraction electron microscopy (4D-STEM) coupled with electron
atomic pair distribution function analysis (ePDF) to understand the local structure and chemistry
in a complex multicomponent system, a hot rolled, Ni-encapsulated, Zr$_{65}$Cu$_{17.5}$Ni$_{10}$Al$_{7.5}$
bulk metallic glass, as a function of position with 3~nm spatial resolution. We show that it is possible
to gain insight into the chemistry and chemical clustering/ordering tendency in different regions
of the sample, including in the vicinity of nano-scale crystallites that are identified from virtual
dark-field images and in heavily deformed regions at the edge of the BMG. This gives critical insights
into the formation mechanism of these features. Unsupervised machine learning was used to extract
partial PDFs from the material, modeled as quasi-binary alloy, and map them in space allowing key
insights not only into the local average composition but also any chemical short-range ordering
tendency in that region of the sample. The experiments are straightforward and rapid and unlike
spectroscopic measurements don't require energy filters on the instrument. We spatially map different
quantities of interest (QoI's), defined as scalars that can be computed directly from an analysis
of the data such as positions and widths of PDF peaks or parameters refined from fits to the patterns,
and have developed a flexible and rapid data analysis software framework that allows experimenters
to rapidly explore images of the sample on the basis of different QoI's. The power and flexibility
of this approach is explored and described in detail. Sicne we are getting spatially resolved images
of the nanoscale structure obtained from PDFs we call this approach scanning nano-structure electron
microscopy (SNEM). We believe that it will be powerful and useful extension of current 4D-STEM methods.

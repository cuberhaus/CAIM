Liquids realize a highly complex state of matter in which strong competing kinetic and interaction
effects come to life. As such, liquids are more challenging to understand than either gases or solids
generally. In weakly interacting gases, the kinetic effects dominate. By contrast, low temperature
solids typically feature far smaller fluctuations about their ground state. Notwithstanding
their complexity, with the exception of quantum fluids and supercooled liquids, various aspects
of common liquid dynamics such as their dynamic viscosity are often assumed to be given by rather
simple, Arrhenius-type, activated forms with nearly constant (i.e., temperature independent)
energy barriers. In this work, we analyze experimentally measured viscosities of numerous liquids
far above their equilibrium melting temperature to see how well this assumption fares. We find,
for the investigated liquids, marked deviations from simple activated dynamics. Even far above
their equilibrium melting temperatures, as the temperature drops, the viscosity of these liquids
increases more strongly than predicted by activated dynamics dominated by a single uniform energy
barrier. For metallic fluids, the scale of the prefactors of the best Arrhenius fits for the viscosity
is typically consistent with that given by the product $nh$ with $n$ the number density and $h$ Planck's
constant. In various fluids that we examined, $nh$ constitutes a lower bound scale on the viscosity.
We find that a scaling of the temperature axis (complementing that of the viscosity) leads to a partial
collapse of the temperature dependent viscosities of different fluids; such a scaling allows for
a functional dependence of the viscosity on temperature that includes yet is far more general than
activated Arrhenius form alone. We speculate on relations between non-Arrhenius dynamics and
thermodynamic observables.

Synthetic dimensions have garnered widespread interest for implementing high dimensional classical
and quantum dynamics on lower dimensional geometries. Synthetic frequency dimensions, in particular,
have been used to experimentally realize a plethora of bulk physics effects, such as effective gauge
potentials, nontrivial Hermitian as well as non-Hermitian topology, spin-momentum locking,
complex long-range coupling, unidirectional frequency conversion, and four-dimensional lattices.
However, in synthetic frequency dimensions there has not been any demonstration of boundary effects
which are of paramount importance in topological physics due to the bulk edge correspondence, since
systems exhibiting synthetic frequency dimensions do not support well-defined sharp boundaries.
Here we theoretically elucidate a method to construct boundaries in the synthetic frequency dimension
of dynamically modulated ring resonators by strongly coupling it to an auxiliary ring, and provide
an experimental demonstration of this method. We experimentally explore various physics effects
associated with the creation of such boundaries in the synthetic frequency dimension, including
confinement of the spectrum of light, the discretization of the band structure, and the interaction
of such boundaries with the topologically protected one-way chiral modes in a quantum Hall ladder.
The incorporation of boundaries allows us to observe topologically robust transport of light along
the frequency axis, which shows that the frequency of light can be controlled through topological
concepts. Our demonstration of such sharp boundaries fundamentally expands the capability of
exploring topological physics, and is also of importance for other applications such as classical
and quantum information processing in synthetic frequency dimensions.

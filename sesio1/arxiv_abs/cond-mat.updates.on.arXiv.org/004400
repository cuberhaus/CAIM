The enhancement of interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction (DMI) in magnetic multilayers
results in the stabilization of topological spin textures like chiral domain walls and skyrmions.
Here we report on the evaluation of interface-driven magnetic interactions in a uniquely designed
multilayer where each magnetic layer of two AFM coupled sublattices of 3d and 4f moments is sandwiched
between the layers of \beta-tungsten and holmium whose spin Hall angles are large but opposite in
sign. The atomic and magnetic periodicity of these multilayers is established by polarized neutron
reflectivity measurements and the presence of a labyrinth domain spin texture of zero remanence
with x-ray photoelectron microscopy. Measurements of the Hall resistivity (\rho_{xy}(T, H))
together with static magnetization (M(T,H)) over a broad range of temperature (T) and magnetic
field (H) indicate impending compensation between 3d and 4f sublattices at T>350 K. These multilayers
are characterized by a small (0.04 %) but positive magnetoresistance indicative of interface enhance
scattering and a large (40 n\Omega.m) and negative anomalous \rho_{xy}(T,H) which results from
a parallel alignment of 4f moments with the external magnetic field. No distinct scaling is seen
between \rho_{xy}(T,H), \rho_{xx}(T, H) and M(T,H) at temperatures above 200K where the magnetization
develops out-of-plane anisotropy. The field scans of \rho_{xy} at T>200K show a distinct cusp in
the vicinity of magnetic saturation. These Hall data have been analyzed in the framework of a model
where a distinct topological contribution to \rho_{xy} rides over the anomalous Hall resistivities
of the 3d and 4f magnetic sublattices. It is suggested that this apparent topological effect results
from an interfacial DMI and dominates \rho_{xy}(T,H) in the temperature regime where the 3d and
4f lattices are nearly compensated.

Two-dimensional (2D) layered lead iodide (PbI2) is an important precursor and common residual
species during the synthesis of lead-halide perovskites. There currently exist some debates and
uncertainties about the effect of excess PbI2 on the efficiency and stability of the solar cell with
respect to its energy alignment and energetics of defects. Herein, by applying the first-principles
calculations, we investigate the energetics, changes of work function and the defective levels
associated with the iodine vacancy (VI) and interstitial iodine (II) defects of monolayer PbI2
(ML-PbI2). We find that the PbI2 has a very low formation energy of VI of 0.77 and 0.19 eV for dilute
and high concentration, respectively, reflecting coalescence tendency of isolated VI, much lower
than that of vacancies in other 2D materials like phosphorene. Similar to VI, a low formation energy
of II of 0.65 eV is found, implying a high population of such defects. Both defects generate in-gap
defective levels which are mainly due to the unsaturated chemical bonds of p-orbitals of exposed
Pb or inserted I. Such rich defective levels allow the VI and II as the reservoir or sinks of electron/hole
carriers in PbI2. Our results suggest that the remnant PbI2 in perovskite MAPbI3 (or FAPbI3) would
play dual opposite roles in affecting the efficiency of the perovskite: (1) Forming Schottky-type
interface with MAPbI3 (or FAPbI3) in which the built-in potential would facilitate the electron-hole
separation and prolong the carrier lifetime; (2) Acting as the recombination centers due to the
deep defective levels. To promote the efficiency by the Schottky effect, our work reveals that the
II defect is favored, and to reduce the recombination centers the VI defect should be suppressed.
Our results shall be beneficial in improving strategies for the related optoelectronics applications.

Hyperbolic lattices are a revolutionary platform for tabletop simulations of holography and quantum
physics in curved space and facilitate efficient quantum error correcting codes. Their underlying
geometry is non-Euclidean, and the absence of Bloch's theorem precludes the straightforward application
of the often indispensable energy band theory to study model Hamiltonians on hyperbolic lattices.
Motivated by recent insights into hyperbolic band theory, we initiate a crystallography of hyperbolic
lattices. We show that many hyperbolic lattices feature a hidden crystal structure characterized
by unit cells, hyperbolic Bravais lattices, and associated symmetry groups. Using the mathematical
framework of higher-genus Riemann surfaces and Fuchsian groups, we derive, for the first time,
a list of example hyperbolic $\{p,q\}$ lattices and their hyperbolic Bravais lattices, including
five infinite families and several graphs relevant for experiments in circuit quantum electrodynamics
and topolectrical circuits. This dramatically simplifies the computation of energy spectra of
tight-binding Hamiltonians on hyperbolic lattices, from exact diagonalization on the graph to
solving a finite set of equations in terms of irreducible representations. The significance of
this achievement needs to be compared to the all-important role played by conventional Euclidean
crystallography in the study of solids. We exemplify the high potential of this approach by constructing
and diagonalizing finite-dimensional Bloch wave Hamiltonians. Our work lays the foundation for
generalizing some of the most powerful concepts of solid state physics, crystal momentum and Brillouin
zone, to the emerging field of hyperbolic lattices and tabletop simulations of gravitational theories,
and reveals the connections to concepts from topology and algebraic geometry.

The magnon-phonon coupling has received growing attention in recent years due to its central role
in spin caloritronics and the emerging field of acoustic spintronics. At resonance, this magnetoelastic
interaction drives the formation of magnon polarons, which underpin exotic phenomena such as magnonic
heat currents and phononic spin, but has with a few recent exceptions only been investigated using
mesoscopic spin-lattice models. Motivated to integrate the magnon-phonon coupling into first-principle
many-body electronic structure theory, we set up to derive the non-relativistic exchange-contribution,
which is more subtle than the spin-orbit contribution, using Schwinger's method of functional
derivatives. To avoid having to solve the famous Hedin-Baym equations self-consistently, the
phonons are treated as a perturbation to the electronic structure. A formalism is developed around
the idea of imposing crossing symmetry on the interaction, in order to treat charge and spin on equal
footing. By an iterative scheme, we find that the spin-flip component of the ${\mathit collective}$
four-point interaction, $\mathcal{V}$, which is used to calculate the magnon spectrum, contains
a first-order "screened T matrix" part and an arguably more important second-order part, which
in the limit of local spins describes the same processes of phonon emission and absorption as obtained
from phenomenological magnetoelastic models. Here, the "order" refers to the ${\mathit screened}$
${\mathit collective}$ four-point interaction, $\mathcal{W}$ - the crossing-symmetric analog
of Hedin's $W$. Proof-of-principle model calculations are performed at varying temperatures
for the isotropic magnon spectrum in three dimensions in the presence of a flat optical phonon branch.

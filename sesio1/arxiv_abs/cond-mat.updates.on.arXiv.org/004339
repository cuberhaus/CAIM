We report on magnetoconductance measurements through a weakly coupled quantum dot, containing
roughly 900 electrons, in a wide magnetic field range from 0 T to 12 T. We find modulations of the conductance
resonances in the quantum Hall regime for higher integer filling factors $6> \nu_\mathrm{dot}
> 2$, in addition to modulations at $2> \nu_\mathrm{dot} > 1$ and at fractional filling factors $\nu_\mathrm{dot}
\gtrsim 2/3$, $1/3$. Depending on the internal filling factor, edge reconstruction inside the
quantum dot leads to the formation of multiple concentric compressible regions, which contain
discrete charge and are separated by incompressible rings. Quasiparticle tunneling between different
compressible regions results in magnetic-field-(pseudo)-periodic modulations of the Coulomb
resonances with different periodicities, additional super-periodicity or non-periodic features.
The evolution of the period in magnetic field indicates cyclic depopulation of the inner compressible
regions close to integer filing factors. We study the temperature dependence of the conductance
resonances for different magnetic fields. While at low fields, the resonance amplitude decays
inversely with temperature, corresponding to single-level transport, the temperature dependence
of the amplitude evolves continuously into a linearly increasing behavior for dot filling factor
$2> \nu_\mathrm{dot} > 1$. This coincides with a reduction of the charging energy by approximately
a factor of 2 in the same regime. At zero magnetic field, the temperature dependence differs for individual
resonances, and is found to depend on the closeness to quantum dot states that couple strongly to
the leads. The presented experiments complement and extend previous results on internal rearrangements
of quasiparticles for weakly coupled quantum dots in magnetic field.

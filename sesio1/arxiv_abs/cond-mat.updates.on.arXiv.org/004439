High-quality single crystals of KCo$_2$As$_2$ with the body-centered tetragonal ThCr$_2$Si$_2$
structure were grown using KAs self flux. Structural, magnetic, thermal, and electrical transport
were investigated. No clear evidence for any phase transitions was found in the temperature range
2 to 300 K. The in-plane electrical resistivity $\rho$ versus temperature $T$ is highly unusual,
showing a $T^4$ behavior below 30 K and an anomalous positive curvature up to 300 K which is different
from the linear behavior expected from the Bloch-Gr\"uneisen theory for electron scattering by
acoustic phonons. This positive curvature has been previously observed in the in-plane resistivity
of high-conductivity layered delafossites such as PdCoO$_2$ and PtCoO$_2$. The in-plane $\rho(T\to0)
= 0.36~\mu\Omega$ cm of KCo$_2$As$_2$ is exceptionally small for this class of compounds. The material
also exhibits a nearly linear magnetoresistance at low $T$ which attains a value of about 40% at $T=2$K
and magnetic field $H= 80$ kOe. The magnetic susceptibility $\chi$ of KCo$_2$As$_2$ is isotropic
and about an order of magnitude smaller than the values for the related compounds SrCo$_2$As$_2$
and BaCo$_2$As$_2$. The $\chi$ increases above 100 K which is found from our first-principles calculations
to arise from a sharp peak in the electronic density of states just above the Fermi energy $E_{\rm
F}$. Heat capacity $C_{\rm p}(T)$ data at low $T$ yield an electronic density of states $N(E_{\rm
F})$ that is about 36% larger than predicted by the first-principles theory. The $C_{\rm p}(T)$
data near room temperature suggest the presence of excited optic vibration modes which may also
be the source of the positive curvature in $\rho(T)$. Our results show that KCo$_2$As$_2$ provides
a new avenue for investigating the physics of high-purity metals.

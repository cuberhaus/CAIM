The combination of piezoelectricity with nontrivial topological insulating phase in two-dimensional
(2D) systems, namely piezoelectric quantum spin Hall insulator (PQSHI), is intriguing for exploring
novel topological states toward the development of high-speed and dissipationless electronic
devices. In this work, we predict a PQSHI Janus monolayer VCClBr constructed from $\mathrm{VCCl_2}$,
which is dynamically, mechanically and thermally stable. In the absence of spin orbital coupling
(SOC), VCClBr is a narrow gap semiconductor with gap value of 57 meV, which is different from Dirac
semimetal $\mathrm{VCCl_2}$. The gap of VCClBr is due to built-in electric field caused by asymmetrical
upper and lower atomic layers, which is further confirmed by external-electric-field induced
gap in $\mathrm{VCCl_2}$. When including SOC, the gap of VCClBr is improved to 76 meV, which is larger
than the thermal energy of room temperature (25 meV). The VCClBr is a 2D topological insulator (TI),
which is confirmed by $Z_2$ topological invariant and nontrivial one-dimensional edge states.
It is proved that the nontrivial topological properties of VCClBr are robust against strain (biaxial
and uniaxial cases) and external electric field. Due to broken horizontal mirror symmetry, only
out-of-plane piezoelectric response can be observed, when biaxial or uniaxial in-plane strain
is applied. The predicted piezoelectric strain coefficients $d_{31}$ and $d_{32}$ are -0.425
pm/V and -0.219 pm/V, which are higher than or compared with ones of many 2D materials. Finally, another
two Janus monolayer VCFBr and VCFCl (dynamically unstable) are constructed, and they are still
PQSHIs. Moreover, their $d_{31}$ and $d_{32}$ are higher than ones of VCClBr, and the $d_{31}$ (absolute
value) of VCFBr is larger than one.

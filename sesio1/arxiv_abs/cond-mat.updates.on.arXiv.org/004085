The "band representation", formulated by Zak in the 80's, is widely used in recent studies of topological
phase of material. However, either the basis of band representation contains an error in its definition
or the transformation properties employed is missing phase terms. This manuscript present a clear
definition of the basis and an alternative derivation of analytical transformation properties
of the band representation. It identifies explicitly what occurs at high symmetry point on the surface
of Brillouin zone and allows decomposition of band representation into irreducible representations
of the space group anywhere in the representation domain of the Brillouin zone. Two different Fourier
transform conventions in defining the band representation induced from the same localised Wannier
functions are discussed and identified as related by a simple gauge transformation. The tight binding
band representation are used as basis in deriving the tight binding Hamiltonian using group theoretical
technique. With the analytical tools afforded by the representation matrices of the band representations,
a clear methodology is developed to obtain band connectivity in the representation domain and establish
which does not have an atomic limit. Elementary band representations is shown to be fully connected
in the atomic limit. In particular, the band representation induced from spin-ful ${\rm p}_z$ orbital
on Wyckoff position 2c of honeycomb lattice has a connectivity with atomic limit and the topological
nature of the band in graphene can arises from such connection and spin orbit interaction induced
gap at K point. Combined with symmetry compliant tight binding Hamiltonian, one can examine the
homeomorphic transformation of bands induced by changes in the parameters in the model and establish
if band inversion has occurred.

Many complex fluids can be described by continuum hydrodynamic field equations, to which noise
must be added in order to capture thermal fluctuations. In almost all cases, the resulting coarse-grained
stochastic partial differential equations carry a short-scale cutoff -- which is also reflected
in numerical discretisation schemes. We draw together our recent findings concerning the construction
of such schemes and the interpretation of their continuum limits, focusing for simplicity on models
with a purely diffusive scalar field, such as `Model B' which describes phase separation in binary
fluid mixtures. We address the requirement that the steady state entropy production rate (EPR)
must vanish for any stochastic hydrodynamic model in thermal equilibrium. Only if this is achieved
can the given discretisation scheme be relied upon to correctly calculate the nonvanishing EPR
for `active field theories' in which new terms are deliberately added to the fluctuating hydrodynamic
equations that break detailed balance. To compute the correct probabilities of forward and time-reversed
paths (whose ratio determines the EPR) we must make a careful treatment of so-called `spurious drift'
and other closely related terms that depend on the discretisation scheme. We show that such subtleties
can arise not only in the temporal discretisation (as is well documented for stochastic ODEs with
multiplicative noise) but also from spatial discretisation, even when noise is additive, as most
active field theories assume. We then review how such noise can become multiplicative, via off-diagonal
couplings to additional fields that encode thermodynamically the underlying chemical processes
responsible for activity. In this case the spurious drift terms need careful accounting, not just
to evaluate correctly the EPR, but also to numerically implement the Langevin dynamics itself.

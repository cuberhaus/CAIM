We explore a phenomenological phase diagram for the magnetic helical state with 90$^{\circ}$ turn
angle between neighboring spins in the external magnetic field. Such state is formed by the Eu spin
layers in the superconducting iron arsenide RbEuFe$_{4}$As$_{4}$. The peculiarity of this spin
configuration is that it is not realized in the standard Heisenberg model with bilinear exchange
interactions. A minimum model allowing for such a state requires the biquadratic nearest-neighbor
interaction term. In addition, in tetragonal materials the 90$^\circ$ helix state may be stabilized
by the in-plane four-fold anisotropy term, which also fixes helix orientation with respect to the
crystal lattice. Such a system has a very rich behavior in the external magnetic field. The magnetic
field induces the metamagnetic transition to the double-periodic state with the moment angles
($\alpha$, $\alpha$, $-\alpha$, $-\alpha$) with respect to the field for the four subsequent spins.
The transition field to this state from the deformed helix is determined by the strength of biquadratic
interaction. The transition is second order for small biquadratic coupling and becomes first order
when this coupling exceeds the critical value. On the other hand, the aligned state at high magnetic
field becomes unstable with respect to formation of incommensurate fan state which transforms
into the double-periodic state with decreasing magnetic field. The range of this incommensurate
state near the saturation field is proportional to square of the biquadratic coupling. In addition,
when the magnetic field is applied along one of four the equilibrium moment directions, the deformed
helix state experience the first-order rotation transition at the field determined by the four-fold
anisotropy. rotation transition at the field determined by the four-fold anisotropy.

Spectroscopic and interferometric measurements complement each other in extracting the fundamental
properties of quantum many-body systems. While spectroscopy provides precise measurements of
equilibrated energies, interferometry can elucidate the dynamical evolution of the system. For
an impurity immersed in a bosonic medium, both are equally important for understanding the quasiparticle
physics of the Bose polaron. Here, we compare the interferometric and spectroscopic timescales
to the underlying dynamical regimes of the impurity dynamics and the polaron lifetime, highlighting
the capability of the interferometric approach to clearly resolve polaron dynamics. In particular,
interferometric measurements of the coherence amplitude at strong interactions reveal faster
quantum dynamics at large repulsive interaction strengths than at unitarity. These observations
are in excellent agreement with a short-time theoretical prediction including both the continuum
and the attractive polaron branch. For longer times, qualitative agreement with a many-body theoretical
prediction which includes both branches is obtained. Moreover, the polaron energy is extracted
from interferometric measurements of the observed phase velocity in agreement with previous spectroscopic
results from weak to strong attractive interactions. Finally, the phase evolution allows for the
measurement of an energetic equilibration timescale, describing the initial approach of the phase
velocity to the polaron energy. Theoretically, this is shown to lie within the regime of universal
dynamics revealing a fast initial evolution towards the formation of polarons. Our results give
a comprehensive picture of the many-body physics governing the Bose polaron and thus validates
the quasiparticle framework for further studies.

In spontaneous collapse models, the wave function collapse is explained as an objective process
governed by a stochastic differential equation which is a modification of Schr\"{o}dinger equation.
In this paper, we develop an action formulation of stochastic dynamics in the Hilbert space. In this
formulation, the quantum theory of random unitary evolution is easily reconciled with special
relativity. We generalize the Wiener process and define a scalar random field which keeps invariant
under Lorentz transformations. By adding to the action of QFT a coupling term between random and
quantum fields, we obtain a random action which has the statistical spacetime translation and Lorentz
symmetries. Quantization of the theory results in a Lorentz-invariant dynamical equation of state
vector. We derive the path integral formula of $S$-matrix, and then develop a diagrammatic technique
for calculation. We find the diagrammatic rules for both the stochastic free field theory and $\phi^4$-theory.
The Lorentz invariance of random $S$-matrix is proved. We then develop a diagrammatic technique
for calculating the density matrix of final quantum states after scattering. Without interaction,
we obtain the $S$-matrix and density matrix. In the presence of interaction, we prove a relation
between the density matrices of stochastic and conventional $\phi^4$-theory. Our formalism leads
to an ultraviolet divergence, which can be canceled by renormalizing the coupling strength to random
field even in the presence of interaction. With a linear coupling to quantum field, the random field
excites particles out of vacuum, driving the universe towards an infinite-temperature state.
The number of excited particles has Poisson distribution. Collision between particles is not affected
by random field. But the signals of colliding particles are gradually covered by the background
excitations caused by random field.

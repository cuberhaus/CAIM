Discrete time crystals (DTCs) refer to a novel many-body steady state that spontaneously breaks
the discrete time-translational symmetry in a periodically-driven quantum system. Here, we study
DTCs in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) bouncing resonantly on an oscillating mirror, using a
two-mode model derived from a standard quantum field theory. We investigate the validity of this
model and apply it to study the long-time behavior of our system. A wide variety of initial states
based on two Wannier modes are considered. We find that in previous studies the investigated phenomena
in the evolution time-window ($\lessapprox$2000 driving periods) are actually "short-time"
transient behavior though DTC formation signaled by the sub-harmonic responses is still shown
if the inter-boson interaction is strong enough. After a much longer (about 20 times) evolution
time, initial states with no "long-range" correlations relax to a steady state, where time-symmetry
breaking can be unambiguously defined. Quantum revivals also eventually occur. This long-time
behavior can be understood via the many-body Floquet quasi-eigenenergy spectrum of the two-mode
model. A symmetry-breaking edge for DTC formation appears in the spectrum for strong enough interaction,
where all quasi-eigenstates below the edge are symmetry-breaking while those above the edge are
symmetric. The late-time steady state's time-translational symmetry depends solely on whether
the initial energy is above or below the symmetry-breaking edge. A phase diagram showing regions
of symmetry-broken and symmetric phases for differing initial energies and interaction strengths
is presented. We find that according to this two-mode model, the discrete time crystal survives
for times out to at least 250,000 driving periods.

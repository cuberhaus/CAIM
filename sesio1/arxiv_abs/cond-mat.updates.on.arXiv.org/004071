The magnetic relaxation characteristics are investigated in the two-dimensional ($l^{}_x\times
l^{}_y$) assembly of nanoparticles as a function of out-of-plane positional disorder strength
$\Delta(\%)$ using numerical simulations. Such defects are redundantly observed in experimentally
fabricated nanostructures, resulting in unusual magnetization dynamics. The magnetization
decays exponentially for small and negligible dipolar interaction strength $h^{}_d\leq0.2$.
In such a case, the magnetization relaxation does not depend on $\Delta$ and aspect ratio $A^{}_r=l^{}_y/l^{}_x$,
as expected. In square-like MNPs ensembles and perfectly ordered system ($\Delta(\%)=0$), the
magnetization relaxes rapidly with an increase in $h^{}_d$. Consequently, the effective N\'eel
relaxation time $\tau^{}_N$ decreases with $h^{}_d$. The dipolar interaction of sufficient strength
promotes antiferromagnetic coupling in such a system, resulting in rapid magnetization decay.
Remarkably, the out-of-plane disorder instigates the magnetic moment to interact ferromagnetically
in the presence of large $h^{}_d$, even in the square-like assembly of MNPs. As a result, magnetization
relaxation slows down, resulting in a monotonous increase of $\tau^{}_N$ with an increase in $\Delta$
and $h^{}_d$ in such cases. Notably, there is a prolonged magnetization decay in the highly anisotropic
system with large $h^{}_d$. The dipolar interaction induces ferromagnetic coupling along the
long axis of the system in such cases. Therefore, the magnetization ceases to relax as a function
of time for large $h^{}_d$, irrespective of disorder strength $\Delta(\%)$. The present work could
provide a concrete theoretical basis to explain the unexpected relaxation behaviour observed
in experiments. These results are also beneficial in digital data storage and spintronics based
applications where such nanostructures are extensively used.

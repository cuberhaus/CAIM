When a fluid is subject to an external field, as is the case near an interface or under spatial confinement,
then the density becomes spatially inhomogeneous. Although the one-body density provides much
useful information, a higher level of resolution is provided by the two-body correlations. These
give a statistical description of the internal microstructure of the fluid and enable calculation
of the average interparticle force, which plays an essential role in determining both the equilibrium
and dynamic properties of interacting fluids. We present a theoretical framework for the description
of inhomogeneous (classical) many-body systems, based explicitly on the two-body correlation
functions. By consideration of local Noether-invariance against spatial distortion of the system
we demonstrate the fundamental status of the Yvon-Born-Green (YBG) equation as a local force-balance
within the fluid. Using the inhomogeneous Ornstein-Zernike equation we show that the two-body
correlations are density functionals and, thus, that the average interparticle force entering
the YBG equation is also a functional of the one-body density. The force-based theory we develop
provides an alternative to standard density functional theory for the study of inhomogeneous systems
both in- and out-of-equilibrium. We compare force-based density profiles to the results of the
standard potential-based (dynamical) density functional theory. In equilibrium, we confirm
both analytically and numerically that the standard approach yields profiles that are consistent
with the compressibility pressure, whereas the force-density functional gives profiles consistent
with the virial pressure. The structure of the theory offers deep insights into the nature of correlation
in dense and inhomogeneous systems.

Step pattern stability of the vicinal surfaces during growth was analyzed using various surface
kinetic models. It was shown that standard analysis of the vicinal surfaces provides no indication
on the possible step coalescence and therefore could not be used to elucidate macrostep creation
during growth. A scenario of the instability, leading go macrostep creation was based on the dynamics
of the step train. The critical is step motion at the rear of the train which leads to double and multiple
step creation. The condition is that the step density ratio in and out of the train lower than 2 prevents
double step formation irrespective of the kinetics. For higher step density ratio low density of
the step promotes single step stability. Fast step kinetics from lower terrace stabilizes the single
steps slow (high barrier) is promoting step coalescence. The incorporation kinetics from upper
terrace role is close to neutral. The creation of double step creates slow the step in front to accelerate
and catch the previous double step while those behind catch up the double step creating multistep
structure. The multistep are not mobile as the alimentation leads to emission of single step which
moves forward. The final structure consist of macrosteps and superterraces with the number of single
steps moving forward. Thus the single step motion is essential crystal growth mode despite the presence
of the macrosteps. The macrostep are prone to creation of the overhangs which results from surface
dynamics coupling to impingement from the mother phase. The angular preferential access of the
bulk material to the macrostep edge, leads to diffusive instability. Therefore it is expected that
harmful influence of the macrosteps by creation of inclusions and dislocation is stronger during
growth from the liquid phase.

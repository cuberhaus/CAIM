Within the last decade, experimentalists have demonstrated their impressive ability to control
mechanical modes within mesoscopic objects down to the quantum level: it is now possible to create
mechanical Fock states, to entangle mechanical modes from distinct objects, store quantum information
or transfer it from one quantum bit to another, among the many possibilities found in today's literature.
Indeed mechanics is quantum, very much like spins or electromagnetic degrees of freedom. And all
of this is in particular referred to as a new engineering resource for quantum technologies. But
there is also much more beyond this utilitarian aspect: invoking the original discussions of Braginsky
and Caves where a quantum oscillator is thought of as a quantum detector for a classical field, namely
a gravitational wave, it is also a unique sensing capability for quantum fields. The subject of study
is then the baths to which the mechanical mode is coupled to, let them be known or unknown in nature.
This Letter is about this new potentiality, that addresses stochastic thermodynamics, potentially
down to its quantum version, the search for a fundamental underlying (random) field postulated
in recent theories that can be affiliated to the class of the Wave-function Collapse models, and
more generally open questions of Condensed Matter like the actual nature of the elusive (and ubiquitous)
Two-Level Systems present within all mechanical objects. But such research turns out to be much
more demanding than the usage of a few quantum mechanical modes: all the known baths have to be identified,
experiments have to be conducted in-equilibrium, and the word "mechanics" needs to be justified
by a real ability to move substantially the centre-of-mass when a proper drive tone is applied to
the system.

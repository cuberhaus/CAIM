The distribution of shortest path lengths (DSPL) of random networks provides useful information
on their large scale structure. In the special case of random regular graphs (RRGs), which consist
of $N$ nodes of degree $c \ge 3$, the DSPL, denoted by $P(L=\ell)$, follows a discrete Gompertz distribution.
Using the discrete Laplace transform we derive a closed-form expression for the moment generating
function of the DSPL of RRGs. From the moment generating function we obtain closed-form expressions
for the mean and variance of the DSPL. More specifically, we find that the mean distance between pairs
of distinct nodes is given by $\langle L \rangle=\frac{\ln N}{\ln (c-1)} + \frac{1}{2}- \frac{
\ln c - \ln (c-2) +\gamma}{\ln (c-1)} + \mathcal{O} \left( \frac{\ln N}{N} \right)$, where $\gamma$
is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. While the leading term is known, this result includes a novel
correction term, which yields very good agreement with the results obtained from direct numerical
evaluation of $\langle L \rangle$ via the tail-sum formula and with the results obtained from computer
simulations. However, it does not account for an oscillatory behavior of $\langle L \rangle$ as
a function of $c$ or $N$. These oscillations are negligible in the sparse networks but detectable
in the dense networks. We also derive an expression for the variance ${\rm Var}(L)$ of the DSPL, which
captures the overall dependence of the variance on $c$ but does not account for the oscillations.
The oscillations are due to the discrete nature of the shell structure around a random node. They
reflect the profile of the filling of new shells as $N$ is increased. The results for the mean and variance
are compared to the corresponding results obtained in other types of random networks. The relation
between the mean distance and the diameter is discussed.

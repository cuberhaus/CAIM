We have deployed density functional theory, Wannier function analysis and mean-field calculations
to investigate the double-double perovskite compound CaMnCrSbO_{6}. The crystallographically
non-equivalent Mn atoms in the unit cell have tetrahedral and planar oxygen coordinations (labelled
as Mn(1) and Mn(2)), while the Cr atom is in the centre of distorted oxygen octahedron. While the bulk
magnetization and neutron diffraction suggest a simpler ferrimagnetic order (T_C=49 K) between
Mn2+ and Cr3+ spins, the exchange interactions are more complex than that expected from a two sublattice
magnetic system. The electronic structure calculations yield a ferrimagnetic insulating ground
state even in absence of Hubbard U which persists for a wide range of U. The Mn(1)-O-Mn(2) (out of plane
and in-plane), Mn(1)-O-Cr and Mn(2)-O-Cr superexchange interactions are found to be anti-ferromagnetic,
while the Cr-O-O-Cr super-superexchange is found to be ferromagnetic. The Mn(2)-O-Cr superexchange
is weaker than the Mn(1)-O-Cr superexchange, thus effectively resulting in ferrimagnetism. From
a simple 3-site Hubbard model, we derived expressions for the antiferromagnetic superexchange
strength J_AFM and the weaker ferromagnetic J_FM. The relative strengths of JAFM for the various
superexchange interactions are in agreement with those obtained from DFT. The expression for Cr-O-O-Cr
super-superexchange strength (J_SS), which is derived considering a 4-site Hubbard model, predicts
a ferromagnetic exchange in agreement with DFT. Finally, our mean field calculations reveal that
assuming a set of four magnetic sub-lattice for Mn2+ spins and a single magnetic sublattice for Cr3+
spins yields a much improved T_C, while a simple two magnetic sublattice model yields a much higher
T_C.

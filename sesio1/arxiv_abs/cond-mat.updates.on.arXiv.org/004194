Two-dimensional (2D) insulators are a key element in the design and fabrication of van der Waals
heterostructures. They are vital as transparent dielectric spacers whose thickness can influence
both the photonic, electronic, and optoelectronic properties of 2D devices. Simultaneously,
they provide protection of the active layers in the heterostructure. For these critical roles,
hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) is the dominant choice due to its large bandgap, atomic flatness,
low defect density, and encapsulation properties. However, the broad catalogue of 2D insulators
offers exciting opportunities to replace hBN in certain applications that require transparent
thin layers with additional optical degrees of freedom. Here we investigate the potential of single-crystalline
Molybdenum Oxide (MoO$_3$) as an alternative 2D insulator for the design of nanodevices that require
precise adjustment of the light polarization at the nanometer scale. First, we measure the wavelength-dependent
refractive indices of MoO$_3$ along its three main crystal axes and determine the in-plane and out-of-plane
anisotropy of its optical properties. We find the birefringence in MoO$_3$ nanosheets compares
favorably with other 2D materials that exhibit strong birefringence, such as black phosphorus,
ReS$_2$, or ReSe$_2$, in particular in the visible spectral range where MoO$_3$ has the unique advantage
of transparency. Finally, we demonstrate the suitability of MoO$_3$ for dielectric encapsulation
by reporting linewidth narrowing and reduced inhomogeneous broadening of 2D excitons and optically
active quantum emitters, respectively, in a prototypical monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenide
semiconductor. These results show the potential of MoO$_3$ as a 2D dielectric layer for manipulation
of the light polarization in vertical 2D heterostructures.

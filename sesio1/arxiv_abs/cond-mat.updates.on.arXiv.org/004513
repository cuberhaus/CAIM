We consider molecules confined to a microcavity whose dimensions are such that an excitation of
the molecule is nearly resonant with a cavity mode. We investigate the situation where the excitation
energies of the molecules are randomly distributed with a mean value of $\epsilon_a$ and variance
$\sigma$. For this case, we find a solution that approaches the exact result for large values of the
number density $\mathscr{N}$ of the molecules. We find the conditions for the existence of the polaritonic
states, as well as expressions for their energies. The polaritonic states are quite stable against
disorder. Analytical results are verified by comparison with simulations. When $\epsilon_a$
is equal to that of the cavity state $\epsilon_c$ (on resonance) the gap between the two polaritonic
states is found to increase with disorder, the increase being equal to $2 \frac{\sigma^2}{\sqrt{\mathscr{N}}|\tilde{V}|}$
where $\tilde{V}$ is the coupling of a molecular excitation to the cavity state. An analytic expression
is found for the disorder induced width of the polaritonic peak. We results for various densities
of states, and the absorption spectrum. The dark states that exist in the case $\sigma=0$ turn "grey"
in presence of disorder with their contribution to the absorption increasing with $\sigma$. We
analyze the effect of including lifetimes of the cavity and molecular states and find that in the
strong coupling regime, the width of the polaritonic peaks is dominated by the lifetime effect and
that disorder plays almost no role, if the Rabi splitting is sufficiently large. We also consider
the case where there is (a) orientational disorder as well as (b) spatial variation of the cavity
field and find that they effectively amount to a renormlisation of the coupling.

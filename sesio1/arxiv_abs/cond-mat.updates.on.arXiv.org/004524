The microscopic spin-spin correlations in the 2D layered spin-1 honeycomb lattice compound Na2Ni2TeO6
have been investigated by neutron diffraction and inelastic neutron scattering. The honeycomb
lattice of spin-1 Ni2+ ions, within the crystallographic ab planes, are well separated along the
c axis by an intermediate Na layer whose crystal structure contains chiral nuclear density distributions
of Na ions. The chirality of the alternating Na layers is opposite. Such alternating chirality of
the Na layer dictates the magnetic periodicity along the c axis where an up-up-down-down spin arrangement
of the in-plane zigzag AFM structure is found. Besides, the above described commensurate (CM) zigzag
AFM order state is found to coexist with an incommensurate (ICM) AFM state below the TN ~ 27.5 K. The
ICM state is found to appear at much higher temperature ~ 50 K and persists down to lowest measured
temperature of 1.7 K. Our reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) analysis divulges a two dimensional (2D) magnetic
correlations (within the ab plane) of the ICM AFM state over the entire temperature range 1.7-50
K. Further, the spin-Hamiltonian has been determined by carrying out inelastic neutron scattering
experiments and subsequent linear spin-wave theory analysis which reveals the presence of competing
inplane exchange interactions up to 3 rd nearest neighbours consistent with the zigzag AFM ground
state, and weak interplanar interaction as well as a weak single-ion-anisotropy. The values of
the exchange constants yield that Na2Ni2TeO6 is situated well inside the zigzag AFM phase (spans
over a wide ranges of J2/J1 and J3/J1 values) in the theoretical phase diagram. The present study,
thus, provides a detailed microscopic understanding of the magnetic correlations and divulges
the intertwining magneto-structural correlations.

One of the grand challenges of utilizing machine learning for the discovery of innovative new polymers
lies in the difficulty of accurately representing the complex structures of polymeric materials.
Although a wide array of hand-designed polymer representations have been explored, there has yet
to be an ideal solution for how to capture the periodicity of polymer structures, and how to develop
polymer descriptors without the need for human feature design. In this work, we tackle these problems
through the development of our periodic polymer graph representation. Our pipeline for polymer
property predictions is comprised of our polymer graph representation that naturally accounts
for the periodicity of polymers, followed by a message-passing neural network (MPNN) that leverages
the power of graph deep learning to automatically learn chemically-relevant polymer descriptors.
Across a diverse dataset of 10 polymer properties, we find that this polymer graph representation
consistently outperforms hand-designed representations with a 20% average reduction in prediction
error. Our results illustrate how the incorporation of chemical intuition through directly encoding
periodicity into our polymer graph representation leads to a considerable improvement in the accuracy
and reliability of polymer property predictions. We also demonstrate how combining polymer graph
representations with message-passing neural network architectures can automatically extract
meaningful polymer features that are consistent with human intuition, while outperforming human-derived
features. This work highlights the advancement in predictive capability that is possible if using
chemical descriptors that are specifically optimized for capturing the unique chemical structure
of polymers.

By using the gauge-invariant kinetic equation approach [Yang and Wu, Phys. Rev. B {\bf 98}, 094507
(2018); {\bf 100}, 104513 (2019)], we construct the coupled dual dynamics of macroscopic phase
coherence and microscopic electronic fluids in cuprate superconductors. We prove that the developed
dual dynamics provides an efficient and simplified approach to formulate the dephasing process
of macroscopic superconducting phase coherence, as well as its influence on microscopic electronic
fluids (including gap, densities of superfluid and normal fluid, and in particular, the transport
property to determine superconducting transition temperature $T_c$). We then present theoretical
description of the preformed Cooper pairs in pseudogap state. The key origin of pseudogap state
comes from the quantum effect of disorder, which excites the macroscopic inhomogeneous phase fluctuation
through Josephson effect. Influenced by this phase fluctuation, there exist normal fluid and viscous
superfluid below $T_c$ in cuprate superconductors, in addition to conventional non-viscous superfluid.
The normal fluid always emerges around nodal points even at zero temperature, whereas the viscous
superfluid emerges due to the friction between superfluid and normal fluid. Particularly, the
non-viscous superfluid gets suppressed when the phase fluctuation is enhanced by increasing temperature,
until vanishes at $T_c$. Then, the system enters the pseudogap state, showing the nonzero resistivity
as well as the finite gap from the viscous superfluid. By further increasing temperature to $T^{\rm
os}$, the viscous superfluid and hence gap vanish. An experimental scheme to distinguish the densities
of normal fluid as well as viscous and non-viscous superfluids is proposed. Finally, this theory
is also applied to low-dimensional disordered $s$-wave superconductors.

We study the scattering of surface TM-polarized plasmon-polariton waves (PPWs) by the finite red
region of plane metal-vacuum boundary with randomly inhomogeneous impedance. We analyze the solution
of the integral equation connecting the scattered field with the field of the oncoming PPWs, that
is valid for any strength of the scattering and dissipative properties of the conducting half-space.
As a measure of scattering strength, the Hilbert norm of the intermode scattering operator is used.
It is shown that the intensity of the scattering is not only determined by the parameters of the random
impedance (the variance, correlation radius, the length of the heterogenious region), but it also
crucially depends on the metal substrate conductivity. For a small norm of the integral operator,
the incident surface plasmon polariton (SPP) radiates effectively into vacuum, loosing the part
of its energy for excitation of quasi-isotropic Norton-type waves above the conducting surface.
The intensity of the leaking field is expressed in terms of the pair correlation function of the impedance,
the dependence of which on wave numbers of incident and scattered waves demonstrates the possibility
to observe a phenomenon similar to Wood's anomalies of wave scattering by periodic lattices. With
strong scattering, when the norm of the scattering operator becomes large as compared to unity,
the radiation into the volume is highly suppressed and the PPW is basically mirrored from the heterogeneous
surface area in backward direction. In the model of dissipationless conducting halfspace, the
surface plasmon-polariton becomes unstable for arbitrarily small fluctuations of the conductor
polarizability. The mirroring also takes place at small norm of the scattering operator, yet in
this case it is related to Anderson's localization of the SPP within the disordered region.

The structure and dynamics of aqueous ions such as lithium, sodium, or potassium play a pivotal role
in biology and in many industrial applications. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxometry
represents a powerful tool for extracting dynamic information, but obtaining links to molecular
motion can be challenging. The relaxation for many of these ions is dominated by the quadrupolar
interaction mediated by electric field gradient (EFG) fluctuations and its interpretation in
terms of definite microscopic mechanisms is still lacking. Here we combine systematic quadrupolar
relaxometry experiments with ab initio calculations and classical molecular dynamics simulations
to account for both the electron cloud contribution to the quadrupolar coupling constant and long-time
EFG fluctuations. For aqueous sodium ions, we show that this approach yields a good agreement between
the calculated and experimentally measured NMR rates both in dilute and concentrated electrolyte
solutions over a broad range of temperatures. For increasing salt concentration or decreasing
temperature, we find that the growth of the NMR relaxation rate is mainly due to the slowing down of
EFG fluctuations. The quadrupolar coupling constant is marginally affected by concurrent modifications
of the ion's solvation shell structure, yet it counterintuitively increases with temperature.
We further demonstrate that the commonly-assumed rotational models fail to account for the measured
effects and significantly overestimate the correlation times. In contrast, we find that the EFG
relaxation occurs over a time scale compatible with that of the solution structural relaxation
that we determine from stress correlation functions. We thus conclude that the NMR relaxometry
of $^{23}\text{Na}^{+}$ can sense the fast collective dynamics around the solute that drive the
electrolyte structural rearrangements within the THz domain.

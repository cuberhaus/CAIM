Chemically-responsive polymers are macromolecules that respond to local variations of the chemical
composition of the solution by changing their conformation, with notable examples including polyelectrolytes,
proteins and DNA. The polymer conformation changes can occur in response to changes to the pH, the
ionic strength or to the concentration of a generic solute that interacts with the polymer. These
chemical stimuli can lead to drastic variations of the polymer flexibility and even trigger a transition
from a coil to a globule polymer conformation. In many situations the spatial distribution of the
chemical stimuli can be highly inhomogeneous, which can lead to large spatial variations of polymer
conformation and of the rheological properties of the mixture. In this paper, we develop a theory
for the flow of a mixture of a solute and chemically-responsive polymers. The approach is valid for
generic flows and inhomogeneous distributions of polymers and solutes. To model the polymer conformation
changes introduced by the interactions with the solute, we consider the polymers as linear elastic
dumbbells whose spring stiffness depends on the solute concentration. We use the Onsager's variational
formalism to derive the equations governing the evolution of the variables, which unveils novel
couplings between the distribution of dumbbells and that of the solute. Finally, we use a linear
stability analysis to show that the governing equations predict an equilibrium phase separation
and a distinct shear-induced phase separation whereby a homogeneous distribution of solute and
dumbbells spontaneously demix. Similar phase transitions have been observed in previous experiments
using stimuli-responsive polymers and may play an important role in living systems.

It is difficult to predict material behavior under decades long irradiation regimes. Machine and
deep learning can be very important tools that can help predict resulting material properties.
These tools require strong and robust models that can carefully reproduce the microstructural
evolution against experiments so researchers can understand the material processes and to validate
the model for future use with other materials. Thus, a newly developed Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC)
model was constructed to investigate the precipitation behavior of Y-Ti-O oxides along grain boundaries
in nanostructured ferritic alloys (NFA) and the oxide response to neutron irradiation. The level
of radiation damage simulated reached the long dpa range required for reactor components. Simulations
were conducted to investigate the influence of temperature as well as the influence of grain boundary
sinks on the resulting oxide characteristics of a 12YWT-like alloy during heat treatments at 1023K
- 1223K. There is good agreement of the oxide characteristics from simulation with literature values
and the influence of the grain boundary on precipitation is slight. The same oxide configuration
and positions were input into a new simulation and placed under simulated neutron irradiation to
a total accumulated dose of 8 dpa at temperatures, 673K - 873K, and at dose rates of 10^-3, 10^-4, and
10^-5. The expected inverse relationship of oxide size with dose rate was observed. A long-term
irradiation simulation at 873K and 10^-3 dpa/s was taken to 66 dpa and it was found that the oxides
in the vicinity of the grain boundary were more susceptible to dissolution. Additionally, irradiation
simulations of a 14YWT-like alloy were conducted to replicate findings from neutron irradiation
experiments. The larger oxides in the 14YWT-like alloy did not dissolve and showed the same stability
as in the experiments.

In Materio computation aims to leverage the complex physics that dictates the response of metamaterials
to perform computational operations. Magnetic materials are of particular interest for In Materio
computation due to their complex nonlinear interactions to stimuli, non-volatility of response,
and ease of electrical interfacing with existing computational platforms. Magnetic materials
can also exhibit emergent behaviours -- where local interactions lead to complex global behaviours
that are robust to variation in individual elements -- which are promising for In Materio computation
due to the high degree of expressivity that emergence offers. However, to make use of the broad range
of complexity that these emergent systems boast, methods for reading and writing data to and from
the material substrate must be tailored to extract the specific computational properties that
a given task demands. Here, devices of arrays of interconnected permalloy nanorings, shown to exhibit
emergent dynamics, are electrically measured under three input configurations falling under
the paradigm of 'Reservoir Computing' to perform signal transformation, spoken digit recognition,
and memory-intensive time series prediction. The successful performance of each of these tasks
is then correlated to the physical processes occurring in the device, providing interpretability
of the role of the substrate in computation. The ring array system performs competitively compared
to other proposed magnetic architectures in the signal transformation and spoken digit recognition
tasks, and provides, to the author's knowledge, the first experimental demonstration of NARMA
time series prediction in a nanomagnetic platform without the use of external delay lines. This
constitutes a critical step forward in the design of In Materio computation devices which can exploit
the rich dynamics offered by emergent systems.

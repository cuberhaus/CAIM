The Li-Haldane correspondence [PRL 101, 010504 (2008)] is often used to help identify wave functions
of (2+1)-D chiral topological phases, by studying low-lying entanglement spectra (ES) on long
cylinders of finite circumference. Here we consider such ES of states [in fact, of wave functions
of certain Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS)] that are not chiral, but which strongly break
time-reversal as well as reflection symmetry. This leads to ES which have branches of both right-
and left-moving chiralities, but with vastly different velocities. For circumferences much smaller
than the inverse entanglement gap scale, the low-lying ES appear chiral in some topological sectors,
and precisely follow the Li-Haldane state counting of a truly chiral phase. On its face, this could
lead one to mistakenly identify the phase as chiral. However, by considering the ES in all possible
sectors, one can observe distinct differences from a chiral phase. We explore this phenomenon in
the setting of an $SU(3)$ spin liquid PEPS studied by Kure\v{c}i\'c, et al. [PRB 99, 045116 (2019)],
where the trivial sector appeared to have the characteristic Li-Haldane counting of a chiral $SU(3)$-level-one
[$SU(3)_1$] Conformal Field Theory (CFT). In fact, the PEPS has $D(\mathbb{Z}_3)$ topological
order, with 9 sectors. We compute the ES in minimally entangled states corresponding to all these
sectors, which map to the 9 anyon types of doubled $SU(3)$-level-one Chern-Simons Topological
Field Theory. The state countings of the ES are consistent with our expectation: specifically,
the ES contain representations of global $SU(3)$ symmetry from the tensor products of the (lowest-lying)
multiplet of primary states of a "high-velocity" chiral $SU(3)_1$ CFT with the full content of a
"low-velocity" chiral $SU(3)_1$ CFT sector, a non-chiral structure beyond that observable in
the trivial sector of the ES.

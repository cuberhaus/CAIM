A comprehensive study of thermodynamic properties of three samples of bimetallic molecular magnets
[Co$^{\mathrm{II}}$(pyrazole)$_{4}$]$_{2x}$[Fe$^{\mathrm{II}}$(pyrazole)$_{4}$]$_{2(1-x)}$[Nb$^{\mathrm{IV}}$(CN)$_{8}$]$\cdot$4H$_{2}$O
with $x$=0 (Co$_{2}$Nb), 0.5 (CoFeNb), and 1 (Fe$_{2}$Nb) is reported. The three samples display
the same crystallographic structure crystallizing in the tetragonal system with space group $I4_1/a$.
Their heat capacities are measured in the temperature range 0.36-100 K without applied field as
well as in the field of $\mu_0 H$ = 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 9 T. The results imply the presence of the
second-order phase transitions to magnetically ordered phases at 4.87(8) K, 7.1(2) K, and 8.44(3)
K for $x$=0, 0.5, and 1, respectively. The corresponding thermodynamic functions are analyzed
to discuss the stability of the mixed compound and the magnetocaloric effect (MCE). The Gibbs energy
of mixing is found to be positive but smaller in magnitude than the energy of thermal fluctuations
indicating that the mixed sample is marginally stable in the full detected temperature range. The
enthalpy of mixing is negative, which points to an ordered arrangement of the Co(II) and Fe(II) ions
in the solid solution CoFeNb. The negative values of the entropy of mixing are explained by considering
the enhanced rigidity of the crystal lattice of the solid solution sample. To extract the magnetic
contribution to the heat capacity an approach based on a reasonable frequency spectrum is adopted.
Taking advantage of the in-field heat capacity measurements MCE was described in terms of the isothermal
entropy change $\Delta S_\mathrm{M}$ and the adiabatic temperature change $\Delta T_\mathrm{ad}$.
The magnitudes of these quantities are typical for the class of molecular magnets.

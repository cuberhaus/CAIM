A primary goal at the interface of theoretical and experimental quantum magnetism is the investigation
of exotic spin states, most notably quantum spin liquids (QSLs). Magnetic rare-earth ions go beyond
the straightforward paradigm of geometrical frustration in Heisenberg antiferromagnets by introducing
competing energy scales, and in particular their strong spin-orbit coupling creates multiple
split crystal electric-field (CEF) levels, leading to anisotropic effective spin models with
intrinsic frustration. While rare-earth delafossites have a triangular-lattice geometry, and
thus have gained recent attention as candidates for hosting spin-1/2 QSL physics, the reliable
extraction of effective spin models from the initial many-parameter CEF spectrum is a hard problem.
Using the example of CsYbSe2, we demonstrate the unambiguous extraction of the Stevens-operators
coefficients dictating the full CEF spectrum of Yb$^{3+}$ by translating these into parameters
with a direct physical interpretation. Specifically, we combine low-field susceptibility measurements
with resonant torsion magnetometry experiments in fields up to 60 T to determine a sufficiently
large number of physical parameters -- effective Zeeman splittings, anisotropic van Vleck coefficients,
and magnetotropic coefficients -- that the set of Stevens-operator coefficients is unique. Our
crucial identification of the strong corrections to the Zeeman splitting of Kramers doublets as
van Vleck coefficients has direct consequences for the interpretation of all anisotropic magnetic
susceptibility measurements. Our results allow us to determine the nature and validity of an effective
spin-1/2 model for CsYbSe2, to provide input for theoretical studies of such models on the triangular
lattice, and to provide additional materials insight into routes for achieving magnetic frustration
and candidate QSL systems in rare-earth compounds.

Semiconductor superlattices have been extensively investigated for thermoelectric applications,
to explore the effects of compositions, interface structures, and lattice strain environments
on the reduction of thermal conductivity, and improvement of efficiency. Most studies assumed
that their electronic properties remain unaffected compared to their bulk counterparts. However,
recent studies demonstrated that electronic properties of silicon (Si)/germanium (Ge) superlattices
show significant variations depending on compositions and growth substrates. These studies used
a constant relaxation time approximation, and ignored the effects of electron scattering processes.
Here, we consider electron scattering with phonons and ionized impurities, and report first-principles
calculations of electronic transport properties including the scattering rates. We investigate
two classes of Si/Ge superlattices: superlattices with varied compositions grown on identical
substrates and with identical compositions but grown on different substrates. We illustrate the
relationship between the energy bands of the superlattices and the electron-phonon relaxation
times. We model the electron-ionized impurity interaction potentials by accounting for the in-plane
and the cross-plane structural anisotropy. Our analysis reveals that the inclusion of electron-phonon
and electron-impurity scattering processes can lead to ~1.56-fold improved peak power-factors,
compared to that of bulk Si. We observe that superlattices can also display dramatically reduced
power-factors for specific lattice strain environments. Such reduction could cancel out thermoelectric
efficiency improvements due to reduced thermal conductivities. Our study provides insight to
predict variation of electronic properties due to changes in lattice strain environments, essential
for designing superlattices with optimized electronic properties.

We analyze the capillarity-driven thinning dynamics of entangled polymer solutions described
by the Doi-Edwards-Marrucci-Grizzuti (DEMG) model and the Rolie-Poly (RP) model. Both models
capture polymer reptation, finite rates of chain retraction and finite extensibility of single
polymer molecules, while differing slightly in their final form regarding to the convective constraint
release. We calculate numerically the filament thinning profiles predicted by the two models with
realistic entanglement densities, assuming cylindrical filament shapes and no fluid inertia.
Both results reveal an early tube-reorientation regime, followed by a brief intermediate elasto-capillary
regime, and finally a finite-extensibility regime close to the pinch-off singularity. The results
presented in this work reveal two critical features in the transient extensional rheology of entangled
polymer solutions that have been reported from previous experimental studies, but are poorly described
by the widely-used FENE-P model. First, the relaxation time obtained from capillary breakup extensional
rheometry is notably smaller than that from steady-shear rheometry. Their ratio can be expressed
as a universal function of the entanglement state and the polymer concentration, which agrees well
with the experimental data for a range of entangled polymer solutions. Second, the filament thinning
dynamics at sufficiently high polymer concentrations are governed by the tube reorientation at
intermediate strain-rates, and the apparent extensional viscosity shows a noticeably rate-thinning
response. We finally evaluate the filament thinning dynamics of aqueous polyethylene oxide solutions
(1 MDa) over dilute and entangled regimes. As the concentration increases, the profiles deviate
from the well-studied exponential-thinning trends beyond the entangled threshold, becoming
increasingly power-law in character.

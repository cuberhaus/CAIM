The diagrammatic formalism and transport equation are conventionally considered as separate
but complementary techniques to tackle the impurity scattering effect. To compare with the previous
studies from the gauge-invariant kinetic equation approach [F. Yang and M. W. Wu, Phys. Rev. B 98,
094507 (2018); 102, 144508 (2020)], we analytically perform a diagrammatic formulation of the
impurity scattering in superconductors, with both transport and collective Higgs mode studied,
in order to fill the long missing calculation of the Kubo current-current correlation in superconductors
with impurity scattering and resolve the controversy (whether the impurity scattering can lead
to the damping of Higgs mode) between gauge-invariant kinetic equation and Eilenberger equation.
For transport behavior, through a special unitary transformation that is equivalent to the Wilson-line
technique for the diamagnetic response, we derive the Meissner-supercurrent vertex. Then, by
formulating the supercurrent-supercurrent correlation with Born and vertex corrections from
impurity scattering, we recover the previously revealed microscopic momentum-relaxation rate
of superfluid by gauge-invariant kinetic equation. This rate is finite only when the superconducting
velocity is larger than a threshold, at which the normal fluid emerges and causes the friction with
the superfluid current, similar to the Landau's superfluid theory of liquid helium. This derivation
also provides a physical understanding of the relaxation-time approximation in the previous diagrammatic
formulation in the literature, which leads to the friction resistance of the Meissner supercurrent.
For the collective Higgs mode, we calculate the amplitude-amplitude correlation with Born and
vertex corrections from impurity scattering. The vertex correction, which only emerges at nonequilibrium
case, leads to a Higgs-mode damping, ......

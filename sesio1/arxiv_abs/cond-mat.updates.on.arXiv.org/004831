Transition metal monosilicides CoSi, CoGe, RhSi and RhGe in the chiral cubic B20 structure have
recently been found to host unconventional chiral fermions beyond spin-1/2 WFs, and also exhibit
exotic physical phenomena such as long Fermi arc surface states, GME and quantized CPGE. Thus, exploring
novel spin-related transports in these unconventional chiral fermion semimetals may open a new
door for spintronics and spin caloritronics. In this paper, we study the intrinsic SHE and SNE in
the CoSi family based on ab initio relativistic band structure calculations. First, we find that
unlike nonchiral cubic metals, the CoSi family have two independent nonzero SHC (SNC) tensor elements,
namely, $\sigma_{xy}^z$ and $\sigma_{xz}^y$ ($\alpha_{xy}^z$ and $\alpha_{xz}^y$) instead
of one element. Furthermore, sign of $\sigma_{xy}^z$, chirality of spin-3/2 chiral fermion node
and helicity of the chiral structure are found to be correlated, thus enabling SHE detection of chiral
fermion chirality and also structural helicity. Second, the intrinsic SHE and SNE in some of the
CoSi family are large. In particular, the calculated SHC of RhGe is as large as -140 ($\hbar$/e)(S/cm).
The calculated SNC of CoGe is also large, being -1.3 ($\hbar$/e)(A/m K) at room temperature. Due
to their semimetallic nature with low electrical conductivity, these topological semimetals
may have large spin Hall and spin Nernst angles, being comparable to that of Pt metal. The SHC and SNC
of these compounds can also be increased by raising or lowering $\mu$ to, e.g., the topological nodes,
via either chemical doping or electrical gating. Our findings thus indicate that the CoSi family
not only would provide a material platform for exploring novel spin-transports and exotic phenomena
in unconventional chiral fermion semimetals but also could be promising materials for developing
better spintronic and spin caloritronic devices.

Wastewaters containing high concentrations of NH4+, PO43- and transition metals are environmentally
harmful and toxic pollutants. At the same time phosphorous and transition metals constitute valuable
resources. Typically, separate pathways have been considered to extract hazardous transition
metals or phosphate, independently from each other. Investigations on the simultaneous removal
of multiple components have been studied only to a limited extent. Here, we report the synthesis
routes for Co- and Ni-struvites (NH4MPO4.6H2O, M = Ni2+, Co2+), which allow for P, ammonia and metal
co-precipitation. By evaluating different reaction parameters, which are representative for
some common wastewater compositions, the phase and stability of transition metal struvites, as
well as their crystal morphologies, and sizes could be optimized. Ni-struvite is stable in a wide
reactant concentration range and at different metal/phosphorus (M/P) ratios, whereas Co-struvite
only forms at low M/P ratios. Detailed investigations of the precipitation process using ex situ
and in situ techniques provided insights in the crystallization mechanisms. Ni- and Co-struvites
crystallize via intermediate colloidal nanophases which subsequently aggregate and condense
to final crystals after extended reaction times. This mechanism is different from the practically
immediate crystallization of micrometer-sized crystals of ordinary struvite (NH4MgPO4.6H2O),
which does not seem to involve any amorphous precursor phase. The achieved level of control over
the morphology and size, makes precipitation of transition metal struvites a promising method
for wastewater treatment. The crystals can be potentially up-cycled into precursor raw materials
e.g. for electrochemical or (electro)catalytical applications.

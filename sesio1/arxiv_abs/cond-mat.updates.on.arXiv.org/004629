Fracture mechanics is crucial for many fields of engineering, as precisely predicting failure
of structures and parts is required for efficient designs. The simulation of failure processes
is, from a mechanical and a numerical point of view, challenging, especially for inhomogeneous
materials, where the microstructure influences crack initiation and propagation and leads to
complex crack patterns. The phase field method for fracture is a promising approach to encounter
such materials since it is able to describe complex fracture phenomena like crack kinking, branching
and coalescence. Moreover, it is a largely mesh independent approach, given that the mesh is homogenous
around the crack. However, the broadly used formulation of the phase field method is limited to isotropic
materials and does not account for preferable fracture planes defined through the material's microstructure.
In this work, the method is expanded to take orthotropic constitutive behavior and preferable directions
of crack propagation into account. We show that by using a stress-based split and multiple phase
field variables with preferable fracture planes, in combination with a hybrid phase field approach,
a general framework can be found for simulating anisotropic, inhomogeneous materials. The stress-based
split is based on fictitious crack faces and is, herein, expanded to anisotropic materials. Furthermore,
a novel hybrid approach is used, where the degradation of the sound material is performed based on
a smooth traction free crack boundary condition, which proves to be the main driving factor for recovering
observed crack patterns. This is shown by means of a detailed analysis of two examples: a wooden single
edge notched plate and a wood board with a single knot and complex fiber directions. In both cases,
the proposed novel hybrid phase field approach can realistically reproduce complex failure modes.

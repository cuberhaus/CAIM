Single enzyme chemotaxis is a phenomenon by which a non-equilibrium spatial distribution of an
enzyme is created and maintained by concentration gradients of the substrate and product of the
catalyzed reaction. These gradients can arise either naturally through metabolism, or experimentally,
e.g., by flow of materials through several channels or by use of diffusion chambers with semipermeable
membranes. Numerous hypotheses regarding the mechanism of this phenomenon have been proposed.
Here we discuss a mechanism based solely on diffusion and chemical kinetics and show that kinetic
asymmetry, a difference in the off rates for substrate and for product, and diffusion asymmetry,
a difference in the diffusivities of the bound and free forms of the enzyme, are the sole determinates
of the direction of chemotaxis. Exploration of these fundamental symmetries that govern nonequilibrium
behavior helps to distinguish between possible mechanisms for the evolution of a chemical system
from initial to the steady state, and whether the principle that determines the direction a system
shifts when exposed to an external energy source is based on thermodynamics, or on kinetics, with
the latter being supported by the results of the present paper. Our results show that while dissipation
ineluctably accompanies non-equilibrium phenomena, including chemotaxis, systems do not evolve
to maximize dissipation, but rather to attain greatest kinetic stability. Chemotactic response
to the gradients formed by other enzymes provides a mechanism for forming loose associations known
as metabolons. Significantly the direction of the effective force due to these gradients depends
on the kinetic asymmetry of the enzyme, and so can be non-reciprocal, where one enzyme is attracted
to another enzyme, but the other enzyme is repelled by the one, an important ingredient in the behavior
of active matter.

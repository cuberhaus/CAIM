Two different heat-transport mechanisms are discussed in solids: in crystals, heat carriers propagate
and scatter like particles, as described by Peierls' formulation of Boltzmann transport equation
for phonon wavepackets; in glasses, instead, carriers behave wave-like, diffusing via a Zener-like
tunneling between quasi-degenerate vibrational eigenstates, as described by the Allen-Feldman
equation. Recently, it has been shown that these two conduction mechanisms emerge as limiting cases
from a unified transport equation, which describes on an equal footing solids ranging from crystals
to glasses; moreover, in materials with intermediate characteristics the two conduction mechanisms
coexist, and it is crucial to account for both. Here, we discuss the theoretical foundations of such
transport equation as is derived from the Wigner phase-space formulation of quantum mechanics,
elucidating how the interplay between disorder, anharmonicity, and the quantum Bose-Einstein
statistics of atomic vibrations determines thermal conductivity. This Wigner formulation argues
for a preferential phase convention for the dynamical matrix in the reciprocal Bloch representation
and related off-diagonal velocity operator's elements; such convention is the only one yielding
a conductivity which is invariant with respect to the non-unique choice of the crystal's unit cell
and is size-consistent. We rationalize the conditions determining the crossover from particle-like
to wave-like heat conduction, showing that phonons below the Ioffe-Regel limit (i.e. with a mean
free path shorter than the interatomic spacing) contribute to heat transport due to their wave-like
capability to interfere and tunnel. Finally, we show that the present approach overcomes the failures
of the Peierls-Boltzmann formulation for materials with ultralow or glass-like thermal conductivity.

Fracture in aluminum alloys with precipitates involves at least two mechanisms, namely, ductile
fracture of the aluminum-rich matrix and brittle fracture of the precipitates. In this work, a coupled
crystal plasticity-phase field model for mixed ductile-brittle failure modes is formulated and
used to investigate the effect of precipitate morphology and size distribution on damage evolution
in aluminum alloys. A thermodynamically consistent framework for elastic and plastic work dissipation
in the fracture process zone is used to formulate the coupled constitutive behavior for brittle
and ductile damage, respectively. Representative Volume Elements (RVE) with varying particle
morphology and orientation were generated and their uni-axial loading was simulated to assess
the damage resistance of the different model microstructures. For critical energy release rate
$G_c$ values of the aluminum matrix ranging from 4 to 8~Jm$^{-2}$ for single crystals and from 10
to 16~Jm$^{-2}$ for polycrystals, the model predicts a change in failure modes from particle debonding
to cracking followed by ductile matrix failure. The change of particle failure mechanism as a result
of increased $G_c$ is observed for both, single and polycrystalline model microstructures. For
the case of particle debonding, microstructures with circular or ellipsoidal particles (with
the major axis perpendicular to the loading direction) show a higher ductility and fracture work
compared to the other studied cases. In the case of particle cracking, microstructures with ellipsoidal
particles aligned parallel to the loading axis show a higher ductility and fracture work among the
investigated cases. The simulations qualitatively reproduce the experimentally observed particle
failure mechanisms (cracking and debonding) for two different matrix alloy classes (commercially
pure and 2xxx alloys) reinforced with ceramic particles.

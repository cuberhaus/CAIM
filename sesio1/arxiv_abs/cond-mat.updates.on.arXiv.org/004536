A magnetic atom has two magnetic poles of N and S, and in normal conditions, separation of magnetic
poles cannot be happened, even in very small atomic dimensions. Existence of magnetic dipoles is
due to a fundamental property of magnetic materials and belongs to intrinsic spin of electrons.
For the electron, N and S magnetic poles are considered, similar to a current loop. The aim of this
paper is theoretical calculate dissociation energy of N-S poles a quantum magnetic particle with
two approaches of classical and quantum mechanics by providing a harmonic oscillator simple model
to estimate dissociation energy of the N-S poles and corresponding breakdown temperature and internal
pressure. The results showed that separation of magnetic poles occurs in two states: (a) in an ultra-hot
plasma medium with extremely high temperatures, such as in the center of a hot star, and (b) at extremely
high pressures, such as between internal plates in complex superlattices of layered solids. It
will be shown that breakdown temperature is in order of {\theta} =107 to 108 Kelvin. This temperature
is very high and it only happens in an ultra-hot plasma environment as fifth phase of matter. In addition,
based on this model, we calculated that the possibility of dissociation of bonds between N and S magnetic
poles for solid superlattices occurs at very high pressures between crystal plates. According
to these results, the presence of isolated magnetic monopole in superlattices of solids under ultra-high-pressure
conditions is possible. Therefore, this model suggests that the conductivity of magnetic monopole
carries can be used in the manipulation of nanomaterials for applications in the production of advanced
devices such as new generation of superconductors, new spin devices and magnetic-electronics
advanced materials with magnetic monopoles and super-dielectrics.

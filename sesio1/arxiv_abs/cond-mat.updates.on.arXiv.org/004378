We present a path integral derivation of the commonly used effective action of the anomalous Hall
effect with Berry's phase on the basis of the adiabatic condition $|\epsilon_{n\pm1}-\epsilon_{n}|\gg
2\pi\hbar/T$, where $2\pi\hbar/T$ is the typical energy scale of the slower system and $\epsilon_{n}$
is the energy level of the fast system. In the conventional definition of the adiabatic condition
with $T\rightarrow {\rm large}$ and fixed energy eigenvalues, it is shown that the starting canonical
commutation relations are recovered. On the other hand, in a singular limit $|\epsilon_{n\pm1}-\epsilon_{n}|\rightarrow
\infty$ with specific $\epsilon_{n}$ kept fixed for which any motions of the slower variables $X_{k}$
are treated to be adiabatic, the non-commutative geometry $[X_{k}, X_{l}] = i\hbar(\partial_{k}{\cal
A}^{(n)}_{l}-\partial_{l}{\cal A}^{(n)}_{k})$ with Berry's connection ${\cal A}^{(n)}_{k}$
is induced. In the Born-Oppenheimer approximation based on the canonical commutation relations,
the non-commutative geometry appears if one uses a non-canonical transformation of variables
$X_{k}^{(n)}=X_{k}+{\cal A}^{(n)}_{k}$ which help constrain the slower variables to a specific
state $\varphi_{n}(P)$ in the total state $\Psi=\sum_{n}\varphi_{n}(P)\phi_{n}(x,P)$. In
either case, the map of the slower variables in the full phase space to a neighborhood of a specific
$n$-th state of the fast variables induces a non-canonical transformation and changes the commutation
relations. This constrained dynamics of slower variables in a specific state such as $\varphi_{n}(P)$
is not compatible with the electromagnetic gauge symmetry, which acts universally on all the states
$\Psi=\sum_{n}\varphi_{n}(P)\phi_{n}(x,P)$, and leads to complications in the quantization
of the effective action of the anomalous Hall effect with $eA_{k}(X)$ included and also to the Nernst
effect.

Stochastic processes play a key role for modeling a huge variety of transport problems out of equilibrium,
with manifold applications throughout the natural and social sciences. To formulate models of
stochastic dynamics the conventional approach consists in superimposing random fluctuations
on a suitable deterministic evolution. These fluctuations are sampled from probability distributions
that are prescribed a priori, most commonly as Gaussian or L\'evy. While these distributions are
motivated by (generalised) central limit theorems they are nevertheless \textit{unbounded},
meaning that arbitrarily large fluctuations can be obtained with finite probability. This property
implies the violation of fundamental physical principles such as special relativity and may yield
divergencies for basic physical quantities like energy. Here we solve the fundamental problem
of unbounded random fluctuations by constructing a comprehensive theoretical framework of stochastic
processes possessing physically realistic finite propagation velocity. Our approach is motivated
by the theory of L\'evy walks, which we embed into an extension of conventional Poisson-Kac processes.
The resulting extended theory employs generalised transition rates to model subtle microscopic
dynamics, which reproduces non-trivial spatio-temporal correlations on macroscopic scales.
It thus enables the modelling of many different kinds of dynamical features, as we demonstrate by
three physically and biologically motivated examples. The corresponding stochastic models capture
the whole spectrum of diffusive dynamics from normal to anomalous diffusion, including the striking
`Brownian yet non Gaussian' diffusion, and more sophisticated phenomena such as senescence. Extended
Poisson-Kac theory can therefore be used to model a wide range of finite velocity dynamical phenomena
that are observed experimentally.

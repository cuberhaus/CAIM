There is growing interest in using ultrafast light pulses to drive functional materials into nonequilibrium
states with novel properties. The conventional wisdom is that above gap photoexcitation behaves
similarly to raising the electronic temperature and lacks the desired selectivity in the final
state. Here we report a novel nonthermal lattice instability induced by ultrafast above-gap excitation
in SnSe, a representative of the IV-VI class of semiconductors that provides a rich platform for
tuning material functionality with ultrafast pulses due to their multiple lattice instabilities.
The new lattice instability is accompanied by a drastic softening of the lowest frequency A$_g$
phonon. This mode has previously been identified as the soft mode in the thermally driven phase transition
to a Cmcm structure. However, by a quantitative reconstruction of the atomic displacements from
time-resolved x-ray diffraction for multiple Bragg peaks and excitation densities, we show that
ultrafast photoexcitation with near-infrared (1.55 eV) light, induces a distortion towards a
different structure with Immm symmetry. The Immm structure of SnSe is an orthorhombic distortion
of the rocksalt structure and does not occur in equilibrium. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations
reveal that the photoinduced Immm lattice instability arises from electron excitation from the
Se 4$p$- and Sn 5$s$-derived bands deep below the Fermi level that cannot be excited thermally. The
results have implications for optical control of the thermoelectric, ferroelectric and topological
properties of the monochalcogenides and related materials. More generally, the results emphasize
the need for ultrafast structural probes to reveal distinct atomic-scale dynamics that are otherwise
too subtle or invisible in conventional spectroscopies.

We study the phase diagram of a system of $2\times 2\times 1$ hard plates on the three dimensional
cubic lattice, {\em i.e.} a lattice gas of plates that each cover a single face of the cubic lattice
and touch the four points of the corresponding square plaquette. We focus on the isotropic system,
with equal fugacity for the three orientations of plates We show, using grand canonical Monte Carlo
simulations, that the system undergoes two density-driven phase transitions with increasing
density of plates: first from a disordered fluid to a layered phase, and second from the layered phase
to a sublattice ordered phase. In the layered phase, the system breaks up into occupied bilayers
or equivalently slabs of thickness two along one spontaneously chosen cartesian direction, with
a higher density of plates occupying these bilayers relative to the density in the adjacent unoccupied
bilayers. In addition to breaking of lattice translation symmetry along one cartesian direction,
the layered phase additionally breaks the symmetry between the three types of plates, as two types
of plates, with normals perpendicular to the layering direction, have a higher density compared
to the third type. Also, the occupied bilayers of the layered phase have power-law columnar correlations
within each bilayer, corresponding to power-law two-dimensional columnar order within the occupied
bilayers. In contrast, inter-bilayer correlations of the two-dimensional columnar order parameters
decay exponentially with the separation between the bilayers. In the sublattice ordered phase,
there is two-fold ($Z_2$) breaking of lattice translation symmetry along all three cartesian directions.
We present evidence that the disordered to layered transition is continuous and consistent with
the three-dimensional $O(3)$ universality class, while the layered to sublattice transition
is discontinuous.

Recently, the two-dimensional magnetic semiconductor CrSBr has attracted considerable attention
due to its excellent air-stable property and high magnetic critical temperature. Here, we systematically
investigate the electronic structure, magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, first-order magneto-optical
effects (Kerr and Faraday effects) and second-order magneto-optical effects (Schafer-Hubert
and Voigt effects) as well as intrinsically anomalous transport properties (anomalous Hall, anomalous
Nernst, and anomalous thermal Hall effects) of two-dimensional van der Waals layered magnets CrXY
(X = S, Se, Te; Y = Cl, Br, I) by using the first-principles calculations. Our results show that monolayer
and bilayer CrXY (X = S, Se) are narrow band gap semiconductors, whereas monolayer and bilayer CrTeY
are multi-band metals. The magnetic ground states of bilayer CrXY and the easy magnetization axis
of monolayer and bilayer CrXY are confirmed by the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy calculations.
Utilizing magnetic group theory analysis, the first-order magneto-optical effects as well as
anomalous Hall, anomalous Nernst, and anomalous thermal Hall effects are identified to exist in
ferromagnetic state with out-of-plane magnetization. The second-order magneto-optical effects
are not restricted by the above symmetry requirements, and therefore can arise in ferromagnetic
and antiferromagnetic states with in-plane magnetization. The calculated results are compared
with the available theoretical and experimental data of other two-dimensional magnets and some
conventional ferromagnets. The present work reveals that monolayer and bilayer CrXY with superior
magneto-optical responses and anomalous transport properties provide an excellent material
platform for the promising applications of magneto-optical devices, spintronics, and spin caloritronics.

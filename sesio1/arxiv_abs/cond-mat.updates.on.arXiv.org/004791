Molecular sorting is a fundamental process that allows eukaryotic cells to distill and concentrate
specific chemical factors in appropriate cell membrane subregions, thus endowing them with different
chemical identities and functional properties. A phenomenological theory of this molecular distillation
process has recently been proposed arXiv:1811.06760, based on the idea that molecular sorting
emerges from the combination of: a) phase-separation-driven formation of sorting domains, and
b) domain-induced membrane bending, leading to the production of submicrometric lipid vesicles
enriched in the sorted molecules. In this framework, a natural parameter controlling the efficiency
of molecular distillation is the critical size of phase-separated domains. In the experiments,
sorting domains appear to fall into two classes: unproductive domains, characterized by short
lifetimes and low probability of extraction, and productive domains, that evolve into vesicles
that ultimately detach from the membrane system. It is tempting to link these two classes to the different
fates predicted by classical phase separation theory for subcritical and supercritical phase-separated
domains. Here, we discuss the implication of this picture in the framework of the previously introduced
phenomenological theory of molecular sorting. Several predictions of the theory are verified
by numerical simulations of a lattice-gas model. Sorting is observed to be most efficient when the
number of sorting domains is close to a minimum. To help in the analysis of experimental data, an operational
definition of the critical size of sorting domains is proposed. Comparison with experimental results
shows that the statistical properties of productive/unproductive domains inferred from experimental
data are in agreement with those predicted from numerical simulations of the model.

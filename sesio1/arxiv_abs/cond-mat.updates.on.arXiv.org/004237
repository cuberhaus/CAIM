Compositionally complex materials (CCMs) present a potential paradigm shift in the design of magnetic
materials. These alloys exhibit long-range structural order coupled with limited or no chemical
order. As a result, extreme local environments exist with a large opposing magnetic energy term,
which can manifest large changes in the magnetic behavior. In the current work, the magnetic properties
of (Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni) alloys are presented. These materials were prepared by room-temperature combinatorial
sputtering, resulting in a range of compositions with a single BCC structural phase and no chemical
ordering. The combinatorial growth technique allows CCMs to be prepared outside of their thermodynamically
stable phase, enabling the exploration of otherwise inaccessible order. The mixed ferromagnetic
and antiferromagnetic interactions in these alloys causes frustrated magnetic behavior, which
results in an extremely low coercivity (<1 mT), which increases rapidly at 50 K. At low temperatures,
the coercivity achieves values of nearly 500 mT, which is comparable to some high-anisotropy magnetic
materials. Commensurate with the divergent coercivity is an atypical drop in the temperature dependent
magnetization. These effects are explained by a mixed magnetic phase model, consisting of ferro-,
antiferro , and frustrated magnetic regions, and are rationalized by simulations. A machine-learning
algorithm is employed to visualize the parameter space and inform the development of subsequent
compositions. Annealing the samples at 600 {\deg}C orders the sample, more-than doubling the Curie
temperature and increasing the saturation magnetization by as much as 5x. Simultaneously, the
large coercivities are suppressed, resulting in magnetic behavior that is largely temperature
independent over a range of 350 K.

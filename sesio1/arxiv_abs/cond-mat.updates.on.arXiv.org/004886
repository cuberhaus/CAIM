Although evidence of inter-valley attraction-mediated by phonon or topological fluctuations
is accumulating, the origin of superconductivity in the flat-band quantum moir\'e materials remains
an open question. Here, instead of attempting to pinpoint the origin of the superconductivity,
we aim at identifying universal properties of moir\'e flat bands that shall emerge in the presence
of inter-valley attractions. We show that by matching the interaction strength of inter-valley
attraction with intra-valley repulsion, the flat-band limit becomes exactly solvable. Away from
the flat-band limit, the system can be simulated via quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods without sign
problem for any fillings. Combining analytic solutions with large-scale numerical simulations,
we show that upon increasing temperature, the superconducting phase melts into a bosonic fluid
of Cooper pairs with large/diverging compressibility. In contrast to flat-band attractive Hubbard
models, where similar effects arise only for on-site interactions, our study indicates this physics
is a universal property of moir\'e flat bands, regardless of microscopic details such as the range
of interactions and/or spin-oribt couplings. At higher temperature, the boson fluid phase gives
its way to a pseudo gap phase, where some Cooper pairs are torn apart by thermal fluctuations, resulting
in fermion density of states inside the gap. Unlike the superconducting transition temperature,
which is very sensitive to doping and twisting angles, the gap and the temperature scale of the boson
fluid phase and the pseudo gap phase are found to be nearly independent of doping level and/or flat-band
bandwidth. The relevance of these phases with experimental discoveries in the flat band quantum
moir\'e materials is discussed.

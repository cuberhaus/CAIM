The reduction of iron ore with carbon-carriers is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions
in the industry, motivating global activities to replace the coke-based blast furnace reduction
by hydrogen-based direct reduction (HyDR). Iron oxide reduction with hydrogen has been widely
investigated both experimentally and theoretically. The process includes multiple types of chemical
reactions, solid state and defect-mediated diffusion (by oxygen and hydrogen species), several
phase transformations, as well as massive volume shrinkage and mechanical stress buildup. In this
work, a chemo-mechanically coupled phase-field (PF) model has been developed to explore the interplay
between phase transformation, chemical reaction, species diffusion, large elasto-plastic deformation
and microstructure evolution. Energetic constitutive relations of the model are based on the system
free energy which is calibrated with the help of a thermodynamic database. The model has been first
applied to the classical core-shell (w\"ustite-iron) structure. Simulations show that the phase
transformation from w\"ustite to alpha-iron can result in high stress and rapidly decelerating
reaction kinetics. Mechanical stresses can contribute elastic energy to the system, making phase
transformation difficult. Thus slow reaction kinetics and low metallization are observed. However,
if the stress becomes comparatively high, it can shift the shape of the free energy from a double-well
to a single-well case and speed up the transformation. The model has been further applied to simulate
an actual iron oxide specimen with its complex microstructure, characterized by electron microscopy.
The simulation results show that isolated pores in the microstructure are filled with water vapor
during reduction, an effect which influences the local reaction atmosphere and dynamics.

We present a complete microscopic Fermi-liquid description for next-to-leading order transport
through an Anderson impurity under a finite bias voltage $V$. It is applicable to multilevel quantum
dots without particle-hole nor time-reversal symmetry, and is constructed based on the nonequilibrium
Keldysh formalism, taking into account the current conservation between electrons in the impurity
levels and the conduction bands. Specifically, we derive the formula for the current noise generated
in the steady flow up to terms of order $(eV)^3$ at zero temperature $T=0$. To this end, we calculate
the Keldysh vertex functions $\Gamma_{\sigma\sigma';\sigma'\sigma}^{ \nu_1\nu_2;\nu_3\nu_4}
(\omega,\omega'; \omega',\omega)$, which depend on branches $\nu_1, \nu_2, \nu_3$ and $\nu_4$
of the time-loop contour and on spin degrees of freedom $\sigma$ and $\sigma'$, up to linear-order
terms with respect to $eV$, $T$, and frequencies $\omega$ and $\omega'$. The coefficients of these
linear-order terms are determined by a set of the parameters, defined with respect to the equilibrium
ground state: the phase shift, static susceptibilities, and nonlinear three-body susceptibilities
of the impurity electrons. The low-energy expressions of the vertex components are shown to satisfy
the Ward identities with the Keldysh Green's functions expanded up to terms of order $\omega^2$,
$(eV)^2$, and $T^2$. We also find that the imaginary part of the Ward identities can be described
in terms of the $eV$-dependent collision integrals for a single-quasiparticle excitation and
that for a single quasiparticle-quasihole pair excitation. These collision integrals ensure
the current conservation of the next-to-leading order Fermi-liquid transport due to the quasiparticles
with a finite damping rate.

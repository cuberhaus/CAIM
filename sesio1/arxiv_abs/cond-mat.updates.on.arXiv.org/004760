To efficiently capture the energy of the nuclear bond, advanced nuclear reactor concepts seek solid
fuels that must withstand unprecedented temperature and radiation extremes. In these advanced
fuels, thermal energy transport under irradiation is directly related to reactor performance
as well as reactor safety. The science of thermal transport in nuclear fuel is a grand challenge due
to both computational and experimental complexities. Here, we provide a comprehensive review
of thermal transport research on two actinide oxides: one currently in use in commercial nuclear
reactors, uranium dioxide (UO2), and one advanced fuel candidate material, thorium dioxide (ThO2).
In both materials, heat is carried by lattice waves or phonons. Crystalline defects caused by fission
events effectively scatter phonons and lead to a degradation in fuel performance over time. Bolstered
by new computational and experimental tools, researchers are now developing the foundational
work necessary to accurately model and ultimately control thermal transport in advanced nuclear
fuel. We begin by reviewing research aimed at understanding thermal transport in perfect single
crystals. The absence of defects enables studies that focus on the fundamental aspects of phonon
transport. Next, we review research that targets defect generation and evolution. Here, the focus
is on ion irradiation studies used as surrogates for damage caused by fission products. We end this
review with a discussion of modeling and experimental efforts directed at predicting and validating
mesoscale thermal transport in the presence of irradiation defects. While efforts into these research
areas have been robust, challenging work remains in developing holistic tools to capture and predict
thermal energy transport across widely varying environmental conditions.

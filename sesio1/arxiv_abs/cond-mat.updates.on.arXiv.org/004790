Dissipation and adhesion are important in many areas of materials science, including friction
and lubrication, cold spray deposition, and micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS). Another
interesting problem is the adhesion of mineral grains during the early stages of planetesimal formation
in the early solar system. Molecular-dynamics (MD) simulation has often been used to elucidate
dissipative properties, most often in the simulation of sliding friction. In this paper, we demonstrate
how the reversible and irreversible work associated with interactions between planar surfaces
can be calculated using the dynamical contact simulation approach based on MD and empirical potentials.
Moreover, it is demonstrated how the approach can obtain the free-energy $\Delta A(z)$ as a function
of separation between two slabs using the Jarzynksi equality applied to an ensemble of trajectories
which deviate significantly from equilibrium. Furthermore, the dissipative work can also be obtained
using this method without the need to compute an entire cycle from approach to retraction. It is expected
that this technique might be used to efficiently compute dissipative properties which might enable
the use of more accurate approaches including density-functional theory. In this paper, we present
results obtained for forsterite surfaces both with and without MgO-vacancy surface defects. It
is shown that strong dissipation is possible when MgO-vacancy defects are present. The mechanism
for strong dissipation is connected to the tendency of less strongly-bound surface units to undergo
large displacements including mass transfer between the two surfaces. Systems with strong dissipation
tend to exhibit a long-tailed distribution rather than the Gaussian distribution often anticipated
in near-equilibrium applications of the JE.

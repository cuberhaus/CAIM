Growing energy storage demands on lithium-ion batteries necessitate exploration of new electrochemical
materials as next-generation battery electrode materials. In this work, we investigate the previously
unexplored electrochemical properties of earth-abundant and tunable Zn1-xSn1+xN2 (x = -0.4 to
x = 0.4) thin films, which show high electrical conductivity and high gravimetric capacity for Li
insertion. Enhanced cycling performance is achieved compared to previously published end-members
Zn3N2 and Sn3N4, showing decreased irreversible loss and increased total capacity and cycle stability.
The average reversible capacity observed is > 1050 mAh/g for all compositions and 1220 mAh/g for
Zn-poor (x = 0.2) films. Extremely Zn-rich films (x = -0.4) show improved adhesion; however, Zn-rich
films undergo a phase transformation on the first cycle. Zn-poor and stoichiometric films do not
exhibit significant phase transformations which often plague nitride materials and show no required
overpotential at the 0.5 V plateau. Cation composition x is explored as a mechanism for tuning relevant
mechanical and electrochemical properties, such as capacity, overpotential, phase transformation,
electrical conductivity, and adhesion. The lithiation/delithiation experiments confirm the
reversible electrochemical reactions. Without any binding additives, the as-deposited electrodes
delaminate resulting in fast capacity degradation. We demonstrate the mechanical nature of this
degradation through decreased electrode thinning, resulting in cells with improved cycling stability
due to increased mechanical stability. Combining composition and electrochemical analysis,
this work demonstrates for the first time composition dependent electrochemical properties for
the ternary Zn1-xSn1+xN2 and proposes earth-abundant ternary nitride anodes for increased reversible
capacity and cycling stability.

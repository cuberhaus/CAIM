Pressure not only provides a powerful way to tune the crystal structure of transition metal dichalcogenides
(TMDCs) but also promotes the discovery of exotic electronic states and intriguing phenomena.
Structural transitions from the quasi-two-dimensional layered orthorhombic phase to three-dimensional
cubic pyrite phase, metallization, and superconductivity under high pressure have been observed
experimentally in TMDCs materials PdS2 and PdSe2. Here, we report a theoretical prediction of the
pressure-induced evolutions of crystal structure and electronic structure of PdSSe, an isomorphous
intermediate material of the orthorhombic PdS2 and PdSe2. A series of pressure-induced structural
phase transitions from the layered orthorhombic structure into an intermediate phase, then to
a cubic phase are revealed. The intermediate phase features the same structure symmetry as the ambient
orthorhombic phase, except for drastic collapsed interlayer distances and striking changes of
the coordination polyhedron. Furthermore, the structural phase transitions are accompanied
by electronic structure variations from semiconductor to semimetal, which are attributed to bandwidth
broaden and orbital-selective mechanisms. Especially, the cubic phase PdSSe is distinct from
the cubic PdS2 and PdSe2 materials by breaking inversion and mirror-plane symmetries, but showing
similar superconductivity under high pressure, which is originated from strong electron-phonon
coupling interactions concomitant with topologically nontrivial Weyl and high-fold Fermions.
The intricate interplay between lattice, charge, and orbital degrees of freedom as well as the topologically
nontrivial states in these compounds will further stimulate wide interest to explore the exotic
physics of the TMDCs materials.

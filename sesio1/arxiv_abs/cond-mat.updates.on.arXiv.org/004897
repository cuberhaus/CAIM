Self-assembled fibrillar network (SAFIN) hydrogels and organogels are commonly obtained by a
crystallization process into fibers induced by external stimuli like temperature or pH. The gel-to-sol-to-gel
transition is generally readily reversible and the change rate of the stimulus determines the fiber
homogeneity and eventual elastic properties of the gels. However, recent work shows that in some
specific cases, fibrillation occurs for a given molecular conformation and the sol-to-gel transition
depends on the relative energetic stability of one conformation over the other, and not on the rate
of change of the stimuli. We observe such a phenomenon on a class of bolaform glycolipids, sophorosides,
similar to the well-known sophorolipid biosurfactants, but composed of two symmetric sophorose
units. A combination of oscillatory rheology, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) cryogenic
transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) and in situ rheo-SAXS using synchrotron radiation
shows that below 14$^\circ$C, twisted nanofibers are the thermodynamic phase. Between 14$^\circ$C
and about 33$^\circ$C, nanofibers coexist with micelles and a strong hydrogel forms, the sol-to-gel
transition being readily reversible in this temperature range. However, above the annealing temperature
of about 40$^\circ$C, the micelle morphology becomes kinetically-trapped over hours, even upon
cooling, whichever the rate, to 4$^\circ$C. A combination of solution and solid-state nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) suggests two different conformations of the 1'', 1' and 2' carbon stereocenters
of sophorose, precisely at the $\beta(1,2)$ glycosidic bond, for which several combinations of
the dihedral angles are known to provide at least three energetic minima of comparable magnitude
and each corresponding to a given sophorose conformation.

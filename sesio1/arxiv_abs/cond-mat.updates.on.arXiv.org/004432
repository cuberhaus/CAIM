As with like particles in ordinary vacuum, quasi-particles are elementary excitations of the ground
state of condensed matter quantum phases. Demonstrating that they keep quantum coherence while
propagating is a fundamental issue and an important challenge for their manipulation for quantum
information tasks. This is particularly the case for the quasi-particles called anyons of the Fractional
Quantum Hall Effect (FQHE), a quantum phase displayed by two-dimensional electronic conductors
in high magnetic fields. These fractionally charged quasi-particles obey anyonic statistics
intermediate between fermionic and bosonic. Their quantum coherence has been observed by their
transmission through the discrete localized states of electronic Fabry-P\'erot interferometers.
Surprisingly, no quantum interference of anyons was observed in electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometers
for which the quasi-particle transmission occurs via propagating states forming a continuum of
states. Here we address this puzzle by demonstrating that FQHE anyons do keep a finite quantum coherence
while propagating along extended states by using a different kind of interferometry, namely two-particle
time-domain interference using an electronic beam-splitter. By varying the time delay between
photo-created electron-hole pairs and measuring cross-correlated noise sensitive to the two-particle
Hanbury Brown Twiss (HBT) phase, we observe strong quasi-particle interference. Visibilities
as high as 53% and 60% are observed for e/5 and e/3 charged anyons propagating on the FQHE chiral edges
modes. Our results give a positive message for the challenge of performing controlled quantum coherent
braiding of anyons and call for a better understanding of the absence of interference in Mach-Zehnder
interferometers.

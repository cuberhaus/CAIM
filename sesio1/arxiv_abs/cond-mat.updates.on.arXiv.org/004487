This paper addresses the long standing and controversial issue of the origin of superconductivity
in cuprates. Their superconductivity can be attributed to amphoteric defects associated with
vacancy sites in copper oxide planes. A local defect lattice relaxation results in a negative-$U$
energy binding two holes on amphoteric defects in the donor configuration that act as preformed
boson pair. Thermodynamic equilibrium between defects in the donor and acceptor configurations
stabilizes Fermi energy at the amphoteric defect charge transition state assuring resonant coupling
between free holes and the localized hole pairs. Model calculations show that the critical temperature
is primarily determined by the density of the amphoteric defects in the donor configuration, explaining
the ubiquity of dome-like dependence of the critical temperature on the doping as well as its universal
dependence on the superfluid density. Intentional doping with chemical acceptors or donors is
neither necessary nor sufficient condition for superconductivity that is fully determined by
the amphoteric defects whose concentration can be controlled by crystal nonstoichiometry. The
only role of chemical doping is changing the balance between concentrations of amphoteric defects
in the donor and acceptor configurations resulting in an increase of the superfluid density and
thus also the critical temperature for acceptor and a decrease for donor doping. This accounts for
the experimentally observed distinct asymmetry between the dome structures for the chemical doping
with acceptors and donors. The unusual sensitivity of the critical temperature to external perturbations
is explained by the resonant nature of the coupling between free holes and preformed hole pairs.
The work has broader implications as it could be applicable to other superconductors with dome-like
dependence of the critical temperature on doping.

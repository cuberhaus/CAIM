We propose a method to parameterize a coarse grained model for the hydrodynamic friction between
nearly touching rough spheres in suspension flows. The frictional resistance due to surface roughness
primarily alters the sliding and rolling modes of motion of rough particles. Stokesian dynamics
simulations incorporating a near-field pairwise resistance model accounting for these enhanced
frictional modes were employed to compute particle trajectories in shear flow. In this model, the
resistance to sliding and rolling modes of motion are augmented from a weakly diverging log$(1/h)$
form for smooth spheres to a strongly diverging $1/h$ form for rough spheres to account for the additional
resistance due to squeezing flows between surface asperities, where $h$ is the mean surface separation
between particles. We determine new bounds on the relative magnitude of the augmentations to the
resistance to different modes of motion using inequality constraints reflecting the positive
definiteness of the Stokes resistance tensor for a pair of rough particles. Using the simulations
of a particle pair in a shear flow, a simple model for angular rotation rate of the pair centerline
is computed as a function of its orientation in the shear flow and the free parameters of the hydrodynamic
resistance model: the friction coupling strength, $\alpha$, and friction coupling range, $h_0$.
Values of $\alpha$ and $h_0$ for real-world rough particles can then be inferred by matching the
pair rotation rate in the model to experimental observations when a dilute rough particle suspension
is subjected to a linear shear flow. The same model is used to calculate the hydrodynamic contribution
to the high frequency viscosity of rough particle suspensions. For different $\alpha$ and $h_0$,
we observe that the viscosity diverges differently depending on $h_0$.

The diode effect is fundamental to electronic devices and is widely used in rectifiers and AC-DC
converters. At low temperatures, however, conventional semiconductor diodes possess a high resistivity,
which yields energy loss and heating during operation. The superconducting diode effect (SDE),
which relies on broken inversion symmetry in a superconductor may mitigate this obstacle: in one
direction a zero-resistance supercurrent can flow through the diode, but for the opposite direction
of current flow, the device enters the normal state with ohmic resistance. The application of a magnetic
field can induce SDE in Nb/V/Ta superlattices with a polar structure, in superconducting devices
with asymmetric patterning of pinning centres, or in superconductor/ferromagnet hybrid devices
with induced vortices. The need for an external magnetic field limits their practical application.
Recently, a field-free SDE was observed in a NbSe2/Nb3Br8/NbSe2 junction, and it originates from
asymmetric Josephson tunneling that is induced by the Nb3Br8 barrier and the associated NbSe2/Nb3Br8
interfaces. Here, we present another implementation of zero-field SDE using noncentrosymmetric
[Nb/V/Co/V/Ta]20 multilayers. The magnetic layers provide the necessary symmetry breaking and
we can tune the SDE by adjusting the structural parameters, such as the constituent elements, film
thickness, stacking order, and number of repetitions. We control the polarity of the SDE through
the magnetization direction of the ferromagnetic layers. Artificially stacked structures, as
the one used in this work, are of particular interest as they are compatible with microfabrication
techniques and can be integrated with devices such as Josephson junctions. Energy-loss-free SDEs
as presented in this work may therefore enable novel non-volatile memories and logic circuits with
ultralow power consumption.

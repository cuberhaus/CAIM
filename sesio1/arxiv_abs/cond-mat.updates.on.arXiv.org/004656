Point by point strain scanning is often used to map the residual stress (strain) in engineering materials
and components. However, the gauge volume and hence spatial resolution is limited by the beam defining
apertures and can be anisotropic for very low and high diffraction (scattering) angles. Alternatively,
wavelength resolved neutron transmission imaging has a potential to retrieve information tomographically
about residual strain induced within materials through measurement in transmission of Bragg edges
- crystallographic fingerprints whose locations and shapes depend on microstructure and strain
distribution. In such a case the spatial resolution is determined by the geometrical blurring of
the measurement setup and the detector point spread function. Mathematically, reconstruction
of strain tensor field is described by the longitudinal ray transform; this transform has a non-trivial
null-space, making direct inversion impossible. A combination of the longitudinal ray transform
with physical constraints was used to reconstruct strain tensor fields in convex objects. To relax
physical constraints and generalise reconstruction, a recently introduced concept of histogram
tomography can be employed. Histogram tomography relies on our ability to resolve the distribution
of strain in the beam direction, as we discuss in the paper. More specifically, Bragg edge strain
tomography requires extraction of the second moment (variance about zero) of the strain distribution
which has not yet been demonstrated in practice. In this paper we verify experimentally that the
second moment can be reliably measured for a previously well characterised aluminium ring and plug
sample. We compare experimental measurements against numerical calculation and further support
our conclusions by rigorous uncertainty quantification of the estimated mean and variance of the
strain distribution.

Euclidean Q-ball type solutions carrying Cooper/local-pair condensates inside finite volume
with classically oscillating in Matsubara time spin-/charge densities (SDW/CDW) are found in
the 'nested' repulsive Hubbard model of high-T$_c$ superconductors. Euclidean Q-ball solutions
arise due to global invariance of the effective theory under the phase rotation of the Fourier amplitudes
of SDW/CDW fluctuations, leading to conservation of a 'Noether charge' Q along the Matsubara time
axis. It is demonstrated analytically by integration over fermions, that effective potential
of the SDW/CDW fluctuations possesses famous local minimum, the sufficient condition of Q-balls
formation, analogous to the supersymmetric standard model of squarks. Exchange by SDW/CDW modes
populating the local minimum provides `pairing glue' for the fermions forming Cooper/local-pairs.
We show that below some temperature $T^{*}$ the classical SDW/CDW fluctuations arise simultaneously
with the superconducting condensate density inside Q-balls of finite volumes via 1$^{st}$ order
phase transition. Below $T^{*}$ the volume of the Q-balls is inversely proportional to the square
of SDW/CDW fluctuation amplitude. The fermionic spectral gap inside Euclidean Q-balls arises
in the vicinity of the 'nested' regions of the bare Fermi surface and scales with the square root of
the superconducting density. All solutions are found from the Eliashberg like equations for the
two cases of 'nesting' wave vectors: a CDW wave vector $Q_{CDW}$, connecting regions near the Fermi
surface with equal signs of the superconducting order parameter, a SDW wave vector $Q_{SDW}$, connecting
regions with the opposite signs of the $d$-wave superconducting order parameter. Possible relation
of the presented theory with thermodynamic time-crystals and different properties of high-T$_c$
superconductors is discussed.

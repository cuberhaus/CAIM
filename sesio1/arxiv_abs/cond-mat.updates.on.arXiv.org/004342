Autonomous locomotion is a ubiquitous phenomenon in biology and in physics of active systems at
microscopic scale. This includes prokaryotic, eukaryotic cells (crawling and swimming) and artificial
swimmers. An outstanding feature is the ability of these entities to follow complex trajectories,
ranging from straight, curved (circular, helical...), to random-like ones. The non-straight
nature of these trajectories is often explained as a consequence of the asymmetry of the particle
or the medium in which it moves, or due to the presence of bounding walls, etc... Here, we show that
straight, circular and helical trajectories emerge naturally in the absence of asymmetry of the
swimmer or that of suspending medium. Our first proof is based on general considerations, without
referring to an explicit form of a model. We show that these three trajectories correspond to self-congruent
solutions. Self-congruency means that the states of the system at different moments of time can
be made identical by an appropriate combination of rotation and translation of the coordinate space.
We show that these solutions are exhibited by spherically symmetric particles as a result of a series
of pitchfork bifurcations as the activity is increased. Self-congruent dynamics in one and two
dimensions are analyzed as well. Finally, we present a simple explicit nonlinear exactly solvable
model of fully isotropic phoretic particle that shows the transitions from a non-motile state to
straight motion to circular motion to helical motion as a series of spontaneous symmetry-breaking
bifurcations. Whether a system exhibits or not a given trajectory only depends on the numerical
values of parameters entering the model, while asymmetry of swimmer shape, or anisotropy of the
suspending medium , or influence of bounding walls are not necessary.

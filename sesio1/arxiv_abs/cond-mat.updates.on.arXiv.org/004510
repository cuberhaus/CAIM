The renormalization group equations describing a finite 2DXY system with fourfold anisotropy
are solved in two steps, in order to study the magnetic transition to paramagnetism in an ultrathin
film. First, the equations are linearized near the critical coupling $K=J/k_BT=2/\pi$. This allows
integration constants to be evaluated at the fixed point, and the tuning of the constants to represent
a ferromagnetic ultrathin film. An exact solution of the linearized equations confirms that a finite-size
Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) transition can occur in the presence of fourfold anisotropy, but the
solution is not quantitatively reliable across the temperature range of the finite-size transition.
In the second approach, the fourfold anisotropy is treated as a perturbation. The perturbative
treatment provides a quantitative determination of the renormalized exchange coupling, vortex
density, and anisotropy throughout the transition. In particular, the coupling has a point of inflection
where vortex-antivortex pairs unbind (as opposed to a "universal jump"), and goes to zero asymptotically
in the paramagnetic state. These results are used to calculate the magnetic susceptibility as the
system moves from one dominated by spin waves to one dominated by a free vortex gas. The presence of
anisotropy makes it necessary to include both the susceptibility $\chi_{||}$ due to fluctuations
of the magnitude of the magnetization, and $\chi_\perp$ due to angular fluctuations of the magnetization
about an easy axis. Comparison to recent measurements of the magnetic susceptibility of ultrathin
Fe/W(001) films suggest that a detailed quantitative analysis of the measurements can provide
information on vortex formation, the disappearance of anisotropy, and dissipative processes
in the finite-size KT transition of a real system.

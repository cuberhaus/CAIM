Solitons are typically stable objects in 1D models, but their straightforward extensions to 2D
and 3D settings tend to be unstable. In particular, the ubiquitous nonlinear Schroedinger (NLS)
equation with the cubic self-focusing, creates only unstable 2D and 3D solitons, because the same
equation gives rise to the critical and supercritical collapse in the 2D and 3D cases, respectively.
This article offers, first, a review of relevant settings which, nevertheless, make it possible
to create stable 2D and 3D solitons, including ones with embedded vorticity. The main stabilization
schemes considered here are: (i) competing (e.g., cubic-quintic) and saturable nonlinearities;
(2) linear and nonlinear trapping potentials; (3) the Lee-Huang-Yang correction to the BEC dynamics,
leading to the formation of robust quantum droplets; (4) spin-orbit-coupling (SOC) effects in
binary BEC; (5) emulation of SOC in nonlinear optical waveguides, including PT-symmetric ones.
Further, a detailed summary is presented for results which demonstrate the creation of stable 2D
and 3D solitons by schemes based on the usual linear trapping potentials or effective nonlinear
ones, which may be induced by means of spatial modulation of the local nonlinearity strength. The
latter setting is especially promising, making it possible to use self-defocusing media, with
the local nonlinearity strength growing fast enough from the center to periphery, for the creation
of a great variety of stable multidimensional modes. In addition to fundamental ones and vortex
rings, the 3D modes may be hopfions, i.e., twisted vortex rings with two independent topological
charges. Many results for the multidimensional solitons are obtained, in such settings, not only
in a numerical form, but also by means of analytical methods, such as the variational and Thomas-Fermi
approximations.

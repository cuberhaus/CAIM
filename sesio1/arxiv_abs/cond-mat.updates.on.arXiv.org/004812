We construct exact eigenstates of multicomponent Hubbard models in arbitrary dimensions by generalizing
the $\eta$-pairing mechanism. Our models include the SU($N$) Hubbard model as a special case. Unlike
the conventional two-component case, the generalized $\eta$-pairing mechanism permits the construction
of eigenstates that feature off-diagonal long-range order and magnetic long-range order. These
states form fragmented fermionic condensates due to a simultaneous condensation of multicomponent
$\eta$ pairs. While the $\eta$-pairing states in the SU(2) Hubbard model are based on the $\eta$-pairing
symmetry, the exact eigenstates in the $N$-component system with $N\geq 3$ arise not from symmetry
of the Hamiltonian but from a spectrum generating algebra defined in a Hilbert subspace. We exploit
this fact to show that the generalized $\eta$-pairing eigenstates do not satisfy the eigenstate
thermalization hypothesis and serve as quantum many-body scar states. This result indicates a
weak breakdown of ergodicity in the $N$-component Hubbard models for $N\geq 3$. Furthermore, we
show that these exact eigenstates constitute integrable subsectors in which the Hubbard Hamiltonian
effectively reduces to a non-interacting model. This partial integrability causes various multicomponent
Hubbard models to weakly break ergodicity. We propose a method of harnessing dissipation to distill
the integrable part of the dynamics and elucidate a mechanism of non-thermalization caused by dissipation.
This work establishes the coexistence of off-diagonal long-range order and SU($N$) magnetism
in excited eigenstates of the multicomponent Hubbard models, which presents a possibility of novel
out-of-equilibrium pairing states of multicomponent fermions. These models unveil a unique feature
of quantum thermalization of multicomponent fermions, which can experimentally be tested with
cold-atom quantum simulators.

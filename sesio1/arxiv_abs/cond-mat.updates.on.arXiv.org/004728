Si-doped GaN films were grown on $\textit{c}$-sapphire by rf magnetron reactive co-sputtering
of GaAs and Si at various partial pressures of N$_2$ in Ar-N2 growth atmosphere and their epitaxial
character was ascertained by phi-scans. Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy revealed $\thicksim$2
at.% Si in all the films, but the N/Ga ratio decreased substantially as N$_2$ percentage was reduced
from 100% to 10%. High resolution x-ray diffraction revealed the dominant presence of edge dislocations
($\thicksim$10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$) in the films grown at 30% - 100% N$_2$, which decreased to $\thicksim$5
x 10$^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$ at lower N$_2$ percentages, at which, the density of screw dislocations was
found to increase and attained values comparable to that of edge dislocations. The lattice parameters
($\textit{a}$ and $\textit{c}$) were obtained independently to determine the in-plane and out-of-plane
components of strain in films, which were analyzed to deduce the hydrostatic and biaxial strain
contributions. The film grown at 100% N$_2$ displayed large micro-strain and hydrostatic strain
due to excess/interstitial nitrogen, both of which decreased with the initial reduction of N$_2$
percentage, but increased again below 30% N$_2$ due to Ar incorporation. The films grown above 75%
N$_2$ displayed compressive biaxial stress, which is attributed to possible nitrogen incorporation
into grain boundaries and tensile side of edge dislocations. The reversal of biaxial stress to tensile
character in films grown below 75% N$_2$ is explained by the prevalence of in-plane tensile stress
generated during coalescence. The tensile stress decreased in films grown below 30% N$_2$, which
is ascribed to the Ar incorporation and voided morphology. The presence of Si in the films does not
have a significant influence on strain behaviour and appears to be masked by the dominant growth-related
intrinsic effects.

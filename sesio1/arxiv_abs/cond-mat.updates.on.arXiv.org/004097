Hawkes point processes are first-order non-Markovian stochastic models of intermittent bursty
dynamics with applications to physical, seismic, epidemic, biological, financial, and social
systems. While accounting for positive feedback loops that may lead to critical phenomena in complex
systems, the standard linear Hawkes process only describes excitative phenomena. To describe
the co-existence of excitatory and inhibitory effects (or negative feedbacks), extensions involving
nonlinear dependences of the intensity as a function of past activity are needed. However, such
nonlinear Hawkes processes have been found hitherto to be analytically intractable due to the interplay
between their non-Markovian and nonlinear characteristics, with no analytical solutions available.
Here, we present various exact and robust asymptotic solutions to nonlinear Hawkes processes using
the field master equation approach. We report explicit power law formulas for the steady state intensity
distributions $P_{\mathrm{ss}}(\lambda)\propto \lambda^{-1-a}$, where the tail exponent
$a$ is expressed analytically as a function of parameters of the nonlinear Hawkes models. We present
three robust interesting characteristics of the nonlinear Hawkes process: (i) for one-sided positive
marks (i.e., in the absence of inhibitory effects), the nonlinear Hawkes process can exhibit any
power law relation either as intermediate asymptotics ($a\leq 0$) or as true asymptotics ($a>0$)
by appropriate model selection; (ii) for distribution of marks with zero mean (i.e., for balanced
excitatory and inhibitory effects), the Zipf law ($a\approx 1$) is universally observed for a wide
class of nonlinear Hawkes processes with fast-accelerating intensity map; (iii) for marks with
a negative mean, the asymptotic power law tail becomes lighter with an exponent increasing above
1 ($a>1$) as the mean mark becomes more negative.

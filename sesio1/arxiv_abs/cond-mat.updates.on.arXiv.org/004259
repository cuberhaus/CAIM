Amongst the available theories for accurately modeling electronic excited states, methods able
to simultaneously account for both static and dynamic electron correlations have been considered,
not only to model photochemical events, but also to provide reference values for vertical transition
energies, hence allowing to benchmark lower-order models. In this category, both the complete-active-space
second-order perturbation theory (CASPT2) and the $N$-electron valence state second-order perturbation
theory (NEVPT2) are certainly popular, the latter presenting the advantage of not requiring the
application of the empirical ionization-potential-electron-affinity (IPEA) and level shifts.
However, the actual accuracy of these multiconfigurational approaches is not settled yet. In this
context, the present work relies on highly-accurate \emph{aug}-cc-pVTZ vertical transition
energies for 284 excited states of diverse character determined in 35 small- to medium-sized organic
molecules containing from three to six non-hydrogen atoms to assess the performances of these approaches.
The CASPT2 calculations are performed with and without IPEA shift and compared to the partially-contracted
(PC) and strongly-contracted (SC) variants of NEVPT2. We find that both CASPT2 with IPEA shift and
PC-NEVPT2 provide fairly reliable vertical transition energy estimates, with slight overestimations
and mean absolute errors of $0.11$ and $0.13$ eV, respectively. These values are found to be rather
uniform for the various subgroups of transitions. The present work completes our previous benchmarks
focussed on single-reference wave function methods (\textit{J.~Chem. Theory Comput.} \textbf{14},
4360 (2018); \emph{ibid.}, \textbf{16}, 1711 (2020)), hence allowing for a fair comparison between
various families of electronic structure methods.

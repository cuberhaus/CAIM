We are witnessing a great transition towards a society powered by renewable energies to meet the
ever-stringent climate target. Hydrogen, as an energy carrier, will play a key role in building
a climate-neutral society. Although liquid hydrogen is essential for hydrogen storage and transportation,
liquefying hydrogen is costly with the conventional methods based on Joule-Thomas effect. As an
emerging technology which is potentially more efficient, magnetocaloric hydrogen liquefaction
is a "game-changer". In this work, we have investigated the rare-earth-based Laves phases RAl2
and RNi2 for magnetocaloric hydrogen liquefaction. We have noticed an unaddressed feature that
the magnetocaloric effect of second-order magnetocaloric materials can become "giant" near the
hydrogen boiling point. This feature indicates strong correlations, down to the boiling point
of hydrogen, among the three important quantities of the magnetocaloric effect: the maximum magnetic
entropy change, the maximum adiabatic temperature change, and the Curie temperature. Via a comprehensive
literature review, we interpret the correlations for a rare-earth intermetallic series as two
rules: (1) maximum magnetic entropy change increases with decreasing Curie temperature; (2) maximum
adiabatic temperature change decreases near room temperature with decreasing Curie temperature
but increases at cryogenic temperatures. Moreover, we have developed a mean-field approach to
describe these two rules theoretically. The dependence of maximum magnetocaloric effect on Curie
temperature revealed in this work helps us quickly anticipate the magnetocaloric performance
of rare-earth-based compounds, guiding material design and accelerating the discoveries of magnetocaloric
materials for hydrogen liquefaction. More importantly, our work demonstrates a phenomenon in
cryogenic physics that "cool" favors magnetic cooling.

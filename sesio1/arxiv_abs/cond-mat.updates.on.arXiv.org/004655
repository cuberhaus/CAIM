The design of novel cathode materials for Li-ion batteries requires accurate first-principles
predictions of structural, electronic, and magnetic properties as well as intercalation voltages
in compounds containing transition-metal (TM) elements. For such systems, density-functional
theory (DFT) with standard (semi-)local exchange-correlation functionals is of no use as it fails
dramatically due to strong self-interaction (delocalization) errors for the partially filled
d shells of the TMs. Here, we perform the first comparative study of the phospho-olivine cathode
materials Li$_x$MnPO$_4$, Li$_x$FePO$_4$, and mixed-TM Li$_x$Mn$_{1/2}$Fe$_{1/2}$PO$_4$
($x=0, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1$) using four electronic structure methods: DFT, DFT+$U$, DFT+$U$+$V$,
and HSE06. We show that DFT+$U$+$V$ outperforms the other three methods, provided that the on-site
$U$ and intersite $V$ Hubbard parameters are determined from first-principles and self-consistently
with respect to the structural parameters by means of density-functional perturbation theory
(linear response). In particular, we demonstrate that DFT+$U$+$V$ is the only method that correctly
predicts the digital change in oxidation states of the TM ions in all compounds for the mixed-valence
phases occurring at intermediate Li concentrations, leading to voltages in remarkable agreement
with experiments. We thus show that the inclusion of intersite Hubbard interactions is essential
for the accurate prediction of thermodynamic quantities when electronic localization occurs
while in the presence of inter-atomic orbital hybridization. At variance with the other methods,
DFT+$U$+$V$ alone is capable to describe such localization-hybridization interplay, and thus
opens the door for the study of more complex cathode materials as well as for a reliable exploration
of the chemical space of compounds for Li-ion batteries.

Transmission electron microscopy has suffered from information loss during observation often
ascribed to the structural changes of a specimen into a different substance, known as radiation
damage. The damage in organic matters predominantly occurs via ionization (radiolysis). Although
radiolysis is highly important, studies on radiolysis have largely been descriptive and qualitative,
because of the complexity of the process and the difficulty to quantify the changes under variable
temperature and variable acceleration voltage (VT/VV) conditions. We report here the kinetic
study of the dimerization of a van der Waals dimer [60]fullerene (C60) into C120 in carbon nanotube
(CNT), in which we found five competing reaction pathways that serve as model pathways of radiolysis
damage. We found marked influence of the temperature, the acceleration voltage, and the properties
of the CNT, and reaction paths have been distinguished by the pre-exponential factor and the Arrhenius
activation energy. The most frequently occurring reaction took place via singlet (S1) or triplet
(T1) species generated by energy transfer from CNT exciton. We found an experimental model on how
CNT protects the specimen from radiolysis, which accounts for the stability of a variety of molecules
having low-lying HOMOs. We also observed a radiolysis pathway taking place in a heavily damaged
CNT. The triplet reaction also occurs when we use an oxidized CNT which is known to form a triplet exciton.
The VT/VV behavior of the kinetics agrees with the competitive occurrence of electron excitation
and ionization but not with the atomic displacement damage mechanism. The result provides an illustration
of the potential of atomic resolution video imaging of chemical events for elucidation of the mechanisms
of chemical reactions.

The earliest known examples of quantum superposition were found in organic chemistry -- in molecules
that `resonate' among multiple arrangements of $\pi$-bonds. Small molecules such as benzene resonate
among a few bond arrangements. In contrast, a large system that stretches over a macroscopic lattice
may resonate among an extensive number of configurations. This is analogous to a quantum spin liquid
as described by Anderson's resonating valence bond (RVB) picture. In this article, we study the
intermediate case of somewhat large molecules, the C$_{20}$ and C$_{60}$ fullerenes. We build
a minimal description in terms of quantum dimer models, allowing for local resonance processes
and repulsion between proximate $\pi$-bonds. This allows us to characterize ground-states, e.g.,
with C$_{60}$ forming a superposition of 5828 dimer covers. Despite the large number of contributing
dimer covers, the ground state shows strong dimer-dimer correlations. Going beyond the ground
state, the full spectrum of C$_{60}$ shows many interesting features. Its Hilbert space is bipartite,
leading to spectral reflection symmetry. It has a large number of protected zero-energy states.
In addition, the spectrum contains many scar-like states, corresponding to localized dimer-rearrangement-dynamics.
Resonance dynamics in QDMs can manifest in the behaviour of defects, potentially binding defects
via an effective attractive interaction. To test this notion, we introduce pairs of vacancies at
all possible separations. Resonance energy reaches its lowest value when the vacancies are closest
to one another. This suggests confinement of monomers, albeit within a finite cluster. We discuss
qualitative pictures for understanding bonding in fullerenes and draw connections with results
from quantum chemistry.

We consider a Bogolibov-de Geenes (BdG) Hamiltonian, which is a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian with
pseudo-Hermiticity, for a system of (pseudo) spin-$1/2$ bosons in a honeycomb lattice under the
condition that the population difference between the two spin components, i.e., magnetization,
is a constant. Such a system is capable of acting as a topological amplifier, under time-reversal
symmetry, with stable bulk bands but unstable edge modes which can be populated at an exponentially
fast rate. We quantitatively study the topological properties of this model within the framework
of the 38-fold way for non-Hermitian systems. We find, through the symmetry analysis of the Bloch
Hamiltonian, that this model is classified either as two copies of symmetry class AIII+$\eta_-$
or two copies of symmetry class A+$\eta$ depending on whether the (total) system is time-reversal-symmetric,
where $\eta$ is the matrix representing pseudo-Hermiticity and $\eta_-$ indicates that pseudo-Hermiticity
and chiral symmetry operators anticommute. We prove, within the context of non-Hermitian physics
where eigenstates obey the bi-orthonormality relation, that a stable bulk is characterized by
a single topological invariant, the Chern number for the Haldane model, independent of pairing
interactions. We construct a convenient analytical description for the edge modes of the Haldane
model in semi-infinite planes, which is expected to be useful for models built upon copies of the
Haldane model across a broad array of disciplines. We adapt the theorem in our recent work [Phys.
Rev. A 104, 013305 (2021)] to pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians that are less restrictive than BdG
Hamiltonians and apply it to highlight that the vanishing of an unconventional commutator between
number-conserving and number-nonconserving parts of the Hamiltonian indicates whether a system
can be made to act as a topological amplifier.

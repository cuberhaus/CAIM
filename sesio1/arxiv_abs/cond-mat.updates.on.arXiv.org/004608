Fitting percolation into the conformal field theory framework requires showing that connection
probabilities have a conformally invariant scaling limit. For critical site percolation on the
triangular lattice, we prove that the probability that $n$ vertices belong to the same open cluster
has a well-defined scaling limit for every $n \geq 2$. Moreover, the limiting functions $P_n(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$
transform covariantly under M\"obius transformations of the plane as well as under local conformal
maps, i.e., they behave like correlation functions of primary operators in conformal field theory.
In particular, they are invariant under translations, rotations and inversions, and $P_n(sx_1,\ldots,sx_n)=s^{-5n/48}P_n(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$
for any $s>0$. This implies that the ratio $P_3(x_1,x_2,x_3)/\sqrt{P_2(x_1,x_2)P_2(x_1,x_3)P_2(x_2,x_3)}$
is independent of $x_1,x_2,x_3$, which confirms a prediction of the physics literature. We also
define a site-diluted spin model whose $n$-point correlation functions $\mathrm{C}_{n}$ can
be expressed in terms of percolation connection probabilities and, as a consequence, have a well-defined
scaling limit with the same properties as the functions $P_n$. In particular, $\mathrm{C}_{2}(x_1,x_2)=P_{2}(x_1,x_2)$.
We prove that the magnetization field associated with this spin model has a well-defined scaling
limit in an appropriate space of distributions. The limiting field transforms covariantly under
M\"obius transformations with exponent (scaling dimension) $5/48$. A heuristic analysis of the
four-point function of the magnetization field reveals the presence of an additional conformal
field of scaling dimension $5/4$, which counts the number of percolation four-arm events and can
be identified with the so-called "four-leg operator" of conformal field theory.

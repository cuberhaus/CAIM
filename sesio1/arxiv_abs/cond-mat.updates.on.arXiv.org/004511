We review the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem and its variants, which are no-go theorems that state
that a quantum many-body system with certain conditions cannot have a locally-unique gapped ground
state. We restrict ourselves to one-dimensional quantum spin systems and discuss both the generalized
Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem for models with U(1) symmetry and the extended Lieb-Schultz-Mattis
theorem for models with discrete symmetry. We also discuss the implication of the same arguments
to systems on the infinite cylinder, both with the periodic boundary conditions and with the spiral
boundary conditions. For models with U(1) symmetry, we here present a rearranged version of the
standard proof, which goes back to Lieb, Schultz, and Mattis, based on the twist operator. As the
title suggests we take a modern topological point of view and prove the generalized Lieb-Schultz-Mattis
theorem by making use of a topological index (which coincides with the filling factor). By a topological
index, we mean an index that characterizes a locally-unique gapped ground state and is invariant
under continuous (or smooth) modification of the ground state. For models with discrete symmetry,
we describe the basic idea of the most general proof, which is based on the topological index introduced
in the context of symmetry protected topological phases. We start from background materials such
as the classification of projective representations of the symmetry group. We also review the notion
that we call a locally-unique gapped ground state of a quantum spin system on an infinite lattice
and present basic theorems. This notion turns out to be natural and useful from the physicists' point
of view. We have tried to make the present article readable and almost self-contained. We only assume
basic knowledge about quantum spin systems.

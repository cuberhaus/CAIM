Nematic systems are two component superconductors that break rotational symmetry, but exhibit
a mixed symmetry that couples spatial rotations and phase difference rotations. We show that a consequence
of this induced spatial anisotropy is mixed normal modes, that is the linear response to a small perturbation
of the system about its ground state, generally couples magnetic and condensate degrees of freedom.
We will study the effect of mode mixing on the magnetic response of a nematic system as the strength
of applied field is increased. In general we show that the coupled modes generate magnetic field
perpendicular to the applied field, causing the magnetic response to spontaneously twist direction.
We will study this for the Meissner effect with weak fields and also for stronger applied fields,
which produce a mixture of Skyrmions and composite vortices, forming orientation dependent bound
states. We will also calculate the anisotropies of the resulting first and second critical fields
$H_{c_1}$ and $H_{c_2}$. The Skyrmion lattices for $H_{c_1} \leq H \leq H_{c_2}$ in nematic superconductors
are shown to be structurally complicated, in contrast to the triangular or square vortex lattices
in conventional superconductors. For low fields the magnetic response of the system involves a
loosely bound collection of parallel Skyrmion chains. As the external field is increased the chains
attract one another, causing a transition where the unit cell becomes triangular for high applied
fields. This unique Skyrmion lattice and the magnetic twisting are clear indicators that could
be used experimentally to identify materials that exhibit nematic superconductivity. To obtain
these results we develop and present a novel method to find the unit cell of a vortex lattice that can
be applied to other kinds of superconducting systems.

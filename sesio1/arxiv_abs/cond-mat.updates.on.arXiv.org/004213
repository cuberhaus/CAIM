The role of Cr incorporation into the ZnO were probed through investigations into the structural,
optical and magnetic properties. Zn1-xCrxO with x = 0, 0.01, 0.03 and 0.05, nanoparticles were prepared
by solution combustion method. Powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) results reveal, all the synthesized
samples are in single hexagonal wurtzite crystal structures, indicating that Cr3+ ions substitute
the Zn2+ ions without altering the structure. The crystallite size and microstrain were calculated
using the Willamson-Hall method and found to be 36 +- 2 nm for ZnO and it reduced with the increase of
Cr dopant concentration to 20 +- 2 nm for Zn0.95Cr0.05O. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
revealed that the particle size were 48 +- 2 nm, 29 +- 2 nm and 25 +- 2 nm for the Zn1-xCrxO with x = 0, 0.03
and 0.05, respectively. TEM morphology indicated particles are agglomerated in the doped samples.
The band-gap decreases slightly from 3.305 +- 0.003 eV to 3.292 +- 0.003 eV with increase of Cr content
from x = 0 to 0.05, respectively. Photoluminescence measurements revealed the presence of defects
in the samples, associated with zinc vacancies and singly ionized oxygen vacancy. The field-dependent
magnetization measurements of ZnO and Cr-doped ZnO were carried out using a vibrating sample magnetometer
(VSM) at 300 K. All the samples exhibits ferromagnetic behavior. This long-range ferromagnetism
ordering observed in ZnO is explained based on bound magnetic polaron (BMP) mechanism. The singly
ionized oxygen vacancies playing a crucial role in observed room temperature ferromagnetism (RTFM)
in ZnO. There is a sufficient amount of BMPs formed in Cr doped ZnO because of the defects present in
these samples. Therefore, the overlapping of BMPs results in the RTFM. However, the antiferromagnetic
coupling at a higher doping concentration of Cr, weakens the observed RTFM.

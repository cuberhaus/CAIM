We investigate the dependence of magnetic properties on the out-of-plane disorder strength $\Delta$,
dipolar interaction strength $h^{}_d$ in two-dimensional ($l^{}_x\times l^{}_y$) ensembles
of nanoparticles using numerical simulations. Such positional defects are redundantly observed
in experiments. The superparamagnetic character is dominant with negligible and weak interaction
strength $h^{}_d$, irrespective of $\Delta$ and aspect ratio of the system $A^{}_r=l^{}_y/l^{}_x$.
The double-loop hysteresis curve, characteristics of antiferromagnetic coupling dominance,
emerges with large $h^{}_d$ and $\Delta(\%)\leq5$ in the square-like nanoparticles' assays.
Remarkably, the dipolar interaction of sufficient strength drives the magnetic order from antiferromagnetic
to ferromagnetic with large $\Delta$ and $A^{}_r\leq4.0$, resulting in an enhancement in the hysteresis
loop area. On the other hand, the ferromagnetic coupling gets increased with $h^{}_d$ in systems
with huge $A^{}_r$. Consequently, the hysteresis loop is enormous, even with moderate $h^{}_d$.
The variation of the coercive field $\mu^{}_oH^{}_c$, remanence $M^{}_r$, and amount of heat released
$E^{}_H$ (due to the hysteresis) with these parameters also suggests the transformation of nature
dipolar interaction. They are significant even with large $h^{}_d$ and smaller $A^{}_r$, indicating
the antiferromagnetic coupling dominance. Interestingly, there is an enhancement in these with
$\Delta$ and large $h^{}_d$ due to ferromagnetic interaction. Notably, they are very significant
even with moderate $h^{}_d$ in the highly anisotropic system and external field along the long axis
of the sample. These results could help the experimentalist in explaining the unusual hysteresis
characteristics observed in such systems and should also be beneficial in diverse applications
such as data storage, magnetic hyperthermia, etc.

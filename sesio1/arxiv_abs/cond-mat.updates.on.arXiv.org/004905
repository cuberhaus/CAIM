Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene displays a rich phase diagram typical of a strongly correlated
electronic system. Until now, the contribution of lattice dynamics has been mostly overlooked
in favour of Coulomb repulsion, which seems however unable to provide a coherent explanation of
all key experimental evidences. Nonetheless, the emergent $U_v(1)$ valley-symmetry, characterising
both electronic structure and superlattice normal modes, leads to an extremely strong $e\times
E$ Jahn-Teller electron-phonon coupling. We here show that this coupling positively interplay
with Coulomb repulsion to stabilize topological Jahn-Teller Mott insulators throughout the phase
diagram.\\ Indeed, a static Jahn-Teller effect, microscopically characterized by a Kekul\'e
distortion localised into the AA stacked regions, yields a mean-field insulator at charge neutrality
that conserves all the spatial symmetries and has the two occupied flat-bands bearing opposite
Chern numbers $\text{C}=\pm 2$. The cascade of insulators derived from this parent state leads
in mean-field to topological insulators at all other integer fillings $\nu$, $\text{C}=\pm 2$
for $\nu=\pm 2$ and $\text{C}=\pm 1$ for $\nu=\pm 1,\pm 3$, which break mirror and time reversal
symmetry, carry orbital magnetism and are spin-polarised for odd $\nu$. When the Jahn-Teller effect
is instead dynamical, it may stabilise insulators with the same properties as their mean-field
counterparts but now prone to become $d$-wave superconductors upon doping, being alike resonating
valence bond states built of topological Cooper pairs. The resulting physical scenario from our
calculations is in good agreement with experimental evidences, and underline the importance of
lattice dynamics in the emergence of exotic correlated states in twisted bilayer graphene.

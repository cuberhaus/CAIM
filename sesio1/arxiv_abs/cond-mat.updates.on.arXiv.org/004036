Modern problems in magnetization dynamics require more and more the numerical determination of
the spin-wave spectra and -dispersion in magnetic systems where analytic theories are not yet available.
Micromagnetic simulations can be used to compute the spatial profiles and oscillation frequencies
of spin-waves in magnetic system with almost arbitrary geometry and different magnetic interactions.
Although numerical approaches are very versatile, they often do not give the same insight and physical
understanding as analytical theories. For example, it is not always possible to decide whether
a certain feature (such as dispersion asymmetry, for example) is governed by one magnetic interaction
or the other. Moreover, since numerical approaches typically yield the normal modes of the system,
it is not always feasible to disentangle hybridized modes. In this manuscript, we build a bridge
between numerics and analytics by presenting a methodology to calculate the individual contributions
to general spin-wave dispersions in a fully numerical manner. We discuss the general form of any
spin-wave dispersion in terms of the effective (stiffness) fields produced by the modes. Based
on a special type of micromagnetic simulations, the numerical dynamic-matrix approach, we show
how to calculate each stiffness field in the respective dispersion law, separately for each magnetic
interaction. In particular, it becomes possible to disentangle contributions of different magnetic
interactions to the dispersion asymmetry in systems where non-reciprocity is present. At the same
time, dipolar-hybridized modes can be easily disentangled. Since this method is independent of
the geometry or the involved magnetic interactions at hand, we believe it is attractive for experimental
and theoretical studies of magnetic systems where there are no analytics yet, but also to aid the
development of new analytical theories.

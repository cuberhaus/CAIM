We report on an experimental study of the effect of coherent surface-bulk electron scattering on
quantum transport in a three-dimensional topological insulator Bi$_2$Te$_3$ nanoplate. The
nanoplate is grown via van der Waals epitaxy on a mica substrate and a top-gated Hall-bar device is
fabricated from the nanoplate directly on the growth substrate. Top-gate voltage dependent measurements
of the sheet resistance of the device reveal that the transport carriers in the nanoplate are of n-type
and that, with decreasing top gate voltage, the carrier density in the nanoplate is decreased. However,
the mobility is increased with decreasing top-gate voltage. This mobility increase with decreasing
carrier density in the nanoplate is demonstrated to arise from a decrease in bulk-to-surface electron
scattering rate. Low-field magnetotransport measurements are performed at low temperatures.
The measured magnetoconductivity of the nanoplate shows typical weak anti-localization (WAL)
characteristics. We analyze the measurements by taking surface-bulk inter-channel electron
scattering into account and extract dephasing times ${\tau}_{\phi}$, diffusion coefficients
$D$ of electrons at the top surface and in the bulk, and the surface-bulk scattering times ${\tau}_{SB}$
as a function of top-gate voltage and temperature. It is found that the dephasing in the nanoplate
arises dominantly from electron-electron scattering with small energy transfers. It is also found
that the ratio of ${\tau}_{\phi}$/${\tau}_{SB}$ (a measure of the surface-bulk electron coherent
coupling) is decreased with decreasing gate voltage or increasing temperature. We demonstrate
that taking the surface-bulk coherent electron scattering in our Bi$_2$Te$_3$ nanoplate into
account is essential to understand quantum transport measurements at low temperatures.

In this study, we have reported electronic structure, lattice dynamics, and thermoelectric (TE)
transport properties of a new family of pentanary substituted TiNiSn systems using the 18 valence
electron count (VEC) rule. From our calculated band structures and density of states, we show that
by preserving the 18 VEC through aliovalent substitutions at the Ti site of TiNiSn semiconducting
behavior can be achieved, and hence one can tune the band structure and band gap to maximize the thermoelectric
figure of merit (ZT) value. Two approaches have been used for calculating the lattice thermal conductivity
($\kappa_{L}$), one by fully solving the linearized phonon Boltzmann transport (LBTE) equation
from first$-$principles anharmonic lattice dynamics calculations implemented in Phono3py code
and other using Slack's equation with calculated Debye temperature and Gr\"{u}neisen parameter
using the calculated elastic constant values. The calculated $\kappa_{L}$ values decrease from
parent TiNiSn to pentanary substituted TiNiSn systems as expected due to fluctuation in atomic
mass. The calculated $\kappa_{L}$ for Hf containing systems La$_{0.25}$Hf$_{0.5}$V$_{0.25}$NiSn
and non Hf containing system La$_{0.25}$Zr$_{0.5}$V$_{0.25}$NiSn calculated from Phono3py
(Slack's equation) are found to be 0.37 (1.04) and 0.16 (0.95) W/mK, at 550\,K, respectively and
the corresponding ZT value are found to be 0.54 (0.4) and 0.77 (0.53). Among the considered systems,
the calculated phonon spectra and heat capacity show that La$_{0.25}$Hf$_{0.5}$V$_{0.25}$NiSn
has more optical$-$acoustic band mixing which creates more phonon$-$phonon scattering and hence
lower the $\kappa_{L}$ value and maximizing the ZT. Based on the calculated results we conclude
that one can design high-efficiency thermoelectric materials by considering the 18 VEC rule with
aliovalent substitution.

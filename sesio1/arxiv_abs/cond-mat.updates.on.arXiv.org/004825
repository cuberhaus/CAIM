Data from experiments and theoretical arguments are the two pillars sustaining the job of modelling
physical systems through inference. In order to solve the inference problem, the data should satisfy
certain conditions that depend also upon the particular questions addressed in a research. Here
we focus on the characterization of systems in terms of a distance from equilibrium, typically the
entropy production (time-reversal asymmetry) or the violation of the Kubo fluctuation-dissipation
relation. We show how general, counter-intuitive and negative for inference, is the problem of
the impossibility to estimate the distance from equilibrium using a series of scalar data which
have a Gaussian statistics. This impossibility occurs also when the data are correlated in time,
and that is the most interesting case because it usually stems from a multi-dimensional linear Markovian
system where there are many time-scales associated to different variables and, possibly, thermal
baths. Observing a single variable (or a linear combination of variables) results in a one-dimensional
process which is always indistinguishable from an equilibrium one (unless a perturbation-response
experiment is available). In a setting where only data analysis (and not new experiments) is allowed,
we propose - as a way out - the combined use of different series of data acquired with different parameters.
This strategy works when there is a sufficient knowledge of the connection between experimental
parameters and model parameters. We also briefly discuss how such results emerge, similarly, in
the context of Markov chains within certain coarse-graining schemes. Our conclusion is that the
distance from equilibrium is related to quite a fine knowledge of the full phase space, and therefore
typically hard to approximate in real experiments.

In the present study we have investigated the structural properties, electronic band dispersion,
elastic constants, acoustic behavior, phonon spectrum, optical properties, and a number of thermophysical
parameters of binary topological semimetal BaGa2 in details via first-principles calculations
using the density functional theory (DFT) based formalisms. The electronic band structure and
density of states calculations with spin orbit coupling reveal semimetallic nature with clear
topological signature. The minimum thermal conductivities and anisotropies of the compound are
calculated. The elastic constants, phonon dispersion calculations show that the compound under
study is both mechanically and dynamically stable. Comprehensive study of elastic constants and
moduli shows that BaGa2 possesses fairly isotropic mechanical properties, reasonably good machinability,
low Debye temperature and melting point. The chemical bonding in BaG2 is interpreted via the electronic
energy density of states, electron density distribution, elastic properties and Mulliken bond
population analysis. The compound possesses both ionic and covalent bondings. The reflectivity
spectra show strong anisotropy with respect to polarization of the incident electric field in the
visible to mid-ultraviolet regions. High reflectivity over wide spectral range makes BaGa2 suitable
as a reflecting material. BaGa2 is also an efficient absorber of ultraviolet radiation. Furthermore,
the refractive index is quite high in the infrared to visible range. All the energy dependent optical
parameters show metallic features and are in complete accord with the underlying bulk electronic
density of states calculations. Most of the results presented in this study are novel and should
serve as useful reference for future study.

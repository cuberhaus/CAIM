Strain is a very effective method to tune electronic states of two-dimension (2D) materials, which
can induce unique phase transition. Recently, 2D $\mathrm{MA_2Z_4}$ family materials are of interest
because of their emerging topological, magnetic and superconducting properties. Here, we investigate
the impact of strain effects ($a/a_0$:0.96$\sim$1.04) on physical properties of Janus monolayer
$\mathrm{VSiGeN_4}$ as a derivative of $\mathrm{VSi_2N_4}$ or $\mathrm{VGe_2N_4}$, which possesses
dynamic, mechanical and thermal stabilities. For out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy, with increasing
strain, $\mathrm{VSiGeN_4}$ undergoes ferrovalley semiconductor (FVS), half-valley-metal
(HVM), valley-polarized quantum anomalous Hall insulator (VQAHI), HVM and FVS. These imply twice
topological phase transition, which are related with sign-reversible Berry curvature and band
inversion between $d_{xy}$+$d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals for K or -K valley. The band inversion
also leads to transformation of valley splitting strength between valence and conduction bands.
However, for in-plane magnetic anisotropy, no special quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states and
valley polarization exist within considered strain range. The actual magnetic anisotropy energy
(MAE) shows that the easy magnetization axis of $\mathrm{VSiGeN_4}$ possesses a complex strain
dependence, and several transitions in the magnetic anisotropy can be observed. The intrinsic
phase diagram shows no special QAH and HVM states in monolayer $\mathrm{VSiGeN_4}$. Fortunately,
these can be easily achieved by external magnetic field, which can adjust easy magnetization axis
of $\mathrm{VSiGeN_4}$ from in-plane one to out-of-plane one. Because strain can effectively
tune the correlation strength ($U$) of electron, the MAE as a function of $U$ is calculated, which
shows similar outline with MAE vs $a/a_0$.

We study the effect of anisotropy of spin-$S$ impurities on an antiferromagnetic SU(2) Heisenberg
chain. The magnetic impurities are assumed to have an XXZ-type anisotropic exchange with its neighboring
sites. First, using density-matrix renormalization group technique. we examine spin-spin correlation
function, instability of N\'eel order, and local spin susceptibility in the presence of a single
spin-$S$ impurity. Based on the results, we find that the types of spin-$S$ impurities are classified
into two groups: $\rm(\hspace{.18em}i\hspace{.18em})$ nonmagnetic and $S=1$ impurities enhance
only short-range antiferromagnetic correlation and $\rm(\hspace{.08em}ii\hspace{.08em})$
$S=1/2$ and $S>1$ impurities can, in contrast, stabilize a long-range N\'eel order in the disordered
SU(2) Heisenberg chain. Then, we focus on the case of $S=1/2$ impurity as a representative of $\rm(\hspace{.08em}ii\hspace{.08em})$
and investigate the evolution of some experimentally observable quantities such as magnetization,
specific heat, and magnetic susceptibility, as a function of concentration and XXZ anisotropy
strength of the impurity. We confirm that the N\'eel order is induced in the bulk spin chain in the
presence of finite amount of easy-axis XXZ $S=1/2$ impurities. Furthermore, we recover some of
the aforementioned features using cluster mean-field theory, which allows us to present results
on experimentally accessible quantities at finite temperatures. Interestingly, in the presence
of uniform magnetic field, the total magnetization exhibits a pseudo-gap behavior for low values
of applied field. We also discuss the dependence of NMR spectrum on various XXZ impurities and identify
that the spin state of Co impurity in SrCu$_{0.99}$Co$_{0.01}$O$_2$ is $S = 3/2$.

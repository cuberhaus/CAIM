Electronic anisotropy (or `nematicity') has been detected in all main families of cuprate superconductors
by a range of experimental techniques -- electronic Raman scattering, THz dichroism, thermal conductivity,
torque magnetometry, second-harmonic generation -- and was directly visualized by scanning tunneling
microscope (STM) spectroscopy. Using angle-resolved transverse resistance (ARTR) measurements,
a very sensitive and background-free technique that can detect 0.5$\%$ anisotropy in transport,
we have observed it also in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$ (LSCO) for $0.02 \leq x \leq 0.25$. Arguably
the key enigma in LSCO is the rotation of the nematic director with temperature; this has not been
seen before in any material. Here, we address this puzzle by measuring the angle-resolved transverse
magnetoresistance (ARTMR) in LSCO. We report a discovery of colossal transverse magnetoresistance
(CTMR) -- an order-of-magnitude drop in the transverse resistivity in the magnetic field of $6\,$T,
while none is seen in the longitudinal resistivity. We show that the apparent rotation of the nematic
director is caused by superconducting phase fluctuations, which are much more anisotropic than
the normal-electron fluid, and their respective directors are not parallel. This qualitative
conclusion is robust and follows straight from the raw experimental data. We quantify this by modelling
the measured (magneto-)conductivity by a sum of two conducting channels that correspond to distinct
anisotropic Drude and Cooper-pair effective mass tensors. Strikingly, the anisotropy of Cooper-pair
stiffness is significantly larger than that of the normal electrons, and it grows dramatically
on the underdoped side, where the fluctuations become effectively quasi-one dimensional.

Liquids near the glass transition exhibit dynamical heterogeneity, i.e. correlated regions in
the liquid relax at either a much faster rate or a much slower rate than the average. This collective
phenomenon has been characterized by measurements of a dynamic susceptibility $\chi_4(t)$, which
are sometimes interpreted in terms of the size of those relaxing regions and the intensity of the
fluctuations. We show that the results of those measurements can be affected not only by the collective
fluctuations in the relaxation rate, but also by density fluctuations in the initial state and by
single-particle fluctuations. We also show that at very long times the average overlap $C(t)$ probing
the similarity between an initial and a final state separated by a time interval $t$ decays as a power
law $C(t) \sim t^{-d/2}$. This is much slower than the stretched exponential behavior $C(t) \sim
{\rm e}^{-(t/\tau)^{\beta}}$ previously observed at times within one or two orders of magnitude
of the $\alpha$-relaxation time $\tau_{\alpha}$. We find that for times longer than $10-100 \tau_{\alpha}$,
the dynamic susceptibility $\chi_4(t)$ is dominated by single particle fluctuations, and that
$\chi_4(t) \approx C(t) \sim t^{-d/2}$. Finally, we introduce a method to extract the collective
relaxation contribution to the dynamic susceptibility $\chi_4(t)$ by subtracting the effects
of single-particle fluctuations and initial state density fluctuations. We apply this method
to numerical simulations of two glass forming models: a binary hard sphere system and a Kob-Andersen
Lennard-Jones system. This allows us to extend the analysis of numerical data to timescales much
longer than previously possible, and opens the door for further future progress in the study of dynamic
heterogeneities, including the determination of the exchange time.

High-quality multicrystalline Upgraded Metallurgical Grade Silicon (UMG-Si) offers significant
advantages over conventional polysilicon-based PV technology, associated to lower cost, lower
energy budget and lower carbon footprint. The aim of this study is twofold: on the one hand, to ascertain
the efficiency potential of solar cells based on this material in terms of carrier lifetime; and
on the other hand, to explore, as a result of that, the adoption of high-efficiency cell architectures
by establishing an effective rear-side passivation scheme for the implementation of passivated
emitter rear contact (PERC) devices. The carrier lifetime and the surface passivation efficacy
are investigated for different passivating layer configurations after single and double P-diffusion
gettering processes. Layer stacks consisting of Al2O3, SiOxNy and a-SiNx:H capping overlayers
have been optimized, on industrial size, saw-damage-etched UMG wafers and results compared to
those obtained using reference iodine-ethanol (IE) passivation. Diagnosis based on minority
carrier lifetime and implied Voc (iVoc) measurements helped monitor the impact of parameter optimization
on wafer quality, particularly after firing processes. Carrier lifetimes over 600 us at 10^15 cm-3
injection level as well as up to 790 us locally have been measured in UMG-Si wafers passivated with
IE after a Phosphorus Diffusion Gettering (PDG), demonstrating the suitability of the material
for high-efficiency cell architectures. Values higher than 300 us have been obtained with Al2O3-based
passivation layers for gettered UMG wafers, with implied Voc values up to 710 mV. These record-breaking
lifetimes and iVoc figures obtained with p-type multicrystalline UMG-Si material demonstrate
a significant upgrading of its electronic quality by means of industry-scalable technical processes.

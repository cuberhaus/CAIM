We show that systematic full configuration-interaction (FCI) calculations enable prediction
of the energy spectra and the intrinsic spatial and spin structures of the many-body wave functions
as a function of the detuning parameter for the case of three-electron hybrid qubits based on GaAs
asymmetric double quantum dots. Specifically, in comparison with the case of weak interactions
and treating the entire three-electron double-dot hybrid qubit as an integral unit, it is shown
that the predicted spectroscopic patterns, originating from strong electron correlations, manifest
the formation of Wigner molecules (WMs). Signatures of WM formation include: (1) a strong suppression
of the energy gaps relative to the non-interacting-electrons modeling, and (2) the appearance
of a pair of avoided crossings arising between states associated with two-electron occupancies
in the left and right wells. The Wigner molecule is a physical entity associated with electron localization
within each well and it cannot be captured by the previously employed independent-particle or two-site-Hubbard
theoretical modeling of the hybrid qubits. The emergence of strong WMs is investigated in depth
through the concerted use of FCI-adapted diagnostic tools like charge and spin densities, as well
as conditional probability distributions. Furthermore, the energy spectrum as a function of the
strength of the Coulomb repulsion (at constant detuning) is calculated in order to complement the
thorough analysis of the factors contributing to WM emergence. We report remarkable agreement
with recent experimental measurements. The present FCI methodology for multi-well quantum dots
can be straightforwardly extended to treat two-band Si/SiGe hybrid qubits, where the central role
of the WMs was confirmed, as well, in recent experiments.

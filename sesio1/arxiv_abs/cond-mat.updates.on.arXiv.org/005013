Materials hosting topologically protected non-Abelian zero modes offer the exciting possibility
of storing and manipulating quantum information in a manner that is protected from decoherence
at the hardware level. In this work, we study the possibility of realizing such excitations along
line defects in certain fractional quantum Hall states in multi-valley systems. Such line defects
have been recently observed experimentally between valley polarized Hall states on the surface
of Bi(111), and excitations near these defects appear to be gapped (gapless) depending on the presence
(absence) of interaction-induced gapping perturbations constrained by momentum selection rules,
while the position of defects is determined by strain. In this work, we use these selection rules
to show that a hybrid structure involving a superlattice imposed on such a multi-valley quantum
Hall surface realizes non-Abelian anyons which can then be braided by modulating strain locally
to move line defects. Specifically, we explore such defects in Abelian fractional quantum Hall
states of the form {\nu} = 2/m using a K-matrix approach, and identify relevant gapping perturbations.
Charged modes on these line defects remain gapped, while charge netural valley pseudospin modes
may be gapped with the aid of two (mutually orthogonal) superlattices which pin non-commuting fields.
When these superlattices are alternated along the line defect, non-Abelian zero modes result at
points where the gapping perturbation changes. Given that these pseudospin modes carry no net physical
charge or spin, the setup eschews utilizing superconducting and magnetic elements to engineer
gapping perturbations. We provide a scheme to braid these modes using strain modulation, and confirm
that the resulting unitaries satisfy a representation of the braid group.

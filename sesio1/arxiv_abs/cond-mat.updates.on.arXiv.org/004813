We present a robust technique for computationally studying surface polariton modes in hybrid materials.
We use a semi-classical model that allows us to understand the physics behind the interactions between
collective excitations of the hybrid system and develop a scattering and transfer matrix method
that imposes the proper boundary conditions to solve Maxwell equations and derive a general equation
describing the surface polariton in a heterostructure consisting of N constituent materials.
We apply this method to a test structure composed of a topological insulator (TI) and an antiferromagnetic
material (AFM) to study the resulting surface Dirac plasmon-phonon-magnon polariton (DPPMP).
We find that interactions between the excitations of the two constituents result in the formation
of hybridized modes and the emergence of avoided-crossing points in the dispersion relations for
the DPPMP. For the specific case of a Bi2Se3 TI material, the polariton branch with low frequency
below 2 THz redshifts upon increasing the thickness of TI thin film, which leads to an upper bound
on the thickness of the TI layer that will allow an observable signature of strong coupling and the
emergence of hybridized states. We also find that the strength of the coupling between the TI and
the AFM, which is parameterized by the amplitude of the avoided-crossing splitting between the
two polariton branches at the magnon resonance frequency, depends on the magnitude of the magnetic
dipole and the line width of the magnon in the AFM material as well as on the Fermi energy of Dirac plasmon
in the TI. Finally, we predict that materials with extremely high quality, i.e. low scattering loss
rate, are essential to achieve an experimentally-observable strong coupling between a TI and AFM.

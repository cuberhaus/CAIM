We obtain the phase diagram for the infinite range random field Blume capel (RFBC) model for the symmetric
trimodal distribution of the random field (h) in the temperature (T)-crystal field ($\Delta$)
and T-h planes. We find 4 ordered and 2 disordered phases in the model at T=0. Depending on the disorder
strength, there are 5 different ground state phase diagrams in the $\Delta-$h plane. The T-$\Delta$
and T-h phase diagrams also can be classified into 5 different categories as a function of the strength
of the disorder, consistent with the 5 different ground state phase diagrams. The phase diagrams
at finite temperature consist of lines of first order and second order transitions, multicritical
points like tricritical point, bicritical points, critical end point, and also many multi-phase
coexistence points. We find re-entrance in the T-h phase diagram for the symmetric trimodal distribution
for some values of $\Delta$. We also studied the Gaussian distribution of the random field. In contrast,
the ground state for the Gaussian distribution consists of only one ordered and one disordered phase.
At low disorder strength ($\sigma$) the T$-\Delta$ phase diagram has a line of first order and a line
of second order transitions, separated by a TCP. However at higher $\sigma$ the phase diagram only
has a line of second order transition. In general the phase diagram of the random field problems is
expected to be similar for symmetric distributions as has been observed for the random field O(n)
models. In the case of RFBC we find that while for Gaussian distribution, the phase diagram is similar
to the phase diagram of the infinite range random field Ising model (RFIM) with the bimodal random
field distribution, for the symmetric trimodal distribution there are many different T-$\Delta$
and T-h phase diagrams with multiple multicritical and multi-phase coexistence points.

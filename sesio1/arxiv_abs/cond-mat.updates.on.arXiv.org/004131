Recent reports on the formation of hydrogen peroxide (H$_2$O$_2$) in water microdroplets produced
via pneumatic spraying or capillary condensation have garnered significant attention. How covalent
bonds in water could break under such conditions challenges our textbook understanding of physical
chemistry and the water substance. While there is no definitive answer, it has been speculated that
ultrahigh electric fields at the air-water interface are responsible for this chemical transformation.
Here, we resolve this mystery via a comprehensive experimental investigation of H$_2$O$_2$ formation
in (i) water microdroplets sprayed over a range of liquid flow-rates, the (shearing) air flow rates,
and the air composition (ii) water microdroplets condensed on hydrophobic substrates formed via
hot water or humidifier under controlled air composition. Specifically, we assessed the contributions
of the evaporative concentration and shock waves in sprays and the effects of trace O$_3$(g) on the
H$_2$O$_2$ formation. Glovebox experiments revealed that the H$_2$O$_2$ formation in water microdroplets
was most sensitive to the air-borne ozone (O$_3$) concentration. In the absence of O$_3$(g), we
could not detect H$_2$O$_2$(aq) in sprays or condensates (detection limit: 250 nM. In contrast,
microdroplets exposed to atmospherically relevant O$_3$(g) concentration (10-100 ppb) formed
2-30 $\mu$M H$_2$O$_2$(aq); increasing the gas-liquid surface area, mixing, and contact duration
increased H$_2$O$_2$(aq) concentration. Thus, the mystery is resolved - the water surface facilitates
the O$_3$(g) mass transfer, which is followed by the chemical transformation of O$_3$(aq) into
H$_2$O$_2$(aq). These findings should also help us understand the implications of this chemistry
in natural and applied contexts.

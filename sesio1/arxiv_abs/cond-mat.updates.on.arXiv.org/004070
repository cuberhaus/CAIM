Polarons, that is, charge carriers correlated with lattice deformations, are ubiquitous quasiparticles
in semiconductors, and play an important role in electrical conductivity. To date most theoretical
studies of so-called large polarons, in which the lattice can be considered as a continuum, have
focused on the original Fr\"ohlich model: a simple (non-degenerate) parabolic isotropic electronic
band coupled to one dispersionless longitudinal optical phonon branch. The Fr\"ohlich model allows
one to understand characteristics such as polaron formation energy, radius, effective mass and
mobility. Real cubic materials, instead, have electronic band extrema that are often degenerate
or anisotropic and present several phonon modes. In the present work, we address such issues. We
keep the continuum hypothesis inherent to the large polaron Fr\"ohlich model, but waive the isotropic
and non-degeneracy hypotheses, and also include multiple phonon branches. For polaron effective
masses, working at the lowest order of perturbation theory, we provide analytical results for the
case of anisotropic electronic energy dispersion, with two distinct effective masses (uniaxial)
and numerical simulations for the degenerate 3-band case, typical of III-V and II-VI semiconductor
valence bands. We also deal with the strong-coupling limit, using a variational treatment: we propose
trial wavefunctions for the above-mentioned cases, providing polaron radii and energies. Then,
we evaluate the polaron formation energies, effective masses and localisation lengths using parameters
representative of a dozen II-VI, III-V and oxide semiconductors, for both electron and hole polarons...In
the non-degenerate case, we compare the perturbative approach with the Feynman path integral approach
in characterisizing polarons in the weak coupling limit...

Metal halide perovskite semiconductors have the potential to reach the optoelectronic quality
of meticulously grown inorganic materials, but with a distinct advantage of being solution processable.
Currently, perovskite performance is limited by charge carrier recombination loss at surfaces
and interfaces. Indeed, the highest quality perovskite films are achieved with molecular surface
passivation, for example with n-trioctylphosphine oxide, but these treatments are often labile
and electrically insulating. As an alternative, the formation of a thin 2D perovskite layer on the
bulk 3D perovskite reduces non-radiative energy loss while also improving device performance.
But, thus far, it has been unclear how best to design and optimize 2D/3D heterostructures and whether
critical material properties, such as charge carrier lifetime, can reach values as high as ligand-based
approaches. Here, we study perovskite devices that have exhibited power conversion efficiencies
exceeding 25% and show that 2D layers are capable of pushing beyond molecular passivation strategies
with even greater tunability. We set new benchmarks for photoluminescence lifetime, reaching
values > 30 {\mu}s, and perovskite/charge transport layer surface recombination velocity with
values < 7 cm s^{-1}. We use X-ray spectroscopy to directly visualize how treatment with hexylammonium
bromide not only selectively targets defects at surfaces and grain boundaries, but also forms a
bandgap grading extending > 100 nm into the bulk layer. We expect these results to be a starting point
for more sophisticated engineering of 2D/3D heterostructures with surface fields that exclusively
repel charge carriers from defective regions while also enabling efficient charge transfer. It
is likely that the precise manipulation of energy bands will enable perovskite-based optoelectronics
to operate at their theoretical performance limits.

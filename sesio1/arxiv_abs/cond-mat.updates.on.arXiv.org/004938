We construct quasi one-dimensional topological and non-topological three-band lattices with
tunable band gap and winding number of the flat band. Using mean field (MF) and exact density matrix
renormalization group (DMRG) calculations, we show explicitly how the band gap affects pairing
and superconductivity (SC) in a Hubbard model with attractive interactions. We show excellent
agreement between MF and DMRG. When a phase twist is applied on the system, a phase difference appears
between pairing order parameters on different sublattices, and this plays a very important role
in the SC density. The SC weight, $D_s$, on the gapped topological, $W\neq0$, flat band increases
linearly with interaction strength, $U$, for low values, and with a slope that depends on the details
of the compact localized state at $U=0$. As $U\to 0$ for the gapped non-topological flat band ($W=0$),
$D_s$ decays with a power law faster than quadratic but slower than exponential. This indicates
that isolated non-topological flat bands are less beneficial to SC. In the gapless case (flat band
touching the band above it), we find at low $U$ (both for $W=0$ and $W\neq 0$) that $D_s\propto U^\varphi$
with $\varphi<1$ contrary to the $U{\rm ln}\, ({\rm const.}/U)$ behavior reported in the literature.
In other words, $D_s$ increases faster than linearly for low $U$ thus favoring SC at weak interaction
more than the gapped case. For systems with touching bands, we observe that the one-body correlation
length, $\xi$, diverges as a power law as $U\rightarrow0$, while for the isolated flat band $\xi(U\to
0)$ is a constant smaller than one lattice spacing. Both behaviors are distinct from the exponential
divergence of $\xi$ in the dispersive case. Our results re-establish that the BCS mean field and
quantum metric alone are insufficient to characterize SC at weak coupling.

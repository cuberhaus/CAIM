Polarization-dependent scattering anisotropy of cylindrical nanowires has numerous potential
applications in, for example, nanoantennas, photothermal therapy, thermophotovoltaics, catalysis,
sensing, optical filters and switches. In all these applications, temperature-dependent material
properties play an important role and often adversely impact performance depending on the dominance
of either radiative or dissipative damping. Here, we employ numerical modeling based on Mie scattering
theory to investigate and compare the temperature and polarization-dependent optical anisotropy
of metallic (gold, Au) nanowires with indirect (silicon, Si) and direct (gallium arsenide, GaAs)
bandgap semiconducting nanowires. Results indicate that plasmonic scattering resonances in
semiconductors, within the absorption band, deteriorate with an increase in temperature whereas
those occurring away from the absorption band strengthen as a result of the increase in phononic
contribution. Indirect-bandgap thin ($20 \,\mathrm{nm}$) Si nanowires present low absorption
efficiencies for both the transverse electric (TE, $E_{\perp}$) and magnetic (TM, $E_{\parallel}$)
modes, and high scattering efficiencies for the TM mode at shorter wavelengths making them suitable
as highly efficient scatterers. Temperature-resilient higher-order anapole modes with their
characteristic high absorption and low scattering efficiencies are also observed in the semiconductor
nanowires ($r \! = \! 125 \! - \! 130$ nm) for the TE polarization. Herein, the GaAs nanowires present
$3 \! - \! 7$ times greater absorption efficiencies compared to the Si nanowires making them especially
suitable for temperature-resilient applications such as scanning near-field optical microscopy
(SNOM), localized heating, non-invasive sensing or detection that require strong localization
of energy in the near field.

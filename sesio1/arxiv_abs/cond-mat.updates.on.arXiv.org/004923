This review of quantitative field emitter electrostatics, covering analytical, numerical and
fitted-formula approaches, is thought the first of its kind. The review relates chiefly to situations
where emitters operate in an electronically ideal manner, and zero-current electrostatics is
applicable. Terminology is carefully described and is polarity independent; thus the review applies
to both field electron and field ion emitters. It also applies more generally to charged, pointed
electron-conductors that exhibit the "electrostatic lightning-rod effect", but are poorly discussed
in general electricity and magnetism literature. Modern electron-conductor electrostatics
is an application of the chemical thermodynamics and statistical mechanics of electrons. The review
focuses chiefly on the electrostatics of two common basic emitter forms: the needle-shaped emitters
used in traditional projection technologies; and the post-shaped emitters often used in modelling
large-area multi-emitter electron sources. In the post-on-plane context, we consider in detail
both the electrostatics of the single post and the interaction between two identical posts that
occurs as a result of electrostatic depolarization (often called "screening" or "shielding").
Core to the review are discussions of the "minimum domain dimensions" method for implementing effective
finite-element-method electrostatic simulations, and of the variant that leads to very precise
estimates of dimensionless field enhancement factors (error typically less than 0.001 % in situations
where analytical comparisons exist). Brief outline discussions, and core references, are given
for each of many "related considerations" that are relevant to the electrostatic situations, methods
and results described. Many areas of field emitter electrostatics are suggested where further
research and/or separate mini-reviews would probably be useful.

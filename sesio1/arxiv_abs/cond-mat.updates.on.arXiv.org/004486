The standard method to determine the transition temperature (Tg) of glass transition is the jump
in the specific heat. Despite this importance, standard theory for this jump is lacking. The difficulties
encompass from lack of proper treatments of specific heat of liquids, hysteresis, to the timescale
issue. The first part of this paper provides a non-empirical method to calculate specific heat of
glass. The method consists of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on density-functional
theory (DFT) and thermodynamics methods. The total-energy approach based on DFT enables us to calculate
specific heat, irrespective of solids or liquids. A serious problem for glass-transition states
is involvement of complicated energy dissipation processes, which is resolved by adiabatic MD
simulations. The problems of hysteresis and the timescale issue are alleviated by restricting
the scope of calculations to equilibrium states only. The second part of this paper describes an
application of the theory to the specific-heat jump (Delta Cp) of glycerol in order to show the validity
of the methods. Despite severe limitations due to the small size of supercells, a reasonable value
for the specific-heat jump is obtained. By decomposing Delta Cp into contributions of the structural
energy, phonon, and thermal expansion parts, we have a sound interpretation for the Delta Cp: the
major contribution to Delta Cp comes from the change in the structural energy. From this, a neat energy
diagram about the glass transition is obtained. An outcome of this study is verification of the empirical
relationship between the fragility and specific-heat jump. These two energies are scaled by the
ratio k=Tg/ Delta T, where Delta T is the width of the transition, through which the two quantities
are interrelated. This is useful for organizing various relationships that are found empirically.

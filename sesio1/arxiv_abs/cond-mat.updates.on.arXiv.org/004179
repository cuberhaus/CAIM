Here, we study the thermoelectric properties of topological semimetal CoSi in the temperature
range $300-800$ K by using combined experimental and density functional theory (DFT) based methods.
CoSi is synthesized using arc melting technique. The measured values of Seebeck coefficient (S)
shows the non-monotonic behaviour in the studied temperature range with the value of $\sim-$81
$\mu$V/K at room temperature. The $|S|$ first increases till 560 K ($\sim-$93 $\mu$V/K) and then
decreases up to 800 K ($\sim-$84 $\mu$V/K) indicating the dominating n-type behaviour in the full
temperature range. The electrical conductivity, $\sigma$ (thermal conductivity, $\kappa$)
shows the monotonic decreasing (increasing) behaviour with the values of $\sim$5.2$\times 10^{5}$
(12.1 W/m-K) and $\sim$3.6$\times 10^{5}$ (14.2 W/m-K) $\Omega^{-1}m^{-1}$ at 300 K and 800 K,
respectively. The $\kappa$ exhibits the temperature dependency as, $\kappa \propto T^{0.16}$.
The DFT based Boltzmann transport theory is used to understand these behaviour. The comparison
between experimental and calculated S suggests the off-stoichiometry of the sample. The multi-band
electron and hole pockets appear to be mainly responsible for deciding the temperature dependent
transport behaviour. The temperature dependent relaxation time is computed which shows temperature
dependency of $1/T^{0.35}$. The calculated value of lattice part of thermal conductivity, $\kappa_{L}$
($\sim$8.0 W/m-K) at 300 K is found to be in good agreement with the experimentally estimated value
of $\sim$8.3 W/m-K. The calculated value of thermal expansion is also found to be in good agreement
with experiment. Present study suggests that electronic and phononic band-structure obtained
from DFT provides reasonably good estimate of the transport coefficients of CoSi in the high temperature
region of $300-800$ K.

Superexchange is one of the vital resources to realize long-range interaction between distant
spins for large-scale quantum computing. Recent experiments have demonstrated coherent oscillations
between logical states defined by remote spins whose coupling is given by the superexchange interaction
mediated by central spins. Excavating the potential of superexchange requires a full understanding
of the interaction in terms of control parameters, which is still lacking in literature. Here, using
full configuration interaction calculation, we study a linear triple-quantum-dot device in which
the left and right dots are occupied by a single electron each, whose spin states define the computational
basis states of a qubit. We have found that, when the detunings at the left and right dots are leveled,
the superexchange can exhibit a non-monotonic behavior which ranges from positive to negative
values as a function of the middle-dot detuning. We further show that the larger relative detuning
between the left and right dots causes the magnitude of the superexchange to increase (decrease)
for an originally positive (negative) superexchange. We then proceed to show that a much larger
left-right dot detuning can switch the superexchange from an originally negative value at zero
detuning to a positive one. Using a Hubbard-like model, we present analytical expressions of the
superexchange and have found that they conform well qualitatively with the numerical results obtained
from full configuration interaction calculations. Our results suggest that even a simple configuration
of delocalized two-electron states in a linear triple-quantum-dot device exhibits superexchange
energy with non-trivial behavior, making it a promising candidate for scaling up with various implementations.

The discovery of correlated states and superconductivity in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene
(MATBG) has established moir\'e quantum matter as a new platform to explore interaction-driven
and topological quantum phenomena. Multitudes of phases have been realized in moir\'e systems,
but surprisingly, robust superconductivity has been one of the least common of all, initially found
in MATBG and only more recently also in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene (MATTG). While MATBG
and MATTG share some similar characteristics, they also exhibit substantial differences, such
as in their response to external electric and magnetic fields. This raises the question of whether
they are simply two separate unique systems, or whether they form part of a broader family of superconducting
materials. Here, we report the experimental realization of magic-angle twisted 4-layer and 5-layer
graphene (MAT4G and MAT5G, respectively), which turn out to be superconductors, hence establishing
alternating-twist magic-angle multilayer graphene as a robust family of moir\'e superconductors.
The members of this family have flat bands in their electronic structure as a common feature, suggesting
their central role in the observed robust superconductivity. On the other hand, there are also important
variations across the family, such as different symmetries for members with even and odd number
of layers. However, our measurements in parallel magnetic fields, in particular the investigation
of Pauli limit violation and spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking, reveal that the most pronounced
distinction is between the N=2 and N>2-layer structures. Our results expand the emergent family
of moir\'e superconductors, providing new insight with potential implications for the design
of novel superconducting materials platforms.

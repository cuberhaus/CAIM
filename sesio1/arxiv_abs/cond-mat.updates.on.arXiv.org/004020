Improving our understanding of the physical coupling between type-II superconductors (SC) and
soft ferromagnetic materials (SFM), is root for progressing onto the application of SC-SFM metastructures
in scenarios such as magnetic cloaking, magnetic shielding, and power transmission systems. However,
in the latter some intriguing and yet unexplained phenomena occurred, such as a noticeable rise
in the SC energy losses, and a local but not isotropic deformation of its magnetic flux density. These
phenomena, which are in apparent contradiction with the most fundamental theory of electromagnetism
for superconductivity, i.e., the critical state theory (CST), have remained unexplained for about
20 years, given place to the acceptance of the controversial and yet paradigmatic existence of the
so-called overcritical current densities. Therefore, aimed to resolve these long-standing problems,
we extended the CST by incorporating a semi-analytical model for cylindrical monocore SC-SFM heterostructures,
setting the standards for its validation with a variational approach of multipole functionals
for the magnetic coupling between Sc and SFM materials. It is accompanied by a comprehensive numerical
study for SFM sheaths of arbitrary dimensions and magnetic relative permeabilities $\mu_{r}$,
ranging from $\mu_{r}=5$ (NiZn ferrites) to $\mu_{r}=350000$ (pure Iron), showing how the AC-losses
of the SC-SFM metastructure radically changes as a function of the SC and the SFM radius for $\mu_{r}
\geq 100$. Our numerical technique and simulations revealed also a remarkable agreement with the
magneto optical imaging observations that were questioning the CST validness, proving therefore
that the reported phenomena for self-field SC-SFM heterostructures can be understood without
the need for invoking the concept of overcritical currents.

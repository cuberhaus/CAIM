Chromium (Cr) is a transition metal element with 3$d$ orbital electrons. In most compounds containing
Cr, due to the correlation effect, twofold features of localization and itinerancy are expected.
The localization gives rise to a magnetic moment, while the latter exhibits as the effective coherent
weight for conductivity. Here we report the physical properties of Cr$_3$Ru compounds with bcc
or A15 phases by using multiple experimental tools. The resistivity measurements show sharp superconducting
transitions at $T_{\rm c}$ = 2.77 K and $T_{\rm c}$ = 3.37 K for the bcc and A15 structures. A high residual
resistivity exists for both samples with the mean-free-path about 2 nm. Magnetization measurements
also show rather narrow transitions, with a clear hump structure at high temperatures around 150
K, which may be ascribed to the remaining antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations. The specific heat
coefficient reveals a clear jump at $T_{\rm c}$. We find that s-wave gaps can be adopted to fit the
low temperature specific heat data yielding ratios of about $2\Delta/k_{\scriptscriptstyle
B}T_{\rm c}$ $\approx$ 3.6, indicating a moderate pairing strength. Interestingly, the Wilson
ratios are 3.81 and 3.62 for the bcc and A15 phases, suggesting a moderate correlation effect of conducting
electron in the normal state. Besides, for samples with A15 structure, another specific heat anomaly
occurs at about 0.85 K and is sensitive to magnetic fields. By applying high pressures, both system
exhibit an enhancement of $T_{\rm c}$ with a rate of about 0.019 K/GPa and 0.013 K/GPa for the bcc and
A15 phases. We also conduct tunneling spectrum measurements and found that the coherence peaks
are strongly smeared out. The strong suppression to the coherence peaks may be ascribed to the strong
scattering. Our combinatory results point to an unconventional superconductivity in these Cr
based compounds.

A network analysis of the structure of social relationships in one of the most popular Russian novels
of the Soviet era \emph{The Master and Margarita} by M.~A.~Bulgakov has been carried out. The structure
of the novel is complex, i.e., there is `a story within a story'. In our study, only paired verbal communications
(conversations) between explicitly present and acting characters have been taken into account;
frontal communications, monologues, off-stage characters as well as expected connections between
characters have not been assessed. Based on a character pair verbal communication matrix, a graph
has been constructed, the vertices of which are the characters of the novel, while the edges correspond
to the connections between them. Taking only dialog into account leads to the result, that the social
network can be described by an ordinary, rather than a directed graph. Since the activity of the dialogs
was out of our intended scope, the edges have been given no weights. The largest connected component
of the graph consists of 76 characters. Centralities, such as degree, betweenness, closeness,
eigenvector, and assortativity coefficient were computed to characterize the network. The assortativity
coefficient of the network under consideration is negative $-0.133$, i.e., the network demonstrates
the properties of an artificial network. The structure of the communities in the network was also
analysed. In addition to the obvious large communities~ -- the characters from the Yershalaim part
of the novel and the characters of the Moscow part -- the analysis also revealed a fine structure in
the Moscow component. Using the analysis of centralities, a group of main characters has been detected.
The central characters of the novel are Bezdomny, Woland, Levi Matthew, Koroviev, Azazello, Behemoth,
Bosoi, Warenukha, Master, and Margarita.

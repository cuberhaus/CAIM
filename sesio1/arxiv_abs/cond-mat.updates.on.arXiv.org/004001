In this work, we derive some analytical properties of Berry's phase in one-dimensional quantum
and classical crystals, also named Zak's phase, when computed with a Fourier basis. We show that
Zak's phase can be divided in two terms: a global phase required to make the Bloch wave periodic in
the Brillouin zone and an internal phase which measures the relative delay of the different Fourier
terms within the Brillouin zone. While the former phase is dependent on the origin of coordinates
of the unit cell, the latter is independent of it, so that it can be interpreted as an internal property
of the band itself. We show that this internal phase is always zero for a symmetric crystal while it
can take any value when this symmetry is broken, showing therefore that it can be interpreted as a
measure of the assymetry of the band. Since for a symmetric crystal Zak's phase is entirely determined
by the global part, we show that this can be easily calculated by means of the parity of the Fourier
terms at the center and edge of the Brillouin zone, being therefore unnecessary the integration
of the modes through the unit cell and the entire Brillouin zone. We provide numerical examples analyzing
the internal part for both electronic and classical waves (acoustic or photonic). We analyze the
weakest electronic potential capable of presenting asymmetry, as well as the double-Dirac delta
potential, and in both examples it is found that the internal phase varies continuously as a function
of a symmetry-control parameter, but it is zero when the crystal is symmetric. For classical waves,
the layered material is analyzed. Although Zak's phase has been mainly studied in connection with
the existence of edge states in finite crystals, we consider that the study of the internal phase
can be more relevant to understand bulk properties of quantum and classical crystals.

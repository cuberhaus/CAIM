The Helfrich-Hurault (HH) elastic instability is a well-known mechanism behind patterns that
form as a result of strain upon liquid crystal systems with periodic ground states. In the HH model,
layered structures undulate and buckle in response to local, geometric incompatibilities, in
order to maintain the preferred layer spacing. Classic HH systems include cholesteric liquid crystals
under electromagnetic field distortions and smectic liquid crystals under mechanical strains,
where both materials are confined between rigid substrates. However, richer phenomena are observed
when undulation instabilities occur in the presence of deformable interfaces and variable boundary
conditions. Understanding how the HH instability is affected by deformable surfaces is imperative
for applying the instability to a broader range of materials. In this review, we re-examine the HH
instability and give special focus to how the boundary conditions influence the mechanical response
of lamellar systems to geometrical frustration. We use lamellar liquid crystals confined within
a spherical shell geometry as our model system. Made possible by the relatively recent advances
in microfluidics within the past 15 years, liquid crystal shells are composed entirely of fluid
interfaces and have boundary conditions that can be dynamically controlled at will. We examine
past and recent work that exemplifies how topological constraints, molecular anchoring conditions,
and boundary curvature can trigger the HH instability in liquid crystals with periodic ground states.
We then end by identifying similar phenomena across a wide variety of materials, both biological
and synthetic. With this review, we aim to highlight that the HH instability is a generic and often
overlooked response of periodic materials to geometrical frustration.

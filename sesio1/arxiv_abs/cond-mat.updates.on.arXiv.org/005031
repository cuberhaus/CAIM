We outline a holographic framework that attempts to unify Landau and beyond-Landau paradigms of
quantum phases and phase transitions. Leveraging a modern understanding of symmetries as topological
defects/operators, the framework uses a topological order to organize the space of quantum systems
with a global symmetry in one lower dimension. The global symmetry naturally serves as an input for
the topological order. In particular, we holographically construct a String Operator Algebra
(SOA) which is the building block of symmetric quantum systems with a given symmetry $G$ in one lower
dimension. This exposes a vast web of dualities which act on the space of $G$-symmetric quantum systems.
The SOA facilitates the classification of gapped phases as well as their corresponding order parameters
and fundamental excitations, while dualities help to navigate and predict various corners of phase
diagrams and analytically compute universality classes of phase transitions. A novelty of the
approach is that it treats conventional Landau and unconventional topological phase transitions
on an equal footing, thereby providing a holographic unification of these seemingly-disparate
domains of understanding. We uncover a new feature of gapped phases and their multi-critical points,
which we dub fusion structure, that encodes information about which phases and transitions can
be dual to each other. Furthermore, we discover that self-dual systems typically posses emergent
non-invertible, i.e., beyond group-like symmetries. We apply these ideas to $1+1d$ quantum spin
chains with finite Abelian group symmetry, using topologically-ordered systems in $2+1d$. We
predict the phase diagrams of various concrete spin models, and analytically compute the full conformal
spectra of non-trivial quantum phase transitions, which we then verify numerically.

The discovery of new catalysts that are efficient, sustainable, and low-cost is a major research
endeavor for many industrial chemical processes. This requires an understanding and determination
of the catalytic origins for the given catalysts, which still remains a challenge. Here we describe
a novel method to identify new catalysts based on searching for crystalline symmetry-protected
obstructed atomic insulators (OAIs) that have metallic surface states on otherwise semiconducting
or insulating compounds. The Wannier charge centers in OAIs are pinned by symmetries at some empty
Wyckoff positions so that surfaces that accommodate these sites are guaranteed to have metallic
obstructed surface states (OSSs). Beyond the well-studied 2H-MoS2, we further verified our theory
on the catalysts, 2H-MoTe2, and 1T'-MoTe2, whose catalytic active sites are consistent with our
calculations of obstructed Wannier charge centers (OWCCs) and OSSs. In addition, we have predicted
the location of catalytic active sites and confirmed these predictions by exploring the hydrogen
evolution reaction on NiPS3 bulk single crystals, which we find to be one of the most promising new
catalysts with high activity and, moreover, of low cost. Most importantly, we successfully identified
several high-efficient catalysts just by considering the number of OWCCs and the crystal symmetry
of the OAIs. Using the real space invariant theory and high-throughput computational methods applied
to a database of 34013 topologically trivial insulators, we have identified 1788 unique OAIs (3383
ICSDs), of which 465 are potential high-quality catalysts for heterogeneous reactions. The Miller
indices of the active surfaces are also obtained. Our new methodology will facilitate and accelerate
the discovery of new catalysts for a wide range of heterogeneous redox reactions, where sustainability,
toxicity, and cost must be considered.

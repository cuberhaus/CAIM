Atomically engineered artificial lattices are a useful tool for simulating complex quantum phenomena,
but have so far been limited to the study of Hamiltonians where electron-electron interactions
do not play a role -- but it's precisely the regime in which these interactions do matter where computational
times lend simulations a critical advantage over numerical methods. Here, we propose a new platform
for constructing artificial matter that relies on the confinement of field-emission resonances,
a class of vacuum-localized discretized electronic states. We use atom manipulation of surface
vacancies in a chlorine-terminated Cu(100) surface to reveal square patches of the underlying
metal, thereby creating atomically-precise potential wells that host particle-in-a-box modes.
By adjusting the shape and size of the confining potential, we can access states with different quantum
numbers, making these patches attractive candidates as quantum dots or artificial atoms. We demonstrate
that the lifetime of electrons in these engineered states can be extended and tuned through modification
of the confining potential, either via atomic assembly or by changing the tip-sample distance.
We also demonstrate control over a finite range of state-filling, a parameter which plays a key role
in the evolution of quantum many-body states. We model the transport through the localized state
to disentangle and quantify the lifetime-limiting processes, illustrating the critical dependency
of the electron lifetime on the properties of the underlying bulk band structure. The interplay
with the bulk bands also gives rise to negative differential resistance, opening possible avenues
for engineering custom atomic-scale resonant tunnelling diodes, which exhibit similar current-voltage
characteristics.

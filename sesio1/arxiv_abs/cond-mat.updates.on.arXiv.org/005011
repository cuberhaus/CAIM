Advancements in nanotechnology continue to unearth material vistas that presage a new age of revolutionary
functionalities replete with unparalleled physical properties and avant-garde chemical capabilities
that promise sweeping paradigm shifts in energy, environment, telecommunications and potentially
healthcare. At the upper echelons of this realm, the pnictogen and chalcogen class of honeycomb
layered oxides have emerged with fascinating crystal chemistry and exotic electromagnetic and
topological phenomena that muster multifaceted concepts spanning from materials science to condensed
matter physics and potential applications in electrochemistry, quantum mechanics and electronics.
In a bid to shed light on the mechanisms governing these biomimetic nanostructures, this review
highlights the significant milestones and breakthroughs that have augmented their current knowledgebase
of theory, properties and utilities. Herein, we elucidate the vast promising crystal chemistry
space against the backdrop of known synthesis and characterisation techniques employed in the
development and optimisation of this class of materials. Further, we highlight key theoretical
models that have reinvigorated the exploration and characterisation of honeycomb layered oxides
within this class and are poised to redefine the frontiers of material research and their applications.
We conclude by envisaging future research directions where fascinating physicochemical, topological
and electromagnetic properties could be lurking and where valiant efforts ought to be inclined,
particularly in the prospective realisation of exotic material compositional space as well as
their utility as testing grounds for emergent two-dimensional (2D) topological quantum gravity
and conformal field theories.

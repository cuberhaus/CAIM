When two-dimensional van der Waals materials are stacked to build heterostructures, moir\'e patterns
emerge from twisted interfaces or from mismatch in lattice constant of individual layers. Relaxation
of the atomic positions is a direct, generic consequence of the moir\'e pattern, with many implications
for the physical properties. Moir\'e driven atomic relaxation may be naively thought to be restricted
to the interfacial layers and thus irrelevant for multi-layered heterostructures. However, we
provide experimental evidence for the importance of the three dimensional nature of the relaxation
in two types of van der Waals heterostructures: First, in multi-layer graphene twisted on graphite
at small twist angles ($\theta\approx0.14^\circ$) we observe propagation of relaxation domains
even beyond 18 graphene layers. Second, we show how for multi-layer PdTe$_2$ on Bi$_2$Se$_3$ the
moir\'e lattice constant depends on the number of PdTe$_2$ layers. Motivated by the experimental
findings, we developed a continuum approach to model multi-layered relaxation processes based
on the generalized stacking fault energy functional given by ab-initio simulations. Leveraging
the continuum property of the approach enables us to access large scale regimes and achieve agreement
with our experimental data for both systems. Furthermore it is well known that the electronic structure
of graphene sensitively depends on local lattice deformations. Therefore we study the impact of
multi-layered relaxation on the local density of states of the twisted graphitic system. We identify
measurable implications for the system, experimentally accessible by scanning tunneling microscopy.
Our multi-layered relaxation approach is not restricted to the discussed systems, and can be used
to uncover the impact of an interfacial defect on various layered systems of interest.

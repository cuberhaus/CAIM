The Ce$^{3+}$ pseudospin-$\frac{1}{2}$ degrees of freedom in the pyrochlore magnet Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$
are known to possess dipole-octupole (DO) character, making it a candidate for novel quantum spin
liquid (QSL) ground states at low temperatures. We report new heat capacity ($C_p$) measurements
on Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ which rise sharply at low temperatures, initially plateauing near 0.08 K,
before falling off towards a high temperature zero beyond 3 K. Above $\sim$0.5 K, the $C_p$ data set
can be fit to the results of a quantum numerical linked cluster (NLC) calculation, that allows estimates
for the terms in the XYZ Hamiltonian expected for such DO pyrochlore systems. Fits of the same theory
to the temperature dependence of neutron scattering and magnetic susceptibility complement this
analysis to produce robust estimates of the exchange parameters. Polarized neutron diffraction
results show spin flip scattering with pinch points, largely consistent with predictions from
the NLC calculation. However, the non-spin flip structure factor shows zone-boundary scattering
similar to that observed in the dipolar spin ice Ho$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ and likely arising from long-range
dipolar interactions. We conclude that Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ realizes a U(1)$_\pi$ QSL state at low
temperatures, and one that resides near the boundary between dipolar and octupolar character.
We then interpolate between the NLC-calculated $T$ $>$ $\sim$0.5 K $C_p$ and a low temperature form
for $C_p$ that is consistent with both the calculated near-neighbour exchange parameters and a
$T^3$ $C_p$ appropriate for emergent gapless photons. This low temperature form for $C_p$ allows
for $R\ln(2)$ entropy to be accounted for up to $T$ = 10 K. Phenomenologically, the entropy recovery
above the plateau in $C_p$, near $T$ = 0.08 K, gives $R\ln(2)$ less $\frac{R}{2}\ln(\frac{3}{2}$),
the missing Pauling, spin ice entropy.

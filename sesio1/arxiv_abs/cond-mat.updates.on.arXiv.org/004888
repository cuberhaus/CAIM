We report the temperature dependent dielectric properties and impedance spectroscopy investigation
of Na$_3$Zr$_2$Si$_2$PO$_{12}$ in the frequency range of 20 Hz--2 MHz. The Rietveld refinement
of x-ray diffraction pattern confirms the monoclinic phase with C2/c space group. The {\it d.c.}
resistivity behavior shows its strong insulating nature at low temperatures, and follows Arrhenius
law of thermal conduction with an activation energy of 0.68 eV. The decrease in electric permittivity
($\epsilon_r$) with frequency is explained based on the space polarization mechanism and its increment
with temperature by thermal activation of charge carriers. The dielectric loss (D=tan$\delta$)
peak follows the Arrhenius law of thermal activation with an energy of 0.25 eV. We observe an enhancement
in {\it a.c.} conductivity with frequency and temperature due to the decrease in the activation
energy, which results in enhancing the conduction between defect states. Further, we observe an
abrupt increase in the {\it a.c.} conductivity at high frequencies, which is explained using the
universal Jonschers power law. The analysis of {\it a.c.} conductivity shows two types of conduction
mechanisms namely correlated barrier hopping and non-overlapping small polaron tunnelling in
the measured temperature range. The imaginary part of the electric modulus confirms the non-Debye
type relaxation in the sample. The shifting of the relaxation peak towards higher frequency side
with an increase in temperature ensures its thermally activated nature. The scaling behavior of
the electric modulus shows similar type of relaxation over the measured temperature range. The
combined analysis of electric modulus and impedance with frequency shows the short-range mobility
of charge carriers.

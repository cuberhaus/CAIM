Tribological loading of metals induces microstructural changes by dislocation-mediated plastic
deformation. During continued sliding, combined shear and lattice rotation result in the formation
of crystallographic textures which influence friction and wear at the sliding interface. In order
to elucidate the fundamental lattice rotation kinematics involved in this process during the early
stages of sliding, we conducted unlubricated, linear single pass sliding experiments on a copper
bicrystal using sapphire spheres. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) performed directly
on the bulk surface of the wear tracks in the vicinity of the grain boundary reveals crystal lattice
rotations by approximately up to 35{\deg}. Predominantly, the tribologically induced crystal
rotations appear to be kinematically constrained to rotations around the transverse direction
(TD) and occur in both grains, irrespective of load (2 to 8 N). We demonstrate that inverting the sliding
direction (SD) inverts the sense of crystal rotation, but does not change the principal nature of
rotation for the majority of indexed EBSD data. A lower proportion of the crystal lattice rotates
much farther around TD (roughly up to 90{\deg}), accompanied by a superimposed crystal rotation
around +/-SD. Analysis reveals that sliding direction and grain orientation exert a systematic
influence of how crystal rotations are accommodated. This is rationalized in terms of geometry,
anisotropic wear track profiles and slip traces. Under specific conditions, combined crystal
rotation and twinning are observed. These detailed insights into the fundamental nature of tribologically
induced lattice rotation kinematics provide important guidance for applied research targeting
materials with superior tribological properties.

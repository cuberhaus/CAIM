The search for an alternative high-voltage polyanionic cathode material for Li-ion batteries
is vital to improve the energy densities beyond the state-of-the-art, where sulfate frameworks
form an important class of high-voltage cathode materials due to the strong inductive effect of
the S$^{6+}$ ion. Here, we have investigated the mechanism of cationic and/or anionic redox in Li$_x$M(SO$_4$)$_2$
frameworks (M = Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni and 0 $\leq$ x $\leq$ 2) using density functional calculations.
Specifically, we have used a combination of Hubbard $U$ corrected strongly constrained and appropriately
normed (SCAN+$U$) and generalized gradient approximation (GGA+$U$) functionals to explore the
thermodynamic (polymorph stability), electrochemical (intercalation voltage), geometric
(bond lengths), and electronic (band gaps, magnetic moments, charge populations, etc.) properties
of the bisulfate frameworks considered. Importantly, we find that the anionic (cationic) redox
process is dominant throughout delithiation in the Ni (Mn) bisulfate, as verified using our calculated
projected density of states, bond lengths, and on-site magnetic moments. On the other hand, in Fe
and Co bisulfates, cationic redox dominates the initial delithiation (1 $\leq$ x $\leq$ 2), while
anionic redox dominates subsequent delithiation (0 $\leq$ x $\leq$ 2). In addition, evaluation
of the crystal overlap Hamilton population reveals insignificant bonding between oxidizing O
atoms throughout the delithiation process in the Ni bisulfate, indicating robust battery performance
that is resistant to irreversible oxygen evolution. Finally, we observe both GGA+$U$ and SCAN+$U$
predictions are in qualitative agreement for the various properties predicted. Our work should
open new avenues for exploring lattice oxygen redox in novel high voltage polyanionic cathodes,
especially using the SCAN+$U$ functional.

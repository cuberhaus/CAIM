A recent study have shown that it is possible to have enhancement, in contrast to an expected suppression,
in tunneling density of states (TDOS) in a Luttinger liquid (LL) which is solely driven by the non-local
density-density interactions. Also, it is well known that a LL in proximity to a superconductor
(SC) shows enhancement in TDOS in the vicinity of the junction in the zero energy limit. In this paper,
we study the interplay of nonlocal density-density interaction and superconducting correlations
in the TDOS in the vicinity of the SC-LL junction, where the LL maybe realized on the edge of an integer
or a fractional quantum Hall state. We show that the TDOS enhancement in a LL quantum wire (QW) due
to superconducting correlation at the junction can be farther amplified in presence of appropriate
choice of non-local interaction parameters, which is demonstrated through a neat algebraic expression
in the weak interaction limit. We also show that, in the full parameter regime comprising both the
local and the non-local interaction, the region of enhanced TDOS for LL junction with "superconducting"
boundary condition and that of "non-superconducting charge conserving" boundary condition (discussed
in Phys. Rev. B 104, 045402 (2021)) are mutually exclusive. We show that this fact can be understood
in terms of symmetry relation established between the superconducting and non-superconducting
sectors of the theory. We compare the dependence of the proximity induced pair potential and TDOS
as a function of distance $x$ from the junction. We demonstrate that the dependence of the spatial
power law exponent for the `TDOS(x)/TDOS(x -> 0)' and the `pair-potential(x)/pair-potential(x
-> 0)' are distinct function of the various local and non-local interaction parameters, which implies
that the TDOS enhancement can not be directly attributed to the proximity induced pair potential
in the LL.

The material $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ has been the subject of intense scrutiny as a potential Kitaev quantum
spin liquid, predicted to display Majorana fermions as low energy excitations. In practice, $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$
undergoes a transition to a state with antiferromagnetic order below a temperature $T_{\rm N}$
$\approx$ 7 K, but this order can be suppressed by applying an external in-plane magnetic field of
$H_\parallel$ = 7 T. Whether a quantum spin liquid phase exists just above that field is still an open
question, but the reported observation of a quantized thermal Hall conductivity at $H_\parallel$
$>$ 7 T by Kasahara and co-workers $\big[$Kasahara ${\it et \ al}$., Nature ${\bf 559}$, 227 (2018)$\big]$
has been interpreted as evidence of itinerant Majorana fermions in the Kitaev quantum spin liquid
state. In this study, we re-examine the origin of the thermal Hall conductivity $\kappa_{\rm xy}$
in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. Our measurements of $\kappa_{\rm xy}$($T$) on several different crystals
yield a temperature dependence very similar to that of the phonon-dominated longitudinal thermal
conductivity $\kappa_{\rm xx}$($T$), for which the natural explanation is that $\kappa_{\rm
xy}$ is also mostly carried by phonons. Upon cooling, $\kappa_{\rm xx}$ peaks at $T \simeq$ 20 K,
then drops until $T_{\rm N}$, whereupon it suddenly increases again. The abrupt increase below
$T_{\rm N}$ is attributed to a sudden reduction in the scattering of phonons by low-energy spin fluctuations
as these become partially gapped when the system orders. The fact that $\kappa_{\rm xy}$ also increases
suddenly below $T_{\rm N}$ is strong evidence that the thermal Hall effect in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$
is also carried predominantly by phonons. This implies that any quantized signal from Majorana
edge modes would have to come on top of a sizable -- and sample-dependent -- phonon background.

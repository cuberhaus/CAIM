Cobalt based sulphides of compositional formula Co$ _{3} $A$ _{2} $S$ _{2} $ (A = Sn and In) are endowed
with frustrated kagome lattice structure and a plethora of novel phenomena determined from the
topological band structure. Here-in, we report on the detailed exploration of anisotropic magnetic
properties of single crystals of ferromagnetic compound Co$ _{3} $Sn$ _{2} $S$ _{2} $ under magnetic
field $H$ applied along the c-axis $(H\parallel c)$ and the ab-plane $(H\parallel ab)$. A low temperature
clustered-glassy magnetic behaviour is revealed in field-cooled and zero field-cooled magnetization
and memory effect measurement protocols. The sharp downturn and non-linearity observed in the
inverse susceptibility above the critical temperature $T _{\text{C}} $ in the paramagnetic region
corroborates to the presence of short-range ferromagnetic clusters above $ T _{\text{C}} $ in Co$
_{3} $Sn$ _{2} $S$ _{2} $. The deviation from linear Curie-Weiss behaviour in the paramagnetic state
signifies the strong Griffiths singularity in the material. The slow spin dynamics behaviour and
zero spontaneous magnetization above $ T _{\text{C}} $ give an evidence of Griffiths phase owing
to the ferromagnetic clusters. The Arrott plots derived from magnetization reveal convex type
curvature at low fields and linear positive behavior in the high field region, confirming the second
order magnetic phase transition in Co$ _{3} $Sn$ _{2} $S$ _{2} $. The Takahashi spin fluctuation
theory analysis provides sufficient evidence for itinerant ferromagnetism in Co$ _{3} $Sn$ _{2}
$S$ _{2} $. A large magneto-crystalline anisotropy concomitant with a high anisotropy field suggests
the dominance of strong spin orbit coupling phenomenon. Our experimental results emphasize an
intuitive understanding of the complex nature of magnetism present in Co-based shandite systems.

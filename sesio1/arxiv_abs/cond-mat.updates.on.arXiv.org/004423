In conventional superconductors, the electron-phonon coupling plays a dominant role in pairing
the electrons and generating superconductivity. In high temperature cuprate superconductors,
the existence of the electron coupling with phonons and other boson modes and its role in producing
high temperature superconductivity remain unclear. The evidence of the electron-boson coupling
mainly comes from the angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) observations of the ~70meV nodal dispersion
kink and the ~40meV antinodal kink. However, the reported results are sporadic and the nature of
the involved bosons are still under debate. Here we report new findings of ubiquitous two coexisting
electron-mode couplings in cuprate superconductors. By taking ultra-high resolution laser-based
ARPES measurements, combined with the improved second derivative analysis method, we discovered
that the electrons are coupled simultaneously with two sharp phonon modes with energies of ~70meV
and ~40meV in different superconductors with different doping levels, over the entire momentum
space and at different temperatures above and below the superconducting transition temperature.
The observed electron-phonon couplings are unusual because the associated energy scales do not
exhibit an obvious change across the superconducting transition. We further find that the well-known
"peak-dip-hump" structure, which has long been considered as a hallmark of superconductivity,
is also omnipresent and consists of finer structures that originates from electron coupling with
two sharp phonon modes. These comprehensive results provide a unified picture to reconcile all
the reported observations and pinpoint the origin of the electron-mode couplings in cuprate superconductors.
They provide key information to understand the role of the electron-phonon coupling in generating
high temperature superconductivity.

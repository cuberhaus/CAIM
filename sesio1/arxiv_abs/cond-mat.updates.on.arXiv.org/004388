Hydrogenation of amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) is critical for reducing defect densities, passivating
mid-gap states and surfaces, and improving photoconductivity in silicon-based electro-optical
devices. Modelling the atomic scale structure of this material is critical to understanding these
processes, which in turn is needed to describe c-Si/a-Si:H heterjunctions that are at the heart
of the modern solar cells with world record efficiency. Density functional theory (DFT) studies
achieve the required high accuracy but are limited to moderate system sizes a hundred atoms or so
by their high computational cost. Simulations of amorphous materials in particular have been hindered
by this high cost because large structural models are required to capture the medium range order
that is characteristic of such materials. Empirical potential models are much faster, but their
accuracy is not sufficient to correctly describe the frustrated local structure. Data driven,
"machine learned" interatomic potentials have broken this impasse, and have been highly successful
in describing a variety of amorphous materials in their elemental phase. Here we extend the Gaussian
approximation potential (GAP) for silicon by incorporating the interaction with hydrogen, thereby
significantly improving the degree of realism with which amorphous silicon can be modelled. We
show that our Si:H GAP enables the simulation of hydrogenated silicon with an accuracy very close
to DFT, but with computational expense and run times reduced by several orders of magnitude for large
structures. We demonstrate the capabilities of the Si:H GAP by creating models of hydrogenated
liquid and amorphous silicon, and showing that their energies, forces and stresses are in excellent
agreement with DFT results, and their structure as captured by bond and angle distributions, with
both DFT and experiments.

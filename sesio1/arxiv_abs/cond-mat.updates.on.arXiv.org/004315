Super cooled liquids display increasingly heterogeneous dynamics as temperature is lowered towards
the glass transition ($T_{g}$). A hallmark of this dynamical heterogeneity is the spontaneous
emergence of cooperative rearranging regions (CRRs) composed of fast moving particles. While
these CRRs in passive glass formers have been explored in great detail, thus understanding is severely
limited in active glass formers. The existing consensus on the morphology of CRRs in a passive glass
former prioritizes its fast subsets, composed of fast moving particles. In the present study, we
focus on a synthetic athermal active glass former and show an equal contribution for the morphology
of CRRs from slow subsets as well. Both these subsets exhibit an exponential distribution in their
structure which strongly correlates with the existence of CRRs. Interestingly, we also observe
that the fractal dimensions ($d_{\text{f}}$) of these subsets share both string and compact like
morphology that tends to vary in opposite fashion with the control parameters, namely the persistent
time ($\tau_{p}$) and the effective temperature ($T_{\text{eff}}$). The fractal dimension $d_{\text{f}}$
measures the roughness or put simply the compactness of fractal objects at their boundaries. More
precisely, molecules are loosely bound in a structure for which boundary is rough and thereby this
condition facilitates its structural change in terms of size and shape. It is also a fact that any
structural change is a signature of relaxation dynamics in the context of glass forming liquids.
Thus, in the present study, we observe a change in $d_{\text{f}}$ with $T_{\text{eff}}$ and $\tau_{p}$
from the insights of morphology variation that causes structural change, both in the BD limit and
non-equilibrium limit.

Optical drives at terahertz and mid-infrared frequencies in quantum materials are increasingly
used to reveal the nonlinear dynamics of collective modes in correlated many-body systems and their
interplay with electromagnetic waves. Recent experiments demonstrated several surprising optical
properties of transient states induced by driving, including the appearance of photo-induced
edges in the reflectivity in cuprate superconductors, observed both below and above the equilibrium
transition temperature. Furthermore, in other driven materials, reflection coefficients larger
than unity have been observed. In this paper we demonstrate that unusual optical properties of photoexcited
systems can be understood from the perspective of a Floquet system; a system with periodically modulated
system parameters originating from pump-induced oscillations of a collective mode. We present
a general phenomenological model of reflectivity from Floquet materials, which takes into account
parametric generation of excitation pairs. We find a universal phase diagram of drive induced features
in reflectivity which evidence a competition between driving and dissipation. To illustrate our
general analysis we apply our formalism to two concrete examples motivated by recent experiments:
a single plasmon band, which describes Josephson plasmons in layered superconductors, and a phonon-polariton
system, which describes upper and lower polaritons in materials such as insulating SiC. Finally
we demonstrate that our model can be used to provide an accurate fit to results of phonon-pump - terahertz-probe
experiments in the high temperature superconductor $\rm{YBa_2Cu_3O_{6.5}}$. Our model explains
the appearance of a pump-induced edge, which is higher in energy than the equilibrium Josephson
plasmon edge, even if the interlayer Josephson coupling is suppressed by the pump pulse.

We present spin transport studies on a low-field, room-temperature magnetoelectric multiferroic
polycrystalline $\text{Sr}_{3}\text{Co}_{2}\text{Fe}_{24}\text{O}_{41}$ (SCFO)|Pt heterostructure
wherein a highly tunable transverse conical magnetic phase is responsible for static and dynamic
magnetoelectric coupling. We measured angular dependence of spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR)
at constant magnetic fields ($H$) in the range of 50 to 100 kOe. Application of field below the critical
value (2.5 kOe), yielded negative SMR and the $H$-evolution of normalized SMR exhibited a negative
gradient. Further, an increase in the $H$ resulted in the positive slope of normalized SMR Vs. $H$
and later at higher $H$ around 14 kOe, a crossover from negative to positive SMR was observed. We employed
a simple model for estimating the equilibrium magnetic configuration and computed the SMR modulation
at various values of $H$. We argue that the tilting of the cone is dominant and in turn responsible
for the observed nature of SMR below 2.5 kOe while, the closing of the cone-angle is pronounced at
higher fields causing a reversal in sign of the SMR from negative to positive. Importantly, SMR experiments
revealed that a change in the helicity with a reversal of the magnetic field has no influence on the
observed SMR. Longitudinal spin Seebeck effect (LSSE) signal was measured to be 500 nV at 280 K, under
application of thermal gradient, $\Delta T = 23$ K and field, 60 kOe. The observed LSSE signal, originating
from pure magnon spin current, showed a similar $H$-dependent behavior as that of the magnetization
of SCFO. Our detailed spin transport studies on polycrystalline SCFO|Pt heterostructure demonstrate
high tunability of the amplitude and the sign of the SMR, highlighting its potential for novel spintronic
devices such as SMR-based spin valves and voltage-controlled spin transport devices.

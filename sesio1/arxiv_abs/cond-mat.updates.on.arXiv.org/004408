The radiative response of any object is governed by a surface parameter known as emissivity. Tuning
the emissivity of surfaces has been of great interest in many applications involving thermal radiation
such as thermophotovoltaics, thermal management systems, and passive radiative cooling. Although
several surface engineering techniques (e.g., surface functionalization) have been pursued
to alter the emissivity, there exists a knowledge gap in precisely predicting the emissivity of
a surface prior to the modification/fabrication process. Predicting emissivity by a physics-based
modeling approach is challenging due to surface's contributing factors, complex interactions
and interdependence, and measuring the emissivity requires a tedious procedure for every sample.
Thus, a new approach is much-needed to systematically predict the emissivity and expand the applications
of thermal radiation. In this work, we demonstrate the immense advantage of employing artificial
intelligence (AI) techniques to predict the emissivity of complex surfaces. For this aim, we fabricated
116 bulk aluminum 6061 samples with various surface characteristics using femtosecond laser surface
processing (FLSP). A comprehensive dataset was established by collecting surface characteristic
data, laser operating parameters, and measured emissivities for all samples. We demonstrated
the application of AI in two distinct scenarios. First, the range of emissivity of an unknown sample
was shown to be estimated correctly solely based on its 3D surface morphology image. Second, the
emissivity of a sample was precisely predicted based on its surface characteristics data and fabrication
parameters. The implementation of the AI techniques resulted in the highly accurate prediction
of emissivity by showing excellent agreement with the measurements.

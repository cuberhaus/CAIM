Interpenetrated polymer network microgels, composed of crosslinked networks of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)
and polyacrylic acid (PAAc), have been investigated through rheological measurements at four
different amounts of polyacrylic acid. Both PAAc content and crosslinking degree modify particle
dimensions, mass and softness, thereby strongly affecting the volume fraction and the system viscosity.
Here the volume fraction is derived from the flow curves at low concentrations by fitting the zero-shear
viscosity with the Einstein-Batchelor equation which provides a parameter k to shift weight concentration
to volume fraction. We find that particles with higher PAAc content and crosslinker are characterized
by a greater value of k and therefore by larger volume fractions when compared to softer particles.
The packing fractions obtained from rheological measurements are compared with those from static
light scattering for two PAAc contents revealing a good agreement. Moreover, the behaviour of the
viscosity as a function of packing fraction, at room temperature, has highlighted an Arrhenius
dependence for microgels synthesized with low PAAc content and a Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann dependence
for the highest investigated PAAc concentration. A comparison with the hard spheres behaviour
indicates a steepest increase of the viscosity with decreasing particles softness. Finally, the
volume fraction dependence of the viscosity at a fixed PAAc and at two different temperatures, below
and above the volume phase transition, shows a quantitative agreement with the structural relaxation
time measured through dynamic light scattering indicating that IPN microgels softness can be tuned
with PAAc and temperature and that, depending on particle softness, two different routes are followed.

We report a new experimental approach for observing mesoscopic fluctuations underlying the thermodynamic
anomalies of ambient liquid water. In this approach, two sound velocity measurements with different
frequencies, namely inelastic X-ray scattering (IXS) in THz band and ultrasonic (US) in MHz band,
are required to investigate the relaxation phenomenon with the characteristic frequency between
the two aforementioned frequencies. We performed IXS measurements to obtain the IXS sound velocity
of liquid water from the ambient conditions to the supercritical region of liquid-gas phase transition
(LGT) and compared the results with the US sound velocity in the literature. We found that the ratio
of the two sound velocities, Sf, which corresponds to the relaxation intensity, exhibits a simple
but significant change. Two distinct rises were observed in the high-temperature and low-temperature
regions, implying that two relaxation phenomena exist: in the high-temperature region, a peak
was observed near the LGT critical ridge line, which was linked with changes in the density fluctuation
and isochoric and isobaric specific heat capacities; in the low-temperature region, Sf increased
toward the low-temperature region, which was linked with the change in the isochoric heat capacity.
We concluded that these two relaxation phenomena are originated from critical fluctuations of
liquid-gas phase transition (LGT) and liquid-liquid phase transition, respectively. The linkage
between Sf and isochoric heat capacity in the low-temperature region proves that the relaxation
is the cause of the well-known heat capacity anomaly of ambient liquid water. In this study, both
LGT and LLT critical fluctuations were observed, and the relationship between thermodynamics
and the critical fluctuations was comprehensively discussed.

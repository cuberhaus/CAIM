The aim of this study was two-fold. First, we proposed a new numerical method to investigate the particularities
of evolution. Second, we applied this method to a model of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) and explored
the evolution of mutational robustness. Living systems have developed functions through evolutionary
processes. However, evolutionary simulation (ES) alone is insufficient to understand the particularities
of this process theoretically, because the outcomes of ES depend on evolutionary pathways. Therefore,
a reference system is required for comparison. An appropriate reference system for this purpose
is an ensemble of the randomly sampled genotypes. However, it is difficult to generate high-fitness
genotypes using simple random sampling because such genotypes are rare. Nagata and Kikuchi (PLoS
Comput Biol 16 (2020) e1007969) proposed a method that enables sampling GRN genotypes from low to
high fitness based on the multicanonical Monte Carlo method developed in statistical physics.
In this study, we used this method to construct a reference ensemble of GRNs and compared it with the
outcomes of ES. In particular, we focused on mutational robustness and its relationship with bistability.
We obtained the following results. First, mutational robustness was significantly higher in ES
than in the reference ensemble at the same fitness level. In other words, evolution enhances mutational
robustness. Second, random sampling revealed that GRNs with high fitness exhibited bistability
when a sensitive response to environmental changes was needed. Comparison with ES showed that the
emergence of this new phenotype, bistability, was delayed in evolution. Third, the bistable group
of GRNs contains many mutationally fragile GRNs compared with those in the non-bistable group.
This suggests that the delayed emergence of bistability is a consequence of the mutation-selection
mechanism.

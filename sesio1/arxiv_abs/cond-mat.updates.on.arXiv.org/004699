As an unconventional realization of topological orders with an exotic interplay of topology and
geometry, fracton (topological) orders feature subextensive topological ground state degeneracy
and subdimensional excitations that are movable only within a certain subspace. It has been known
in exactly solvable three-dimensional (3D) X-cube model that universally represents the type-I
fracton orders, mobility constraints on subdimensional excitations originate from the absence
of spatially deformable string-like operators. To unveil the interplay of topology and geometry,
in this paper, we study dynamical signature in the X-cube model in the presence of external Zeeman
fields via large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation and stochastic analytic continuation.
We compute both real-space correlation functions and dynamic structure factors of subdimensional
excitations (i.e., fractons, lineons, and planons) in the fracton phase and their evolution into
the trivial paramagnetic phase by increasing external fields. We find in the fracton phase, the
correlation functions and the spectral functions show clear anisotropy exactly caused by the underlying
mobility constraints. On the other hand, the external fields successfully induce quantum fluctuations
and offer mobility to excitations along the subspace allowed by mobility constraints. These numerical
results provide the evolution of dynamical signature of subdimensional particles in fracton orders,
indicating that the mobility constraints on local dynamical properties of subdimensional excitations
are deeply related to the existence of fracton topological order. The results will also be helpful
in potential experimental identifications in spectroscopy measurements such as neutron scattering
and nuclear magnetic resonance.

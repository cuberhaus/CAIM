In microrheology, the local rheological properties such as viscoelasticity of a complex fluid
are inferred from the free or forced motion of embedded colloidal probe particles. Theoretical
machinery developed for forced-probe microrheology of colloidal suspensions focused on either
constant-force (CF) or constant-velocity (CV) probes while in experiments neither the force nor
the kinematics of the probe is fixed. More importantly, the constraint of CF or CV introduces a difficulty
in the meaningful quantification of the fluctuations of the probe due to a thermodynamic uncertainty
relation. It is known that for a Brownian particle trapped in a harmonic potential well, the product
of the standard deviations of the trap force and the particle position is $d k_BT$ in $d$ dimensions
with $k_BT$ being the thermal energy. As a result, if the force (position) is not allowed to fluctuate,
the position (force) fluctuation becomes infinite. To allow the measurement of fluctuations,
in this work we consider a microrheology model in which the embedded probe is dragged along by a moving
harmonic potential so that both its position and the trap force are allowed to fluctuate. Starting
from the full Smoluchowski equation governing the dynamics of $N$ hard active Brownian particles,
we derive a pair Smoluchowski equation describing the dynamics of the probe as it interacts with
one bath particle by neglecting hydrodynamic interactions among particles in the dilute limit.
From this, we determine the mean and the variance (i.e., fluctuation) of the probe position in terms
of the pair probability distribution. We then characterize the behavior of the system in the limits
of both weak and strong trap. By taking appropriate limits, we show that our generalized model can
be reduced to the well-studied CF or CV microrheology models.

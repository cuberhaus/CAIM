Magnetism and magnetic monopole are classical issues in basic physics. Conventional magnets are
generally composed of rigid materials with shapes and structures unchangeable which may face challenges
sometimes to answer the above questions. Here, from an alternative other than rigid magnet, we disclosed
an unconventional way to generate endogenous magnetism and then construct magnetic monopole through
tuning liquid metal machine. Through theoretical interpretation and conceptual experiments,
we illustrated that when gallium base liquid metal in solution rotates under actuation of an external
electric field, it forms an endogenous magnetic field inside which well explains the phenomenon
that two such discrete metal droplets could easily fuse together, indicating their reciprocal
attraction via N and S poles. Further, we conceived that the self-driving liquid metal motor was
also an endogenous magnet owning the electromagnetic homology. When liquid metal in solution swallowed
aluminum inside, it formed a spin motor and dynamically variable charge distribution which produced
an endogenous magnetic field. This finding explains the phenomena that there often happened reflection
collision and attraction fusion between running liquid metal motors which were just caused by the
dynamic adjustment of their N and S polarities. Finally, we conceived that such endogenous magnet
could lead to magnetic monopole and four technical routes were suggested as: 1. Matching the interior
flow field of liquid metal machines; 2. Superposition between external electric effect and magnetic
field; 3. Composite construction between magnetic particles and liquid metal motor; 4. Chemical
ways such as via galvanic cell reaction. Overall, the fluidic endogenous magnet and the promising
magnetic monopole it enabled may lead to unconventional magnetoelectric devices and applications
in the near future.

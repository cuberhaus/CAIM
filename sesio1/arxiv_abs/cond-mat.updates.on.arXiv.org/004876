We derive low-energy effective Hamiltonians (LEH) for several high-temperature superconducting
(SC) copper oxides. We focus on Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CuO$_6$ (Bi2201, $N_{\ell}=1$, $T_c \sim 10$ K), Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_8$
(Bi2212, $N_{\ell}=2$, $T_c \sim 84$ K) and CaCuO$_2$ (Ca11, $N_{\ell}=\infty$, $T_c \sim 110$
K), where $N_{\ell}$ is the number of laminated CuO$_2$ planes between neighboring block layers,
and $T_c$ is the experimental optimal SC transition temperature. We apply the latest methodology
of the multiscale ab initio scheme for correlated electron systems (MACE) [Hirayama et al, Phys.
Rev. B 99, 245155 (2019)]. The LEH for HgBa$_2$CuO$_4$ (Hg1201, $N_{\ell}=1$, $T_c \sim 90$ K) is
also derived to benchmark the consistency with the literature. We mainly discuss the single-orbital
LEH consisting of the antibonding (AB) combination of Cu$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ and O$2p_{\sigma}$ orbitals
in the CuO$_2$ plane, by which the experimental phase diagram of Hg1201 was reproduced [Ohgoe et
al, Phys, Rev. B 101, 045124 (2020)]. The derived LEHs provide reliable starting points to understand
the difference in $T_c$ and SC mechanism, when they are solved by accurate quantum many-body solvers.
We further discuss the following features: (1) The onsite effective interaction $U \sim 3.6-4.5$
eV increases monotonically with $T_c$, which is consistent with the expectation of increasing
SC order parameter $\Delta_{\rm SC}$ with increasing $U$. (2) Inspection of the three-orbital
LEH consisting of the AB and two counterpart bonding (B) orbitals suggests that the single-orbital
LEH looks sufficient to describe low-energy physics. (3) For $N_{\ell} \geq 2$, off-site interactions
between neighboring CuO$_2$ layers ($\sim 0.7$ eV) and within a CuO$_2$ layer ($\sim 1.0$ eV) are
comparable. We discuss their contributions to both $\Delta_{\rm SC}$ and the stability of the SC
state.

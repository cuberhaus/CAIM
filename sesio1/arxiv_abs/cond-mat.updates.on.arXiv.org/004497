We study the phase diagram of a system of $2\times 2\times 1$ hard plates on the three dimensional
cubic lattice, {\em i.e.} a lattice gas of plates that each cover an elementary plaquette of the cubic
lattice and occupy its four vertices, with the constraint that no two plates occupy the same site
of the cubic lattice. We focus on the isotropic system, with equal fugacities for the three orientations
of plates. We show, using grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations, that the system undergoes two
density-driven phase transitions with increasing density of plates: the first from a disordered
fluid to a layered phase, and the second from the layered phase to a sublattice-ordered phase. In
the layered phase, the system breaks up into disjoint slabs of thickness two along one spontaneously
chosen cartesian direction. Plates with normals perpendicular to this layering direction are
preferentially contained entirely within these slabs, while plates straddling two successive
slabs have a lower density. Additionally the symmetry between the three types of plates is spontaneously
broken, as plates with normal along the layering direction have a lower density than the other two
types of plates. Intriguingly, the occupied slabs exhibit two-dimensional power-law columnar
order even in the presence of a nonzero density of vacancies. In contrast, inter-slab correlations
of the two-dimensional columnar order parameter decay exponentially with the separation between
the slabs. In the sublattice-ordered phase, there is two-fold ($Z_2$) breaking of lattice translation
symmetry along all three cartesian directions. We present numerical evidence that the disordered
to layered transition is continuous and consistent with the three-dimensional $O(3)$ universality
class, while the layered to sublattice transition is first-order in nature.

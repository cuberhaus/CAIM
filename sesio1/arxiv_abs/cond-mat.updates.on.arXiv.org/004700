Two-dimensional (2D) perovskites show higher stability in comparison to their three-dimensional
(3D) counterparts. Therefore, 2D perovskites have invoked remarkable attention in basic understanding
of their physical properties and optoelectronic applications. Here we present a low-dimensional
naturally self-assembled inorganic-organic (IO) hybrid systems based on primary cyclic ammonium-based
(C$_{\textrm{n}}$H$_{2\textrm{n}-1}$NH$_{3}$) semiconductor series [viz. ((C$_{\textrm{n}}$H$_{2\textrm{n}-1}$
NH$_3$)$_2$PbI$_4$; n=3-6)]. However, the wide bandgap nature and presence of toxicity due to
lead (Pb) prohibit their applications. Therefore, in the present work, we study the role of Ge/Sn
substitution and Pb-vacancy (Pb-$\boxtimes$) to reduce concentration of Pb and to enhance solar
cell efficiency by the formation of mixed perovskite structures. We have discussed the effect of
spin-orbit coupling (SOC) using state-of-the-art hybrid density functional theory (DFT). We
find the mixed conformers with Pb-$\boxtimes$ do not possess structural stability. Moreover,
they have indirect bandgap, which is not good for solar cell applications. Only those conformers,
which have favourable thermodynamics and structural stability, are considered for further study
of optical properties. Our results infer that Sn substitution is more favorable than that of Ge in
replacing Pb and enhancing the efficiency. Exciton binding energies calculated using Wannier-Mott
approach for pristine and substituted conformers are larger than lead halide perovskites, while
the electron-phonon coupling is smaller in the former. From computed spectroscopic limited maximum
efficiency (SLME), these 2D perovskites show enough promise as alternatives to conventional lead
halide perovskites.

Layered van-der-Waals materials with hexagonal symmetry offer an extra degree of freedom to their
electrons, the so called valley index or valley pseudospin. This quantity behaves conceptually
like the electron spin and the term valleytronics has been coined. In this context, the group of semiconducting
transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) are particularly appealing, due to large spin-orbit
interactions and a direct bandgap at the K points of the hexagonal Brillouin zone. In this work, we
present investigations of excitonic transitions in mono- and multilayer WSe$_2$ and MoSe$_2$
materials by time-resolved Faraday ellipticity (TRFE) with in-plane magnetic fields, $B_{\parallel}$,
of up to 9 T. In monolayer samples, the measured TRFE time traces are almost independent of $B_{\parallel}$,
which confirms a close to zero in-plane exciton $g$ factor $g_\parallel$, consistent with first-principles
calculations. In stark contrast, we observe pronounced temporal oscillations in multilayer samples
for $B_{\parallel}>0$. Remarkably, the extracted in-plane $g_\parallel$ are very close to reported
out-of-plane exciton $g$ factors of the materials, namely $|g_{\parallel 1s}|=3.1\pm 0.2$ and
$2.5\pm0.2$ for the 1s A excitons in WSe$_2$ and MoSe$_2$ multilayers, respectively. Our first-principles
calculations nicely confirm the presence of a non-zero $g_{\parallel}$ for the multilayer samples.
We propose that the oscillatory TRFE signal in the multilayer samples is caused by pseudospin quantum
beats of excitons, which is a manifestation of spin- and pseudospin layer locking in the multilayer
samples. Our results demonstrate ultrafast pseudospin rotations in the GHz- to THz frequency range,
which pave the way towards ultrafast pseudospin manipulation in multilayer TMDC samples.

Understanding and predicting uncertain things are the central themes of scientific evolution.
Human beings revolve around these fears of uncertainties concerning various aspects like a global
pandemic, health, finances, to name but a few. Dealing with this unavoidable part of life is far tougher
due to the chaotic nature of these unpredictable activities. In the present article, we consider
a global network of identical chaotic maps, which splits into two different clusters, despite the
interaction between all nodes are uniform. The stability analysis of the spatially homogeneous
chaotic solutions provides a critical coupling strength, before which we anticipate such partial
synchronization. The distance between these two chaotic synchronized populations often deviates
more than eight times of standard deviation from its long-term average. The probability density
function of these highly deviated values fits well with the Generalized Extreme Value distribution.
Meanwhile, the distribution of recurrence time intervals between extreme events resembles the
Weibull distribution. The existing literature helps us to characterize such events as extreme
events using the significant height. These extremely high fluctuations are less frequent in terms
of their occurrence. We determine numerically a range of coupling strength for these extremely
large but recurrent events. On-off intermittency is the responsible mechanism underlying the
formation of such extreme events. Besides understanding the generation of such extreme events
and their statistical signature, we furnish forecasting these events using the powerful deep learning
algorithms of an artificial recurrent neural network. This Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) can offer
handy one-step forecasting of these chaotic intermittent bursts. We also ensure the robustness
of this forecasting model with two hundred hidden cells in each LSTM layer.

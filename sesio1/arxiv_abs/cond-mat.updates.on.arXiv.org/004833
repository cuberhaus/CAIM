The nonequilibrium thermodynamics feature of a Brownian motor is investigated by obtaining exact
time-dependent solutions. This in turn enables us to investigate not only the long time property
(steady-state) but also the short time the behavior of the system. The general expressions for the
free energy, entropy production ${\dot e}_{p}(t)$ as well as entropy extraction ${\dot h}_{d}(t)$
rates are derived for a system that is genuinely driven out of equilibrium by time-independent force
as well as by spatially varying thermal background. We show that for a system that operates between
hot and cold reservoirs, most of the thermodynamics quantities approach a non-equilibrium steady
state in the long time limit. The change in free energy becomes minimal at a steady state. However
for a system that operates in a heat bath where its temperature varies linearly in space, the entropy
production and extraction rates approach a non-equilibrium steady state while the change in free
energy varies linearly in space. This reveals that unlike systems at equilibrium, when systems
are driven out of equilibrium, their free energy may not be minimized. The thermodynamic properties
of a system that operates between the hot and cold baths are further compared and contrasted with
a system that operates in a heat bath where its temperature varies linearly in space along with the
reaction coordinate. We show that the entropy, entropy production, and extraction rates are considerably
larger for linearly varying temperature case than a system that operates between the hot and cold
baths revealing such systems are inherently irreversible. For both cases, in the presence of load
or when a distinct temperature difference is retained, the entropy $S(t)$ monotonously increases
with time and saturates to a constant value as $t$ further steps up.

Quantum circuits have been widely used as a platform to simulate generic quantum many-body systems.
In particular, random quantum circuits provide a means to probe universal features of many-body
quantum chaos and ergodicity. Some such features have already been experimentally demonstrated
in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. On the theory side, properties of random
quantum circuits have been studied on a case-by-case basis and for certain specific systems, a hallmark
of quantum chaos - universal Wigner-Dyson level statistics - has been derived. This work develops
an effective field theory for a large class of random quantum circuits. The theory has the form of
a replica sigma model and is similar to the low-energy approach to diffusion in disordered systems.
The method is used to explicitly derive universal random matrix behavior of a large family of random
circuits. In particular, we rederive Wigner-Dyson spectral statistics of the brickwork circuit
model by Chan, De~Luca, and Chalker [Phys. Rev. X 8, 041019 (2018)] and show within the same calculation
that its various permutations and higher-dimensional generalizations preserve the universal
level statistics. Finally, we use the replica sigma model framework to rederive the Weingarten
calculus, which is a method to evaluate integrals of polynomials of matrix elements with respect
to the Haar measure over compact groups and has many applications in the studies of quantum circuits.
The effective field theory, derived here, provides both a method to quantitatively characterize
quantum dynamics of random Floquet systems (e.g., calculating operator and entanglement spreading)
and also path to understanding the general fundamental mechanism behind quantum chaos and thermalization
in these systems.

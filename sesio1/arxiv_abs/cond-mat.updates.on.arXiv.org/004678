Depositing carbon films by hot-filament chemical vapor deposition system is a topic of great interest.
A carbon film is deposited at some value of the chamber pressure, where it is controlled by different
composition of gases. In hot-filament reactor, having dissociated from methane precursor, gaseous
carbon atoms convert into mainly the graphite state atoms or the diamond state atoms. Increase in
the chamber pressure from 3.3 kPa to 14 kPa changes the morphology and structure of the deposited
carbon films. Increasing the chamber pressure upto 8.6 kPa increases the growth rate of carbon film
along with discernible features of grains and particles. The rate of converting gaseous carbon
atoms into diamond state atoms also increases. At 11.3 kPa and 14 kPa high chamber pressures, gaseous
carbon atoms converted into the graphite state atoms at high rate. However, the films with low growth
rates are deposited. The gas activation and gas collision processes vary largely at varying chamber
pressure. Hence, morphology and structure of carbon films got deposited with different nucleation
and growth rates. The rate of dissociating molecular hydrogen into atomic hydrogen becomes different
at each chamber pressure. Atomic hydrogen is used to etch the photons emitted from hot-filaments
converting them into typical energy of different shapes. Consequently, the amount of formation
of typical energy varies at varying chamber pressure. A certain-shaped typical energy is involved
to convert the gaseous carbon atoms into the graphite and diamond state atoms. Graphite state atoms
get bound by the previously involved typical energy. However, a different shaped typical energy
is involved in the process of binding diamond state atoms. The study sets a new trend in depositing,
characterizing and analyzing the carbon films.

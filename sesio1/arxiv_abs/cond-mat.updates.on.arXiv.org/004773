High traffic touch surfaces such as doorknobs, countertops, and handrails can be transmission
points for the spread of pathogens, emphasizing the need to develop materials that actively self-sanitize.
Metals are frequently used for these surfaces due to their durability, but many metals also possess
antimicrobial properties which function through a variety of mechanisms. This work investigates
metallic alloys comprised of several bioactive metals with the target of achieving broad-spectrum,
rapid bioactivity through synergistic activity. An entropy-motivated stabilization paradigm
is proposed to prepare scalable alloys of copper, silver, nickel and cobalt. Using combinatorial
sputtering, thin-film alloys were prepared on 100 mm wafers with 50% compositional grading of each
element across the wafer. The films were then annealed and investigated for alloy stability. Bioactivity
testing was performed on both the as-grown alloys and the annealed films using four microorganisms
-- Phi6, MS2, Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli -- as surrogates for human viral and bacterial
pathogens. Testing showed that after 30 s of contact with some of the test alloys, Phi6, an enveloped,
single-stranded RNA bacteriophage that serves as a SARS-CoV 2 surrogate, was reduced up to 6.9 orders
of magnitude (>99.9999%). Additionally, the non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA bacteriophage
MS2, and the Gram-negative E. coli and Gram-positive B. subtilis bacterial strains showed a 5.0,
6.4, and 5.7 log reduction in activity after 30, 20 and 10 minutes, respectively. Bioactivity in
the alloy samples showed a strong dependence on the composition, with the log reduction scaling
directly with the Cu content. Concentration of Cu by phase separation after annealing improved
activity in some of the samples. The results motivate a variety of themes which can be leveraged to
design ideal bioactive surfaces.

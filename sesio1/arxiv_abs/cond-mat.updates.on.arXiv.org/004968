The evolution of interfaces is intrinsic to many physical processes ranging from cavitation in
fluids to recrystallization in solids. Computational modeling of interface motion entails a number
of challenges, many of which are related to the range of topological transitions that can occur over
the course of the simulation. Microstructure evolution in a polycrystalline material that involves
grain boundary motion is a particularly complex example due to the extreme variety, heterogeneity,
and anisotropy of grain boundary properties. Accurately modeling this process is essential to
determining processing-structure-property relationships in polycrystalline materials though.
Simulations of microstructure evolution in such materials often use diffuse interface methods
like the phase field method that are advantageous for their versatility and ease of handling complex
geometries but can be prohibitively expensive due to the need for high interface resolution. Discrete
interface methods require fewer grid points and can consequently exhibit better performance but
have received comparatively little attention, perhaps due to the difficulties of maintaining
the mesh and consistently implementing topological transitions on the grain boundary network.
This work explicitly compares a recently-developed discrete interface method to a multiphase
field method on several classical problems relating to microstructure evolution in polcrystalline
materials: a shrinking spherical grain, the steady-state triple junction dihedral angle, and
the steady-state quadruple point dihedral angle. In each case, the discrete method is found to meet
or outperform the multiphase field method with respect to accuracy for comparable levels of refinement,
demonstrating its potential efficacy as a numerical approach for microstructure evolution in
polycrystalline materials.

Double perovskite based magnets wherein frustration and competition between emergent degrees
of freedom are at play can lead to novel electronic and magnetic phenomena. Herein, we report the
structural and magnetic properties of an ordered double perovskite material Ho2CoMnO6. In the
double perovskite with general class A2BB'O6, the octahedral B and B' -site has a distinct crystallographic
site. The Rietveld refinement of XRD data reveal that Ho2CoMnO6 crystallizes in the monoclinic
P21/n space group. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms the charge state of cations present
in this material. The temperature dependence of magnetization and specific heat exhibit a long-range
ferromagnetic ordering at Tc = 79 K owing to the super exchange interaction between Co2+ and Mn4+
moments. Furthermore, the magnetization isotherm at 5 K shows a hysteresis curve that confirms
ferromagnetic behavior of this double perovskite. We observed Griffiths-like phase and re-entrant
glassy state in the intermediate temperature regime, which is attributed to the presence of inherent
anti-site disorder and competing interactions. The temperature dependent Raman spectroscopy
studies support the presence of spin-phonon coupling and short range order above Tc way up to the
Griffiths temperature in this double perovskite. The stabilization of magnetic ordering and charge
states is further analyzed through electronic structure calculations. The latter also infers
the compound to be a narrow band gap insulator with the gap arising between the lower and upper Hubbard
Co-d subbands. Our results demonstrate that anti-site disorder and complex 3d-4f exchange interactions
in the spin-lattice account for the unconventional electronic and magnetic properties in this
promising double perovskite material.

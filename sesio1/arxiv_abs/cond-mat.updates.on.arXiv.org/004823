By viewing a (generalized) finite symmetry as a topological order $M$ in one higher dimension (i.e.
as a categorical symmetry), we find that the patterns of spontaneous categorical symmetry breaking
are classified by condensable (higher) algebras $A$ formed by excitations in $M$. Various categorical
symmetry breaking patterns can describe, in a unified way, symmetry breaking orders, symmetry
protected topological orders, symmetry enriched topological orders, gapless critical points,
etc. The local low energy properties of a state with spontaneous categorical symmetry breaking
pattern $A$ are exactly reproduced by a 1-condensed boundary state of $M_{/A}$, where $M_{/A}$
(called unbroken categorical symmetry) is the topological order obtained from $M$ by condensing
$A$. The properties of the gapless state can be calculated from the unbroken categorical symmetry
$M_{/A}$ via an algebraic number theoretical method. For example, a state with symmetry breaking
pattern $A$ can be gapped if $M_{/A}$ is trivial, and must be gapless if $M_{/A}$ is non-trivial.
This is a general way to understand the emergence and the symmetry protection of gaplessness, that
applies to generalized symmetries, such as algebraic higher symmetries. The relations between
the condensable algebras also help us to determine the structure of the global phase diagram. Using
such a theory, we show that, for 1+1D $Z_2 \times Z_2'$ symmetry with the mixed anomaly, there is a
stable continuous transition between the $Z_2$-breaking-$Z_2'$-symmetric phase and the $Z_2$-symmetric-$Z_2'$-breaking
phase. The critical point is the same as the $Z_4$ symmetry breaking critical point. The gapped and
gapless states for 1+1D bosonic systems with anomalous $S_3$ symmetries are also obtained. For
example, anomalous $S_3^{(2)}$ symmetry can have a stable chiral gapless phase described $E(8)_1
\times \bar{SO}(9)_2$ CFT.

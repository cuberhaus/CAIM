The novel spin-triplet superconductor candidate UTe2 was discovered only recently at the end of
2018 and attracted enormous attention. We review key experimental and theoretical progress which
has been achieved in different laboratories. UTe2 is a heavy-fermion paramagnet, but right after
the discovery of superconductivity it has been expected to be close to a ferromagnetic instability
showing many similarities to the U-based ferromagnetic superconductors, URhGe and UCoGe. The
competition between different types of magnetic interactions and the duality between the local
and itinerant character of the 5f Uranium electrons, as well as the shift of the U valence appear as
key parameters in the rich phase diagrams discovered recently under extreme conditions like low
temperature, high magnetic field, and pressure. We discuss macroscopic and microscopic experiments
at low temperature to clarify the normal phase properties at ambient pressure. Special attention
will be given to the occurrence of a metamagnetic transition at Hm = 35 T for a magnetic field applied
along the hard magnetic axis b. Adding external pressure leads to strong changes in the magnetic
and electronic properties with a direct feedback on superconductivity. Attention will be given
on the possible evolution of the Fermi surface as a function of magnetic field and pressure. Superconductivity
in UTe2 is extremely rich exhibiting various unconventional behaviors which will be highlighted.
It shows an exceptionally huge superconducting upper critical field with a re-entrant behavior
under magnetic field and the occurrence of multiple superconducting phases in the temperature
field, pressure phase diagram. There is evidence for spin-triplet pairing. The different theoretical
approaches will be described. Notably we discuss that UTe2 is a possible example for the realization
of a fascinating topological superconductor.

The unsteady, nonlinear magnetization dynamics induced by spin injection in an easy-plane ferromagnetic
channel subject to an external magnetic field are studied analytically. Leveraging a dispersive
hydrodynamic description, the Landau-Lifshitz equation is recast in terms of hydrodynamic-like
variables for the magnetization's perpendicular component (spin density) and azimuthal phase
gradient (fluid velocity). Spin injection acts as a moving piston that generates nonlinear, dynamical
spin textures in the ferromagnetic channel with downstream quiescent spin density set by the external
field. In contrast to the classical problem of a piston accelerating a compressible gas, here, variable
spin injection and field lead to a rich variety of nonlinear wave phenomena from oscillatory spin
shocks to solitons and rarefaction waves. A full classification of solutions is provided using
nonlinear wave modulation theory by identifying two key aspects of the fluid-like dynamics: subsonic/supersonic
conditions and convex/nonconvex hydrodynamic flux. Familiar waveforms from the classical piston
problem such as rarefaction (expansion) waves and shocks manifest in their spin-based counterparts
as smooth and highly oscillatory transitions, respectively. The spin shock is an example of a dispersive
shock wave, which arises in many physical systems. New features without a gas dynamics counterpart
include composite wave complexes with "contact" spin shocks and rarefactions. Magnetic supersonic
conditions lead to two pronounced piston edge behaviors including a stationary soliton and an oscillatory
wavetrain. These coherent wave structures have physical implications for the generation of high
frequency spin waves from pulsed injection and persistent, stable stationary and/or propagating
solitons in the presence of magnetic damping. The analytical results are favorably compared with
numerical simulations.

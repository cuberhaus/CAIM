We cast encryption via classical block ciphers in terms of operator spreading in a dual space of Pauli
strings, a formulation which allows us to characterize classical ciphers by using tools well known
in the analysis of quantum many-body systems. We connect plaintext and ciphertext attacks to out-of-time
order correlators (OTOCs) and quantify the quality of ciphers using measures of delocalization
in string space such as participation ratios and corresponding entropies obtained from the wave
function amplitudes in string space. The saturation of the string-space information entropy is
accompanied by the vanishing of OTOCs. Together these signal irreversibility and chaos, which
we take to be the defining properties of good classical ciphers. More precisely, we define a good
cipher by requiring that the OTOCs vanish to exponential precision and that the string entropies
saturate to the values associated with a random permutation, which are computed explicitly in the
paper. We argue that these conditions can be satisfied by $n$-bit block ciphers implemented via
random reversible circuits with ${\cal O}(n \log n)$ gates arranged on a tree structure, with layers
of $n/3$ 3-bit gates, for which a "key" specifies uniquely the sequence of gates that comprise the
circuit. We show that in order to reach this "speed limit" one must employ a three-stage circuit consisting
of a stage implemented by layers of nonlinear gates that proliferate the number of strings, flanked
by two other stages, each deploying layers of a special set of linear "inflationary" gates that accelerate
the growth of small individual strings. A shallow, ${\cal O}(\log n)$-depth cipher of the type described
here can be used in constructing a polynomial-overhead scheme for computation on encrypted data
proposed in another publication as an alternative to Homomorphic Encryption.

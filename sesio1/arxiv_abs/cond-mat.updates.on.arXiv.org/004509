This paper presents an experimental investigation on pattern formation and evolution in bilayered
tubular organs using swelling deformation of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and aims at supplying
a thorough comparison with theoretical and finite element results. To create a twin model in modelling
and simulation, the shear modulus in the incompressible neo-Hookean material is estimated via
uni-axial tensile and pure shear tests. Five bilayered tubes with different material or geometrical
parameters are fabricated. Swelling experiments are carried out for these samples in an individual
experimental setup where a plane-strain deformation is guaranteed, and several surface patterns
and the associated mode transformations are observed, namely, creases, wrinkles, period-doubling
profiles, wrinkle-to-crease transition, and wrinkle-to-period-doubling transition. In particular,
an interfacial wrinkling pattern is also observed. To make comparisons, a buckling analysis is
conducted within the framework of finite elasticity by means of the Stroh formulation. In addition,
a finite element analysis is performed to trace the evolution of surface instabilities. It turns
out that the experimental findings agree well with the theoretical predictions as well as the finite
element results. From our experiments, it is found that creasing mode may appear instead of wrinkling
mode when both layers share a similar mechanical property. It is expected that the current work could
provide novel experimental insight into pattern formation in tubular structures, and the good
agreement among experimental, theoretical, and simulation consequences supplies strong evidence
that a phenomenological growth model is satisfactory to reveal mechanisms behind intricate surface
morphology in tubular tissues.

Emerging multi-material 3D printing techniques have paved the way for the rational design of metamaterials
with not only complex geometries but also arbitrary distributions of multiple materials within
those geometries. Varying the spatial distribution of multiple materials gives rise to many interesting
and potentially unique combinations of anisotropic elastic properties. While the availability
of a design approach to cover a large portion of all possible combinations of elastic properties
is interesting in itself, it is even more important to find the extremely rare designs that lead to
highly unusual combinations of material properties (e.g., double-auxeticity and high elastic
moduli). Here, we used a random distribution of a hard phase and a soft phase within a regular lattice
to study the resulting anisotropic mechanical properties of the network in general and the abovementioned
rare designs in particular. The primary challenge to take up concerns the huge number of design parameters
and the extreme rarity of such designs. We, therefore, used computational models and deep learning
algorithms to create a mapping from the space of design parameters to the space of mechanical properties,
thereby (i) reducing the computational time required for evaluating each designand (ii) making
the process of evaluating the different designs highly parallelizable. Furthermore, we selected
ten designs to be fabricated using polyjet multi-material 3D printing techniques, mechanically
tested them, and characterized their behavior using digital image correlation (DIC, 3 designs)
to validate the accuracy of our computational models. The results of our simulations show that deep
learning-based algorithms can accurately predict the mechanical properties of the different
designs, which match the various deformation mechanisms observed in the experiments.

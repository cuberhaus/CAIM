Computing the $GW$ quasiparticle bandstructure and Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) absorption
spectra for materials with spin-orbit coupling has commonly been done by treating $GW$ corrections
and spin-orbit coupling as separate perturbations to density-functional theory. However, accurate
treatment of materials with strong spin-orbit coupling often requires a fully relativistic approach
using spinor wavefunctions in the Kohn-Sham equation and $GW$/BSE. Such calculations have only
recently become available, in particular for the BSE. We have implemented this approach in the plane-wave
pseudopotential $GW$/BSE code BerkeleyGW, which is highly parallelized and widely used in the
electronic-structure community. We present reference results for quasiparticle bandstructures
and optical absorption spectra of solids with different strengths of spin-orbit coupling, including
Si, Ge, GaAs, GaSb, CdSe, Au, and Bi$_2$Se$_3$. The calculated quasiparticle band gaps of these
systems are found to agree with experiment to within a few tens of meV. The absorption spectrum of
GaSb calculated with the fully-relativistic $GW$-BSE captures the large spin-orbit splitting
of peaks in the spectrum. For Bi$_2$Se$_3$, we find a drastic change in the low-energy bandstructure
compared to that of DFT, with the fully-relativistic treatment of the $GW$ approximation correctly
capturing the parabolic nature of the valence and conduction bands after including off-diagonal
self-energy matrix elements. We present the detailed methodology, approach to spatial symmetries
for spinors, comparison against other codes, and performance compared to spinless $GW$/BSE calculations
and perturbative approaches to SOC. This work aims to spur further development of spinor $GW$/BSE
methodology in excited-state research software.

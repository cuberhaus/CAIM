Antiferromagnetic manganese-based nitride antiperovskites, such as Mn$_3$NiN, hold a triangular
frustrated magnetic ordering over their kagome lattice formed by the Mn atoms along the (111)-plane.
As such, frustration imposes a non-trivial interplay between the symmetric and asymmetric magnetic
interactions, which can only reach equilibrium in a noncollinear magnetic configuration. Consequently,
the associated electronic interactions and their possible tuning by external constraints, such
as applied epitaxial strain, play a crucial role in defining the microscopic and macroscopic properties
of such topological condensed matter systems. Thus, in the present work, we explored and explained
the effect of the epitaxial strain imposed within the (111)-plane, in which the magnetic and crystallographic
symmetry operations are kept fixed, and only the magnitude of the ionic and electronic interactions
are tuned. We found a linear shifting in the energy of the band structure and a linear increase/decrease
of the available states near the Fermi level with the applied strain. Concretely, the compression
strain reduces the Mn-Mn distances in the (111) kagome plane but linearly increases the separation
between the stacked kagome lattices and the available states near the Fermi level. Despite the linear
controlling of the available states across the Fermi energy, the anomalous Hall conductivity shows
a non-linear behavior where the $\sigma_{111}$ conductivity nearly vanishes for tensile strain.
On the other hand, $\sigma_{111}$ fetches a maximum increase of 26\% about the unstrained structure
for a compression value close to $-$1.5\%.This behavior found an explanation in the non-divergent
Berry curvature within the kagome plane, which is increased for constraining but significantly
reduced for expansion strain values...

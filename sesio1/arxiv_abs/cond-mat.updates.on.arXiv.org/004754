We develop a general theory to study strong random quenched disorder effects in systems of experimental
relevance in the search for Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in topological superconductors. Using the
random matrix theory in class D ensemble, we simulate the transport properties of random quantum
dots (QDs) by attaching leads and calculating the differential conductance in the S matrix formalism.
To add the concept of the length to the random system so that disordered Majorana nanowires can be
simulated by the random matrix theory, we generalize the model of a single QD to a chain of QDs by analogy
with the SC-SM nanowire Majorana platform. We first define a new concept, the robustness of zero-bias
conductance peaks (ZBCPs) in terms of an effective random Hamiltonian considering the self-energy
of leads. We then study the joint distribution for the robustness and ZBCPs and find a strong correlation
that the zero-bias conductance peak with stronger robustness is also prone to carry a larger conductance
peak near $2e^2/h$. This trend is more prominent in shorter chains than in longer chains. This is
consistent with experimentally observed zero-bias conductance associated with disorder-induced
trivial Andreev bound states (the so-called ugly ZBCP). Finally, we study the end-to-end correlation
of the disorder-induced zero-bias conductances from two leads by calculating the normalized mutual
information, which estimates the degrees of the correlation arising from the trivial ZBCPs. Our
work provides an estimate of several important metrics used in SC-SM experiments to determine the
nature of ZBCPs, including the robustness, quantization, and end-to-end correlation of the trivial
ZBCPs. Therefore, in order to claim any evidence for the MZM, one must establish the observed ZBCPs
to have considerable statistical significance well beyond what we find in this work to exist for
the trivial peaks.

Topological superconductors are predicted to exhibit outstanding phenomena, including non-abelian
anyon excitations, heat-carrying edge states, and topological nodes in the Bogoliubov spectra.
Nonetheless, and despite major experimental efforts, we are still lacking unambiguous signatures
of such exotic phenomena. In this context, the recent discovery of coexisting superconductivity
and ferroelectricity in lightly doped and ultra clean SrTiO$_3$ opens new opportunities. Indeed,
a promising route to engineer topological superconductivity is the combination of strong spin-orbit
coupling and inversion-symmetry breaking. Here we study a three-dimensional parabolic band minimum
with Rashba spin-orbit coupling, whose axis is aligned by the direction of a ferroelectric moment.
We show that all of the aforementioned phenomena naturally emerge in this model when a magnetic field
is applied. Above a critical Zeeman field, Majorana-Weyl cones emerge regardless of the electronic
density. These cones manifest themselves as Majorana arcs states appearing on surfaces and tetragonal
domain walls. Rotating the magnetic field with respect to the direction of the ferroelectric moment
tilts the Majorana-Weyl cones, eventually driving them into the type-II state with Bogoliubov
Fermi surfaces. We then consider the consequences of the orbital magnetic field. First, the single
vortex is found to be surrounded by a topological halo, and is characterized by two Majorana zero
modes: One localized in the vortex core and the other on the boundary of the topological halo. For
a finite density of vortices forming close enough to the upper critical field, these halos overlap
and eventually percolate through the system, causing a bulk topological transition that always
precedes the normal state. Finally, we propose concrete experiments to test our predictions.

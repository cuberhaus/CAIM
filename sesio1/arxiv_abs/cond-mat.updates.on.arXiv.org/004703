In this paper we consider a threshold surface absorption mechanism for a particle diffusing in a
domain containing a single target $\calU $. The target boundary $\partial \calU$ is taken to be a
reactive surface that modifies an internal state $Z_t$ of the particle when in contact with the surface
at time $t$, with $Z_0=h$. The state $Z_t$ is taken to be a monotonically decreasing function of the
so-called boundary local time, and absorption occurs as soon as $Z_t$ reaches zero. (The boundary
local time is a Brownian functional that determines the amount of time that the particle spends in
a neighborhood of $\partial \calU$.) We first show how to analyze threshold surface absorption
in terms of the joint probability density or generalized propagator $P_0(\x,\ell,t|\x_0)$ for
the pair $(\X_t,\ell_t)$ in the case of a perfectly reflecting surface, where $\X_t$ and $\ell_t$
denote the particle position and local time at time $t$, respectively, and $\x_0$ is the initial
position. We then introduce a generalized stochastic resetting protocol in which both the position
$\X_t$ and the internal state $Z_t$ are reset to their initial values, $\X_t\rightarrow \x_0$ and
$Z_t\rightarrow h$, at a Poisson rate $r$. The latter is mathematically equivalent to resetting
the boundary local time, $\ell_t\rightarrow 0$. Since resetting is governed by a renewal process,
the survival probability with resetting can be expressed in terms of the survival probability without
resetting, which means that the statistics of absorption can be determined by calculating the Laplace
transform of $P_0(\x,\ell,t|\x_0)$ with respect to $t$. We contrast this with the case where only
particle position is reset, which is not governed by a renewal process. We illustrate the theory
using the simple examples of diffusion on the half-line and a spherical target in a spherical domain.

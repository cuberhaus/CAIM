The physics of mutual interaction of phonon quasiparticles with electronic spin degrees of freedom,
leading to unusual transport phenomena of spin and heat, has been a subject of continuing interests
for decades. Despite its pivotal role in transport processes, the effect of spin-phonon coupling
on the phonon system, especially acoustic phonon properties, has so far been elusive. By means of
inelastic neutron scattering and first-principles calculations, anomalous scattering spectral
intensity from acoustic phonons was identified in the exemplary collinear antiferromagnetic
nickel (II) oxide, unveiling strong correlations between spin and lattice degrees of freedom that
renormalize the polarization of acoustic phonon. In particular, a clear magnetic scattering signature
of the measured intensity from acoustic phonons is verified by the corresponding momentum transfer
and temperature dependences. The anomalous scattering intensity is successfully modeled with
a modified magneto-vibrational scattering cross section, suggesting the presence of spin precession
driven by phonon. Additionally, renormalization of phonon eigenvector is indicated by the observed
geometry-forbidden neutron scattering intensity from transverse acoustic phonon. The eigenvector
renormalization cannot be modeled by magnetostriction but instead, it may result from the coupling
between phonon and local magnetization of ions, suggesting the presence of spin driven effects
on lattice vibration. These observations and analysis reveal the existence of mutual driving effects
through strong spin-lattice coupling and acoustic phonon eigenvector renormalization in nickel
(II) oxide for the first time, provide a new way to quantify spin-phonon interaction strength and
shed light on controlling phonon dynamics in the presence of spin-phonon coupling.

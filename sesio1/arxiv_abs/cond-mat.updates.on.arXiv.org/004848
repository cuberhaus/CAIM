Exchange-antisymmetric pair wavefunctions in fermionic systems can give rise to unconventional
superconductors and superfluids with non-trivial transport properties. The realisation of these
states in controllable quantum systems, such as ultracold gases, could enable new types of quantum
simulations, topological quantum gates, and exotic few-body states. However, p-wave and other
antisymmetric interactions are weak in naturally occurring systems, and their enhancement via
Feshbach resonances in ultracold systems has been limited by three-body loss. In this work, we create
isolated pairs of spin-polarised fermionic atoms in a multi-orbital three-dimensional optical
lattice. We spectroscopically measure elastic p-wave interaction energies of strongly interacting
pairs of atoms near a magnetic Feshbach resonance and find pair lifetimes to be up to fifty times larger
than in free space. We demonstrate that on-site interaction strengths can be widely tuned by the
magnetic field and confinement strength but collapse onto a universal single-parameter curve
when rescaled by the harmonic energy and length scales of a single lattice site. Since three-body
processes are absent within our approach, we are able to observe elastic unitary p-wave interactions
for the first time. We take the first steps towards coherent temporal control via Rabi oscillations
between free-atom and interacting-pair states. All experimental observations are compared both
to an exact solution for two harmonically confined atoms interacting via a p-wave pseudopotential,
and to numerical solutions using an ab-initio interaction potential. The understanding and control
of on-site p-wave interactions provides a necessary component for the assembly of multi-orbital
lattice models, and a starting point for investigations of how to protect such a system from three-body
recombination even in the presence of tunnelling.

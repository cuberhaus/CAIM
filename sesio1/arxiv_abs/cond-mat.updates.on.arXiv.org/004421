Motivated by recent experiments [P. Vaidya {\em et al.}, Science {\bf 368}, 160 (2020)] on spin pumping
from sub-THz radiation-driven uniaxial antiferromagnetic insulator (AFI) MnF$_2$ into heavy
metal (HM) Pt hosting strong spin-orbit (SO) coupling, we compute and compare pumped spin currents
in Cu/MnF$_2$/Cu and Pt/MnF$_2$/Cu heterostructures. Recent theories of spin pumping by AFI have
relied on simplistic Hamiltonians (such as tight-binding) and the scattering approach to quantum
transport yielding the so-called interfacial spin mixing conductance (SMC), but the concept of
SMC ceases to be applicable when SO coupling is present directly at the interface. In contrast, we
use more general first-principles quantum transport approach which combines noncollinear density
functional theory with Floquet-nonequilibrium Green's functions in order to take into account:
{\em SO-proximitized AFI} as a new type of quantum material, different from isolated AFI and brought
about by AFI hybridization with adjacent HM layer; SO coupling at interfaces; and evanescent wavefunctions
penetrating from Pt or Cu into AFI layer to make its interfacial region {\em conducting} rather than
insulating as in the original AFI. The DC component of pumped spin current $I_\mathrm{DC}^{S_z}$
vs. precession cone angle $\theta_{\vb*{l}}$ of the N\'{e}el vector $\vb*{l}$ of AFI {\em does
not} follow putative $I^{S_z}_\mathrm{DC} \propto \sin^2 \theta_{\vb*{l}}$, except for very
small angles $\theta_{\vb*{l}} \lesssim 10^\circ$ for which we can define an {\em effective} SMC
from the prefactor and find that it doubles from MnF$_2$/Cu to MnF$_2$/Pt interface. In addition,
the angular dependence $I^{S_z}_\mathrm{DC}(\theta_{\vb*{l}})$ differs for opposite directions
of precession of the N\'{e}el vector, leading to twice as large SMC for the right-handed than for
the left-handed chirality of the precession mode.

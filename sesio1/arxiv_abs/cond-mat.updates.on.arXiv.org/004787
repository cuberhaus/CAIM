Studies on double-double perovskite CaMnCrSbO6 (space group : P42n) suggest ferrimagnetic order
(TC~49 K), with opposite alignment of Mn2+ and Cr3+ spins. The unit cell comprises of two different
Mn atoms, denoted as Mn(1) and Mn(2) which have tetrahedral and planar coordination of oxygen atoms,
respectively, while the Cr atom is in the centre of orthorhombically distorted octahedron. The
density functional theory, Wannier function analysis, and mean-field calculations are used to
investigate this compound. The super-exchange strengths obtained from DFT are an order of magnitude
smaller than those reported for various magnetic perovskites and double perovskites. The nearest
neighbour (along c-direction) Mn(1)-O-Mn(2) superexchange interactions are found to be anti-ferromagnetic
and smaller than the next nearest neighbour Cr-O-O-Cr super-superexchange interactions, which
are found to be ferromagnetic. The in-plane Mn(1)-O-Mn(2) superexchange, also antiferromagnetic,
is much smaller due to greater separation between the Mn atoms. The Mn(1)-O-Cr and Mn(2)-O-Cr superexchange
interactions are found to be antiferromagnetic. The signs of exchange interactions from DFT predict
that while the Cr3+ spins can be arranged ferromagnetically, the alternate Mn2+ spins have to be
arranged antiferromagnetically. Due to difference in ligand symmetry, the Mn(2)-O-Cr superexchange
is weaker than the Mn(1)-O-Cr superexchange, thus effectively resulting in ferrimagnetism, as
observed experimentally too. The superexchange mechanisms have been analysed in terms of the hopping
integrals between the Wannier orbitals of the transition metal ions and oxygen. Our mean field calculations
reveal that assuming a set of four magnetic sub-lattice for Mn2+ spins and a single magnetic lattice
for Cr3+ spins yields a much improved TC, unlike the use of the two magnetic sublattice model which
yields a much higher TC.

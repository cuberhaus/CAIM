Discovering new materials is a long-standing challenging task that is crucial to the progress of
human society. Conventional approaches based on trial-and-error experiments and computational
simulations are labor-intensive or costly with success heavily depending on experts' heuristic
knowledge. Recently, deep generative models have been proposed for generative design of materials
by learning implicit knowledge from known materials datasets. However, these models are either
applicable to a specific material system or the performance is low due to their failure to incorporate
physical rules into their model training process. Here, we propose a deep learning based Physics
Guided Crystal Generative Model (PGCGM) for efficient generative materials design with high structural
diversity (up to 20 different space groups). The high performance of our model manifests its capability
to capture and exploit the symmetric constraints of crystals and the pairwise atomic distance constraints
among neighbor atoms. Using data augmentation and spatial atom clustering and merging, our PGCGM
model increases the overall generation validity performance by more than 700\% compared to FTCP,
one of the state-of-the-art structure generators and by more than 45\% compared to our previous
CubicGAN model. The newly generated crystal materials also show higher quality in terms of atomic
spatial distribution and composition diversity. We further validated the new crystal structures
by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. 1,869 materials out of 2,000 were successfully
optimized, of which 39.6\% have negative formation energy and 5.3\% have energy-above-hull less
than 0.25 eV/atom, indicating their thermodynamic stability and potential synthesizability.
The 1,869 crystal structures have been deposited to the Carolina Materials Database \url{www.carolinamatdb.org}.

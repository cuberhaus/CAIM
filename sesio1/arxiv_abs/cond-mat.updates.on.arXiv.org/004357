Exploration of low temperature phase transitions associated with quantum critical point is one
of the most mystifying fields of research which is under intensive focus in recent times. In this
work, through comprehensive experimental evidences, we report the possibility of achieving quantum
criticality in the neighborhood of a magnetic field-tuned tricritical point separating paramagnetic,
antiferromagnetic and metamagnetic phases in a magnetic insulator, DyVO4. Magnetic susceptibility
and heat capacity indicate to the presence of a long-range second order antiferromagnetic transition
at TN ~ 3.2 K. Field variation of Magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity, along with differential
magnetic susceptibility and DC field dependent AC susceptibility gives evidence of the modification
of the antiferromagnetic structure below the tricritical point; implying the presence of a field-induced
first order metamagnetic transition which persists down to 1.8 K. Further, the magnetic field dependence
of the thermodynamic quantity -dM/dT, which is related to magnetic Gruneisen parameter, approaches
a minimum, followed by a crossover near 5 kOe to a maximum; along with a hyperbolic divergence in temperature
response of dM/dT in the critical field regime. Temperature response of heat capacity at 5 kOe also
shows a deviation from the conventional behavior. Entropic topography phase diagram allows tracking
of the variation of the entropy, which indicates towards the emergence of the peak at quantum critical
point into a V-shaped region at high temperatures. Our studies yield an inimitable phase diagram
describing a tricritical point at which the second-order antiferromagnetic phase line terminates
followed by a first order line of metamagnetic transition, as the temperature is lowered, leading
to metamagnetic quantum critical end point.

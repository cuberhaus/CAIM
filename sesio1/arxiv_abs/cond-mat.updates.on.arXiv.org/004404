Multiferroic materials have garnered wide interest for their exceptional static and dynamical
magnetoelectric properties. In particular, type-II multiferroics exhibit an inversion-symmetry-breaking
magnetic order which directly induces a ferroelectric polarization through various mechanisms,
such as the spin-current or the inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya effect. This intrinsic coupling
between the magnetic and dipolar order parameters results in record-strength magnetoelectric
effects. Two dimensional materials possessing such intrinsic multiferroic properties have been
long sought for harnessing magnetoelectric coupling in nanoelectronic devices. Here, we report
the discovery of type-II multiferroic order in a single atomic layer of the transition metal-based
van der Waals material NiI2. The multiferroic state of NiI2 is characterized by a proper-screw spin
helix with given handedness, which couples to the charge degrees of freedom to produce a chirality-controlled
electrical polarization. We use circular dichroic Raman measurements to directly probe the magneto-chiral
ground state and its electromagnon modes originating from dynamic magnetoelectric coupling.
Using birefringence and second-harmonic generation measurements, we detect a highly anisotropic
electronic state simultaneously breaking three-fold rotational and inversion symmetry, and
supporting polar order. The evolution of the optical signatures as a function of temperature and
layer number surprisingly reveals an ordered magnetic, polar state that persists down to the ultrathin
limit of monolayer NiI2. These observations establish NiI2 and transition metal dihalides as a
new platform for studying emergent multiferroic phenomena, chiral magnetic textures and ferroelectricity
in the two-dimensional limit.

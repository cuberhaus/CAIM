We report a novel simulation strategy that enables us to identify key parameters controlling the
experimentally measurable characteristics of structural protein tags on dsDNA construct translocating
through a double nanopore setup. First, we validate the scheme in silico by reproducing and explaining
the physical origin of the experimental dwell time distributions of the Streptavidin markers on
a 48 kbp long dsDNA. These studies reveal the important differences in the characteristics of the
protein tags compared to the dynamics of dsDNA segments, immediately providing clues on how to improve
the measurement protocols to decipher the unknown genomic lengths accurately. Of particular importance
is the in silico studies on the effect of electric field inside and beyond the pores which we find is
critical to discriminate protein tags based on their effective charges and masses revealed through
a generic power-law dependence of the average dwell time at each pore. The simulation protocols
enable to monitor piecewise dynamics of the individual monomers at a sub-nanometer length scale
and provide an explanation of the disparate velocity variation from one tag to the other using the
nonequilibrium tension propagation theory, - a key element to decipher genomic lengths accurately.
We further justify the model and the chosen simulation parameters by calculating the Peclet number
which is in close agreement with the experiment. Analysis of our simulation results from the CG model
has the capability to refine the accuracy of the experimentally obtained genomic lengths and carefully
chosen simulation strategies can serve as a powerful tool to discriminate different types of neutral
and charged tags of different origins on a dsDNA construct in terms of their physical characteristics
and can provide insights to increase both the efficiency and accuracy of an experimental dual-nanopore
setup.

As the simplest element in nature, unraveling the phase diagram of hydrogen is a primary task for
condensed matter physics. As conjectured many decades ago, in the low-temperature and high-pressure
part of the phase diagram, solid hydrogen is expected to become metallic with a high superconducting
transition temperature. The metallization may occur via band gap closure in the molecular solid
or via a transition to the atomic solid. Recently, a few experimental studies pushed the achievable
pressures into the 400 - 500 GPa range. There are strong indications that at some pressure in this
range metallization via either of these mechanisms occurs, although there are disagreements between
experimental reports. Furthermore, there are multiple good candidate crystal phases that have
emerged from recent computational and experimental studies which may be realized in upcoming experiments.
Therefore, it is crucial to determine the superconducting properties of these candidate phases.
In a recent study, we reported the superconducting properties of the C2/c-24 phase, which we believe
to be a strong candidate for metallization via band gap closure [M. Dogan et al., arXiv:2107.03889
(2021)]. Here, we report the superconducting properties of the Cmca-12, Cmca-4 and I41/amd-2 phases
including the anharmonic effects using a Wannier function-based dense k-point and q-point sampling.
We find that the Cmca-12 phase has a superconducting transition temperature that rises from 86 K
at 400 GPa to 212 K at 500 GPa, whereas the Cmca-4 and I41/amd-2 phases show a less pressure-dependent
behavior with their Tc in the 74 - 94 K and 307 - 343 K ranges, respectively. These properties can be
used to distinguish between crystal phases in future experiments. Understanding superconductivity
in pure hydrogen is also important in the study of high-Tc hydrides.

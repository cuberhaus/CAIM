Finding amorphous polymers with higher thermal conductivity is important, as they are ubiquitous
in heat transfer applications. With recent progress in material informatics, machine learning
approaches have been increasingly adopted for finding or designing materials with desired properties.
However, relatively limited effort has been put into finding thermally conductive polymers using
machine learning, mainly due to the lack of polymer thermal conductivity databases with reasonable
data volume. In this work, we combine high-throughput molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and
machine learning to explore polymers with relatively high thermal conductivity (> 0.300 W/m-K).
We first randomly select 365 polymers from the existing PolyInfo database and calculate their thermal
conductivity using MD simulations. The data are then employed to train a machine learning regression
model to quantify the structure-thermal conductivity relation, which is further leveraged to
screen polymer candidates in the PolyInfo database with thermal conductivity > 0.300 W/m-K. 133
polymers with MD-calculated thermal conductivity above this threshold are eventually identified.
Polymers with a wide range of thermal conductivity values are selected for re-calculation under
different simulation conditions, and those polymers found with thermal conductivity above 0.300
W/m-K are mostly calculated to maintain values above this threshold despite fluctuation in the
exact values. A classification model is also constructed, and similar results were obtained compared
to the regression model in predicting polymers with thermal conductivity above or below 0.300 W/m-K.
The strategy and results from this work may contribute to automating the design of polymers with
high thermal conductivity.

Background. The Gorkov approach to self-consistent Green's function theory has been formulated
in [V. Som\`a, T. Duguet, C. Barbieri, Phys. Rev. C 84, 064317 (2011)]. Over the past decade, it has
become a method of reference for first-principle computations of semi-magic nuclear isotopes.
The currently available implementation is limited to a second-order self-energy and neglects
particle-number non-conserving terms arising from contracting three-particle forces with anomalous
propagators. For nuclear physics applications, this is sufficient to address first-order energy
differences, ground-state radii and moments on an accurate enough basis. However, addressing
absolute binding energies, fine spectroscopic details of $N\pm1$ particle systems or delicate
quantities such as second-order energy differences associated to pairing gaps, requires to go
to higher truncation orders. Purpose. The formalism is extended to third order in the algebraic
diagrammatic construction (ADC) expansion with two-body Hamiltonians. Methods. The expansion
of Gorkov propagators in Feynman diagrams is combined with the algebraic diagrammatic construction
up to the third order as an organization scheme to generate the Gorkov self-energy. Results. Algebraic
expressions for the static and dynamic contributions to the self-energy, along with equations
for the matrix elements of the Gorkov eigenvalue problem, are derived. It is first done for a general
basis before specifying the set of equations to the case of spherical systems displaying rotational
symmetry. Workable approximations to the full self-consistency problem are also elaborated on.
The formalism at third order it thus complete for a general two-body Hamiltonian. Conclusion. Working
equations for the full Gorkov-ADC(3) are now available for numerical implementation.

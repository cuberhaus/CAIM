In this work, we study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the paradigmatic quasi-one-dimensional
material (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I, that exhibits a transition into an incommensurate CDW phase when cooled
just below room temperature, namely at T$_{\rm{CDW}} $= 263 K. We make use of both optical laser and
free-electron laser (FEL) based time-resolved spectroscopies in order to study the effect of a
selective excitation on the normal-state and on the CDW phases, by probing the near-infrared/visible
optical properties both along and perpendicularly to the direction of the CDW, where the system
is metallic and insulating, respectively. Excitation of the core-levels by ultrashort X-ray FEL
pulses at 47 eV and 119 eV induces reflectivity transients resembling those recorded when only exciting
the valence band of the compound - by near-infrared pulses at 1.55 eV - in the case of the insulating
sub-system. Conversely, the metallic sub-system displays a relaxation dynamics which depends
on the energy of photo-excitation. Moreover, excitation of the CDW amplitude mode is recorded only
for excitation at low-photon-energy. This fact suggests that the coupling of light to ordered states
of matter can predominantly be achieved when directly injecting delocalized carriers in the valence
band, rather than localized excitations in the core levels. On a complementary side, table-top
experiments allow us to prove the quasi-unidirectional nature of the CDW phase in (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I,
whose fingerprints are detected along its $c$-axis only. Our results provide new insights on the
symmetry of the ordered phase of (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I perturbed by a selective excitation, and suggest
a novel approach based on complementary table-top and FEL spectroscopies for the study of complex
materials.

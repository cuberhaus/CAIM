Triple-component fermions are pseudospin-1 quasiparticles hosted by certain three-band semimetals
in the vicinity of their band-touching nodes [Phys. Rev. B {\bf 100}, 235201 (2019)]. The excitations
comprise of a flat band and two dispersive bands. The energies of the dispersive bands are $E_{\pm}=\pm\sqrt{\alpha^2_n
k^{2n}_\perp+v^2_z k^2_z}$ with $k_\perp=\sqrt{k^2_x+k^2_y}$ and $n=1,2,3$. In this work,
we obtain the exact expression of Berry curvature, approximate form of density of states and Fermi
energy as a function of carrier density for any value of $n$. In particular, we study the Berry curvature
induced electrical and thermal magnetotransport properties of quadratic $(n=2)$ triple-component
fermions using semiclassical Boltzmann transport formalism. Since the energy spectrum is anisotropic,
we consider two orientations of magnetic field (${\bf B}$): (i) ${\bf B}$ applied in the $x$-$y$
plane and (ii) ${\bf B}$ applied in the $x$-$z$ plane. For both the orientations, the longitudinal
and planar magnetoelectric/magnetothermal conductivities show the usual quadratic-$B$ dependence
and oscillatory behaviour with respect to the angle between the applied electric field/temperature
gradient and magnetic field as observed in other topological semimetals. However, the out-of-plane
magnetoconductivity has an oscillatory dependence on angle between the applied fields for the
second orientation but is angle-independent for the first one. We observe large differences in
the magnitudes of transport coefficients for the two orientations at a given Fermi energy. A noteworthy
feature of quadratic triple-component fermions which is typically absent in conventional systems
is that certain transport coefficients and their ratios are independent of Fermi energy within
the low-energy model.

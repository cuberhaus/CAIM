Collisional reservoirs are becoming a major tool for modelling open quantum systems. In their simplest
implementation, an external agent switches on, for a given time, the interaction between the system
and a specimen from the reservoir. Generically, in this operation the external agent performs work
onto the system, preventing thermalization when the reservoir is at equilibrium. One can recover
thermalization by considering an autonomous global setup where the reservoir particles colliding
with the system possess a kinetic degree of freedom. The drawback is that the corresponding scattering
problem is rather involved. Here, we present a formal solution of the problem in one dimension and
for flat interaction potentials. The solution is based on the transfer matrix formalism and allows
one to explore the symmetries of the resulting scattering map. One of these symmetries is micro-reversibility,
which is a condition for thermalization. We then introduce two approximations of the scattering
map that preserve these symmetries and, consequently, thermalize the system. These relatively
simple approximate solutions constitute models of quantum thermostats and are useful tools to
study quantum systems in contact with thermal baths. We illustrate their accuracy in a specific
example, showing that both are good approximations of the exact scattering problem even in situations
far from equilibrium. Moreover, one of the models consists of the removal of certain coherences
plus a very specific randomization of the interaction time. These two features allow one to identify
as heat the energy transfer due to switching on and off the interaction. Our results prompt the fundamental
question of how to distinguish between heat and work from the statistical properties of the exchange
of energy between a system and its surroundings.

A two-dimensional electron system placed in a magnetic field develops Landau levels, where strong
Coulomb interactions lead to the appearance of many-body correlated ground states. Quantum numbers
similar to the electron spin enable the understanding and control of complex ground state order
and collective excitations. Owing to its spin, valley and orbital degrees of freedom, Bernal-stacked
bilayer graphene offers a rich platform to pursue correlated phenomena in two dimensions. In this
work, we fabricate dual-gated Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene devices and demonstrate unprecedented
fine control over its valley isospin degrees of freedom using a perpendicular electric field. Higher
sample quality enables us to probe regimes obscured by disorder in previous studies. We present
evidence for a new even-denominator fractional quantum Hall state at filling factor {\nu} = 5/2.
The 5/2 state is found to be spontaneously valley polarized in the limit of vanishing valley Zeeman
splitting, consistent with a theoretical prediction made regarding the spin polarization of the
Moore-Read state. In the vicinity of the even-denominator fractional quantum Hall states, we observe
the appearance of the predicted Levin-Halperin daughter states of the Moore-Read Pfaffian wave
function at {\nu}= 3/2, 7/2 and of the anti-Pfaffian at {\nu}= 5/2 and -1/2. These observations suggest
the breaking of particle-hole symmetry in bilayer graphene. We construct a comprehensive valley
polarization phase diagram for the Jain sequence fractional states surrounding filling factor
3/2. These results are well explained by a two-component composite fermion model, further demonstrating
the SU(2) nature of the valley isospin in bilayer graphene. Our experiment paves the path for future
efforts of manipulating the valley isospin in bilayer graphene to engineer exotic topological
orders and quantum information processes.

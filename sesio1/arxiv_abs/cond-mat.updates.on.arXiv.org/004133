We construct path integrals for stochastic hybrid reaction-diffusion (RD) processes, in which
the reaction terms depend on the discrete state of a randomly switching environment. We proceed
by spatially discretizing a given RD system and using a spinor representation of the environmental
states to derive a path integral for the lattice model. In the case of large molecular numbers, the
corresponding continuum path integral action is expressed in terms of an effective Hamiltonian,
which involves a concentration field $u(\x,t)$, $\x\in \R^d$, a conjugate field $v(\x,t)$, and
$M$ auxiliary conjugate pairs $(c_m(t),\phi_m(t))$, where $M$ is the number of discrete environmental
states. The variable $c_m(t)$ determines the effective probability that a sample path is exposed
to the $m$-th environmental state at time $t$, with $\sum_{m=1}^Mc_m(t)=1$. We then consider the
semi-classical (adiabatic) limit $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$, where $\epsilon^{-1}$ determines
the rate of switching between the environmental states. We show how the auxiliary variables can
be eliminated to yield an action functional for the fields $u$ and $v$ alone. The associated Hamiltonian
is the sum of a diffusion term and the Perron or principal eigenvalue of a functional linear operator
involving the reaction terms and the matrix generator of the switching process. The reduced path
integral is then used to derive a functional Hamilton-Jacobi equation for least action paths and
to obtain a Gaussian noise approximation of the stochastic hybrid RD system in the adiabatic limit.
Finally, the path integral in the case of low molecular numbers is constructed by considering a corresponding
RD master equation. It is now necessary to take into account two sources of noise, one due to the switching
environment and the other due to fluctuations in molecular numbers.

In this review, we single out selected universal features of high-$T_c$ and related systems, which
can be compared with experiment. We start with the concept of real-space pairing, combined with
strong correlations. The discussion of concrete properties relies on variational approach, based
on renormalized mean-field theory (RMFT) in the form of statistically-consistent Gutzwiller
approximation (SGA), and Diagrammatic Expansion of the Variational Wave Function (DE-GWF). Two
energy scales appear, one involving quasiparticles close to the Fermi energy, and the other reflecting
the correlated state. Those two regimes are separated by a kink in the dispersion relation, observed
in photoemission. One obtains both the doping dependent properties and renormalized quasiparticles.
The reviewed ground-state characteristics for high-$T_c$ systems encompass superconductivity,
nematicity, charge- (and pair-) density-wave effects, as well as non-BCS kinetic energy gain in
the paired state, all in quantitative manner. Calculated dynamic properties are: universal Fermi
velocity, Fermi wave-vector, effective mass enhancement, pseudogap, and $d$-wave gap magnitude.
The minimal realistic model is represented by the $t$-$J$-$U$ Hamiltonian. Inadequacy of the $t$-$J$
and Hubbard models is discussed. For heavy fermion systems we summarize superconducting, Kondo
insulating, ferro- and anti-ferromagnetic states. We overview also coexistent ferromagnetic
(spin-triplet) superconducting phases observed for $\mathrm{UGe_2}$. Finally, we extend our
scheme to collective spin and charge fluctuations in high-$T_c$ systems, starting from variational
approach, combined with $1/N$ expansion (beyond random phase approximation). Spectrum of collective
spin and charge excitations is determined for the Hubbard and $t$-$J$-$U$ models, and compared
quantitatively with recent experiments.

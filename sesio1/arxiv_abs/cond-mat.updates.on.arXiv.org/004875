As the first intrinsic antiferromagnetic (AFM) topological insulator (TI), MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ has
provided a material platform to realize various emergent phenomena arising from the interplay
of magnetism and band topology. Here by investigating (Mn$_{1-x}$Pb$_x$)Bi$_2$Te$_4$ $(0\leq
x \leq 0.82)$ single crystals via the x-ray, electrical transport, magnetometry and neutron measurements,
chemical analysis, external pressure, and first-principles calculations, we reveal the magnetic
dilution effect on the magnetism and band topology in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. With increasing $x$, both
lattice parameters $a$ and $c$ expand linearly by around 2\%. All samples undergo the paramagnetic
to A-type antiferromagnetic transition with the N$\acute{e}$el temperature decreasing lineally
from 24 K at $x=0$ to 2 K at $x=0.82$. Our neutron data refinement of the $x=0.37$ sample indicates
that the ordered moment is 4.3(1)$\mu_B$/Mn at 4.85 K and the amount of the Mn$_{\rm{Bi}}$ antisites
is negligible within the error bars. Isothermal magnetization data reveal a slight decrease of
the interlayer plane-plane antiferromagnetic exchange interaction and a monotonic decrease
of the magnetic anisotropy, due to diluting magnetic ions and enlarging the unit cell. For $x=0.37$,
the application of external pressures enhances the interlayer antiferromagnetic coupling, boosting
the N$\acute{e}$el temperature at a rate of 1.4 K/GPa and the saturation field at a rate of 1.8 T/GPa.
Furthermore, our first-principles calculations reveal that the band inversion in the two end materials,
MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ and PbBi$_2$Te$_4$, occurs at the $\Gamma$ and $Z$ point, respectively, while
two gapless points appear at $x = $ 0.44 and $x = $ 0.66, suggesting possible topological phase transitions
with doping.

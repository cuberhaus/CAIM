Despite being a source of rich information, graphs are limited to pairwise interactions. However,
several real-world networks such as social networks, neuronal networks, etc., involve interactions
between more than two nodes. Simplicial complexes provide a powerful mathematical framework to
model such higher-order interactions. It is well known that the spectrum of the graph Laplacian
is indicative of community structure, and this relation is exploited by spectral clustering algorithms.
Here we propose that the spectrum of the Hodge Laplacian, a higher-order Laplacian defined on simplicial
complexes, encodes simplicial communities. We formulate an algorithm to extract simplicial communities
(of arbitrary dimension). We apply this algorithm to simplicial complex benchmarks and to real
higher-order network data including social networks and networks extracted using language or
text processing tools. However, datasets of simplicial complexes are scarce, and for the vast majority
of datasets that may involve higher-order interactions, only the set of pairwise interactions
are available. Hence, we use known properties of the data to infer the most likely higher-order interactions.
In other words, we introduce an inference method to predict the most likely simplicial complex given
the community structure of its network skeleton. This method identifies as most likely the higher-order
interactions inducing simplicial communities that maximize the adjusted mutual information
measured with respect to ground-truth community structure. Finally, we consider higher-order
networks constructed through thresholding the edge weights of collaboration networks (encoding
only pairwise interactions) and provide an example of persistent simplicial communities that
are sustained over a wide range of the threshold.

The past few years have seen rapid progress in characterizing topological band structures using
symmetry eigenvalue indicated methods. Recently, however, there has been increasing theoretical
and experimental interest in multi-gap dependent topological phases that cannot be captured by
this paradigm. These topologies arise by braiding band degeneracies that reside between different
bands and carry non-Abelian charges due to the presence of either $C_2T$ or $PT$ symmetry, culminating
in different invariants such as $\mathbb{Z}$-valued Euler class. Here, we present a universal
formulation for Euler phases motivated by their homotopy classification that is related to the
Skyrmion-profile of a single unit-vector in three-level systems, and that of two unit-vectors
in four-level systems. In addition, upon employing the strategy of systematically building 3D
models from a pair of sub-dimensional Euler phases, we show that phase transitions between any two
inequivalent Euler phases are mediated by the presence of adjacent (in-gap) nodal rings linked
with sub-gap nodal lines, forming trajectories corresponding to the braiding or debraiding of
nodal points. The stability of the linked adjacent nodal rings is furthermore demonstrated to be
indicated by an Euler class monopole charge matching with its $\mathbb{Z}$-valued linking numbers.
We finally also systematically address the conversion of Euler phases into descendant Chern phases
upon breaking the $C_2T$ or $PT$ symmetry. All the topological phases discussed in this work are
corroborated with explicit minimal lattice models. These models can themselves directly serve
as an extra impetus for experimental searches or be employed for theoretical studies, thereby underpinning
the upcoming of this nascent pursuit.

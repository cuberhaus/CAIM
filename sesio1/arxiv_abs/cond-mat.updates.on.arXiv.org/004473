We investigate the effects of magnetic and crystalline anisotropies on the topological superconducting
state of planar Josephson junctions (JJs). In junctions where only Rashba spin-orbit coupling
(SOC) is present, the topological phase diagram is insensitive to the supercurrent direction,
but exhibits a strong dependence on the magnetic field orientation. However, when both Rashba and
Dresselhaus SOCs coexist, the topological phase diagram strongly depends on both the magnetic
field and junction crystallographic orientations. We examine the impact of the magnetic and crystalline
anisotropy on the current-phase relation (CPR), energy spectrum, and topological gap of phase-biased
JJs, where the junction is connected in a loop and the superconducting phase difference is fixed
by a loop-threading magnetic flux. The anisotropic CPR can be used to extract the ground-sate phase
(i.e. the superconducting phase difference that minimizes the system free energy) behavior in
phase-unbiased JJs with no magnetic flux. Under appropriate conditions, phase-unbiased JJs can
self-tune into or out of the topological superconducting state by rotating the in-plane magnetic
field. The magnetic field orientations at which topological transitions occur strongly depend
on both the junction crystallographic orientation and the relative strength between Rashba and
Dresselhaus SOCs. We find that for an optimal practical application, in which the junction exhibits
topological superconductivity with a sizable topological gap, a careful balancing of the magnetic
field direction, the junction crystallographic orientation, and the relative strengths of the
Rashba and Dresselhaus SOCs is required. We discuss the considerations that must be undertaken
to achieve this balancing for various junction types and parameters.

Energy harvesting from evaporation has become a hot topic in the last couple of years. Researchers
have speculated on several possible mechanisms. Electrokinetic energy conversion is the least
hypothetical one. The basics of pressure-driven electrokinetic phenomena of streaming current
and streaming potential have long been established. The regularities of evaporation from porous
media are also well known. However, coupling of these two classes of phenomena has not, yet, been
seriously explored. In this critical review, we will recapitalize and combine the available knowledge
from these two fields to produce a coherent picture of electrokinetic electricity generation during
evaporation from (nano)porous materials. For illustration, we will consider several configurations,
namely, single nanopores, arrays of nanopores, systems with reduced area of electrokinetic-conversion
elements and devices with side evaporation from thin nanoporous films. For the latter (practically
the only one studied experimentally), we will formulate a simple model describing correlations
of system performance with such principal parameters as the nanoporous-layer length, width and
thickness as well as the pore size, pore-surface hydrophilicity, effective zeta-potential and
electric conductivity in nanopores. These correlations will be qualitatively compared with experimental
data available in the literature. We will see that experimental data not always are in agreement
with the model predictions, which may be due to simplifying model assumptions but also because the
mechanisms are different from the classical electrokinetic energy conversion. In particular,
this concerns the mechanisms of conversion of evaporation-driven ion streaming currents into
electron currents in external circuits. We will also formulate directions of future experimental
and theoretical studies that could help clarify these issues.

We propose a proposal for the easier experimental realization of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model in multilayered
type-II Weyl semimetal WTe$_2$ in $T_d$ phase, through the optical second harmonic generation
(SHG) technique. As the WTe$_{2}$ is a promising candidate to show strong nonlinear optical characters,
including the SHG, we consider the effects come from the random interactions between the nondispersive
bosonic modes induced by the SHG response (with two photon resonance) in each layer. For normally
incident laser at proper frequency with ignorable extinction, the induced bosons can be regarded
as the same energies, and randomly interact with each other due to the existence of two-photon shift-current
SHG process, which has a much small weight compared to the normal SHG. In addition to the approximate
zero-dimensional SYK model, we also consider the effects of the one-dimensional SYK model (in the
direction perpendicular to the layer surface) as a correction to our results. The finite spacial
effect are studied in terms of the energy current in the perpendicular direction, and is based on
the broadened range of zero-dimensional SYK interactions in real material at finite temperature
by introducing a UV cutoff which is the interlayer spacing instead of the lattice constant. The numerical
simulation and exact diagonalization show that the system exhibiting a maximally chaotic character
and the spectral is characterized by many-body statistic of Gaussian symplectic ensemble. For
numerical simulation, we use the data of experimental detected electronic structure of WTe$_{2}$
with spin-orbit coupling, and picking the photon energy at near-infrared range. A finite deviation
from the standard Gaussian distribution of the random SYK couplings is considered and we prove that
this deviation (although small) is important for the experimental observable SYK effects. A detailed
proposal of experimental detection for this finite deviation is presented, which is through the
measurement of surface tunneling conductivity using the STM.

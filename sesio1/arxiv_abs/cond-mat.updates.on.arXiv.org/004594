The jamming transition is ubiquitous. It is present in granular matter, foams, colloids, structural
glasses, and many other systems. Yet, it defines a critical point whose properties still need to
be fully understood. Recently, a major breakthrough came about when the replica formalism was extended
to build a mean-field theory that provides an exact description of the jamming transition of spherical
particles in the infinite-dimensional limit. While such theory explains the jamming critical
behavior of both soft and hard spheres (HS), investigating these two kinds of particles in finite
dimensions poses very different problems, particularly from the numerical point of view. Soft
particles are modeled by a continuous potential; thus, their jamming point can be reached through
efficient energy minimization algorithms. In contrast, such methods are inapplicable in HS systems
because the interaction energy among the particles is always zero by construction. To overcome
this difficulty, here we recast HS jamming as a constrained optimization problem and introduce
the CALiPPSO algorithm, capable of readily producing jammed packings of HS without including any
effective potential. This algorithm brings a HS configuration of arbitrary dimensions to its jamming
point by solving a chain of linear optimization problems. We show that there is a strict correspondence
between the force balance conditions of jammed packings and the properties of the optimal solutions
of CALiPPSO, whence we prove analytically that our packings are always isostatic and in mechanical
equilibrium. Furthermore, using extensive numerical simulations, we show that our algorithm
is able to probe the complex structure of the free energy landscape, finding qualitative agreement
with mean-field predictions. We also characterize the algorithmic complexity of CALiPPSO and
provide an open-source implementation of it.

The mechanical behavior of inelastic materials with microstructure is very complex and hard to
grasp with heuristic, empirical constitutive models. For this purpose, multiscale, homogenization
approaches are often used for performing reliable, accurate predictions of the macroscopic mechanical
behavior of microstructured solids. Nevertheless, the calculation cost of such approaches is
extremely high and prohibitive for real-scale applications involving inelastic materials. Recently,
data-driven approaches based on deep learning have risen as a promising alternative to replace
ad-hoc constitutive laws and speed-up multiscale numerical methods. However, such approaches
lack a rigorous frame based on the laws of physics. As a result, their application to model materials
with complex microstructure in inelasticity is not yet established. Here, we propose Thermodynamics-based
Artificial Neural Networks (TANN) for the constitutive modeling of materials with inelastic and
complex microstructure. Our approach integrates thermodynamics-aware dimensionality reduction
techniques and deep neural networks to identify the constitutive laws and the internal state variables
of complex inelastic materials. The ability of TANN in delivering high-fidelity, physically consistent
predictions is demonstrated through several examples both at the microscopic and macroscopic
scale. In particular, we show the efficiency and accuracy of TANN in predicting the average and local
stress-strain response, the internal energy and the dissipation of both regular and perturbed
lattice microstructures in inelasticity. Finally, a double-scale homogenization scheme is used
to solve a large scale boundary value problem. The high performance of the homogenized model using
TANN is illustrated through detailed comparisons. An excellent agreement is shown for a variety
of monotonous and cyclic stress-strain paths.

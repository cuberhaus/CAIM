We show that the coarse-grained dynamics model with the time-dependent and fluctuating potential
(transient potential) can be derived from the microscopic Hamiltonian dynamics. The concept of
the transient potential was first introduced rather phenomenologically, and its relation to the
underlying microscopic dynamics has not been clarified yet. This is in contrast to the generalized
Langevin equation, of which relation to the microscopic dynamics is well-established. In this
work, we show that the dynamic equations with the transient potential can be derived for the coupled
oscillator model, without any approximations. It is known that the dynamics of the coupled oscillator
model can be exactly described by the generalized Langevin type equations. This fact implies that
the dynamic equations with the transient potential can be utilized as a coarse-grained dynamics
model in a similar way to the generalized Langevin equation. Then we show that the dynamic equations
for the transient potential can be also formally derived for the microscopic Hamiltonian dynamics,
without any approximations. We use the projection operator method for the coarse-grained variables
and transient potential. The dynamic equations for the coarse-grained positions and momenta are
similar to those in the Hamiltonian dynamics, but the interaction potential is replaced by the transient
potential. The dynamic equation for the transient potential is the generalized Langevin equation
with the memory effect. Our result justifies the use of the transient potential to describe the coarse-grained
dynamics. We propose several approximations to obtain simplified dynamics model. We show that,
under several approximations, the dynamic equation for the transient potential reduces to the
relatively simple Markovian dynamic equation for the potential parameters.

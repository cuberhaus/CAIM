Folding nanopatterned flat sheets into complex 3D structures enables the fabrication of meta-biomaterials
that combine a rationally designed 3D architecture (e.g., to tune mechanical and mass transport
properties) with nanoscale surface features (e.g., to guide the differentiation of stem cells).
Self-folding is an attractive approach for realizing such materials. However, self-folded lattices
are generally too compliant as there is an inherent competition between the ease-of-folding requirements
and the final load-bearing characteristics. Inspired by sheet metal forming, we propose an alternative
route for the fabrication of origami lattices. This automated folding approach allows for the introduction
of sharp folds into thick metal sheets, thereby enhancing their stiffness. We then demonstrate
the first time ever realization of automatically folded origami lattices with bone-mimicking
mechanical properties (elastic modulus = 0.5 GPa). The proposed approach is highly scalable given
that the unit cells making up the meta-biomaterial can be arbitrarily large in number and small in
dimensions. To demonstrate the scalability and versatility of the proposed approach, we fabricated
origami lattices with > 100 unit cells, lattices with unit cells as small as 1.25 mm, and auxetic lattices.
We then used inductively coupled plasma reactive ion etching to nanopattern the surface of the sheets
prior to folding. Protected by a thin layer of coating, these nanoscale features remained intact
during the folding process. A cell culture assay was then used to assess the bone tissue regeneration
performance of the folded origami. We found that the nanopatterned folded specimens exhibit significantly
increased mineralization as compared to their non-patterned counterparts.

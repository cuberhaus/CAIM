Interface by definition is two-dimensional (2-D) as it separates 2 phases with an abrupt change
in structure and chemistry across the interface. The interface between a metal and its nitride is
expected to be atomically sharp, as chemical gradation would require the creation of N vacancies
in nitrides and N interstitials in metal. Contrary to this belief, using first-principles density
functional theory (DFT), we establish that the chemically graded Ti/TiN interface is thermodynamically
preferred over the sharp interface. DFT calculated N vacancy formation energy in TiN is 2.4 eV, and
N interstitial in Ti is -3.8 eV. Thus, diffusion of N from TiN to Ti by the formation of N vacancy in TiN
and N interstitial in Ti would reduce the internal energy of the Ti-TiN heterostructure. We show
that diffusion of N is thermodynamically favorable till ~23% of N has diffused from TiN to Ti, resulting
in an atomically chemically graded interface, which we refer to as a 3-D interface. Experiments'
inability to identify a 3-D interface in Ti/TiN could be attributed to limitations in identifying
chemical composition and structure with atomic-level resolution at interfaces. We define the
sum of N vacancy formation energy and N interstitial formation energy as driving-force, which could
be used as a convenient way to assess the possibility of forming a 3-D interface in metal/ceramic
heterostructures. We also show gradual variation in lattice parameters and mechanical properties
(like bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young's modulus, and hardness) across the Ti/TiN interface.
3-D interfaces open a new way to control properties of metal/ceramic heterostructures, in line
with the already established advantage of gradation at interfaces in micrometer length scale.
For widely explored Ti/TiN multilayer nano-heterostructures, the possibility of forming 3-D
interface could lead to enhanced wear and erosion resistance.

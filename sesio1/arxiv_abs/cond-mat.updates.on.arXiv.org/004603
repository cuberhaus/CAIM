In materials science, it is often assumed that ground state crystal structures predicted by density
functional theory are the easiest polymorphs to synthesize. Ternary nitride materials, with many
possible metastable polymorphs, provide a rich materials space to study what influences thermodynamic
stability and polymorph synthesizability. For example, ZnZrN2 is theoretically predicted at
zero Kelvin to have an unusual layered "wurtsalt" ground state crystal structure with compelling
optoelectronic properties, but it is unknown whether this structure can be realized experimentally
under practical synthesis conditions. Here, we use combinatorial sputtering to synthesize hundreds
of ZnxZr1-xNy thin film samples, and find metastable rocksalt-derived or boron-nitride-derived
structures rather than the predicted wurtsalt structure. Using a statistical polymorph sampler
approach, it is demonstrated that although rocksalt is the least stable polymorph at zero Kelvin,
it becomes the most stable polymorph at high effective temperatures similar to those achieved using
this sputter deposition method, and thus corroborates experimental results. Additional calculations
show that this destabilization of the wurtsalt polymorph is due to configurational entropic and
enthalpic effects, and that vibrational contributions are negligible. Specifically, rocksalt-
and boron-nitride-derived structures become the most stable polymorphs in the presence of disorder
because of higher tolerances to cation cross-substitution and off-stoichiometry than the wurtsalt
structure. This understanding of the role of disorder tolerance in the synthesis of competing polymorphs
can enable more accurate predictions of synthesizable crystal structures and their achievable
material properties.

Magnetoresistance (MR) is a characteristic that the resistance of a substance changes with the
external magnetic field, reflecting various physical origins and microstructures of the substance.
A large MR, namely a huge response to a low external field, has always been a useful functional feature
in industrial technology and a core goal pursued by physicists and materials scientists. Conventional
large MR materials are mainly manganites, whose colossal MR (CMR) can be as high as -90%. The dominant
mechanism is attributed to spin configuration aligned by the external field, which reduces magnetic
scattering and thus resistance. In recent years, some new systems have shown an extremely large
unsaturated MR (XMR). Unlike ordinary metals, the positive MR of these systems can reach 103-108%
and is persistent under super high magnetic fields. The XMR materials are mainly metals or semimetals,
distributed in high-mobility topological or non-topological systems, and some are magnetic,
which suggests a wide range of application scenarios. Various mechanisms have been proposed for
the potential physical origin of XMR, including electron-hole compensation, steep band, ultrahigh
mobility, high residual resistance ratio, topological fermions, etc. It turns out that some mechanisms
play a leading role in certain systems, while more are far from clearly defined. In addition, the
researches on XMR are largely overlapped or closely correlated with other recently rising physics
and materials researches, such as topological matters and two-dimensional (2D) materials, which
makes elucidating the mechanism of XMR even more important. Moreover, the disclosed novel properties
will lay a broad and solid foundation for the design and development of functional devices. In this
review, we will discuss several aspects in the following order: ...

A fundamental issue in biology is the nature of evolutionary transitions from unicellular to multicellular
organisms. Volvocine algae are models for this transition, as they span from the unicellular biflagellate
Chlamydomonas to multicellular species of Volvox with up to 50,000 Chlamydomonas-like cells on
the surface of a spherical extracellular matrix. The mechanism of phototaxis in these species is
of particular interest since they lack a nervous system and intercellular connections; steering
is a consequence of the response of individual cells to light. Studies of Volvox and Gonium, a 16-cell
organism with a plate-like structure, have shown that the flagellar response to changing illumination
of the cellular photosensor is adaptive, with a recovery time tuned to the rotation period of the
colony around its primary axis. Here, combining high-resolution studies of the flagellar photoresponse
with 3D tracking of freely-swimming cells, we show that such tuning also underlies phototaxis of
Chlamydomonas. A mathematical model is developed based on the rotations around an axis perpendicular
to the flagellar beat plane that occur through the adaptive response to oscillating light levels
as the organism spins. Exploiting a separation of time scales between the flagellar photoresponse
and phototurning, we develop an equation of motion that accurately describes the observed photoalignment.
In showing that the adaptive time scale is tuned to the organisms' rotational period across three
orders of magnitude in cell number, our results suggest a unified picture of phototaxis in green
algae in which the asymmetry in torques that produce phototurns arise from the individual flagella
of Chlamydomonas, the flagellated edges of Gonium and the flagellated hemispheres of Volvox.

The emergence of superconductivity with doping from correlated insulators in magic-angle twisted
bilayer graphene (MATBG) has raised the intriguing possibility that its pairing mechanism is distinct
from that of conventional superconductors, as described by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)
theory. While there is now ample evidence for strong electronic correlations in MATBG, recent studies
have claimed that unlike correlated insulators, superconductivity persists even when these interactions
are partially screened. This suggests that the pairing in MATBG might be conventional in nature,
a consequence of the large density of states of its nearly flat bands, perhaps phonon-mediated as
in BCS superconductors. Here we combine tunneling and Andreev reflection spectroscopy with the
scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to observe several key experimental signatures for unconventional
superconductivity in MATBG. We show that the tunneling spectra below the transition temperature
$T_c$ are inconsistent with that of a conventional s-wave superconductor, but rather resemble
that of a nodal superconductor with an anisotropic pairing mechanism. We observe a large discrepancy
between the tunneling energy gap $\Delta_T$, which far exceeds the mean-field BCS ratio (with $2\Delta_T/k_BT_c
\sim 25$) and the energy gap $\Delta_{AR}$ extracted from Andreev reflection spectroscopy ($2\Delta_{AR}/k_BT_c
\sim 6$). The tunneling gap persists even when superconductivity is suppressed, indicating its
emergence from a pseudogap phase, with a suppressed density of states at the Fermi level. Moreover,
the pseudogap state and superconductivity are both absent when MATBG is aligned with the hexagonal
boron nitride (hBN) underneath. These findings and other observations reported here provide a
preponderance of evidence for a non-BCS mechanism for superconductivity in MATBG.

Dense, disordered packings of particles are useful models of low-temperature amorphous phases
of matter, biological systems, granular media, and colloidal systems. The study of dense packings
of nonspherical particles enables one to ascertain how rotational degrees of freedom affect packing
behavior. Here, we study superballs, a large family of deformations of the sphere, defined in three
dimensions by $|x_1|^{2p}+|x_2|^{2p}+|x_3|^{2p}\leq1$, where $p>0$ is a deformation parameter
indicating to what extent the shape deviates from a sphere. As $p$ increases from the sphere point
($p=1$), the superball attains cubic symmetry, and attains octahedral symmetry when $p<1$. Previous
characterization of superball packings has shown that they have a maximally random jammed (MRJ)
state, whose properties (e.g., packing fraction $\phi$) vary nonanalytically as $p$ diverges
from unity. Here, we use an event-driven molecular dynamics algorithm to produce MRJ superball
packings. We characterize their large-scale structure by examining the small-$Q$ behavior of
their structure factors and spectral densities, which indicate these packings are effectively
hyperuniform. We show that the mean width $\bar{w}$ is a useful length scale to make distances dimensionless
in order to compare systematically superballs of different shape. We also compute the complementary
cumulative pore-size distribution $F(\delta)$ and find the pore sizes tend to decrease as $|1-p|$
increases. From $F(\delta)$, we estimate the fluid permeability, mean survival time, and principal
diffusion relaxation time of the packings. Additionally, we compute the diffusion spreadability
and find the long-time power-law scaling indicates these packings are hyperuniform. Our results
can be used to help inform the design of granular materials with targeted densities and transport
properties.

Random constraint satisfaction problems can exhibit a phase where the number of constraints per
variable $\alpha$ makes the system solvable in theory on the one hand, but also makes the search for
a solution hard, meaning that common algorithms such as Monte-Carlo method fail to find a solution.
The onset of this hardness is deeply linked to the appearance of a dynamical phase transition where
the phase space of the problem breaks into an exponential number of clusters. The exact position
of this dynamical phase transition is not universal with respect to the details of the Hamiltonian
one chooses to represent a given problem. In this paper, we develop some theoretical tools in order
to find a systematic way to build a Hamiltonian that maximizes the dynamic $\alpha_{\rm d}$ threshold.
To illustrate our techniques, we will concentrate on the problem of continuous coloring, where
one tries to set an angle $x_i \in [0;2\pi]$ on each node of a network in such a way that no adjacent nodes
are closer than some threshold angle $\theta$, that is $\cos(x_i - x_j) \leq \cos\theta$. This problem
can be both seen as a continuous version of the discrete graph coloring problem or as a one-dimensional
version of the the Mari-Krzakala-Kurchan (MKK) model. The relevance of this model stems from the
fact that continuous constraint satisfaction problems on sparse random graphs remain largely
unexplored in statistical physics. We show that for sufficiently small angle $\theta$ this model
presents a random first order transition and compute the dynamical, condensation and Kesten-Stigum
transitions; we also compare the analytical predictions with Monte Carlo simulations for values
of $\theta = 2\pi/q$, $q \in \mathbb{N}$. Choosing such values of $q$ allows us to easily compare
our results with the renowned problem of discrete coloring.

A fundamental challenge of the quantum revolution is to efficiently interface the quantum computing
systems operating at cryogenic temperatures with room temperature electronics and media for high
data-rate communication. Current approaches to control and readout of such cryogenic computing
systems use electrical cables, which prevent scalability due to their large size, heat conduction,
and limited bandwidth1. A more viable approach is to use optical fibers which allow high-capacity
transmission and thermal isolation. A key component in implementing photonic datalinks is a cryogenic
optical modulator for converting data from the electrical to the optical domain at high speed and
with low power consumption, while operating at temperatures of 4 K or lower. Cryogenic modulators
based on the electro-optic effect have been demonstrated in a variety of material platforms, however
they are voltage driven components while superconducting circuits are current based, resulting
in a large impedance mismatch. Here, we present the first demonstration of an integrated current-driven
modulator based on the magneto-optic effect operating over a wide temperature range that extends
down to less than 4 K. The modulator works at data rates up to 2 Gbps with energy consumption below 4
pJ/bit, and we show that this figure can be reduced to less than 40 fJ/bit with optimized design and
fabrication. This modulator is a hybrid device, where a current-driven magneto-optically active
crystal (cerium substituted yttrium iron garnet, or Ce:YIG) is bonded to a high-quality silicon
microring resonator. Because of its potential for extremely low power consumption under cryogenic
conditions, the class of magneto-optical modulators demonstrated here has the potential to enable
efficient data links in large-scale systems for quantum information processing.

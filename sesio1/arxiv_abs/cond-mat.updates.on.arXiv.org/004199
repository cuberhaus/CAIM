Novel multicaloric cooling utilizing the giant caloric response of Ni-Mn-based metamagnetic
shape-memory alloys to different external stimuli such as magnetic field, uniaxial stress and
hydrostatic pressure is a promising candidate for energy-efficient and environmentally-friendly
refrigeration. However, the role of microstructure when several external fields are applied simultaneously
or sequentially has been scarcely discussed in literature. Here, we synthesized ternary Ni-Mn-In
alloys by suction casting and arc melting and analyzed the microstructural influence on the response
to magnetic fields and uniaxial stress. By combining SEM-EBSD and stress-strain data, a significant
effect of texture on the stress-induced martensitic transformation is revealed. It is shown that
a <001> texture can strongly reduce the critical transformation stresses. The effect of grain size
on the material failure is demonstrated and its influence on the magnetic-field-induced transformation
dynamics is investigated. Temperature-stress and temperature-magnetic field phase diagrams
are established and single caloric performances are characterized in terms of ${\Delta}{s_T}$
and ${\Delta}{T_{ad}}$. The cyclic ${\Delta}{T_{ad}}$ values are compared to the ones achieved
in the multicaloric exploiting-hysteresis cycle. It turns out that a suction-cast microstructure
and the combination of both stimuli enables outstanding caloric effects in moderate external fields
which can significantly exceed the single caloric performances. In particular for Ni-Mn-In, the
maximum cyclic effect in magnetic fields of 1.9 T is increased by more than 200 % to -4.1 K when a moderate
sequential stress of 55 MPa is applied. Our results illustrate the crucial role of microstructure
for multicaloric cooling using Ni-Mn-based metamagnetic shape-memory alloys.

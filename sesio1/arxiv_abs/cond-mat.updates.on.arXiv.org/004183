Two-dimensional (2D) monolayer pristine MoS$_2$ transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) is the
most studied material because of its promising aspects as nonprecious electrocatalyst for hydrogen
evolution reaction (HER). Previous studies have shown that the basal planes of the 2D MoS$_2$ are
catalytically inert and hence, they cannot be used directly in desired applications such as electrochemical
HER in industries. Here, we have thoroughly studied the defect-engineered Mn-doped 2D monolayer
MoS$_2$ (Mn-MoS$_2$) material where Mn was doped in the pristine MoS$_2$ to activate the inert basal
planes. Using density functional theory (DFT) method, we performed rigorous inspection of electronic
structures and properties of the 2D monolayer Mn-MoS$_2$ to be a promising alternative to noble
metal free catalysts for the effective HER. Periodic 2D slab of the monolayer Mn-MoS$_2$ was created
to study the electronic properties and the reaction pathways occurring on the surface of the material.
The detailed HER mechanism has been explored by creating the Mn$_1$Mo$_9$S$_{21}$ non-periodic
finite molecular cluster model system using M06-L DFT method including solvation effects to determine
the reaction barriers and kinetics. Our study reveals that the 2D Mn-MoS$_2$ follows the most favorable
Volmer-Heyrovsky reaction mechanism with very low energy barriers during the H$_2$ evolution.
It was found that the change of free energy barrier during the Heyrovsky reaction is about 10.34 -
10.79 kcal/mol, indicating an exceptional electrocatalyst for HER. The Tafel slope is lower in
the case of 2D monolayer Mn-MoS$_2$ material due to the overlap of the s-orbital of the hydrogen and
d-orbitals of the Mn atoms appeared in the HOMO and LUMO transition states (TS1 and TS2) of both the
Volmer and Heyrovsky reaction steps.

Despite the extensive research that has been conducted for decades on the behavior of confined liquids,
detailed knowledge of this phenomenon, particularly in the mixed/boundary lubrication regime,
remains limited. This can be attributed to several factors including the difficulty of direct experimental
observations of the behavior of lubricant molecules under non-equilibrium conditions, the high
computational cost of molecular simulations to reach steady state, and the low signal-to-noise
ratio at extremely low shear rates corresponding to actual operating conditions. To this end, we
studied the correlation between the structure formation and shear viscosity of octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane
confined between two mica surfaces in a mixed/boundary lubrication regime. Three different surface
separations corresponding to two-, three-, and five-layered structures were considered to analyze
the effect of confinement. The orientational distributions with one specific peak for $n=2$ and
two distributions, including a parallel orientation with the surface normal for $n>2$, were observed
at rest. The confined liquids exhibited a distinct shear-thinning behavior independent of surface
separations for a relatively low sliding velocity, $V_{\rm x}\lesssim 10^{-1}\,{\rm m/s}$. However,
the shear viscosities at $V_{\rm x}\lesssim 10^{-1}\,{\rm m/s}$ depended on the number of layered
structures. Newtonian behavior was observed with a further increase in the sliding velocity. Furthermore,
we found a strong correlation between the degree of molecular orientation and the shear viscosity
of the confined liquids. The magnitude of the shear viscosity of the confined liquids can primarily
be determined by the degree of molecular orientation, and shear-thinning originates from the vanishing
of specific orientational distributions with increasing sliding velocity.

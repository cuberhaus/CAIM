The distance-dependent interaction of an emitter with a plasmonic nanoparticle or surface forms
the basis of the field of plexitonics. Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are robust emitters due
to their photostability, and offer the possibility of understanding the fundamental photophysics
between one emitter and one metal nanoparticle. A key enabling challenge is the formation of systems
containing both QDs and plasmonic nanoparticles in high purity. We present the translation of DNA-based
self-assembly techniques to assemble metal and semiconductor nanocrystals into discrete hybrid
structures, including dimers, of high purity. This method gives control over the interparticle
separation, geometry, and ratio of QD:metal nanoparticle, as well as the spectral properties of
the metal/QD components in the assembly to allow investigation of plasmon-exciton interaction.
The hybrid assemblies show the expected enhancement in steady-state photoluminescence accompanied
by an increase in the QD emission rate for assemblies with a strong overlap between the QD emission
and localised surface plasmon resonance. In contrast, lengthening of the QD emission lifetime
(a reduction of the emission rate) of up to 1.7-fold, along with an enhancement in steady-state PL
of 15-75% is observed upon detuning of the QD and metal nanoparticle spectral properties. This understood
in terms of the Purcell effect, where the gold nanoparticle acts as a damped, nanoscale cavity. Considering
the metal nanoparticle using generalised nonlocal optical response theory (GNOR) and the QD as
an open quantum system, the response is driven by the interference experienced by the emitter for
parallel and perpendicular field orientations. This provides a mechanism for control of the emission
rate of a QD by a metal nanoparticle across a much wider range of lifetimes than previously understood.

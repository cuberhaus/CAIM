In this work, an extensive Metropolis Monte Carlo simulation is performed to investigate the steady-state
magnetic and thermodynamic behaviour of a trilayered spin-1/2 Ising ferrimagnet with \textit{square
monolayers}, driven by external Gaussian random magnetic field with certain spatio-temporal
variations. Such \textit{thin} magnetic systems are interesting subjects for simulational studies
as they exhibit \textit{compensation phenomenon}. Here, two distinct theoretical atoms, A and
B make up the \textit{ABA} and \textit{AAB} type of configurations. In ABA, A-atoms make up the surface
layers and the mid-layer is composed up of B atoms. While, in \textit{AAB}, A-atoms make up the top
and mid-layer while the bottom layer is made up of B-atoms. The like atoms (A-A and B-B) ferromagnetically
interact and the unlike atoms (A-B) interact antiferromagnetically. For the time-dependent external
Gaussian random field, the mean is zero always and the standard deviation is increased to unity in
steps. Depending upon the strength of the external Gaussian random field, the compensation and
critical points shift and steady-state magnetic behaviours shift between different distinct
type of ferrimagnetic behaviours. The compensation phenomenon even vanishes after crossing a
finite threshold of standard deviation of the magnetic field for particular choices of the other
controlling parameters. Like Chandra S.[Phys. Rev. E 104, 064126 (2021)], in the Hamiltonian parameter
space of both the configurations islands of ferrimagnetic phase without compensation appear within
the phase area with compensation of field-free case. The areas of such islands grow with increasing
standard deviation of the external field, $\sigma$, obeying the scaling relation: $f(\sigma,A(\sigma))=\sigma^{-b}A(\sigma)$
with $b_{ABA}=1.913\pm 0.137$ and $b_{AAB}=1.625\pm 0.066$ .

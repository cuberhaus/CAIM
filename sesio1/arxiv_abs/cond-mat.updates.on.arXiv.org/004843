GW approximation is one of the most popular parameter-free many-body methods that goes beyond the
limitations of the standard density functional theory (DFT) to determine the excitation spectra
for moderately correlated materials and in particular the semiconductors. It is also the first
step in developing the diagrammatic Monte Carlo method into an electronic structure tool, which
would offer a numerically exact solution to the solid-state problem. Currently, most electronic
structure packages support GW calculations for the band-insulating materials, while the support
for the metallic system remains limited to only a few implementations. The metallic systems are
challenging for GW, as it requires one to accurately resolve the Fermi surface singularities, which
demands a dense momentum mesh. Here we implement GW algorithm within the all-electron Linear Augmented
Plane Wave framework, where we pay special attention to the metallic systems, the convergence with
respect to momentum mesh and proper treatment of the deep laying core states, as needed for the future
variational diagrammatic Monte Carlo implementation. Our improved algorithm for resolving Fermi
surface singularities allows us a stable and accurate analytic continuation of imaginary axis
data, which is carried out for GW excitation spectra throughout the Brillouin zone in both the metallic
and insulating materials, and is compared to numerically more stable contour deformation integration
technique. We compute band structures for elemental metallic systems Li, Na, and Mg as well as for
various narrow and wide bandgap insulators such as Si, BN, SiC, MgO, LiF, ZnS, and CdS and compare
our results with previous GW calculations and available experiments data. Our results are in good
agreement with the available literature.

Polarizers are ubiquitous components in optoelectronic devices of daily use as displays, optical
sensors or photographic cameras, among others. Yet the control over light polarization is an unresolved
challenge as the main drawback of the current display technologies relays in significant optical
losses. In such a context, organometal halide perovskites can play a decisive role given their flexible
synthesis with under design optical properties . Therefore, along with their outstanding electrical
properties have elevated hybrid perovskites as the material of choice in photovoltaics and optoelectronics.
Among the different organometal halide perovskite nanostructures, nanowires and nanorods have
lately arise as key players for the control of light polarization for lighting or detector applications.
Herein, we will present the unprecedented fabrication of highly aligned and anisotropic methylammonium
lead iodide (MAPI) perovskite nanowalls by Glancing Angle Deposition of PbI2 under high vacuum
followed by CH3NH3I deposition at normal angle. Our approach offers a direct route for the fabrication
of perovskite nanostructures virtually on any substrate, including on photovoltaic devices.
The unparalleled alignment degree of the perovskite nanowalls provides the samples with strong
anisotropic optical properties such as light absorption and photoluminescence, the latter with
a maximum polarization ratio of P=0.43. Furthermore, the implementation of the MAPI nanowalls
in photovoltaic devices provides them with a polarization-sensitive response, with a maximum
photocurrent difference of 2.1 % when illuminating with the near-infrared range of the solar spectrum
(>700 nm). Our facile vacuum-based approach embodies a milestone in the development of last generation
polarization-sensitive perovskite-based optoelectronic devices such as lighting appliances
or self-powered photodetectors.

Optimization strategies driven by machine learning, such as Bayesian optimization, are being
explored across experimental sciences as an efficient alternative to traditional design of experiment.
When combined with automated laboratory hardware and high-performance computing, these strategies
enable next-generation platforms for autonomous experimentation. However, the practical application
of these approaches is hampered by a lack of flexible software and algorithms tailored to the unique
requirements of chemical research. One such aspect is the pervasive presence of constraints in
the experimental conditions when optimizing chemical processes or protocols, and in the chemical
space that is accessible when designing functional molecules or materials. Although many of these
constraints are known a priori, they can be interdependent, non-linear, and result in non-compact
optimization domains. In this work, we extend our experiment planning algorithms Phoenics and
Gryffin such that they can handle arbitrary known constraints via an intuitive and flexible interface.
We benchmark these extended algorithms on continuous and discrete test functions with a diverse
set of constraints, demonstrating their flexibility and robustness. In addition, we illustrate
their practical utility in two simulated chemical research scenarios: the optimization of the
synthesis of o-xylenyl Buckminsterfullerene adducts under constrained flow conditions, and
the design of redox active molecules for flow batteries under synthetic accessibility constraints.
The tools developed constitute a simple, yet versatile strategy to enable model-based optimization
with known experimental constraints, contributing to its applicability as a core component of
autonomous platforms for scientific discovery.

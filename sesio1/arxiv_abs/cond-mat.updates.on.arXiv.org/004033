I review the way the many-body Green functions are used to renormalize the perturbation theory of
correlated fermions. The Green functions are introduced to implement systematically dynamical
corrections to the static mean-field theory. The renormalizations enter the perturbation theory
via self-consistent evaluations of one-particle and two-particle Green functions. The one-particle
self-consistency is discussed within the Baym-Kadanoff construction. We point to an inherent
dichotomy of the Baym-Kadanoff approach in the relation between one and two-particle Green functions.
They are the Schwinger-Dyson equation, directly derived from the generating Luttinger-Ward functional,
and the Ward identity. The latter imposes a severe restriction on the two-particle irreducible
vertex and is not guaranteed in the Baym-Kadanoff approach. No approximate theory is capable to
obey both relations. I further discuss the two-particle approach with two-particle renormalizations
that offers a way to reconcile the Schwinger-Dyson equation and the Ward identity. The two-particle
irreducible vertex from the critical Bethe-Salpeter equation becomes a generating functional
in the two-particle renormalization of the perturbation theory. The irreducible vertex is used
in the Ward identity to determine the order parameter beyond the critical point and in the Bethe-Salpeter
equation representing the vertex of the Schwinger-Dyson equation to determine the spectral self-energy
in such a way that the thermodynamic critical behavior from both equations is qualitatively the
same. Finally, I discuss a static mean-field-like approximation with a renormalized effective
interaction determined self-consistently that leads to a qualitatively correct description
of strong electron correlations in impurity and lattice models.

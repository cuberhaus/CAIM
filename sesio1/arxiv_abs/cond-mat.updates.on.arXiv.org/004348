We perform simulations to compute the effective potential between the centers-of-mass of two polymers
with reversible bonds. We investigate the influence of the topology of the unbonded precursor (linear
or ring) and the specific sequence of the reactive groups (from purely random to periodic), establishing
that both have a strong impact on the effective potential. When the reactive sites of both polymers
are chemically orthogonal so that only intramolecular bonds are possible, the interactions become
more repulsive the closer to periodic the sequence is. The opposite effect is found if both polymers
have the same type of reactive sites and intermolecular bonds can be formed. We test the validity
of the effective potentials in solution, from high dilution to far above the overlap concentration,
by comparing simulations of the effective fluid with those of the real all-monomer system. Very
good agreement is found for the reversible linear polymers, indicating that unlike in their non-bonding
counterparts many-body effects are minor even far above the overlap concentration. The agreement
for the reversible rings is less satisfactory, and at high concentration the real system does not
show the clustering behavior predicted by the effective potential. Results similar to the former
ones are found for the partial self-correlations in ring/linear mixtures. Finally, we investigate
the possibility of creating a gel of two interpenetrated reversible networks. For this purpose
we simulate a 50/50 two-component mixture of reversible polymers with orthogonal chemistry for
the reactive sites, so that intermolecular bonds are only formed between polymers of the same component.
As predicted by both the theoretical phase diagram and the simulations of the effective fluid, the
two networks in the all-monomer mixture do not interpenetrate and phase separation (demixing)
is observed instead.

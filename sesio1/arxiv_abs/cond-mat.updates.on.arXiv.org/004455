MXene and its derivatives have attracted considerable attention for potential application in
energy storage like batteries and supercapacitors owing to its ultrathin metallic structures.
However, the complexity of the ionic and electronic dynamics in MXene based hybrids, which are normally
needed for device integration, triggers both challenges and opportunities for its application.
In this paper, as a prototype of metallic hybrids of MXene, heterostructures consisting of Ti3C2T2
(T= None, O and F atoms) and metallic MoS2 (1T phase) are investigated. Through density functional
theory, we investigate the interfacial electronic variation, thermal activation, and anode performance
in the lithium-ion battery (LIB) of Ti3C2T2/1T-MoS2. We found that different surface atomic groups
in MXene can significantly alter the affinity, redox reaction and kinetics of Li atoms in the interface
of the Ti3C2T2 and 1T-MoS2. Through examining the three possible pathways of Li by climbing image-nudged
elastic band (CI-NEB) and ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation, the diffusion curve
becomes significantly flattened from the naked to O- and F-terminated Ti3C2 MXene with activation
barriers reducing from 0.80 to 0.22 and 0.29 eV, respectively, and room-temperature diffusion
coefficients increasing from 1.20x10-6 to 2.75x10-6, 1.70x10-4 cm2 s-1, respectively. The functionalization
with O or F eliminates the steric hindrance of Li intercalation by breaking the strong interaction
between two layers and provides additional adsorption sites for Li diffusion in the meantime. Our
work suggests that surface functional groups play a significant role in Ti3C2T2/1T-MoS2 modification
and Ti3C2F2/1T-MoS2 with the high diffusion coefficient and theoretical capacity could be a promising
anode material for LIBs.

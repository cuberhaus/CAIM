In this investigation, we have synthesized BiFeO$_{3}$ nanoparticles by varying hydrothermal
reaction temperatures from 200 $^{\circ}$C to 120 $^{\circ}$C to assess their visible-light-driven
photocatalytic activity along with their applicability for hydrogen production via water splitting.
The rhombohedral perovskite structure of BiFeO$_{3}$ is formed for hydrothermal reaction temperature
up to 160 $^{\circ}$C, however, for a further decrement of reaction temperature a mixed sillenite
phase is observed. The XRD Rietveld analysis, XPS analysis and FESEM imaging ensure the formation
of single-phase and well crystalline nanoparticles at 160 $^{\circ}$C reaction temperature with
20 nm of average size. The nanoparticles fabricated at this particular reaction temperature also
exhibit improved magnetization, reduced leakage current density and excellent ferroelectric
behavior. These nanoparticles demonstrate considerably high absorbance in the visible range
with a low bandgap (2.1 eV). The experimentally observed bandgap is in excellent agreement with
the calculated bandgap using the first-principles calculations. The favorable photocatalytic
performance of these nanoparticles has been able to generate more than two times of solar hydrogen
compared to that produced by bulk BiFeO$_{3}$ as well as commercially available Degussa P25 titania.
Notably, the experimentally observed bandgap is almost equal for both bulk material and nanoparticles
prepared at different reaction temperatures. Therefore, in solar energy applications, the superiority
of BFO nanoparticles prepared at 160 $^{\circ}$C reaction temperature may be attributed not only
to solely their bandgap but also to other factors, such as reduced particle size, excellent morphology,
well crystallinity, large surface to volume ratio, ferroelectricity and so on.

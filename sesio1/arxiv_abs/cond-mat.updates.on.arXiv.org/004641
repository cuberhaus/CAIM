The rapid growth of data-driven materials research has made it necessary to develop systematically
designed, open databases of material properties. However, there are few open databases for polymeric
materials compared to other material systems such as inorganic crystals. To this end, we developed
RadonPy, the world-first open-source Python library for fully automated all-atom classical molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations. For a given polymer repeating unit, the entire process of molecular
modeling, equilibrium and nonequilibrium MD calculations, and property calculations can be conducted
fully automatically. In this study, 15 different properties, including the thermal conductivity,
density, specific heat capacity, thermal expansion coefficients, and refractive index, were
calculated for more than 1,000 unique amorphous polymers. The calculated properties were compared
and validated systematically with experimental values from PoLyInfo. During the high-throughput
data production, eight amorphous polymers with extremely high thermal conductivities, exceeding
0.4 W/mK, were identified, including six polymers with unreported thermal conductivities. These
polymers were found to have a high density of hydrogen bonding units or rigid backbones. A decomposition
analysis of the heat conduction, which is implemented in RadonPy, revealed the underlying mechanisms
that yield a high thermal conductivity of the amorphous polymers: heat transfer via hydrogen bonds
and dipole-dipole interactions between the polymer chains with their hydrogen bonding units or
via the covalent bonds of the polymer backbone with high rigidity. The creation of massive amounts
of computational property data using RadonPy will facilitate the development of polymer informatics,
similar to how the emergence of the first-principles computational database for inorganic crystals
had significantly advanced materials informatics.

Non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) in non-Hermitian lattice systems, associated with a point gap
on the complex energy plane, has attracted great theoretical and experimental interest. Much less
is studied on the so-called second-order non-Hermitian skin effect, where the bulk does not support
a point gap but localization at the corner still occurs. This work discovers a class of hybrid skin-topological
modes as the second-order non-Hermitian skin effect without asymmetric couplings. Specifically,
by only adding gain/loss to two-dimensional Chern insulators and so long as the gain/loss strength
does not close the line gap, all the topological edge states are localized at one corner under the
open boundary condition, with the bulk states extended. The resultant non-Hermitian Chern bands
can be still topologically characterized by Chern numbers, whereas the hybrid skin-topological
modes are understood via some auxiliary Hermitian systems that belong to either intrinsic or extrinsic
second-order topological insulator phases. By proposing an innovative construction of auxiliary
Hamiltonian, our generic route to hybrid skin-topological modes is further successfully extended
to nonequilibrium topological systems with gain and loss, where the anomalous Floquet band topology
is no longer captured by band Chern numbers. The extension thus leads to the intriguing finding of
nonequilibrium hybrid skin-topological modes. In addition to offering a straightforward route
to experimental realization of hybrid topological-skin effects, this study also opens up a promising
perspective for the understanding of corner localization by revealing the synergy of three important
concepts, namely, non-Hermitian topological insulator, second-order non-Hermitian skin effect,
and second-order topological insulator.

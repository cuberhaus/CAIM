Trilayered spin-1/2 Ising ferrimagnets are interesting thin systems for compensation phenomenon.
In this work, a Metropolis Monte Carlo study is performed on the magnetic and thermodynamic response
of such a system on square Bravais lattice, driven by uniform random external magnetic field with
spatio-temporal variations. In two distinct configurations, the surface layers are made up of
A and the mid-layer is made up of B atoms in a ABA type stacking while in AAB type stacking, the top-layer
and the mid-layer is made up of A-atoms while the bottom layer is made up of B-atoms. The magnetic coupling
between the like atoms (A-A and B-B) is ferromagnetic while between the unlike atoms (A-B), it is
antiferromagnetic. For the time-dependent external uniform random field, the mean is always set
to zero and the standard deviation is varied until spin-field energy is comparable to the dominant
cooperative energy of the system. The findings show that the observed compensation and critical
points shift and steady-state magnetic behaviours shift between N-, L-, P- and Q- etc. type of ferrimagnetic
behaviours, depending upon the strength of external uniform random field. The compensation phenomenon
even vanishes after crossing a finite threshold of standard deviation of the magnetic field for
particular choices of the other controlling parameters. Thus islands of ferrimagnetic phase without
compensation appear within the phase area with compensation of field-free case, in the 2D Hamiltonian
parameter space. For both the configurations, the areas of such islands even grow with increasing
standard deviation of the external field, {\sigma}, obeying a scaling relation of the form: $f ({\sigma},
A({\sigma})) = {\sigma}^{-b} A({\sigma})$ with $b_{ABA} = 1.958 \pm 0.122$ and $b_{AAB} = 1.783
\pm 0.118$ .

As studied, atoms deal with the positive or negative charge by losing or gaining an electron. However,
the gaseous and solid atoms can execute interstate electron dynamics. They can also deal with transition
states. Solid atoms can elongate from the east-west poles at the ground surface level. Under suitable
energy, solid atoms can expand, and gaseous atoms can contract. When the excessive field is intact,
flowing inert gas atoms can split. The splitting inert gas atoms convert into electron streams.
Those electron streams carrying the photons when impinging on the naturally-elongated solid atoms,
further elongation of the atoms takes place. If not, elongated atoms at least deform. Gaseous atoms
can squeeze by the suffering of their lattices. Such behaviors of the atoms validate that they cannot
ionize. On splitting the flowing inert gas atoms, characteristics of the photons become apparent.
Those photons that are not carried by the electron streams can enter the air medium directly. On traveling
photons in the air medium, their energy dissipates in heat, and their force confines in the form of
a field. On confinement of the field of traveling photons with the field of air-medium, a glow of light
is appeared, which is better known in plasma. The splitting of inert gas atoms, the carrying of photons
by the electron streams, and the lighting of traveling photons validate that an electric current
is photonic. In various microscopes, the magnification of an image is based on the resolving power
of photons. Photonic current is due to the propagation of the photons in the structure of the interstate
electron gap. Some well-known principles are also discussed, validating that an electric current
is a photonic current. Indeed, this study brings about profound changes in science.

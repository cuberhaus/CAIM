We derive the most basic dynamical properties of random hyperbolic graphs (the distributions of
contact and intercontact durations) in the hot regime (network temperature $T > 1$). We show that
in the thermodynamic limit the contact distribution decays as a power law with exponent $2+T > 3$
for durations $t > T$, while for $t < T$ it exhibits exponential-like decays. This result holds irrespective
of the expected degree distribution, as long as it has a finite $T^{\text{th}}$ moment. Otherwise,
the contact distribution depends on the expected degree distribution and we show that if the latter
is a power law with exponent $\gamma \in (2, T+1]$, then the former decays as a power law with exponent
$\gamma+1 > 3$. On the other hand, the intercontact distribution exhibits power-law decays with
exponent $2-T \in (0, 1)$ for $T \in (1,2)$, while for $T > 2$ it displays linear decays with a slope
that depends on the observation interval. This result holds irrespective of the expected degree
distribution as long as it has a finite $T^{\text{th}}$ moment if $T \in (1,2)$, or a finite second
moment if $T > 2$. Otherwise, the intercontact distribution depends on the expected degree distribution
and if the latter is a power law with exponent $\gamma \in (2, 3)$, then the former decays as a power
law with exponent $3-\gamma \in (0,1)$. Thus, hot random hyperbolic graphs can give rise to contact
and intercontact distributions that both decay as power laws. These power laws however are unrealistic
for the case of the intercontact distribution, as their exponent is always less than one. These results
suggest that hot random hyperbolic graphs are not adequate null models for real temporal networks,
in stark contrast to cold random hyperbolic graphs ($T < 1$). Since the configuration model emerges
at $T \to \infty$, these results also suggest that this is not an adequate null temporal network model
either.

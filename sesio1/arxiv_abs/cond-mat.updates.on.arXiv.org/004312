Speed of state transitions in macroscopic systems is a crucial concept for foundations of nonequilibrium
statistical mechanics as well as various applications in quantum technology represented by optimal
quantum control. While extensive studies have made efforts to obtain rigorous constraints on dynamical
processes since Mandelstam and Tamm, speed limits that provide tight bounds for macroscopic transitions
have remained elusive. Here, by employing the local conservation law of probability, the fundamental
principle in physics, we develop a general framework for deriving qualitatively tighter speed
limits for macroscopic systems than many conventional ones. We show for the first time that the speed
of the expectation value of an observable defined on an arbitrary graph, which can describe general
many-body systems, is bounded by the "gradient" of the observable, in contrast with conventional
speed limits depending on the entire range of the observable. This framework enables us to derive
novel quantum speed limits for macroscopic unitary dynamics. Unlike previous bounds, the speed
limit decreases when the expectation value of the transition Hamiltonian increases; this intuitively
describes a new tradeoff relation between time and quantum phase difference. Our bound is dependent
of instantaneous quantum states and thus can achieve the equality condition, which is conceptually
distinct from the Lieb-Robinson bound. We also demonstrate that our strategy can be applied for
finding new speed limits for macroscopic transitions in stochastic systems, including quantum
ones, where the bounds are expressed by the entropy production rate. Our work elucidates novel speed
limits on the basis of local conservation law, providing fundamental limits to various types of
nonequilibrium quantum macroscopic phenomena.

FAPbI3, as a typical hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite, has attracted considerable interest
due to its band gap suitable for visible light absorption and good thermal stability. A barrier to
the use of FAPbI3 in commercial, stable devices is its unwanted black-to-yellow (non-perovskite
to perovskite, commonly known as delta-to-alpha) phase transition at around 300 K. The intrinsic
mechanisms of such phase transition are far from clear, being the detailed structural description
for the alpha-phase still missing. By combined Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations,
lattice dynamics analysis and DFT molecular dynamics simulations, we assign the alpha-phase to
the highly dynamic tetragonal phase, with the high-symmetry cubic structure emerging as a dynamically
unstable maximum in the system potential energy landscape. We demonstrate computationally that
the diffraction-observed cubic structure is the result of the averaging of different tetragonal
distortions sampled in the experimental detection time scale as a result of the enhanced FA dynamics,
instead of a static system of cubic symmetry. Further finite-temperature Gibbs free energy calculations
confirm that the delta-to-alpha transition should be considered as a hexagonal-to-tetragonal
transition in contrast to the previous hexagonal-to-cubic assignment. More importantly, the
simulations indicate that the driving force of the process is the vibrational entropy difference
rather than the rotational entropy as previously proposed. These results point out the dynamical
nature of the alpha-phase, the importance of the overlooked tetragonal structure, and the key role
of the vibrational entropy in perovskite-related phase transitions, the harnessing of which is
critical for successful uptake of ABX3 hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites in commercial applications.

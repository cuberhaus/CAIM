Identifying the existence of specific functional groups in MXenes is a difficult topic that has
perplexed researchers for a long time. We show in this paper that in the case of magnetic MXenes, the
magneto-transport properties of the material provide an easy solution. One of the fascinating
properties that MXenes offer is the realization of intrinsic ferromagnetism which is important
for two-dimensional (2D) materials family. The previous reports have only made a few statements
on some MXenes citing its usefulness for spintronics related applications. Here, using first-principle
calculations we have examined the actual magneto-transport phenomena in MXenes family. We have
considered all possible combinations of 3\textit{d} transition metals ($Ti, V, Cr$ and $Mn$) and
nitride based functionalized $(O_2, F_2$ and $(OH)_2$) MXenes, $M_2NT_2$. The intrinsic anomalous
Hall effect is investigated in $Cr$ and $Mn$ based MXenes as the compounds possess ground state stable
ferromagnetic solutions. We demonstrate that intrinsic Anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) can
be used to identify the functional groups in MXenes. Additionally, half-metallic features of these
ferromagnetic MXenes make them potential candidates for varieties of applications such as in logic
and memory devices, quantum computations, spintronics etc. The maximum anomalous Hall conductivity
(AHC) at Fermi energy, $E_F$, is found in case of $Mn_2NO_2$ (470 $S/cm$) which is attributed to the
presence of avoided band crossing and larger density of states. Together, when considered all the
studied systems, the AHC can be above 2500 $S/cm$ within $E_F \pm $ 0.25 $eV$. Our findings could be
useful not only in guiding the experimentalists by considering AHC as a simple tool in determining
the functional groups in 2D ferro(i)magnets, also, it could be useful in designing memory device
with negligible stray fields.

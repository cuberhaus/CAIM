In polymer science, cross-linking of polymer chains yields a substantially modified system compared
to the one-dimensional constituent chains, due to the increase of dimensionality and effective
seeding by defects (cross-linking sites). Inspired by this concept, we analyze topological features
of a unit cell of a generalized topological mesh comprised of several one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger
(SSH) lattices cross-linked via a single site. The coupling site functions as a defect with protected
states in the trivial regime and also induces edges inside the bulk with protected localized states
centered around it in the topological regime. When more than two lattices are coupled by the defect,
namely, a dimensionality larger than one, the crossed chains support two types of localized eigenstates
around the defect. One type is highly controllable by modifying the cross-linking strength, enabling
broad tuning of eigenenergies from being submerged in the bulk band to becoming highly isolated
and protected. We show that these unique features can be explained by an equivalence of the aforementioned
system to an SSH chain coupled nonreciprocally to an external reservoir, yielding a unique pseudospectrum
for both the bulk and localized states, with spatially symmetric eigenstates. Applying non-Hermiticity
by adding gain and loss to alternating sites, relevant for example to a possible realization of topological
coupled-laser fabric, we observe an abrupt transition of the topologically protected mid-gap
state from anti-localized to localized near the defect. By changing the gain/loss parameters,
we observe a cascaded spatial symmetry breaking of the supported states at exceptional points where
parity-time symmetry is broken, for both the localized and the bulk states. The combination of the
non-Hermiticity and higher-dimensionality yields various novel phases.

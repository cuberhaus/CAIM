2D semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides have been used to make high-performance electronic,
spintronic, and optoelectronic devices. Recently, room-temperature ferromagnetism and semiconducting
property were found in 2D VSe$_2$ nanoflakes (mechanically exfoliated onto silicon substrates
capped with a oxide layer) and are attributed to the stable 2H-phase of VSe$_2$ in the 2D limit. Here,
our first-principles investigation show that a metastable semiconducting H' phase can be formed
from the H VSe2 monolayer and some other similar when these 2D H-phase materials are under uniaxial
stress or uniaxial strain. For the uniaxial stress (uniaxial strain) scheme, the H' phase will become
lower in total energy than the H phase at the transition point. The calculated phonon spectra indicate
the dynamical stability of the H' structures of VSe$_2$, VS$_2$, and CrS$_2$, and the path of phase
switching between the H and H' VSe$_2$ phases is calculated. For VSe$_2$, the H' phase has stronger
ferromagnetism and its Currier temperature can be substantially enhanced by applying uniaxial
stress or strain. Spin-resolved electronic structures, energy band edges, and effective carrier
masses for both of the H and H' phases can be substantially changed by the applied uniaxial stress
or strain, leading to huge effective masses near the band edge of the strained H' phase. Analysis
indicated that the largest bond length difference between the H' and H phases can reach -19\% for
the Se3-Se3' bond, and there is noticeable covalence for the Se3-Se3' bond, which switches the valence
of the nearby V atoms, leading to the enhanced ferromagnetism. Therefore, structural and bond reconstruction
can be realized by applying uniaxial stress in 2D ferromagnetic H VSe$_2$ and some other similar.
These can be useful to seeking more insights and phenomena in such 2D materials for potential applications.

A paradigm to achieve information processing, communication or signal generation is the idea of
using magnetostrictive nanomagnets, and manipulating their magnetic anisotropy through strain.
Non-thermal light-induced strain (photostriction) is a general property and it can be considered
to achieve such a control of magnetic properties. A comprehensive understanding of the converse
magneto-photostrictive effect (CMPE) and its use to tune the magnetic anisotropy are still elusive,
and a coefficient related to the converse magneto-photostrictive effect is not yet defined. Here,
a photostrictive manipulation of magnetic properties in an extrinsic multiferroic composite
is presented, and a new coefficient named the converse magneto-photostrictive coefficient is
proposed. The composite consists of 5 nm or 10 nm magnetostrictive FeGa thin films coupled to a piezoelectric
(011) PMN-PZT substrate. The photostriction is achieved with a 410 nm laser illumination. FeGa
magnetization reversals are modified under illumination. M-H loops area, coercive fields and
remanent magnetizations are not only reduced but also enhanced by the CMPE, according to the in-plane
applied field direction and for both thicknesses. A new coefficient named the converse magneto-photostrictive
coefficient, $\alpha_{CMP}^\lambda$, is defined in a way similar to that of the converse magneto-electric
coefficient ($\alpha_{CME}$) defined decades ago. The magnitude of $\alpha_{CMP}^\lambda$
is proportional to the change of magnetization inferred by the illumination. $\alpha_{CMP}^{410nm}$
exhibits a strong angular dependence with maxima in the vicinity of the easy axes. An analysis carried
on the latest sample shows that $\alpha_{CME}$ under an electric field change of 6.5 kV.cm$^{-1}$
and $\alpha_{CMP}^{410nm}$ angular dependencies are similar in shape, indicating strain-driven
phenomena in both cases.

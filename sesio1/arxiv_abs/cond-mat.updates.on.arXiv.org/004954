One material containing kagome bilayers and featuring both exceptional magnetism and electron
transport is the ferromagnetic metal Fe3Sn2. Notwithstanding the widespread interest in Fe3Sn2,
crystal twinning, difficulties in distinguishing surface from bulk states, and a large unit cell
have until now prevented the synchrotron-based spectroscopic observation of sharply resolved
quasiparticles near the Fermi surface which could be responsible for the anomalous properties
appearing at low temperatures for the material. Here we report microfocused laser-based angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (micro-ARPES), which offers the first look at such quasiparticles.
The high spatial resolution allows individual crystal twin domains to be examined in isolation,
resulting in the discovery of three-fold symmetric electron pockets at the Brillouin zone (BZ)
center, not predicted by early tight-binding descriptions but in agreement with density functional
theory (DFT) calculations, which also feature Weyl nodes. The quasiparticles in these pockets
have remarkably long mean free paths, and their Fermi surface area is consistent with reported quantum
oscillations. At the same time, though, the best-defined Fermi surface is reduced at low temperature,
and the quasiparticles generally are marginal in the sense that their wavelength uncertainty is
of order the deviation of the quasiparticle wavelength from the Fermi vector. We attribute these
manifestations of strong electron-electron interactions to a flat band predicted by our DFT to
lie just above the dispersive bands seen in this experiment. Thus, beyond demonstrating the impact
of twin averaging for ARPES measurements of band structures, our experiments reveal many-body
physics unaccounted for by current theories of metallic kagome ferromagnets.

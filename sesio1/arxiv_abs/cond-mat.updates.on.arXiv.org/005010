A reentrant temperature dependence of the thermoresistivity $\rho_{\mathrm{xx}}(T)$ between
an onset local superconducting ordering temperature $T_\mathrm{loc}^\mathrm{onset}$ and a
global superconducting transition at $T=T_\mathrm{glo}^\mathrm{offset}$ has been reported
in disordered conventional 3-dimensional (3D) superconductors. The disorder of these superconductors
is a result of either an extrinsic granularity due to grain boundaries, or of an intrinsic granularity
ascribable to the electronic disorder originating from impurity dopants. Here, the effects of
Fe doping on the electronic properties of sputtered NbN layers with a nominal thickness of 100 nm
are studied by means of low-$T$/high-$\mu_{0}H$ magnetotransport measurements. The doping of
NbN is achieved $via$ implantation of 35 keV Fe ions. In the as-grown NbN films, a local onset of superconductivity
at $T_\mathrm{loc}^\mathrm{onset}=15.72\,\mathrm{K}$ is found, while the global superconducting
ordering is achieved at $T_\mathrm{glo}^\mathrm{offset}=15.05\,\mathrm{K}$, with a normal
state resistivity $\rho_{\mathrm{xx}}=22\,{\mu\Omega}\cdot{\mathrm{cm}}$. Moreover, upon
Fe doping of NbN, $\rho_{\mathrm{xx}}=40\,{\mu\Omega}\cdot{\mathrm{cm}}$ is estimated, while
$T_\mathrm{loc}^\mathrm{onset}$ and $T_\mathrm{glo}^\mathrm{offset}$ are measured to be
15.1 K and 13.5K, respectively. In Fe:NbN, the intrinsic granularity leads to the emergence of a
bosonic insulator state and the normal-metal-to-superconductor transition is accompanied by
six different electronic phases characterized by a $N$-shaped $T$ dependence of $\rho_{\mathrm{xx}}(T)$.
The bosonic insulator state in a $s$-wave conventional superconductor doped with dilute paramagnetic
impurities is predicted to represent a workbench for emergent phenomena, such as gapless superconductivity,
triplet Cooper pairings and topological odd frequency superconductivity.

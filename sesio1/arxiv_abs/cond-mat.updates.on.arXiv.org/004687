The behavior of three-dimensional (3D) semimetals under strong magnetic fields is a topic of recurring
interest in condensed matter physics. Recently, the advent of Weyl and Dirac semimetals has brought
about an interesting platform for potentially uncovering phases of matter that combine nontrivial
band topology and interactions. While electronic instabilities of such semimetals at strong magnetic
fields have been explored theoretically and experimentally, the role of electron-phonon interactions
therein has been largely neglected. In this paper, we study the interplay of electron-electron
and electron-phonon interactions in a minimal two-node model of Weyl semimetal. Using a Kadanoff-Wilson
renormalization group approach, we analyze lattice (Peierls) instabilities emerging from chiral
and nonchiral Landau levels as a function of the magnetic field. We consider both the adiabatic and
the nonadiabatic phonon regimes, in the presence or in the absence of improper symmetries that relate
Weyl nodes of opposite chirality. We find that (i) the Cooper channel, often neglected in recent
studies, can prevent purely electronic instabilities while enabling lattice instabilities that
are not Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer-like; (ii) breaking the improper symmetry that relates the
two Weyl nodes suppresses the Cooper channel, thereby increasing the critical temperature for
the lattice instability; (iii) in the adiabatic phonon regime, lattice instabilities can preempt
purely electronic instabilities; (iv) pseudoscalar phonons are more prone to undergo a Peierls
instability than scalar phonons. In short, our study emphasizes the importance of taking electron-phonon
interactions into account for a complete understanding of interacting phases of matter in Dirac
and Weyl semimetals at high magnetic fields.

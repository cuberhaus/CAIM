In recent years, liquid metal dealloying (LMD) has emerged as a promising material processing method
to generate micro and nano-scale bicontinuous or porous structures. Most previous studies focused
on the experimental characterization of the dealloying process and on the properties of the dealloyed
materials, leaving the theoretical study incomplete to fully understand the fundamental mechanisms
of LMD. In this paper, we use theoretical models and phase-field simulations to clarify the kinetics
and pattern formation during LMD. Our study starts from a theoretical analysis of the 1D dissolution
of a binary precursor alloy, which reveals that the 1D dissolution process involves two regimes.
In the first regime, due to the low solubility of one of the elements in the melt, it accumulates at
the solid-liquid interface, which reduces the dissolution kinetics. In the second regime, the
interface kinetics reaches a stationary regime where both elements of the precursor alloy dissolve
into the melt. Previous works revealed that in the early dealloying stage, the dealloying front
is destabilized by an interfacial spinodal decomposition, which triggers the formation of interconnected
ligaments. We extend this line of work by proposing a linear stability analysis able to predict the
initial length-scale of the ligaments formed in the initial stage of the dealloying. Combining
this analysis with the 1D dissolution model proposed here enables us to better understand the initial
conditions (composition of the precursor alloy and the melt) leading to a planar dissolution without
interface destabilization. Finally, we report a strong influence of solid-state diffusion on
dealloying that was overlooked in previous studies. Although the solid-state diffusivity is four
to five orders of magnitude smaller than in the liquid phase, it is found to affect both dissolution
kinetics and ligament morphologies.

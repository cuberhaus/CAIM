Reversible logic has recently progressed in superconducting circuits and promises momentous
improvements in computing efficiency relative to irreversible logic developed by industry in
semiconductor circuits. Superconducting logic uses single flux quanta (SFQ) to represent bits,
and unlike their irreversible SFQ-logic relatives the bits may switch state with extremely low
dissipation. Here we propose and simulate ballistic shift registers (BSRs). These devices are
dramatically more energy-efficient and we show a reversible version of a pioneering shift register
developed before the advent of SFQ logic. The BSR is ballistic because no power is supplied to the
gate other than the input bits themselves; the result is conveyed as a slightly slower output bit.
The BSR uses an SFQ of either polarity for the stored bit as well as a ballistic fluxon. The BSR additionally
uses shunt capacitors and the nonlinearity of the ends of long Josephson junctions to support partial
fluxons and energy-conserving dynamics. The BSRs are multi-port and allow asynchronous bit arrival
-- important functionalities not available in previous reversible gates. During their interaction,
the stored and the moving bits swap their bit states, resulting in the shift-register operation.
We show that two BSRs can be put in sequence. In addition, we show that a BSR circuit with two inputs
and two outputs allows a bit state to be conveyed on different outputs. This constitutes the first
asynchronous ballistic 2-input gate. Finally, for a more intuitive understanding of the dynamics,
we introduce a collective coordinate model. It describes the 1-bit BSR dynamics with the motion
of two coordinates in a potential determined by the initial states of the input bit and the initial
stored SFQ. We discuss the potential for this SFQ logic type in the context of energy efficiency,
parameter margins, speed and combinational logic.

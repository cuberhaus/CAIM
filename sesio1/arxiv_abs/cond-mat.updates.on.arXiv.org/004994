Tens of Zr inter-atomic potentials (force fields) have been developed to enable atomic-scale simulations
of Zr alloys. These can provide critical insight in the in-reactor behaviour of nuclear fuel cladding
and structural components exposed, but the results are strongly sensitive to the choice of potential,
and to date there has been no consistent evaluation of these potentials. We provide a comprehensive
comparison of 13 popular Zr potentials, and assess their ability to reproduce key physical, mechanical,
structural and thermodynamic properties of Zr. We assess the lattice parameters, thermal expansion,
melting point, volume-energy response, allotropic phase stability, elastic properties, and
point defect energies, and compare them to experimental and ab-initio values. No potential was
found to outperform all others on all aspects, but for every metric considered here, at least one
potential was found to provide reliable results. Older embedded-atom method (EAM) potentials
tend to excel in 2-3 metrics each, but at the cost of poorer transferability. The two highest-performing
potentials overall, with complementary strengths and weaknesses, were the 2021 angular-dependent
potential of Smirnova and Starikov (Comp. Mater. Sci. 197, 110581) and the 2019 embedded-atom method
potential of Wimmer et al (J. Nucl. Mater. 532, 152055). All potentials trained through machine
learning algorithms proved to have lower overall accuracy, and less transferability, than simpler
and computationally faster potentials available. Point defect structures and energies is where
the greatest divergence and least accuracy is observed. We created maps that will help modellers
select the most suitable potential for a specific application, and which may help identify areas
of improvement in future potentials.

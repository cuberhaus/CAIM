The design of amorphous entangled systems, specifically from soft and active materials, has the
potential to open exciting new classes of active, shape-shifting, and task-capable 'smart' materials.
However, the global emergent mechanics that arises from the local interactions of individual particles
are not well understood. In this study, we examine the emergent properties of amorphous entangled
systems in three different examples: an in-silico "smarticle" collection, its robophysical chain,
and living entangled aggregate of worm blobs (L. variegatus). In simulations, we examine how material
properties change for a collective composed of dynamic three-link robots. We compare three methods
of controlling entanglement in a collective: externally oscillations, shape-changes, and internal
oscillations. We find that large-amplitude changes of the particle's shape using the shape-change
procedure produced the highest average number of entanglements, with respect to the aspect ratio
(l/w), improving the tensile strength of the collective. We demonstrate application of these simulations
in two experimental systems: robotic chains and entangled worm blobs. In the robophysical models,
we find emergent auxeticity behavior upon straining the confined collective. And finally, we show
how the individual worm activity in a blob can be controlled through the ambient dissolved oxygen
in water, leading to complex emergent properties of the living entangled collective, such as solid-like
entanglement and tumbling. Taken together, our work reveals principles by which future shape-modulating,
potentially soft robotic systems may dynamically alter their material properties, advancing
our understanding of living entangled materials, while inspiring new classes of synthetic emergent
super-materials.

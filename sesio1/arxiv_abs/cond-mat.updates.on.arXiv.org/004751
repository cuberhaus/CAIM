Two-dimensional (2D) magnet-superconductor hybrid systems are intensively studied due to their
potential for the realization of 2D topological superconductors with Majorana edge modes. It is
theoretically predicted that this quantum state is ubiquitous in spin-orbit coupled ferromagnetic
or skyrmionic 2D spin-lattices in proximity to an s-wave superconductor. However, recent examples
suggest that the requirements for topological superconductivity are complicated by the multi-orbital
nature of the magnetic components and disorder effects. Here, we investigate Fe monolayer islands
grown on a surface of the s-wave superconductor with the largest gap of all elemental superconductors,
Nb, with respect to magnetism and superconductivity using spin-resolved scanning tunneling spectrosopy.
We find three types of Fe monolayer islands which differ by their reconstruction inducing disorder,
the magnetism and the sub-gap electronic states. All three types are ferromagnetic with different
coercive fields indicating diverse exchange and anisotropy energies. On all three islands, there
is finite spectral weight throughout the substrate's energy gap at the expense of the coherence
peak intensity, indicating the formation of Shiba bands overlapping with the Fermi energy. The
gap filling and coherence peak reduction is strongest for the island with largest coercive field.
A strong lateral variation of the spectral weight of the Shiba bands signifies substantial disorder
on the order of the substrate's pairing energy with a length scale of the period of the three different
reconstructions. There are neither signs of topological gaps within these bands nor of any kind
of edge modes. Our work illustrates that a reconstructed growth mode of magnetic layers on superconducting
surfaces is detrimental for the formation of 2D topological superconductivity.

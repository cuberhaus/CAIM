The impact of dispersion relations, anisotropy, and Brillouin zone structure on intrinsic phonon
scattering rates has been assessed within the harmonic approximation-perturbation theory approach
for lattice dynamics. Anisotropic nonlinear elastic continuum has been considered with various
levels of representation of phonon dispersion and Brillouin zone shape, and with Gr\"uneisen parameter
used as an average measure of crystal anharmonicity. In addition, thermal conductivity prediction
of different models for the treatment of the off-diagonal elements of phonon collision operator
are compared. For a model system, argon, with a relatively high anisotropy ratio, the results show
that accounting for anisotropy is critical for accurate determination of available phase space
for 3-phonon scattering and scattering rates. Moreover, widely spread approximations such as
isotropic continuum and Single Mode Relaxation Time are found unreliable, even for cubic systems.
The success of these approximations is demonstrated to be a direct result of error cancellations.
By benchmarking against our iterative solution of Boltzmann Transport Equation, which achieves
excellent agreement with experimental thermal conductivity data for solid argon (2-80 K), we show
the essential importance of considering coupling terms of phonon scattering kernel at phonon mode
level, and not in a statistical average sense as, for example, Callaway model does. Moreover, our
results manifest the role played by coherent phonon scattering near the melting temperature, in
agreement with molecular dynamics findings, which serves as an evidence for the crossover between
heat diffusion mediated by particle-like phonons (incoherent scattering) and wave-like heat
propagation due to phonon coherent scattering. Furthermore, sensitivity of conductivity prediction
to phonon spectrum is revealed to change over temperature.

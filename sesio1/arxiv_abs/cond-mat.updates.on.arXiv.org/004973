The electronic structure of condensed matter can be significantly affected by the electron-phonon
interaction, leading to important phenomena such as electrical resistance, superconductivity
or the formation of polarons. This interaction is often neglected in band structure calculations
but can have a strong impact on band gaps or optical spectra. Commonly used frameworks for electron-phonon
energy corrections are the Allen-Heine-Cardona theory and the Fr\"ohlich model. While the latter
shows qualitative agreement with experiment for many polar materials, its simplicity should bring
hard limits to its applicability in real materials. Improvements can be made by introducing a generalized
version of the model, which considers anisotropic and degenerate electronic bands, and multiple
phonon branches. In this work, we search for trends and outliers on over a thousand materials in existing
databases of phonon and electron band structures. We use our results to identify the limits of applicability
of the standard Fr\"olich model by comparing to the generalized version, and by testing its basic
hypothesis of a large radius for the polaronic wavefunction and the corresponding atomic displacement
cloud. Among our extended set of materials, most exhibit large polaron behavior as well as validity
of the perturbative treatment. For the valence band, there is also a significant fraction of the
materials for which the perturbative treatment cannot be applied and/or for which the size of the
self-trapping region is close to the atomic repetition distance. We find a large variety of behaviors,
and employ much more accurate, fully ab initio Allen-Heine-Cardona calculations to understand
extreme cases, where the Fr\"ohlich model should fail and unusually large zero-point renormalization
energies occur.

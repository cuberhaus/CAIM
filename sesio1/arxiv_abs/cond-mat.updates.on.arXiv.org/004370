Both experimental and theoretical studies show non-trivial topological behaviour in native rocksalt
phase for SnS and SnSe and categorize these materials in topological crystalline insulators. Here,
the detailed electronic structures studies of SnS and SnSe in the rocksalt phase are carried out
using many-body $GW$ based theory and density functional theory both for ground states and temperature
dependent excited states. The estimated values of fundamental direct bandgaps around L-point
using $G_0W_0$ (mBJ) are $\sim$0.27 ($\sim$0.13) eV and $\sim$0.37 ($\sim$0.17) eV for SnS and
SnSe, respectively. The strength of hybridization between Sn 5$p$ and S 3$p$ (Se 4$p$) orbitals
for SnS (SnSe) shows strong k-dependence. The behaviour of $\overline{W}$ ($\omega$), which is
the averaged value of diagonal matrix elements of fully screened Coulomb interaction, suggests
to use full-$GW$ method for exploring the excited states because the correlation effects within
these two materials are relatively weak. The temperature dependent electronic structure calculations
for SnS and SnSe provide linearly decreasing behaviour of bandgaps with rise in temperatures. The
existence of collective excitation of quasiparticles in form of plasmon is predicted for these
compounds, where the estimated values of plasmon frequency are $\sim$9.5 eV and $\sim$9.3 eV for
SnS and SnSe, respectively. The imaginary part of self-energy and mass renormalization factor
($Z_\textbf{k}(\omega)$) due to electron-electron interaction (EEI) are also calculated along
W-L-$\Gamma$ direction for both the materials. The present comparative study reveals that the
behaviour of temperature dependent EEI for SnS and SnSe are the almost same and EEI is important for
high temperature transport properties.

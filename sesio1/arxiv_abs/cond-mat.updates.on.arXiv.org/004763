Laboratory studies of the radiation chemistry occurring in astrophysical ices have demonstrated
the dependence of this chemistry on a number of experimental parameters. One experimental parameter
which has received significantly less attention is that of the phase of the solid ice under investigation.
In this present study, we have performed systematic 2 keV electron irradiations of the amorphous
and crystalline phases of pure CH3OH and N2O astrophysical ice analogues. Radiation-induced decay
of these ices and the concomitant formation of products were monitored in situ using FT-IR spectroscopy.
A direct comparison between the irradiated amorphous and crystalline CH3OH ices revealed a more
rapid decay of the former compared to the latter. Interestingly, a significantly lesser difference
was observed when comparing the decay rates of the amorphous and crystalline N2O ices. These observations
have been rationalised in terms of the strength and extent of the intermolecular forces present
in each ice. The strong and extensive hydrogen-bonding network that exists in crystalline CH3OH
(but not in the amorphous phase) is suggested to significantly stabilise this phase against radiation-induced
decay. Conversely, although alignment of the dipole moment of N2O is anticipated to be more extensive
in the crystalline structure, its weak attractive potential does not significantly stabilise
the crystalline phase against radiation-induced decay, hence explaining the smaller difference
in decay rates between the amorphous and crystalline phases of N2O compared to those of CH3OH. Our
results are relevant to the astrochemistry of interstellar ices and icy Solar System objects, which
may experience phase changes due to thermally-induced crystallisation or space radiation-induced
amorphisation.

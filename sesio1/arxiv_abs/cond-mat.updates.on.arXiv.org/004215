Modern quantum platforms such as superconducting circuits provide exciting opportunities for
the experimental exploration of driven-dissipative many-body systems in unconventional regimes.
One of such regimes occurs in bosonic systems, where nowadays one can induce driving and dissipation
through pairs of excitations, rather than the conventional single-excitation processes. Moreover,
modern platforms can be driven in a way in which the modes of the bosonic array decay collectively
rather than locally, such that the pairs of excitations recorded by the environment come from a coherent
superposition of all sites. In this work we analyze the superfluid phases accessible to bosonic
arrays subject to these novel mechanisms more characteristic of quantum optics, which we prove
to lead to remarkable spatiotemporal properties beyond the traditional scope of pattern formation
in condensed-matter systems or nonlinear optics alone. We show that, even in the presence of residual
local loss, the system is stabilized into an exotic state with bosons condensed along the modes of
a closed manifold in Fourier space, with a distribution of the population among these Fourier modes
that can be controlled via a weak bias (linear) drive. This gives access to a plethora of different
patterns, ranging from periodic and quasi-periodic ones with tunable spatial wavelength, to homogeneously-populated
closed-Fourier-manifold condensates that are thought to play an important role in some open problems
of condensed-matter physics. Moreover, we show that when any residual local linear dissipation
is balanced with pumping, new constants of motion emerge that can force the superfluid to oscillate
in time, similarly to the mechanism behind the recently discovered superfluid time crystals. We
propose specific experimental implementations with which this rich and unusual spatiotemporal
superfluid behavior can be explored.

Water is essential for life and technological applications, mainly for its unique thermodynamic
and dynamic properties, often anomalous or counterintuitive. These anomalies result from the
hydrogen-bonds fluctuations, as evidenced by studies for supercooled water. However, it is difficult
to characterize these fluctuations under ambient conditions. Here, we fill this knowledge gap
thanks to the Car-Parrinello ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulation technique. We calculate
the local structural order parameter {\zeta}, quantifying the coordination shells separation,
and find two locally-favored structures or states: High-{\zeta} and Low-{\zeta}. On average,
High-{\zeta} molecules have a tetrahedral arrangement, with four hydrogen bonds, and the first
and the second coordination shell well separated. The Low-{\zeta} molecules are less connected,
partially merging the first and the second shells. The appearance of isosbestic points in the radial
distribution functions and the collective density fluctuations at different length scales and
timescales reveal that the two-state model, consistent with available experimental data for supercooled
water, also holds under ambient conditions, as we confirm by analyzing the vibrational spectrum
of both types of water molecules. Significant consequences of the structural differences between
the two states are that High-{\zeta} molecules have a dipole moment 6.5% higher than Low-{\zeta}.
At the same time, Low-{\zeta} structures are more disordered and with more significant angular
fluctuations. These differences are also reflected in the dynamics under ambient conditions.
The Low-{\zeta} molecules decorrelate their reorientation faster than High-{\zeta} and merge
their coordination shells within 0.2 ps, while the High-{\zeta} preserve the shell separation
for longer times.

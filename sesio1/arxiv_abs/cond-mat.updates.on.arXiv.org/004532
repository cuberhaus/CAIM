Shear banding is a fundamental non-equilibrium phenomenon in amorphous solids. Due to the intrinsic
entangling of three local atomic motions: shear, dilatation and rotation, the precise physical
process of shear band emergence is still an enigma. To unveil this mystery, we formulate for the first
time a theoretical protocol covering both affine and non-affine components of deformation, to
decode these highly entangled local atomic-scale events. In contrast to the broad concept of shear
transformation zone, plastic behavior can be demonstrated comprehensively as the operative manipulation
of more exact shear-dominated zones (SDZs), dilatation-dominated zones (DDZs) and rotation-dominated
zones (RDZs). Their spatiotemporal evolution exhibits a novel transition from synchronous motion
to separate distribution at the onset of shear band, which is in striking resemblance with the transition
from laminar flow to turbulent flow in flow dynamics. The hidden mechanism is revealed with the help
of extreme value theory (EVT) and percolation analysis. Analysis of EVT indicates dilatation is
the dominant mode at the embryo of initial plastic units. The percolation analysis points towards
the critical power-law scaling nature at the transition from stochastic activation to percolation
of plastic regions. Then the comprehensive pictures of shear banding emergence are uncovered.
Firstly, dilatation triggers initial shear and rotation in soft regions, leading to embryo of flow
units, which is followed by the inhomogeneous turbulent-like pattern manifesting as the secondary
activation of rotation in neighboring hard material. Such rotation activation contributes to
further perturbation, and ultimately, leads to shear band formation. Our findings also reinforce
that the discussion of plastic behavior in disordered materials must take into account both affine
and non-affine component deformation.

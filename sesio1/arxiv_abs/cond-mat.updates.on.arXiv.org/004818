In correlated electronic systems, strong interactions and the interplay between different degrees
of freedom may give rise to anomalous charge transport properties, which can be tuned by external
parameters like temperature and magnetic field. Recently, magnetic quantum oscillations and
metallic low-temperature thermal conductivity have been observed in the Kondo insulator YbB$_{12}$,
whose resistivity is a few orders of magnitude higher than those of conventional metals. As yet,
these unusual observations are not fully understood. Here we present a detailed investigation
of the behavior of YbB$_{12}$ under intense magnetic fields using both transport and torque magnetometry
measurements. A low-field Hall anomaly, reminiscent of the Hall response associated with "strange-metal"
physics, develops at $T < 1.5$ K. At two characteristic magnetic fields ($\mu_0H_1= 19.6$ T and $\mu_0H_2
\sim 31$ T), signatures appear in the Hall coefficient, magnetic torque, and magnetoresistance.
We suggest that they are likely to be field-induced Lifshitz transitions. Moreover, above 35 T,
the background resistivity displays an unusual, nonmetallic $T^{\alpha}$-behavior, with $\alpha$
being field-dependent and varying between -1.5 and -2. By normalizing the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillation
amplitude to this $T^{\alpha}$-dependence, the calculated cyclotron mass becomes more consistent
with that deduced from de Haas-van Alphen oscillations. Our results support a novel two-fluid scenario
in YbB$_{12}$: a Fermi-liquid-like fluid of charge-neutral quasiparticles coexists with charge
carriers that remain in a nonmetallic state. The former experience successive Lifshitz transitions
and develop Landau quantization in applied magnetic fields, whilst scattering between both fluids
allows the Shubnikov-de Haas effect to be observed in the electrical transport.

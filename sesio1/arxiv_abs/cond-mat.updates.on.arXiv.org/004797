Multiple-$Q$ magnetic orderings represent magnetic textures composed of superpositions of multiple
spin density waves or spin spirals, as represented by skyrmion crystals and hedgehog lattices.
Such magnetic orderings have been observed in various magnetic materials in recent years, and attracted
enormous attention, especially from the viewpoint of topology and emergent electromagnetic fields
originating from noncoplanar magnetic structures. Although they often exhibit successive phase
transitions among different multiple-$Q$ states while changing temperature and an external magnetic
field, it is not straightforward to elucidate the phase diagrams, mainly due to the lack of concise
theoretical tools as well as appropriate microscopic models. Here, we provide a theoretical framework
for a class of effective spin models with long-range magnetic interactions mediated by conduction
electrons in magnetic metals. Our framework is based on the steepest descent method with a set of
self-consistent equations that leads to exact solutions in the thermodynamic limit, and has many
advantages over existing methods such as biased variational calculations and numerical Monte
Carlo simulations. Applying the framework to the models with instabilities toward triple- and
hextuple-$Q$ magnetic orderings, we find that interesting reentrant phase transitions where
the multiple-$Q$ phases appear only at finite temperature and/or nonzero magnetic field. Furthermore,
we show that the multiple-$Q$ states can be topologically-nontrivial stacked skyrmion crystals
or hedgehog lattices, which exhibit large net spin scalar chirality associated with nonzero skyrmion
number. The results demonstrate that our framework could be a versatile tool for studying magnetic
and topological phase transitions and related quantum phenomena in actual magnetic metals hosting
multiple-$Q$ magnetic orderings.

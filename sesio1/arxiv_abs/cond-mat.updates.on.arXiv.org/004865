The paper considers the generalized Ising model in the $2\times2\times\infty$ strip with a Hamiltonian
invariant with respect to the central axis of rotation through the angle $\pi/2$, which includes
all possible multiplicative interactions of an even number of spins in the unit cube.The exact value
of free energy and heat capacity in the thermodynamic limit is found. For percolation invariant
with respect to rotation about the central axis of rotation through the angle $\pi/2$, a limit relation
for the non-percolation probability is derived. The solution was obtained by the transfer matrix
method. In the general case, finding the largest eigenvalue of a $16 \times 16$ transfer matrix reduces
to solving a quartic equation using the Ferrari method. In special cases, switching the transfer
matrix of models with auxiliary matrices made it possible to reduce the problem to quadratic and
linear equations. A separate chapter is devoted to the gonigendrial model in the $2\times2\times\infty$
strip, the exact values of the free energy and heat capacity in the thermodynamic limit are found
for the case of free boundary conditions and an analogue of cyclically closed boundary conditions
in both directions perpendicular to the central axis of rotation. The numerical solution for the
$3\times3\times\infty$ gonigendrial model in the case of free boundary conditions and in the case
of cyclic closure is compared with the corresponding analytical solutions in the volume $2\times2\times\infty$.
The closeness of free energy and heat capacity in the thermodynamic limit for the gonigendrial model
on the entire three-dimensional lattice and for the analog of cyclic closure in the $2\times2\times\infty$
strip is shown. The exact value of the free energy and heat capacity in the thermodynamic limit in
the $2\times2\times\infty$ strip is obtained for the Antiferromagnetic layered Ising model.

Almost every quantum system interacts with a large environment, so the exact quantum mechanical
description of its evolution is impossible. One has to resort to approximate description, usually
in the form of a master equation. There are at least two basic requirements for such a description:
first, it should preserve the positivity of probabilities; second, it should correctly describe
the equilibration process for systems coupled to a single thermal bath. Existing two widespread
descriptions of evolution fail to satisfy at least one of those conditions. The so-called Davies
master equation, while preserving the positivity of probabilities, fails to describe thermalization
properly. On the other hand, the Bloch-Redfield master equation violates the first condition,
but it correctly describes equilibration, at least for off-diagonal elements for several important
scenarios. However, is it possible to have a description of open system dynamics that would share
both features? In this paper, we partially resolve this problem in the weak-coupling limit: (i)
We provide a general form of the proper thermal equilibrium state (the so-called mean-force state)
for an arbitrary open system. (ii) We provide the solution for the steady-state coherences for a
whole class of master equations, and in particular, we show that the solution coincides with the
mean-force Hamiltonian for the Bloch-Redfield equation. (iii) We consider the cumulant equation,
which is explicitly completely positive, and we show that its steady-state coherences are the same
as one of the Bloch-Redfield dynamics (and the mean-force state accordingly). (iv) We solve the
correction to the diagonal part of the stationary state for a two-level system both for the Bloch-Redfield
and cumulant equation, showing that the solution of the cumulant is very close to the mean-force
state, whereas the Bloch-Redfield differs significantly.

We employ charge-stabilized colloidal suspensions to investigate the nonlinear rheology of supercooled
liquids with soft-repulsive potentials. With the results from BD simulations, we find that the
prominent shear thinning of viscosity (eta) at large enough shear rates (sr), expressed as eta~sr^(-lambda),
can be understood by introducing the concept of localized elastic region (LER). An LER is a transient
region composed of the first several coordination shells of a reference particle. In response to
the external shear, particles within LER undergo nearly affine displacement before the yielding
of LER. The elastic coherency of the particle motion decreases as the distance from the reference
particle (r) increases, and becomes negligible if r is larger than a length scale (xi), which defines
the spatial range of the localized elastic response. The characteristic strain (gamma) and size
(xi) of LER respectively depend on the shear rate by gamma~sr^epsilon and xi~sr^(-nu). Three exponents
are related by lambda=1-epsilon=4*nu based on the "solidity" picture of supercooled liquids.
This relation connects the bulk nonlinear rheology, the elastic properties, and the microscopic
structural distortion of the system. The relaxation of the LER is mainly promoted by the large-step
nonaffine particle displacement along the extensional direction of the shear geometry. The step
length is about 0.4 particle diameter. The elastic deformation and the relaxation of the LER are
ubiquitous in the flow, which can be considered as the microscopic source of the bulk nonlinear viscoelasticity.
We also performed Rheo-Small Angle Neutron Scattering experiments on charge-stabilized colloidal
suspensions under steady shear. The experimental result proves that the local elasticity plays
a dominant role in the shear thinning. Moreover, we find the clue of the shrinkage of the LER with shear
rate.

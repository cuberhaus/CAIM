We review the screening nature and many-body physics foundation of the van der Waals density functional
(vdW-DF) method, a systematic approach to construct truly nonlocal exchange-correlation energy
density functionals. To that end we define and focus on a class of consistent vdW-DF versions that
adhere to the Lindhard screening logic of the full method formulation. The consistent-exchange
vdW-DF-cx version and its spin extension represent the first examples of this class; In general,
consistent vdW-DFs reflect a concerted expansion of a formal recast of the adiabatic-connection
formula, an exponential summation of contributions to the local-field response, and the Dyson
equation. We argue that the screening emphasis is essential because the exchange-correlation
energy reflects an effective electrodynamics set by a long-range interaction. Two consequences
are that 1) there are, in principle, no wiggle room in how one balances exchange and correlation,
for example, in vdW-DF-cx, and that 2) consistent vdW-DFs have a formal structure that allows them
to incorporate vertex-correction effects, at least in the case of levels that experience recoil-less
interactions (for example, near the Fermi surface). We explore the extent to which the strictly
nonempirical vdW-DF-cx formulation can serve as a systematic extension of the constraint-based
semilocal functionals. For validation, we provide a complete survey of vdW-DF-cx performance
for broad molecular processes and comparing to the quantum-chemistry calculations that are summarized
in that paper. We also provide new vdW-DF-cx results for metal surface energies and work functions
that we compare to experiment. Finally, we use the screening insight to separate the vdW-DF nonlocal-correlation
term and present tools to compute and map the binding signatures.

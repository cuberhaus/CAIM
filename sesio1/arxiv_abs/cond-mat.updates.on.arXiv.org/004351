We study the ground state of $N \gg 1$ noninteracting fermions in a two-dimensional harmonic trap
rotating at angular frequency $\Omega>0$. The support of the density of the Fermi gas is a disk of
radius $R_e$. We calculate the variance of the number of fermions ${\cal N}_R$ inside a disk of radius
$R$ centered at the origin for $R$ in the bulk of the Fermi gas. We find rich and interesting behaviours
in two different scaling regimes: (i) $\Omega / \omega <1 $ and (ii) $1 - \Omega / \omega = O(1/N)$,
where $\omega$ is the angular frequency of the oscillator. In the first regime (i) we find that ${\rm
Var}\,{\cal N}_{R}\simeq\left(A\log N+B\right)\sqrt{N}$ and we calculate $A$ and $B$ as functions
of $R/R_e$, $\Omega$ and $\omega$. We also predict the higher cumulants of ${\cal N}_{R}$ and the
bipartite entanglement entropy of the disk with the rest of the system. In the second regime (ii),
the mean fermion density exhibits a staircase form, with discrete plateaus corresponding to filling
$k$ successive Landau levels, as found in previous studies. Here, we show that ${\rm Var}\,{\cal
N}_{R}$ is a discontinuous piecewise linear function of $\sim (R/R_e) \sqrt{N}$ within each plateau,
with coefficients that we calculate exactly, and with steps whose precise shape we obtain for any
$k$. We argue that a similar piecewise linear behavior extends to all the cumulants of ${\cal N}_{R}$
and to the entanglement entropy. We show that these results match smoothly at large $k$ with the above
results for $\Omega/\omega=O(1)$. These findings are nicely confirmed by numerical simulations.
Finally, we uncover a universal behavior of ${\rm Var}\,{\cal N}_{R}$ near the fermionic edge.
We extend our results to a three-dimensional geometry, where an additional confining potential
is applied in the $z$ direction.

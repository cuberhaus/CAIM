State-of-the-art metal halide perovskite-based photovoltaics often employ organic ammonium
salts, AX, as a surface passivator, where A is a large organic cation and X is a halide. These surface
treatments passivate the perovskite by forming layered perovskites (e.g., A2PbX4) or by AX itself
serving as a surface passivation agent on the perovskite photoactive film. It remains unclear whether
layered perovskites or AX is the ideal passivator due to an incomplete understanding of the interfacial
impact and resulting photoexcited carrier dynamics of AX treatment. In the present study, we use
TRPL measurements to selectively probe the different interfaces of glass/perovskite/AX to demonstrate
the vastly distinct interfacial photoexcited state dynamics with the presence of A2PbX4 or AX.
Coupling the TRPL results with X-ray diffraction and nanoscale microscopy measurements, we find
that the presence of AX not only passivates the traps at the surface and the grain boundaries, but
also induces an {\alpha}/{\delta}-FAPbI3 phase mixing that alters the carrier dynamics near the
glass/perovskite interface and enhances the photoluminescence quantum yield. In contrast, the
passivation with A2PbI4 is mostly localized to the surface and grain boundaries near the top surface
where the availability of PbI2 directly determines the formation of A2PbI4. Such distinct mechanisms
significantly impact the corresponding solar cell performance, and we find AX passivation that
has not been converted to a layered perovskite allows for a much larger processing window (e.g.,
larger allowed variance of AX concentration which is critical for improving the eventual manufacturing
yield) and more reproducible condition to realize device performance improvements, while A2PbI4
as a passivator yields a much narrower processing window. We expect these results to enable a more
rational route for developing AX for perovskite.

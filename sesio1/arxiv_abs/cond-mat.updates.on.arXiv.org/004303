We explore the generic long wavelength properties of a collection of nearly phase ordered diffusively
mobile active XY spins with number conservation, which rotate actively in response to the local
density fluctuations and local phase differences, on a solid substrate. We investigate this system
by constructing and studying the hydrodynamic theory of the system which shows that this model,
when stable, belongs to a new universality class, hitherto unstudied: As a consequence of the interplay
between the mobility and number conservation of the XY spins, such a system can be stable over a wide
range of the model parameters characterized by a novel correspondence between the phase and density
fluctuations. In different regions of the phase space where the phase-ordered system is stable,
it shows phase ordering which is generically either logarithmically stronger than the conventional
quasi long range order (QLRO) in its equilibrium limit, together with miniscule number fluctuations,
or logarithmically weaker than QLRO along with giant number fluctuations, showing a novel one-to-one
correspondence between phase ordering and density fluctuations in the ordered states. These are
characterized by the breakdown of conventional dynamic scaling by logarithmic modulations. The
hydrodynamic theory further predicts that for other parameter regimes, the system becomes unstable
either due to linear instability of the uniform states, or purely nonlinear effects. We also construct
an equivalent agent-based lattice-gas model, which validates the hydrodynamic predictions on
phase ordering and density fluctuations in the ordered states. The lattice-gas model further reveals
the existence of two distinct types of disordered steady states of the system, characterized by
the presence or absence of stable clusters of finite sizes.

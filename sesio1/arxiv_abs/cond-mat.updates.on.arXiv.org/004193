The material $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, with a two-dimensional Ru-honeycomb sublattice, has attracted
considerable attention because it may be a realization of the Kitaev quantum spin liquid (QSL).
Recently, a new honeycomb material, $\alpha$-RuI$_3$, was prepared under moderate high-pressure
and it is stable under ambient conditions. However, different from $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, $\alpha$-RuI$_3$
was reported to be a paramagnetic metal without long-range magnetic order down to $0.35$ K. Here,
the structural and electronic properties of the quasi-two-dimensional $\alpha$-RuI$_3$ are
theoretically studied. First, based on first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations,
the ABC stacking honeycomb-layer $R\overline{3}$ (No. 148) structure is found to be the most likely
stacking order for $\alpha$-RuI$_3$ along the $c$-axis. Furthermore, both $R\overline{3}$ and
$P\overline{3}1c$ are dynamically stable because no imaginary frequency modes were obtained
in the phononic dispersion spectrum. Moreover, the different physical behavior of $\alpha$-RuI$_3$
compared to $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ can be understood naturally. The strong hybridization between
Ru $4d$ and I $5p$ orbitals decreases the effective atomic Hubbard repulsion $U$, leading the electrons
of RuI$_3$ to be less localized than in RuCl$_3$. As a consequence, the effective repulsion $U$ is
reduced from Cl to I, leading to the metallic nature of $\alpha$-RuI$_3$. Based on the DFT+$U$ ($U_{\rm
eff} = 2$ eV), plus spin-orbital coupling (SOC), we obtained a spin-orbit Mott insulating behavior
for $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ and, by the same procedure, a metallic behavior for $\alpha$-RuI$_3$, in
good agreement with experimental results. Furthermore, when introducing a large (unrealistic)
$U_{\rm eff} = 6$ eV, the spin-orbit Mott gap opens in $\alpha$-RuI$_3$ as well, supporting the physical
picture we are proposing.

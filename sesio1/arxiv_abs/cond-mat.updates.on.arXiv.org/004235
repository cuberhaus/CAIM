The emergence of alternating twist multilayer graphene (ATMG) as a generalization of twisted bilayer
graphene (TBG) raises the question - in what important ways do these systems differ? Here, we utilize
ab-initio relaxation and single-particle theory, analytical strong coupling analysis, and Hartree-Fock
to contrast ATMG with $n=3,4,5,\ldots$ layers and TBG. $\textbf{I}$: We show how external fields
enter in the decomposition of ATMG into TBG and graphene subsystems. The parallel magnetic field
has little effect for $n$ odd due to mirror symmetry, but surprisingly also for any $n > 2$ if we are
are the largest magic angle. $\textbf{II}$: We compute the relaxation of the multilayers leading
to effective parameters for each TBG subsystem. We find that the second magic angle for $n=5$, $\theta
= 1.14$ is closest to the "chiral" model and thus may be an optimal host for fractional Chern insulators.
$\textbf{III}$: We integrate out non-magic subsystems and reduce ATMG to its magic angle TBG subsystem
with a screened interaction. $\textbf{IV}$: We perform an analytic strong coupling analysis of
the external fields and corroborate it with Hartree-Fock. An in-plane magnetic field in TBG drives
a transition to a valley Hall state or a gapless "magnetic semimetal." A displacement field $V$ has
little effect on TBG, but induces a gapped phase in ATMG for small $V$ for $n = 4$ and above a critical
$V$ for $n = 3$. For $n\geq 3$, we find the superexchange coupling - believed to set the scale of superconductivity
in the skyrmion mechanism - increases with $V$ at angles near and below the magic angle. $\textbf{V}$:
We complement our strong coupling approach with a weak coupling theory of ATMG pair-breaking. While
for $n=2$ orbital effects of the in-plane magnetic field can give a critical field of the same order
as the Pauli field, for $n>2$ we expect the critical field to exceed the Pauli limit.

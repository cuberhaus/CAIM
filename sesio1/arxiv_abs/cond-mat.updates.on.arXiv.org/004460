The anisotropic shape of calamitic LC particles results in distinct energy values when nematogens
are placed side-by-side or end-to-end. The energy anisotropy governed by parameter K' has deep
consequences on equilibrium & non-equilibrium properties. Using GB model, which shows Nm & low
temperature Sm order, we undertake large-scale MC & MD simulations to probe effect of K' on the equilibrium
phase diagram & the non-equilibrium domain growth following a quench in the temperature T (coarsening).
There are 2 transitions in the model, I->Nm at Tc1 & Nm->Sm at Tc2<Tc1. K' decreases Tc1 significantly,
but has relatively little effect on Tc2. Domain growth in Nm phase exhibits the well-known LAC law,
L(t)~t^0.5 & evolution is via annihilation of string defects. The system exhibits dynamical scaling
that is also robust with respect to K'. We find that Sm phase at quench temperatures T (T>Tc1->T<Tc2)
that we consider has SmB order with a hexatic arrangement of the LC molecules in the layers. Coarsening
in this phase exhibits a striking two-time-scale scenario: first the LC molecules align & develop
orientational order, followed by emergence of characteristic layering along with the hexatic
bond-orientational-order within layers. Consequently, the growth follows the LAC law L(t)~t^0.5
at early times & then shows a sharp crossover to a slower growth regime at later times. Our observations
strongly suggest L(t)~t^0.25 in this regime. Interestingly, the correlation function shows dynamical
scaling in both the regimes & the scaling function is universal. The dynamics is also robust with
respect to changes in K', but the smecticity is more pronounced at larger values. Further, the early-time
dynamics is governed by string defects, while the late-time evolution is dictated by interfacial
defects. We believe this scenario is generic to Sm phase even with other kinds of local order within
Sm layers.

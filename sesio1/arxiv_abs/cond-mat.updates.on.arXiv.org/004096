Finding out how symmetry encodes optical polarization information into the selection rule in molecules
and materials is important for their optoelectronic applications including spectroscopic analysis,
display technology and quantum computation. Here, we extend the polarization-dependent selection
rules from atoms to solid systems with point group descriptions via rotational operator for circular
polarization and $2$-fold rotational operator (or reflection operator) for linear polarization.
As a variant of graphene quantum dot (GQD), twisted bilayer graphene quantum dot (TBGQD) certainly
inherits GQD's advantages including ultrathin thickness, excellent biocompatibility and shape-
and size-tunable optical absorption/emission. We then naturally ask how the electronic structures
and optical properties of TBGQDs rely on size, shape, twist angle and correlation effects. We build
plentiful types of TBGQDs with $10$ point groups and obtain the optical selection rule database
for all types, where the current operator matrix elements identify the generalized polarization-dependent
selection rules. Our results show that both of the electronic and optical band gaps follow power-law
scalings and the twist angle has the dominant role in modifying the size scaling. We map an atlas of
optical conductivity spectra for both size and twist angle in TBGQDs. As a result of quantum confinement
effect of finite size, in the atlas a new type of optical conductivity peaks absent in twisted bilayer
graphene bulk is predicted theoretically with multiple discrete absorption frequencies from
infrared to ultraviolet light, enabling applications on photovoltaic devices and photodetectors.
The atlas and size scaling provide a full structure/symmetry-function interrelation and hence
offers an excellent geometrical manipulation of optical properties of TBGQD as a building block
in integrated carbon optoelectronics.

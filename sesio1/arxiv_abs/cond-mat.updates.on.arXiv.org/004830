The mechanical behavior of two nanocrystalline Al alloys, Al-Mg-Y and Al-Fe-Y, is investigated
with in-situ micropillar compression testing. Both alloys were strengthened by a hierarchical
microstructure including grain boundary segregation, nanometer-thick amorphous complexions,
carbide nanorod precipitates with sizes of a few nanometers, and submicron-scale intermetallic
particles. The maximum yield strength of the Al-Mg-Y system is measured to be 950 MPa, exceeding
that of the Al-Fe-Y system (680 MPa), primarily due to a combination of more carbide nanorods and
more amorphous complexions. Both alloys exhibited yield strengths much higher than those of commercial
Al alloys, and therefore have great potential for structural applications. However, some micropillar
specimens were observed to plastically soften through shear banding. Post-mortem investigation
revealed that intermetallic-free deformation pathways of a few micrometers in length were responsible
for this failure. Further characterization showed significant grain growth within the shear band.
The coarsened grains maintained the same orientation with each other, pointing to grain boundary
mechanisms for plastic flow, specifically grain rotation and/or grain boundary migration. The
presence of intermetallic particles makes it difficult for both matrix and intermetallic grains
to rotate into the same orientation due to the different lattice parameters and slip systems. Therefore,
we are able to conclude that a uniform distribution of intermetallic particles with an average spacing
less than the percolation length of shear localization can effectively prevent the maturation
of shear bands, offering a design strategy for high-strength nanocrystalline Al alloys with both
high strength and stable plastic flow.

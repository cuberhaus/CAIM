The Spectral Form Factor (SFF) is a convenient tool for the characterization of eigenvalue statistics
of systems with discrete spectra, and thus serves as a proxy for quantum chaoticity. This work presents
an analytical calculation of the SFF of the Chern-Simons Matrix Model (CSMM), which was first introduced
to describe the intermediate level statistics of disordered electrons at the mobility edge. The
CSMM is characterized by a parameter $ 0 \leq q\leq 1$, where the Circular Unitary Ensemble (CUE)
is recovered for $q\to 0$. The CSMM was later found as a matrix model description of $U(N)$ Chern-Simons
theory on $S^3$, which is dual to a topological string theory characterized by string coupling $g_s=-\log
q$. The spectral form factor is proportional to a colored HOMFLY invariant of a $(2n,2)$-torus link
with its two components carrying the fundamental and antifundamental representations, respectively.
We check that taking $N \to \infty$ whilst keeping $q<1$ reduces the connected SFF to an exact linear
ramp of unit slope, confirming the main result from arXiv:2012.11703 for the specific case of the
CSMM. We then consider the `t Hooft limit, where $N \to \infty$ and $q \to 1^-$ such that $y = q^N $ remains
finite. As we take $q\to 1^-$, this constitutes the opposite extreme of the CUE limit. In the `t Hooft
limit, the connected SFF turns into a remarkable sequence of polynomials which, as far as the authors
are aware, have not appeared in the literature thus far. A gap opens in the spectrum and, after unfolding
by a constant rescaling, the connected SFF approximates a linear ramp of unit slope for all $y$ except
$y \approx 1$, where the connected SFF goes to zero. We thus find that, although the CSMM was introduced
to describe intermediate statistics and the `t Hooft limit is the opposite limit of the CUE, we still
recover Wigner-Dyson universality for all $y$ except $y\approx 1$.

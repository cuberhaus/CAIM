Ferromagnetic spin valves offer the key building blocks to integrate giant- and tunneling-magnetoresistance
effects into spintronics devices. Starting from a generalized Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk approach,
we theoretically investigate the impact of interfacial Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings
on the tunneling conductance, and thereby the magnetoresistance characteristics, of ferromagnet/superconductor/ferromagnet
spin-valve junctions embedding thin superconducting spacers between the either parallel or antiparallel
magnetized ferromagnets. We focus on the unique interplay between usual electron tunnelings-that
fully determine the magnetoresistance in the normal-conducting state-and the peculiar Andreev
reflections in the superconducting state. In the presence of interfacial spin-orbit couplings,
special attention needs to be paid to the spin-flip ("unconventional") Andreev-reflection process
that is expected to induce superconducting triplet correlations in proximitized regions. As a
transport signature of these triplet pairings, we detect conductance double peaks around the singlet-gap
energy, reflecting the competition between the singlet and an additionally emerging triplet gap;
the latter is an effective superconducting gap that can be ascribed to the formation of triplet Cooper
pairs through interfacial spin-flip scatterings (i.e., to the generation of an effective triplet-pairing
term in the order parameter). We thoroughly analyze the Andreev reflections' role in connection
with superconducting magnetoresistance phenomena, and eventually unravel huge conductance
and magnetoresistance magnetoanisotropies-easily exceeding their normal-state counterparts
by several orders of magnitude-as another experimentally accessible fingerprint of unconventional
Andreev reflections.

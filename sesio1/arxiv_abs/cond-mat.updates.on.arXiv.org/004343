In this contribution, cylindrical samples consisting of monodisperse soft (rubber) and stiff
(glass) particles are pre-stressed under uniaxial compression. Acoustic P-waves at ultrasound
frequencies are superimposed into prepared samples with different soft-stiff volume fractions.
Earlier investigations showed the importance of particles networks, i.e. force chains, in controlling
the effective mechanical properties of particulate systems. Measured P-wave modulus showed a
significant decline while more soft particles are added due to a change in microstructure. However,
for small contents of soft particles, it could be observed that the P-wave modulus is increasing.
For the understanding of such kinds of effects, detailed insight into the microstructure of the
system is required. To gain this information and link it to the effective properties, we made use
of high-resolution micro X-ray Computed Tomography (micro-XRCT) imaging and combined it with
the classical stiffness characterization. Both performed in situ meaning inside the laboratory-based
XRCT scanner. With micro-XRCT imaging, the granular microstructure can be visualized in 3d and
characterized subsequently. By post-processing of the data, the individual grains of the particulate
systems could be uniquely identified. Finally, the contact network of the packings which connects
the center of particles was established to demonstrate the network transition from stiff- to soft-dominated
regimes. This has allowed for unprecedented observations and a renewed understanding of particulate
systems. It has been demonstrated that micro-XRCT scans of particles packings can be analyzed and
compared in 3d to gain extensive information on the scale of the single particles. Here, the in situ
setup and workflow from the start of acquiring images in situ till the post-processing of the image
data is explained and demonstrated by selected results.

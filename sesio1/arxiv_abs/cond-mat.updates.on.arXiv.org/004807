We have witnessed a wide range of theoretical as well as experimental investigations to envisage
external stimuli induced changes in electronic, optical, and magnetic properties in the metal
organic complexes, while hybrid perovskites have recently joined this exciting league of explorations.
The flexible organic linkers in such complexes are ideal for triggering not only spin transitions
but also a plethora of different responses under the influence of external stimuli like pressure,
temperature, and light. A diverse range of applications particularly in the field of optoelectronics,
spintronics, and energy scavenging have been manifested. Hysteresis associated with light induced
transitions and spin-crossover governed by pressure and temperature are promising phenomena
for the design principles behind memory devices and optical switches. Pressure induced optical
properties tuning or piezochromism has also emerged as one of the prominent areas in the field of
hybrid perovskites. It is thus imperative to have a clear understanding of how the tuning in electronic,
optical, and magnetic properties occur under various stimuli. Selectivity of the stimulus could
be influential behind the maximum efficiency in the field of energy and optoelectronic research
to determine in what future directions this field could be driven from the perspective of futuristic
material properties. This review though primarily focuses on the theoretical aspects of understanding
the different mechanisms of the phenomena, does provide a unique overview of the experimental literature
too, such that relevant device applications can be considered through a future roadmap of tuning
paradigm of external stimuli. It also provides an insight as to how energy and memory storage may
be combined by using the principles of spin transition in metal organic complexes.

We present a path integral formalism for the intrinsic quantum dynamics of magnetic skyrmions coupled
to a thermal background of magnetic fluctuations. Upon promoting the skyrmion's collective coordinate
$\boldsymbol{R}$ to a dynamic variable and integrating out the magnonic heat bath, we derive the
generalized equation of motion for $\boldsymbol{R}$ with a non-local damping term that describes
a steady-state skyrmion dynamics at finite temperatures. Being essentially temperature dependent,
the intrinsic damping is shown to originate from the coupling of thermally activated magnon modes
to the adiabatic potential driven by a rigid skyrmion motion, which can be regarded as another manifestation
of emergent electrodynamics inherent to topological magnetic textures. We further argue that
the diagonal components of the damping term act as the source of dissipation and inertia, while its
off-diagonal components modify the gyrotropic motion of a magnetic skyrmion. By means of numerical
calculations for the lattice spin model of chiral ferromagnets, we study the temperature behavior
of the intrinsic damping as a function of magnetic field in periodic and confined geometries. The
intrinsic damping is demonstrated to be highly non-local, revealing its quantum-mechanical nature,
that becomes more pronounced with increasing temperature. At high temperatures when the magnon
occupation factors are large, the intrinsic damping is shown to yield a modified Thiele's equation
with the additional non-local dissipative and mass terms that exhibit an almost linear temperature
behavior. Our results provide a microscopic background for semiclassical magnetization dynamics
and establish a framework for understanding spin caloritronics effects in topological magnetic
textures.

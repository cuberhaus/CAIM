Controlling the flow of broadband electromagnetic energy at the nanoscale remains a critical challenge
in optoelectronics. Surface plasmon polaritons (or plasmons) provide subwavelength localization
of light, but are affected by significant losses. On the contrary, dielectrics lack a sufficiently
robust response in the visible to trap photons similar to metallic structures. Overcoming these
limitations appears elusive, as it implies devising a path to circumvent causality in the quantum-mechanical
form of matter. Here we demonstrate that addressing this problem is possible if we employ a novel
approach based on suitably deformed reflective metaphotonic structures. The complex geometrical
shape engineered in these reflectors emulates nondispersive index responses, which can be inverse-designed
following arbitrary form factors. We discuss the realization of essential components such as resonators
with an ultra-high refractive index of $n=100$ in diverse profiles. These structures support localization
of light in the form of bound states in the continuum (BIC), fully localized in air, in a platform in
which all refractive index regions are physically accessible. We discuss our approach to sensing
applications, designing a class of sensors where the analyte directly contacts areas of ultra-high
refractive index. Leveraging this feature, we report differential sensitivities up to $350$~nm/RIU
in structures with footprints of approximately one micron. These performances are two times better
than the closest competitor with a similar form factor. Inversely designed reflective metaphotonics
offers a flexible technology for controlling broadband light, supporting optoelectronics' integration
with large bandwidths in circuitry with miniaturized footprints.

The inference of thermodynamic quantities from the description of an only partially accessible
physical system is a central challenge in stochastic thermodynamics. A common approach is coarse-graining,
which maps the dynamics of such a system to a reduced effective one. While coarse-graining states
of the system into compound ones is a well studied concept, recent evidence hints at a complementary
description by considering observable transitions and waiting times. In this work, we consider
waiting time distributions between two consecutive transitions of a partially observable Markov
network. We formulate an entropy estimator using their ratios to quantify irreversibility. Depending
on the complexity of the underlying network, we formulate criteria to infer whether the entropy
estimator recovers the full physical entropy production or whether it just provides a lower bound
that improves on established results. This conceptual approach, which is based on the irreversibility
of underlying cycles, additionally enables us to derive estimators for the topology of the network,
i.e., the presence of a hidden cycle, its number of states and its driving affinity. Adopting an equivalent
semi-Markov description, our results can be condensed into a fluctuation theorem for the corresponding
semi-Markov process. This mathematical perspective provides a unifying framework for the entropy
estimators considered here and established earlier ones. The crucial role of the correct version
of time-reversal helps to clarify a recent debate on the meaning of formal versus physical irreversibility.
Extensive numerical calculations based on a direct evaluation of waiting-time distributions
illustrate our exact results and provide an estimate on the quality of the bounds for affinities
of hidden cycles.

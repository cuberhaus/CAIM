This paper is concerned with the physics of parametrized gapped quantum many-body systems, which
can be viewed as a generalization of conventional topological phases of matter. In such systems,
rather than considering a single Hamiltonian, one considers a family of Hamiltonians that depend
continuously on some parameters. After discussing the notion of phases of parametrized systems,
we formulate a bulk-boundary correspondence for an important bulk quantity, the Kapustin-Spodyneiko
higher Berry curvature, first in one spatial dimension and then in arbitrary dimension. This clarifies
the physical interpretation of the higher Berry curvature, which in one spatial dimension is a flow
of (ordinary) Berry curvature. In d dimensions, the higher Berry curvature is a flow of (d-1)-dimensional
higher Berry curvature. Based on this, we discuss one-dimensional systems that pump Chern number
to/from spatial boundaries, resulting in anomalous boundary modes featuring isolated Weyl points.
In higher dimensions, there are pumps of the analogous quantized invariants obtained by integrating
the higher Berry curvature. We also discuss the consequences for parametrized systems of Kitaev's
proposal that invertible phases are classified by a generalized cohomology theory, and emphasize
the role of the suspension isomorphism in generating new examples of parametrized systems from
known invertible phases. Finally, we present a pair of general quantum pumping constructions,
based on physical pictures introduced by Kitaev, which take as input a d-dimensional parametrized
system, and produce new (d+1)-dimensional parametrized systems. These constructions are useful
for generating examples, and we conjecture that one of the constructions realizes the suspension
isomorphism in a generalized cohomology theory of invertible phases.

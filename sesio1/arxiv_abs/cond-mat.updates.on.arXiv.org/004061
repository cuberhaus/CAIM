The great tunability of the properties of halide perovskites presents new opportunities for optoelectronic
applications as well as significant challenges associated with exploring combinatorial chemical
spaces. In this work, we develop a framework powered by high-throughput computations and machine
learning for the design and prediction of mixed cation halide perovskite alloys. In a chemical space
of ABX$_{3}$ perovskites with a selected set of options for A, B, and X atoms, pseudo-cubic structures
of compounds with B-site mixing are simulated using density functional theory (DFT) and several
properties are computed, including stability, lattice constant, band gap, vacancy formation
energy, refractive index, and optical absorption spectrum, using both semi-local and hybrid functionals.
Neural networks (NN) are used to train predictive models for every property using tabulated elemental
properties of A, B, and X site atoms as descriptors. Starting from the DFT dataset of 229 points, we
use the trained NN models to predict the structural, energetic, electronic and optical properties
of a complete dataset of 17,955 compounds, and perform high-throughput screening in terms of stability,
band gap and defect tolerance, to obtain 574 promising compounds that are ranked as potential absorbers
according to their photovoltaic figure of merit. Compositional trends in the screened set of attractive
mixed cation halide perovskites are revealed and additional computations are performed on selected
compounds. The data-driven design framework developed here is promising for designing novel mixed
compositions and can be extended to a wider perovskite chemical space in terms of A, B, and X atoms,
different kinds of mixing at the A, B, or X sites, non-cubic phases, and other properties of interest.

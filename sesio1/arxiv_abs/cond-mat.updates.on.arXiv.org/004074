Machine learning has the potential to revolutionize the field of molecular simulation through
the development of efficient and accurate models of interatomic interactions. In particular,
neural network models can describe interactions at the level of accuracy of quantum mechanics-based
calculations, but with a fraction of the cost, enabling the simulation of large systems over long
timescales with ab initio accuracy. However, implicit in the construction of neural network potentials
is an assumption of locality, wherein atomic arrangements on the scale of about a nanometer are used
to learn interatomic interactions. Because of this assumption, the resulting neural network models
cannot describe long-range interactions that play critical roles in dielectric screening and
chemical reactivity. To address this issue, we introduce the self-consistent field neural network
(SCFNN) model -- a general approach for learning the long-range response of molecular systems in
neural network potentials. The SCFNN model relies on a physically meaningful separation of the
interatomic interactions into short- and long-range components, with a separate network to handle
each component. We demonstrate the success of the SCFNN approach in modeling the dielectric properties
of bulk liquid water, and show that the SCFNN model accurately predicts long-range polarization
correlations and the response of water to applied electrostatic fields. Importantly, because
of the separation of interactions inherent in our approach, the SCFNN model can be combined with
many existing approaches for building neural network potentials. Therefore, we expect the SCFNN
model to facilitate the proper description of long-range interactions in a wide-variety of machine
learning-based force fields.

By using the gauge-invariant kinetic equation approach [Yang and Wu, Phys. Rev. B {\bf 98}, 094507
(2018); {\bf 100}, 104513 (2019)], we construct the coupled dual dynamics of macroscopic phase
coherence and microscopic electronic fluids in cuprate superconductors. We prove that the developed
dual dynamics provides an efficient and simplified approach to formulate the dephasing process
of macroscopic superconducting phase coherence with the increase of temperature, as well as its
influence on the characters of microscopic electronic fluids (including gap, densities of superfluid
and normal fluid, and in particular, the transport property to determine superconducting transition
temperature $T_c$). Based on this dual dynamics, we present theoretical description of the preformed
Cooper pairs in pseudogap state. The key origin of pseudogap state comes from the disorder effect,
which excites the inhomogeneous quantum phase fluctuation through Josephson effect. Specifically,
we show that in cuprate superconductors, influenced by phase fluctuation, there also exist normal
fluid and viscous superfluid below $T_c$, in addition to conventional non-viscous superfluid.
The normal fluid always emerges around nodal points even at zero temperature, whereas the viscous
superfluid emerges due to the friction between superfluid and normal fluid. Particularly, the
non-viscous superfluid gets suppressed when phase fluctuation is enhanced by increasing temperature
to weaken phase stiffness, until vanishes at $T_c$ with significant phase fluctuation. Then, the
system enters the pseudogap state, showing the nonzero resistivity and the finite gap contributed
by viscous superfluid. By further increasing temperature to $T^{\rm os}$, the viscous superfluid
and hence gap vanish. This theory can also be applied to low-dimensional disordered $s$-wave superconductors.

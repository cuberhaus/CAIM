In this study, we use DFT calculations to investigate the electronic and structural properties
of MoX$_2$ (X = S, Se, Te) monolayers doped with substitutional Sb atoms, with a central focus on the
Sb(Mo) substitution. In MoS$_2$, we observe that this substitution is energetically favored under
S rich conditions, where the S$_2$ gaseous phase is likely to be present. This result is compatible
with a recent experimental observation in Sb-doped MoS$_2$ nanosheets grown by CVD. A similar behavior
is found in MoSe$_2$, but in MoTe$_2$ the Sb(Mo) substitution is less likely to occur due to the possible
absence of gaseous Te phases in experimental setups. In all cases, several impurity-induced states
are found inside the band gap, with energies that span the entire gap. The Fermi energy is pinned a
few tenths of eV above the top of the valence band, suggesting a predominant $p$-type behavior. The
orbital nature of these states is investigated with projected and local density of states calculations,
which reveal similarities to defect states induced by single Mo vacancies as well as their rehybridization
with the $5s$ orbital from Sb. Additionally, we find that the band gap of the doped systems is increased
in comparison with the pristine materials, in contrast with a previous calculation in Sb-doped
MoS$_2$ that predicts a gap reduction with a different assignment of valence band and impurity levels.
We discuss the similarities, discrepancies, and the limitations of both calculations. We also
speculate possible reasons for the experimentally observed redshifts of the A and B excitons in
the presence of the Sb dopants in MoS$_2$. We hope that these results spark future investigations
on other aspects of the problem, particularly those concerning the effects of disorder and electron-hole
interaction, and continue to reveal the potential of doped TMDCs for applications in optoelectronic
devices.

To illustrate Boltzmann's construction of an entropy function that is defined for a microstate
of a macroscopic system, we present here the simple example of the free expansion of a one dimensional
gas of non-interacting point particles. The construction requires one to define macrostates,
corresponding to macroscopic variables. We define a macrostate $M$ by specifying the fraction
of particles in rectangular boxes $\Delta x \Delta v$ of the single particle position-velocity
space $\{x,v\}$. We verify that when the number of particles is large the Boltzmann entropy, $S_B(t)$,
of a typical microstate of a nonequilibrium ensemble coincides with the Gibbs entropy of the coarse-grained
time-evolved one-particle distribution associated with this ensemble. $S_B(t)$ approaches
its maximum possible value for the dynamical evolution of the given initial state. The rate of approach
depends on the size of $\Delta v$ in the definition of the macrostate, going to zero at any fixed time
$t$ when $\Delta v \to 0$. Surprisingly the different curves $S_B(t)$ collapse when time is scaled
with $\Delta v$ as: $t \sim \tau/\Delta v$. We find an explicit expression for $S_B(\tau)$ in the
limit $\Delta v \to 0$. We also consider a different, more hydrodynamical, definition of macrostates
for which $S_B(t)$ is monotone increasing, unlike the previous one which has small decaying oscillations
near its maximum value. Our system is non-ergodic, non-chaotic and non-interacting; our results
thus illustrate that these concepts are not as relevant as sometimes claimed, for observing macroscopic
irreversibility and entropy increase. Rather, the notions of initial conditions, typicality,
large numbers and coarse-graining are the important factors. We demonstrate these ideas through
extensive simulations as well as analytic results.

The physical properties of itinerant antiferromagnetic (AFM) SrCr$_2$As$_2$ with body-centered
tetragonal ThCr$_2$Si$_2$ structure were investigated in single crystalline and polycrystalline
forms by electrical resistivity $\rho$, heat capacity $C_{\rm p}$, magnetic susceptibility $\chi$
versus temperature~$T$ and magnetization $M$ versus applied magnetic field $H$ isotherm measurements
as well as $^{75}$As and $^{53}$Cr nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements in the wide temperature
range $T$ = 1.6--900 K. From the $\chi(T)$ and $^{75}$As NMR measurements, the G-type AFM state below
$T_{\rm N}$ = 615(15) K has been determined, consistent with the previous neutron-diffraction
measurements. Direct evidence of magnetic ordering of the Cr spins was shown by the observation
of the $^{53}$Cr NMR spectrum under $H$ = 0. From the $\chi(T)$ measurements on single-crystal SrCr$_2$As$_2$
under the two different magnetic field directions $H||ab$ and $H||c$ in the AFM state, the Cr ordered
moments are shown to align along the $c$ axis in the G-type AFM state. The metallic state is directly
evidenced by the $\rho$, $C_{\rm p}$, and NMR measurements, and the density of states at the Fermi
energy ${\cal D}(E_{\rm F})$ in the AFM state is estimated to be 7.53 states/eV f.u. for both spin
directions which is almost twice the bare ${\cal D}(E_{\rm F})$ estimated from first-principles
calculations, suggesting an enhancement of the conduction-carrier mass by a factor of two in the
AFM state. The ${\cal D}(E_{\rm F})$ is found to be nearly constant below at least 100 K and is independent
of $H$. The $\rho(T)$ is found to show $T$-linear behavior above $T_{\rm N}$ and exhibits positive
curvature below $T_{\rm N}$ where significant loss of spin-disorder scattering upon magnetic
ordering is observed.

Observation of strong correlations and superconductivity in twisted-bilayer-graphene~\cite{Cao2018-1,Cao2018-2,Yankowitz1059,Lu2019}
have stimulated tremendous interest in fundamental and applied physics~\cite{WANG2019100099,Andrei2020,Balents2020,Kennes2021}.
In this system, the superposition of two twisted honeycomb lattices, generating a Moir$\acute{e}$
pattern, is the key to the observed flat electronic bands, slow electron velocity and large density
of states~\cite{PhysRevLett.99.256802,PhysRevB.81.161405,Bistritzer12233,PhysRevB.85.195458}.
Despite these observations, a full understanding of the emerging superconductivity from the coupled
insulating layers and the appearance of a small magic angle remain a hot topic of research. Here,
we demonstrate a quantum simulation platform to study superfluids in twisted bilayer lattices
based on Bose-Einstein condensates loaded into spin-dependent optical lattices. The lattices
are made of two sets of laser beams that independently address atoms in different spin states, which
form the synthetic dimension of the two layers. The twisted angle of the two lattices is controlled
by the relative angle of the laser beams. We show that atoms in each spin state only feel one set of the
lattice and the interlayer coupling can be controlled by microwave coupling between the spin states.
Our system allows for flexible control of both the inter- and intralayer couplings. Furthermore
we directly observe the spatial Moir$\acute{e}$ pattern and the momentum diffraction, which confirm
the presence of atomic superfluid in the bilayer lattices. Our system constitutes a powerful platform
to investigate the physics underlying the superconductivity in twisted-bilayer-graphene and
to explore other novel quantum phenomena difficult to realize in materials.

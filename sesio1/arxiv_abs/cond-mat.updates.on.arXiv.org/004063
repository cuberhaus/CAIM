In this sequel (to [Phys. Rev. Res. 3, 023044(2021)], arXiv:2006.10072), we study randomly driven
$(1+1)$ dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs), a family of quantum many-body systems with
soluble non-equilibrium quantum dynamics. The sequence of driving Hamiltonians is drawn from
an independent and identically distributed random ensemble. At each driving step, the deformed
Hamiltonian only involves the energy-momentum density spatially modulated at a single wavelength
and therefore induces a M\"obius transformation on the complex coordinates. The non-equilibrium
dynamics is then determined by the corresponding sequence of M\"obius transformations, from which
the Lyapunov exponent $\lambda_L$ is defined. We use Furstenberg's theorem to classify the dynamical
phases and show that except for a few \emph{exceptional points} that do not satisfy Furstenberg's
criteria, the random drivings always lead to a heating phase with the total energy growing exponentially
in the number of driving steps $n$ and the subsystem entanglement entropy growing linearly in $n$
with a slope proportional to central charge $c$ and the Lyapunov exponent $\lambda_L$. On the contrary,
the subsystem entanglement entropy at an exceptional point could grow as $\sqrt{n}$ while the total
energy remains to grow exponentially. In addition, we show that the distributions of the operator
evolution and the energy density peaks are also useful characterizations to distinguish the heating
phase from the exceptional points: the heating phase has both distributions to be continuous, while
the exceptional points could support finite convex combinations of Dirac measures depending on
their specific type. In the end, we compare the field theory results with the lattice model calculations
for both the entanglement and energy evolution and find remarkably good agreement.

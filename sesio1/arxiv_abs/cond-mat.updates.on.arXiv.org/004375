Phase transitions in non-Hermitian systems are at the focus of cutting edge theoretical and experimental
research. The great majority of previous studies exclusively focus on non-Hermitian Hamiltonians,
whose realization requires an {\it a priori} fine-tuned extended lattices to exhibit topological
and localization transition phenomena. For instance, the $\cal PT$-symmetry in a lattice can be
easily broken by perturbations in \textit{any} of the lattice sites. In this work, we show how the
lattice non-Hermitian localization phenomena can naturally emerge in the synthetic space of zero-dimensional
open quantum systems. This offers an opportunity to simulate localization transitions in low-dimensional
systems, without the need to construct complex arrays of coupled, e.g., cavities or waveguides.
Namely, by taking into consideration the full quantum properties of a zero-dimensional quadratic
bosonic system, we demonstrate the emergence of spectral, topological, and localization properties
in the synthetic vector space, spanned by its higher-order field moments. Indeed, the field moment
equations of motion can describe an equivalent (quasi-)particle moving in a one-dimensional (1D)
synthetic lattice. As an example, we study an anti-$\cal PT$-symmetric bosonic dimmer, and reveal
the intriguing interplay between spectral, topological and localization transition, and the
emergence of non-Hermitian skin effect in the synthetic 1D space of its high-order field moments.
Our results can be directly verified in state-of-the-art optical setups, such as superconducting
circuits and toroidal resonators, by measuring photon moments or correlation functions, thus
allowing the observation of rich spectral and localization non-Hermitian phenomena emerging
in synthetic space of zero-dimensional open quantum systems.

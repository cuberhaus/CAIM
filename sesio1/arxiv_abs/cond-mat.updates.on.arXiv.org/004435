The use of simple, fast and economic experimental tools to characterize low-dimensional materials
is an important step in the process of democratizing the use of such materials in laboratories around
the world. Raman spectroscopy has arisen as a way of indirectly determining the thickness of nanolayers
of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), avoiding the use of more expensive tools such as atomic
force microscopy, and it is therefore a widely used technique in the study of semiconducting TMDs.
However, the study of many metallic TMDs in the limit of few atomic layers is still behind when compared
to their semiconducting counterparts, partly due to the lack of similar alternative characterization
studies. In this work we present the characterization of the Raman spectrum, specifically of the
E$^1_{2g}$- and A$_{1g}$-modes, of mechanically exfoliated crystals of Ta$_{1-x}$Mo$_x$S$_2$,
a metallic TMD which exhibits charge density wave formation and superconductivity. The clear identification
of contributions to the Raman spectrum coming from the SiO$_2$/Si substrate, which overlap with
the peaks coming from the sample, and which dominate in intensity in the few-layer-samples limit,
allowed the isolation of the individual E$^1_{2g}$- and A$_{1g}$-modes of the samples and, for
the first time, the observation of a clear evolution of the Raman shifts of both modes as a function
of sample thickness. The evolution of such peaks qualitatively resembles the evolution seen in
other TMDs, and provide a way of indirectly determining sample thickness in the limit of few atomic
layers at a low cost. In addition, we observe a softening (red-shift) of both E$^1_{2g}$- and A$_{1g}$-modes
with Mo-doping in the nanolayers, possibly related to the increased out-of-plane lattice parameter
with respect to the pure compound.

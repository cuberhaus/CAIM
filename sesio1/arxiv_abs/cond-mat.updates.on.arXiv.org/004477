Topological and quantum stability of low-dimensional crystalline carbon lattices with multiple
non-equivalent sublattices is theoretically analyzed and simulated by multilevel approach.
It is demonstrated that non-equivalent sublattices cause symmetry breakdown caused by uncompensated
internal structural stress. The Topology Conservation Theorem is introduced, formulated and
proved. It is shown that the lack of perfect filling of planar 2D active crystalline space by structural
units may cause the formation of i) Structure waves of either variable or constant wave length or
rotational periods; ii) Nanotubes or rolls; iii) Saddle structures; iv) Formation of aperiodic
ensembles of irregular asymmetric atomic clusters of different nature; v) Stabilization of 2D
lattices by aromatic resonance, correlation effects, or van-der-Waals interactions with substrates.
For infinite superperiodic structural waves the quasiparticle approach is used to introduce the
effect of quantum instability with periodicity breakdown caused by lattice restructurizing.
In contrast with regular free-standing infinite structural waves, both perfect finite-sized,
or stabilized structural waves can exist and can be synthesized. It is shown that for complex low-dimensional
lattices which prone to breakdown the translation invariance (TI), complete active space of normal
coordinates cannot be reduced to a subspace of TI normal coordinates. As a result, for low-dimensional
crystals constrained TI subspace structural minimization may artificially return a regular point
at potential energy surface as either a global/local minimum/maximum. It is proved that for such
lattices phonon dispersion cannot be used as solid and final proof of their stability. A flowchart
algorithm of structural analysis of low-dimensional crystals is proposed and proved to be a powerful
tool for theoretical design of advanced complex nanomaterials.

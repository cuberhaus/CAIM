The Ti$_2$Ni and the related $\eta$-carbide structure are known to exhibit various intriguing
physical properties. The Ti$_2$Ni structure with the cubic space group $Fd\bar{3}m$ is surprisingly
complex, consisting of a unit cell with 96 metal atoms. The related $\eta$-carbide compounds correspond
to a filled version of the Ti$_2$Ni structure. Here, we report on the structure and superconductivity
in the $\eta$-carbide type suboxides Ti$_4$M$_2$O with M = Co, Rh, Ir. We have successfully synthesized
all three compounds in single phase form. We find all three compounds to be type-II bulk superconductors
with transition temperatures of $T_{\rm c}$ = 2.7, 2.8, and 5.4 K, and with normalized specific heat
jumps of $\Delta C/\gamma T_{\rm c}$ = 1.65, 1.28, and 1.80 for Ti$_4$Co$_2$O, Ti$_4$Rh$_2$O, and
Ti$_4$Ir$_2$O, respectively. We find that all three superconductors, exhibit high upper-critical
fields. Particularly noteworthy is Ti$_4$Ir$_2$O with an upper critical field of $\mu_0 H_{\rm
c2}{\rm (0)}$ =~16.06~T, which exceeds by far the weak-coupling Pauli limit of 9.86~T. The role
of the void filling light atom X has so far been uncertain for the overall physical properties of these
materials. Herein, we have successfully grown single crystals of Ti$_2$Co. In contrast to the metallic
$\eta$-carbide type suboxides Ti$_4$M$_2$O, we find that Ti$_2$Co displays a semimetallic behavior.
Hence, the octahedral void-filling oxygen plays a crucial role for the overall physical properties,
even though its effect on the crystal structure is small. Our results indicate that the design of
new superconductors by incorporation of electron-acceptor atoms may in the Ti$_2$Ni-type structures
and other materials with crystallographic void position be a promising future approach. The remarkably
high upper critical fields, in this family of compounds, may furthermore spark significant future
interest.

This paper is concerned with the stochastic thermodynamics of non-equilibrium Gaussian processes
that can exhibit anomalous diffusion. In the systems considered, the noise correlation function
is not necessarily related to friction. Thus, there is no conventional fluctuation-dissipation
relation (FDR) of the second kind and no unique way to define a temperature. We start from a Markovian
process with time-dependent diffusivity (an example being scaled Brownian motion). It turns out
that standard stochastic thermodynamic notions can be applied rather straightforwardly by introducing
a time-dependent temperature, yielding the integral fluctuation relation. We then proceed to
our focal system, that is, a particle undergoing fractional Brownian motion (FBM). In this system,
the noise is Gaussian but the noise correlation function is nonlocal in time, defining a non- Markovian
process. We analyse in detail the consequences when using the conventional notions of stochastic
thermodynamics with a constant medium temperature. In particular, the heat calculated from dissipation
into the medium differs from the log ratio of path probabilities of forward and backward motion,
yielding a deviation from the standard integral fluctuation relation for the total entropy production
if the latter is defined via system entropy and heat exchange. These apparent inconsistencies can
be circumvented by formally defining a time-nonlocal temperature that fulfils a generalized FDR.
To shed light on the rather abstract quantities resulting from the latter approach we perform a perturbation
expansion. This allows us to calculate analytically, up to linear order, the generalized temperature
and the corresponding heat exchange. By this, we provide explicit expressions and a physical interpretation
for the leading corrections induced by non-Markovianity.

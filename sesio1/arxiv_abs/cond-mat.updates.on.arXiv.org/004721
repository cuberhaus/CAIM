We study numerically and analytically the dynamics of a single directed elastic string driven through
a 3-dimensional disordered medium. In the quasistatic limit the string is super-rough in the driving
direction, with roughness exponent $\zeta_{\parallel} = 1.25\pm 0.01$, dynamic exponent $z_{\parallel}=
1.43 \pm 0.01$, correlation-length exponent $\nu= 1.33 \pm 0.02$, depinning exponent $\beta =
0.24\pm 0.01$, and avalanche-size exponent $\tau_{\parallel} = 1.09 \pm 0.03$. In the transverse
direction we find $\zeta_{\perp} = 0.5 \pm 0.01$, $z_{\perp} = 2.27 \pm 0.05$, and $\tau_{\perp}
=1.17\pm 0.06$. We show that transverse fluctuations do not alter the critical exponents in the
driving direction, as predicted by the planar approximation (PA) proposed in 1996 by Ertas and Kardar
(EK). We check the PA for the force-force correlator, comparing to the functional renormalization
group and simulations. Both Random-Bond (RB) and Random-Field (RF) disorder yield a single universality
class, indistinguishable from the one of an elastic string in a 2-dimensional random medium. While
$z_{\perp}=z_{\parallel}+1/\nu$ and $\nu=1/(2-\zeta_{\parallel})$ of EK are satisfied, the
transversal movement is that of a Brownian, with a clock set locally by the forward movement. This
implies $\zeta_\perp = (2-d)/2$, distinct from EK. At small driving velocities the distribution
of local parallel displacements has a negative skewness, while in the transverse direction it is
a Gaussian. For large scales, the system can be described by anisotropic effective temperatures.
In the fast-flow regime the local displacement distributions become Gaussian in both directions
and the effective temperatures vanish as $T^{\perp}_{\tt eff}\sim 1/v$ and $T^{\parallel}_{\tt
eff}\sim 1/v^3$ for RB and as $T^{\perp}_{\tt eff} \approx T^{\parallel}_{\tt eff} \sim 1/v$ for
RF.

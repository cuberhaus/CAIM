We report on the successful on-surface synthesis of metal-organic covalent coordination networks
with a dense Kagome lattice of metallic centers. In the case of Mn centers ab-initio calculations
show that the adsorbed monolayer on Ag(111) has all the characteristic features of a strictly two-dimensional
(2D) ferromagnetic Kagome metal. Tetrahydroxyquinone (THQ) and metal atoms (M=Cu or Mn) are co-deposited
on the Ag(111) substrate to build well-ordered 2D lattices M$_3$C$_6$O$_6$. The surface is studied
by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), low energy electron diffraction (LEED) and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) to optimize the growth conditions like fluxes and temperatures. The details
of the atomic, electronic and magnetic structures are clarified by density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. XPS and DFT reveal a Cu$^+$ charge state and no local magnetic moments for the Cu-organic
network. For the Mn-organic network, we find the charge state Mn$^{2+}$ and a local spin S=5/2. Charge
transfer stabilizes the Cu$^+$ and Mn$^{2+}$ charge states. We find two different modifications
of the M$_3$C$_6$O$_6$ lattice. DFT calculations which neglect the small spin-orbit coupling
show a Dirac point, i.e. a band crossing with linear electron dispersion at the K-point of the Brillouin
zone. This Dirac point is at the Fermi level if there is no charge transfer but drops by 100 meV if electron
doping of Cu$_3$C$_6$O$_6$ on Ag(111) surface is acknowledged. We predict the magnetic couplings
of an isolated M$_3$C$_6$O$_6$ monolayer to be short range and antiferromagnetic leading to high
frustration at the Kagome lattice and a tendency towards a spin-liquid ground state. In the case
of hole transfer from the substrates ferromagnetic ordering is introduced, making M$_3$C$_6$O$_6$
an interesting candidate for the quantum anomalous Hall effect.

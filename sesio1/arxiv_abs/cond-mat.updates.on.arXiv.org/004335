The dynamical mechanisms underlying the grain evolution and growth are of fundamental importance
in controlling the structural properties of large-scale polycrystalline materials, but the effects
of lattice ordering and distinct atomic species in multi-component material systems are still
not well understood. We study these effects through the phase field crystal modeling of embedded
curved grains in two-dimensional hexagonal materials, by examining and comparing the results
of grain rotation, shrinking, and grain boundary dynamics over the full range of misorientation
in binary systems of hexagonal boron nitride and single-component graphene monolayers. Calculations
of the relation between grain radius and misorientation angle during time evolution reveal the
normal-tangential coupled motion of the grain boundary matching the Cahn-Taylor formulation,
as well as the transition to sliding and the regime of grain motion without rotation. The key effect
of two-component sublattice ordering is identified, showing as a dual behavior of both positive
and negative coupling modes with grains rotating towards increasing and decreasing angles, which
is absent in two-dimensional single-component systems. The corresponding mechanisms are beyond
the purely geometric considerations and require the energetic contribution from the difference
between heteroelemental and homoelemental atomic bondings and the subsequent availability of
a diverse variety of defect core structures and transformations. This indicates the important
role played by the lattice inversion symmetry breaking in binary or multi-component materials,
causing the change of detailed microstructures and dynamics of dislocation defects at grain boundaries
as compared to single-component materials.

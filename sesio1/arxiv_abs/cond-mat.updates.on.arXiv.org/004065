The cluster slave-spin method is implemented to research the ground state properties of the honeycomb
lattice Hubbard model with doping $\delta$ and coupling $U$ being its parameters. At half-filling,
a single direct and continuous phase transition between the semi-metal and antiferromagnetic
(AFM) insulator is found at $U_{\text{AFM}}=2.43t$ that is in the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa universality
class, precluding the existence of the intermediate spin liquid state. In the vicinity of this transition,
a relation between the staggered magnetization $M$ and the AFM energy gap $\Delta_{\text{AFM}}$
is established as $M \propto \Delta_{\text{AFM}}$, compared to $M \propto \Delta_{\text{AFM}}
( \ln{\Delta_{\text{AFM}}})^2$ in the square lattice case. For the underlying paramagnetic (PM)
state, a first-order semi-metal to insulator Mott transition is corroborated at $U_{\text{Mott}}=8.36t$,
characterized by discontinuities and hystereses, which is responsible for a broad crossover around
$U_{c} = 5.4t$ between the weak- and strong-coupling regimes in the AFM state. In the doped system,
unlike the square lattice Hubbard model, this crossover coupling strength $U_{c}$ increases with
doping $\delta$. The compressibility $\kappa$ near the van Hove singularity at $\delta=1/4$ is
suppressed substantially by the interaction before the semi-metal to AFM transition occurs, whereas
$\kappa$ near the Dirac points is very close to the noninteracting one, indicating that the Dirac
cone structure of the energy dispersion is rather robust. Finally, an overall phase diagram in the
$U$-$\delta$ plane is presented, which consists of four regimes: the AFM insulator at $\delta=0$
for $U> U_{\text{AFM}}$, the AFM metal with compressibility $\kappa>0$ or $\kappa<0$, and the
PM semi-metal.

We report on photoluminescence in the 3-7 $\mu$m mid-wave infrared (MWIR) range from sub-100 nm
strained thin films of rocksalt PbSe(001) grown on GaAs(001) substrates by molecular beam epitaxy.
These bare films, grown epitaxially at temperatures below 400 {\deg}C, luminesce brightly at room
temperature and have minority carrier lifetimes as long as 172 ns. The relatively long lifetimes
in PbSe thin films are achievable despite threading dislocation densities exceeding $10^9$ $cm^{-2}$
arising from island growth on the nearly 8% lattice- and crystal-structure-mismatched GaAs substrate.
Using quasi-continuous-wave and time-resolved photoluminescence, we show Shockley-Read-Hall
recombination is slow in our high dislocation density PbSe films at room temperature, a hallmark
of defect tolerance. Power-dependent photoluminescence and high injection excess carrier lifetimes
at room temperature suggest that degenerate Auger recombination limits the efficiency of our films,
though the Auger recombination rates are significantly lower than equivalent, III-V bulk materials
and even a bit slower than expectations for bulk PbSe. Consequently, the combined effects of defect
tolerance and low Auger recombination rates yield an estimated peak internal quantum efficiency
of roughly 30% at room temperature, unparalleled in the MWIR for a severely lattice-mismatched
thin film. We anticipate substantial opportunities for improving performance by optimizing crystal
growth as well as understanding Auger processes in thin films. These results highlight the unique
opportunity to harness the unusual chemical bonding in PbSe and related IV-VI semiconductors for
heterogeneously integrated mid-infrared light sources constrained by tight thermal budgets
in new device designs.

In this work we aim to develop a unified mathematical framework and a reliable computational approach
to model the brittle fracture in heterogeneous materials with variability in material microstructures,
and to provide statistic metrics for quantities of interest, such as the fracture toughness. To
depict the material responses and naturally describe the nucleation and growth of fractures, we
consider the peridynamics model. In particular, a stochastic state-based peridynamic model is
developed, where the micromechanical parameters are modeled by a finite-dimensional random vector,
or a combination of random variables truncating the Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve decomposition or the principle
component analysis (PCA). To solve this stochastic peridynamic problem, probabilistic collocation
method (PCM) is employed to sample the random field representing the micromechanical parameters.
For each sample, the deterministic peridynamic problem is discretized with an optimization-based
meshfree quadrature rule. We present rigorous analysis for the proposed scheme and demonstrate
its convergence for a number of benchmark problems, showing that it sustains the asymptotic compatibility
spatially and achieves an algebraic or sub-exponential convergence rate in the random space as
the number of collocation points grows. Finally, to validate the applicability of this approach
on real-world fracture problems, we consider the problem of crystallization toughening in glass-ceramic
materials, in which the material at the microstructural scale contains both amorphous glass and
crystalline phases. The proposed stochastic peridynamic solver is employed to capture the crack
initiation and growth for glass-ceramics with different crystal volume fractions, and the averaged
fracture toughness are calculated. The numerical estimates of fracture toughness show good consistency
with experimental measurements.

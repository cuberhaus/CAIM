In a blueprint for topological electronics, edge state transport in a topological insulator material
can be controlled by employing a gate-induced topological quantum phase transition. Here, by studying
the width dependence of electronic properties, it is inferred that zigzag-Xene nanoribbons are
promising materials for topological electronics with a display of unique physical characteristics
associated with the intrinsic band topology and the finite-size effects on gate-induced topological
switching. First, due to intertwining with intrinsic band topology-driven energy-zero modes
in the pristine case, spin-filtered chiral edge states in zigzag-Xene nanoribbons remain gapless
and protected against backward scattering even with finite inter-edge overlapping in ultra-narrow
ribbons, i.e., a 2D quantum spin Hall material turns into a 1D topological metal. Second, mainly
due to width- and momentum-dependent tunability of the gate-induced inter-edge coupling, the
threshold-voltage required for switching between gapless and gapped edge states reduces as the
width decreases, without any fundamental lower bound. Third, when the width of zigzag-Xene nanoribbons
is smaller than a critical limit, topological switching between edge states can be attained without
bulk bandgap closing and reopening. This is primarily due to the quantum confinement effect on the
bulk band spectrum which increases the nontrivial bulk bandgap with decrease in width. The existence
of such protected gapless edge states and reduction in threshold-voltage accompanied by enhancement
in the bulk bandgap overturns the general wisdom of utilizing narrow-gap and wide channel materials
for reducing the threshold-voltage in a standard field effect transistor analysis and paves the
way toward low-voltage topological devices.

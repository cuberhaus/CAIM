In a disordered environment, the probability of transmission of a wave reduces with increasing
disorder, the ultimate limit of which is the near-zero transmission due to Anderson localization.
Under localizing conditions, transport is arrested because the wave is trapped in the bulk of the
sample with decaying-exponential coupling to the boundaries. Any further increase in disorder
does not modify the overall transport properties. Here, we report the experimental demonstration
of a hitherto-unrealized anomalous transport of hybrid particles under localizing disorder in
a non-Hermitian setting. We create hybrid polariton-photon states in a one-dimensional copper
sample with a comb-shaped periodic microstructure designed for microwave frequencies. Metallic
dissipation realizes the necessary non-Hermiticity. Disorder is introduced by deliberate alterations
of the periodic microstructure. Direct measurement of wave-functions and phases was achieved
by a near-field probe. At a particular disorder, We observe the onset of Anderson localization of
the hybrid states endorsed by exponential tails of the wavefunction. However, at stronger disorder
and under conditions that support localization, an unexpected enhancement in the transmission
was facilitated by an emergent mini-band. The transmission was traced to the hopping of the hybrid
particle over multiple co-existing localized resonances that exchange energy due to the non-orthogonality.
These emergent states are manifested in all configurations under strong disorder, suggesting
the formation of a novel transport regime. This is verified by measuring the averaged conductance
which endorses an anomalous transport regime in the hybrid, non-Hermitian environment under strong
disorder. These experimental observations open up new unexplored avenues in the ambit of disorder
under non-Hermitian conditions.

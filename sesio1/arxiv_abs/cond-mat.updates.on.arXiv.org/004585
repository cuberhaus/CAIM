What happens when a quantum system undergoing unitary evolution in time is subject to repeated projective
measurements to the initial state at random times? A question of general interest is: How does the
survival probability $S_m$, namely, the probability that an initial state survives even after
$m$ number of measurements, behave as a function of $m$? We address these issues in the context of
two paradigmatic quantum systems, one, the quantum random walk evolving in discrete time, and the
other, the tight-binding model evolving in continuous time, with both defined on a one-dimensional
periodic lattice with a finite number of sites $N$. For these two models, we present several numerical
and analytical results that hint at the curious nature of quantum measurement dynamics. In particular,
we unveil that when evolution after every projective measurement continues with the projected
component of the instantaneous state, the average and the typical survival probability decay as
an exponential in $m$ for large $m$. By contrast, if the evolution continues with the leftover component,
namely, what remains of the instantaneous state after a measurement has been performed, the survival
probability exhibits two characteristic $m$ values, namely, $m_1^\star(N) \sim N$ and $m_2^\star(N)
\sim N^\delta$ with $\delta >1$. These scales are such that (i) for $m$ large and satisfying $m < m_1^\star(N)$,
the decay of the survival probability is as $m^{-2}$, (ii) for $m$ satisfying $m_1^\star(N) \ll
m < m_2^\star(N)$, the decay is as $m^{-3/2}$, while (iii) for $m \gg m_2^\star(N)$, the decay is
as an exponential. We find that our results hold independently of the choice of the distribution
of times between successive measurements, as have been corroborated by our results for a wide range
of distributions. This fact hints at robustness and ubiquity of our derived results.

The polycrystalline co-doped samples of Sm0.5Y0.5Fe0.58Mn0.42O3 were prepared by solid-state
reaction route and its various physical properties with their correlations have been investigated.
The dc magnetization measurements on the sample revealed a weak ferromagnetic (WFM) transition
at TN=361 K that is followed by an incomplete spin reorientation transition (SR) at TSR1= 348 K. A
first order magnetic transition (FOMT) around 292 K completes the spin reorientation transition
and the material enters into a nearly collinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) state for T < 260 K. The compound
exhibited magnetization reversal below the compensation temperature (Tcomp) =92 K at low measured
field of 100 Oe. At further low temperature below 71 K, the compound also exhibited Zero-field cooled
memory effects confirming a reentrant spinglass state formation. Robust magnetodielectric (MD)
magnetoelectric coupling has been established in the present material through field dependent
dielectric and resistivity measurements. True ferroelectric transition with a considerable
value of polarization (0.06 microC/cm2 at 15K) have been found in the specimen below TFE=108 K. We
observed an intense spin-phonon coupling (SPC) across TSR and TN from the temperature dependent
Raman spectroscopy and is responsible for the intrinsic magnetoelectric effect. This SPC also
stabilizes the ferroelectric state below TFE in the material. Temperature dependent x-ray diffraction
studies indicates the absence of magnetostriction in the material while an intrinsic rapid positive
thermal expansion (RPTE) to negative thermal expansion (NTE) of the a lattice parameter of the unit
cell is further revealed for T > 573 K. The delicate interplay of the lattice (Phonons), charge and
spins governs the observed features in the investigated physical properties of the material that
makes the specimen a promising multifunctional material.

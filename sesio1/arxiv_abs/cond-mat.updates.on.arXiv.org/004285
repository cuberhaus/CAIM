We study the characteristics of chaos evolution of initially localized energy excitations in the
one-dimensional nonlinear disordered Klein-Gordon lattice of anharmonic oscillators, by computing
the time variation of the fundamental frequencies of the motion of each oscillator. We focus our
attention on the dynamics of the so-called `weak' and `strong chaos' spreading regimes [2010, EPL
91 30001], for which Anderson localization is destroyed. Based on the fact that large variations
of the fundamental frequencies denote strong chaotic behavior, we show that in both regimes chaos
is more intense at the central regions of the wave packet, where also the energy content is higher,
while the oscillators at the wave packet's edges exhibit regular motion up until the time they gain
enough energy to become part of the highly excited portion of the wave packet. Eventually, the percentage
of chaotic oscillators remains practically constant, despite the fact that the number of excited
sites grows as the wave packet spreads, but the portion of highly chaotic sites decreases in time.
We show that the extent of the zones of regular motion at the edges of the wave packet in the strong chaos
regime is much smaller than in the weak chaos case. Furthermore, we find that in the strong chaos regime
the chaotic component of the wave packet is not only more extended than in the weak chaos one, but in
addition the fraction of strongly chaotic oscillators is much higher. Another important difference
between the weak and strong chaos regimes is that in the latter case a significantly larger number
of frequencies is excited, even from the first stages of the evolution. Moreover, our computations
confirmed the shifting of fundamental frequencies outside the normal mode frequency band of the
linear system in the case of the so-called `selftrapping' regime where a large part of the wave packet
remains localized.

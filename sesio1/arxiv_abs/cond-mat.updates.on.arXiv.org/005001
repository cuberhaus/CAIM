When superconductivity is suppressed by high magnetic fields in La2-xSrxCuO4, striped antiferromagnetic
(AFM) order becomes the magnetic ground state of the entire pseudogap regime, up to its end at the
doping p* [M. Frachet, I. Vinograd et al., Nat. Phys. 16, 1064 (2020)]. Glass-like freezing of this
state is detected in 139La NMR measurements of the spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T1. Here, we present
a quantitative analysis of 1/T1 data in the hole-doping range p=x=0.12-0.171, based on the Bloembergen-Purcell-Pound
(BPP) theory, modified to include statistical distribution of parameters arising from strong
spatial inhomogeneity. We observe spin fluctuations to slow down at temperatures T near the onset
of static charge order and, overall, the effect of the field B may be seen as equivalent to strengthening
stripe order by approaching p=0.12 doping. In details however, our analysis reveals significant
departure from usual field-induced magnetic transitions. The continuous growth of the amplitude
of the fluctuating moment with increasing B suggests a nearly-critical state in the B->0 limit,
with very weak quasi-static moments possibly confined in small areas like vortex cores. Further,
the nucleation of spin order in the vortex cores is shown to account quantitatively for both the value
and the p dependence of a field scale characterizing bulk spin freezing. The correlation time of
the fluctuating moment appears to depend exponentially on B/T (over the investigated range). This
explains the timescale dependence of various experimental manifestations, including why, for
transport measurements, the AFM moments may be considered static over a considerable range of B
and T. These results make the high-field magnetic ground state up to p* an integral part of the discussion
on putative quantum criticality.

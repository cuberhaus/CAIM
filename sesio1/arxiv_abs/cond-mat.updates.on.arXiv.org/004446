Kagome-lattice magnets $R$Mn$_6$Sn$_6$ recently emerged as a new platform to exploit the interplay
between magnetism and topological electronic states. Using $\textit{ab initio}$ methods, we
systematically investigate the electronic structures and intrinsic magnetic properties in $R$Mn$_6$Sn$_6$
with $R=$ Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, and Er. We reveal a non-monotonic dependence of the magnetocrystalline
anisotropy energy on the spin quantization for all $R$Mn$_6$Sn$_6$, except for $R=$ Gd. Moreover,
the Mn sublattice exhibits easy-plane anisotropy of similar amplitude in all $R$Mn$_6$Sn$_6$
compounds. Our results show that TbMn$_6$Sn$_6$ has an easy-axis anisotropy, while DyMn$_6$Sn$_6$
and HoMn$_6$Sn$_6$ have easy-cone anisotropy, and GdMn$_6$Sn$_6$ and ErMn$_6$Sn$_6$ have easy-plane
anisotropy. These numerical findings all agree well with the experiment and are fully consistent
with the Mn coordination of the $R$ atoms. The observed band structures of various $R$Mn$_6$Sn$_6$
compounds share great similarities near the Fermi level as they mainly consist of non-$4f$ bands.
Multiple Dirac crossings occur at the Brillouin zone corners, opened by spin-orbit coupling (SOC).
Most of these crossings are strongly $k_z$-dependent. The most prominent 2D-like Dirac crossing
that can be effectively gapped by SOC lies $\sim0.7$ eV above the Fermi level, much higher than in
previously reported band structures calculated in density functional theory [Ref. 1]. The inclusion
of electron correlations within Mn-$3d$ electrons, however, can significantly lower this SOC-gapped
crossing closer to the Fermi level, making it more relevant for the observation of topological phenomena.
Finally, we predict an enhancement of the Mn magnetic moment on the $R$Mn$_6$Sn$_6$ surface, which
may impact the topological band structures of surfaces or thin films, and is yet to be confirmed experimentally.

The key concept in spintronics of current-driven noncollinear magnetic textures, such as magnetic
domain walls (DWs), is adiabaticity, i.e., how closely electronic spins track classical localized
magnetic moments (LMMs) of the texture. When mistracking occurs nonadiabatic effects arise, the
salient of which is nonadiabatic spin transfer torque (STT) where spin angular momentum is exchanged
between electrons and LMMs to cause their dynamics and enable DW motion without any current threshold.
The microscopic mechanisms behind nonadiabatic STT have been debated theoretically for nearly
two decades, but with unanimous conclusion that they should be significant only in narrow DWs. However,
this contradicts sharply experiments [O. Boulle {\em et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 101}, 216601
(2008); C. Burrowes {\em et al.}, Nat. Phys. {\bf 6}, 17 (2010)] observing nonadiabatic STT in DWs
much wider than putatively relevant $\sim 1$ nm scale, as well as largely insensitive to further
increasing the DW width $w$. Here we employ time-dependent quantum transport for electrons to obtain
both nonadiabatic and adiabatic STT from the exact nonequilibrium density matrix and its lowest
order as adiabatic density matrix defined by assuming that LMMs are infinitely slow. This allows
us to demonstrate that our microscopically, and without any simplifications of prior derivations
like effectively static DW, extracted nonadiabatic STT: (i) does not decay, but instead saturates
at a finite value, with increasing $w$ of a moving DW ensuring entry into the adiabatic limit, which
we characterize by showing that electronic spins do not reflect from the static DW in this limit;
and (ii) it has both out-of-DW-plane, as is the case of phenomenological expression widely used
in the LLG equation, and in-plane components, where the former remains finite with increasing $w$.

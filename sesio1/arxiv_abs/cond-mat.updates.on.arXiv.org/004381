Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) represents a robust platform to study strong interactions. While
correlated phases are strongest at the magic angle, around 1.06{\deg}, signatures of correlation
have been observed over a range of angles from 0.9{\deg} to 1.2{\deg}. Recently, alternating twist
multilayer graphene (ATMG) systems, consisting of m layers with equal and sign-alternating twist
angles, have emerged as a family of moir\'e systems which share several basic properties with TBG
while differing in some details such as screening, lattice relaxation and response to electric
and magnetic fields. The similarity is rooted in the observation that ATMG can be mapped to a set of
decoupled TBGs at different twist angles. Recent experiments have already seen signatures of strong
correlations, including superconductivity, in alternating twist trilayer graphene (ATTG) at
a magic angle that is larger than the TBG magic angle by {\sqrt{2}}. Here, we take the next step by studying
alternating twist quadrilayer graphene (ATQG) whose magic angle is larger than TBG magic angle
by the golden ratio, ~1.62. Rather than focusing on the magic angle of 1.68{\deg}, we consider angles
at the edge of the magic angle regime, 1.96{\deg} and 1.52{\deg}, which map to 1.21{\deg} and 0.94{\deg}
in TBG. For the larger angle, we find signatures of correlated insulators only when the ATQG is hole
doped, and no signatures of superconductivity, and for the smaller angle we find signatures of superconductivity,
while signs of the correlated insulators weaken. Our results provide insights on the twist angle
dependence of correlated phases in ATMG and sheds light on the nature of correlations in the intermediate
coupling regime at the edge of the magic angle range where dispersion and interaction are of the same
order.

By varying the oil volume fraction, the microscopic droplet size and the macroscopic rheology of
emulsions are investigated in a Taylor-Couette (TC) turbulent shear flow. Although here oil and
water in the emulsions have almost the same physical properties (density and viscosity), unexpectedly,
we find that oil-in-water (O/W) and water-in-oil (W/O) emulsions have very distinct hydrodynamic
behaviors, i.e., the system is clearly asymmetric. By looking at the micro-scales, the average
droplet diameter hardly changes with the oil volume fraction neither for O/W nor for W/O. However,
for W/O it is about 50% larger than that of O/W. At the macro-scales, the effective viscosity of O/W
is higher when compared to that of W/O. These asymmetric behaviors can be traced back to the presence
of surface-active contaminants in the system. By introducing an oil-soluble surfactant at high
concentration, remarkably, we recover the symmetry (droplet size and effective viscosity) between
O/W and W/O emulsions. Based on this, we suggest a possible mechanism responsible for the initial
asymmetry. Next, we discuss what sets the droplet size in turbulent emulsions. We uncover a -6/5
scaling dependence of the droplet size on the Reynolds number of the flow. Combining the scaling
dependence and the droplet Weber number, we conclude that the droplet fragmentation, which determines
the droplet size, occurs within the boundary layer and is controlled by the dynamic pressure caused
by the gradient of the mean flow, as proposed by Levich (1962), instead of the dynamic pressure due
to turbulent fluctuations, as proposed by Kolmogorov (1949). The present findings provide an understanding
of both the microscopic droplet formation and the macroscopic rheological behaviors in dynamic
emulsification, and connects them.

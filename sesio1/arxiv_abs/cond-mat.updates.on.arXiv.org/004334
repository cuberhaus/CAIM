Hydrogels are widely used in myriad applications including those in the biomedical and personal
care fields. It is generally the rheology, i.e., the flow and deformation properties, of hydrogels
that define their functionalities. However, the ubiquitous viscoplasticity and associated wall
slip behavior of hydrogels handicap the accurate characterization of their rheological material
functions. Here parallel-disk and cone-and-plate viscometers were used to characterize the shear
viscosity and wall slip behavior of a crosslinked poly(acrylic acid), PAA, hydrogel (carbomer,
specifically Carbopol). It is demonstrated that parallel-disk viscometry, i.e., the steady torsional
flow in between two parallel disks, but not the cone-and-plate flow can be used to determine the yield
stress and other parameters of viscoplastic constitutive equations and wall slip behavior unambiguously.
Gap-dependent data from parallel-disk viscometry can then be used to characterize the other parameters
of the shear viscosity and wall slip behavior of the hydrogel. The accuracies of the parameters of
wall slip and Herschel-Bulkley type viscoplastic constitutive equation in representing the flow
and deformation behavior of the hydrogel were tested via the comparisons of the calculated and experimentally
determined velocity distributions and torques. The excellent agreements found reflect the accuracies
of the parameters of shear viscosity and wall slip and indicate that the methodologies demonstrated
here provide the means necessary to understand in detail the steady flow and deformation behavior
of hydrogels. Such a detailed understanding of the viscoplastic nature and wall slip behavior of
hydrogels can then be used to design and develop novel hydrogels with a wider range of applications
in the medical and other industrial areas, and for finding optimum conditions for their processing
and manufacturing.

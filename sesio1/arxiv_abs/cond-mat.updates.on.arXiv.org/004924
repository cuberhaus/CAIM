We calculate the electronic structure of AA'AA'...-stacked alternating twist N-layer (tNG) graphene
for N = 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 20 layers and bulk alternating twist (AT) graphite systems where the lattice
relaxations are modeled by means of molecular dynamics simulations. We show that the symmetric
AA'AA'... stacking is energetically preferred among all interlayer sliding geometries for progressively
added layers up to N=6. Lattice relaxations enhance electron-hole asymmetry, and reduce the magic
angles with respect to calculations with fixed tunneling strengths that we quantify from few layers
to bulk AT-graphite. Without a perpendicular electric field, the largest magic angle flat-band
states locate around the middle following the largest eigenvalue eigenstate in a 1D-chain model
of layers, while the density redistributes to outer layers for smaller magic twist angles corresponding
to higher order effective bilayers in the 1D chain. A perpendicular electric field decouples the
electronic structure into $N$ Dirac bands with renormalized Fermi velocities with distinct even-odd
band splitting behaviors, showing a gap for N=4 while for odd layers a Dirac cone remains between
the flat band gaps. The magic angle error tolerance estimated from density of states maxima expand
progressively from $0.05^{\circ}$ in t2G to up to $0.2^{\circ}$ in AT-graphite, hence allowing
a greater flexibility in multilayers. Decoupling of tNG into t2G with different interlayer tunneling
proportional to the eigenvalues of a 1D layers chain allows to map tNG-multilayers bands onto those
of periodic bulk AT-graphite's at different $k_z$ values. We also obtain the Landau level density
of states in the quantum Hall regime for magnetic fields of up to 50~T and confirm the presence of nearly
flat bands around which we can develop suppressed density of states gap regions by applying an electric
field in N > 3 systems.

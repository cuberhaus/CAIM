Twisted transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) homobilayers have recently emerged as a powerful
platform for studying correlated insulating states. In the strongly correlated limit, we construct
an effective spin Hamiltonian on a honeycomb lattice that includes the Heisenberg interaction
and nonsymmetric interactions such as a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and a Kane-Mele coupling
for the Mott-insulating phase at half-filling. For the twisted TMD homobilayers, the spin-orbit
coupling in the Hubbard model, which is expected to induce the antisymmetric exchange couplings
in the effective spin Hamiltonian, is a highly tunable and experimentally accessible quantity
that can be tuned by an applied electric field. In this study, we investigate classical and quantum
phase diagrams of the effective spin Hamiltonian using analytical and numerical methods. We show
that the model exhibits a rich classical phase diagram including an antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase,
a planar spiral ordered phase with high classical degeneracy, a $z$-AFM phase, a noncoplanar phase,
a noncollinear phase, and a 120$^{\circ}$-AFM phase. In the quantum treatment, we calculate low-energy
magnon excitation spectrum, ground state energy, and static spin structure factor using linear
spin-wave theory and density matrix renormalization group methods to compose the quantum phase
diagram of the effective spin Hamiltonian. Beyond the Heisenberg interaction, we find that the
existence of these antisymmetric couplings is responsible for the quantum spin liquid, $z$-AFM,
noncoplanar, and 120$^{\circ}$ phases. Twisted TMD homobilayers, therefore, offer rich platforms
for realizing rich phases of matter such as quantum spin liquid, noncoplanar, and 120$^{\circ}$,
resulting from the spin-orbit coupling.

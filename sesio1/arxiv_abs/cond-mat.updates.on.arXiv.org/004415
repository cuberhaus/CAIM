Grassmann Phase Space Theory (GSPT) is applied to the BEC/BCS crossover in cold fermionic atomic
gases and used to determine the evolution (over either time or temperature) of the Quantum Correlation
Functions (QCF) that specify: (a) the positions of the spin up and spin down fermionic atoms in a single
Cooper pair and (b) the positions of the two spin up and two spin down fermionic atoms in two Cooper
pairs The first of these QCF is relevent to describing the change in size of a Cooper pair, as the fermion-fermion
coupling constant is changed through the crossover from a small Cooper pair on the BEC side to a large
Cooper pair on the BCS side. The second of these QCF is important for describing the correlations
berween the positions of the fermionic atoms in two Cooper pairs, which is expected to be small at
the BEC or BCS sides of the crossover, but is expected to be significant in the strong interaction
unitary regime, where the size of a Cooper pair is comparable to the separation between Cooper pairs.
In GPST the QCF are ultimately given via the stochastic average of products of Grassman stochastic
momentum fields, and GPST shows that the stochastic average of the products of Grassman stochastic
momentum fields at a later time (or lower temperature) is related linearly to the stochastic average
of the products of Grassman stochastic momentum fields at an earlier time (or higher temperature),
and that the matrix elements involved in the linear relations are all c-numbers. Expressions for
these matrix elements corresponding to a small time increment (or a small temperature change) have
been obtained analytically, providing the formulae needed for numerical studies of the evolution
that are planned for a future publication. Various initial conditions are considered, including
those for a non-interacting fermionic gas at zero temperature and a high temperature gas (where
the effect of the interactions can be ignored in the initial state). These would be relevant for studying
the time evolution of the creation of a Cooper pair when the interaction is switched on via Feshbach
resonance methods, or the evolution as the temperature is lowered for particular choices of the
fermion-fermion coupling constant, such as where the coupling constant is very large -- corresponding
to the unitary regime. Full derivations of the expressions have been presented in the Appendices.

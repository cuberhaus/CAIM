The glass-forming ability (GFA) of alloys, colloidal dispersions, and other particulate materials,
as measured by the critical cooling rate $R_c$, can span more than ten orders of magnitude. Even after
numerous previous studies, the physical features that control the GFA are still not well understood.
For example, it is well-known that mixtures are better glass-formers than monodisperse systems
and that particle size and cohesive energy differences among constituents improve the GFA, but
it is not currently known how particle size differences couple to cohesive energy differences to
determine the GFA. We perform molecular dynamics simulations to determine the GFA of equimolar,
binary Lennard-Jones (LJ) mixtures versus the normalized cohesive energy difference $\epsilon_\_$
and mixing energy $\bar \epsilon_{AB}$ between particles A and B. We find several important results.
First, the $\log_{10} R_c$ contours in the $\bar \epsilon_{AB}$-$\epsilon_\_$ plane are ellipsoidal
for all diameter ratios, and thus $R_c$ is determined by the Mahalanobis distance $d_M$ from a given
point in the $\bar \epsilon_{AB}$-$\epsilon_\_$ plane to the center of the ellipsoidal contours.
Second, LJ systems for which the larger particles have larger cohesive energy are generally better
glass formers than those for which the larger particles have smaller cohesive energy. Third, $d_M(\epsilon_\_,\bar
\epsilon_{AB})$ is determined by the relative Voronoi volume difference between particles and
local chemical order $S_{AB}$, which gives the average fraction of nearest-neighbor B particles
surrounding an A particle and vice-versa. In particular, the shifted Mahalanobis distance $d_M
- d^0_M$ versus the shifted chemical order $S_{AB}-S_{AB}^0$ collapses onto a hyperbolic master
curve for all diameter ratios.

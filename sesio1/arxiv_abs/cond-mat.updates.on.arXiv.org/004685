Helical spin chains, consisting of magnetic (ad-)atoms, on the surface of bulk superconductors
are predicted to host Majorana bound states (MBSs) at the ends of the chain. Here, we investigate
the prevalence of trivial zero-energy bound states in these helical spin chain systems. First,
we show that the Hamiltonian of a helical spin chain on a superconductor can be mapped to an effective
Hamiltonian reminiscent of a semiconductor nanowire with strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling.
In particular, we show that a varying rotation rate between neighbouring magnetic moments maps
to smooth non-uniform potentials in the effective nanowire Hamiltonian. Previously it has been
found that trivial zero-energy states are abundant in nanowire systems with smooth potentials.
Therefore, we perform an extensive search for zero-energy bound states in helical spin chain systems
with varying rotation rates. Although bound states with near zero-energy do exist for certain dimensionalities
and rotation profiles, we find that zero-energy bound states are far less prevalent than in semiconductor
nanowire systems with equivalent non-uniformities. In particular, utilising varying rotation
rates, we do not find zero-energy bound states in the most experimentally relevant setup consisting
of a one-dimensional helical spin chain on the surface of a three-dimensional superconductor,
even for profiles that produce near zero-energy states in equivalent one- and two- dimensional
systems. Although our findings do not rule them out, the much reduced prevalence of zero-energy
bound states in long non-uniform helical spin chains compared with equivalent semi-conductor
nanowires, as well as the ability to measure states locally via STM, should reduce the experimental
barrier to identifying MBSs in such systems.

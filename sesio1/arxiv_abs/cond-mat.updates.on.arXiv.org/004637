State-of-the-art hybrid perovskites have demonstrated excellent functionality in photovoltaics
and light-emitting applications, and have emerged as a promising candidate for exciton-polariton
(polariton) optoelectronics. In the strong coupling regime, polariton formation and Bose-Einstein
condensation (BEC) have been demonstrated at room-temperature in several perovskite formulations.
Thermodynamically, low-threshold BEC requires efficient scattering to k|| = 0, and many applications
demand precise control of polariton interactions. Thus far, the primary mechanisms by which polaritons
relax in perovskites remains unclear. In this work, we perform temperature-dependent measurements
of polaritons in low-dimensional hybrid perovskites with high light-matter coupling strengths
({\hbar}{\Omega}_Rabi = 260+/-5 meV). By embedding the perovskite active layer in a wedged cavity,
we are able to tune the Hopfield coefficients and decouple the primary polariton relaxation mechanisms
in this material for the first time. We observe the thermal activation of a bottleneck regime, and
reveal that this effect can be overcome by harnessing intrinsic scattering mechanisms arising
from the interplay between the different excitonic species, such as biexciton-assisted polariton
relaxation pathways, and isoenergetic intracavity pumping. We demonstrate the dependence of
the bottleneck suppression on cavity detuning, and are able to achieve efficient relaxation to
k|| = 0 even at cryogenic temperatures. This new understanding contributes to the design of ultra-low-threshold
BEC and condensate control by engineering polariton dispersions resonant with efficient relaxation
pathways, leveraging intrinsic material scattering mechanisms for next-generation polariton
optoelectronics.

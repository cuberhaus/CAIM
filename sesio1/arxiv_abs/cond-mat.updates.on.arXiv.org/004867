Symmetry-protected spectral topology in non-Hermitian systems has interesting manifestations
such as dynamically anomalous chiral currents and skin effect. We study the interplay between symmetries
and disorder in a paradigmatic model for spectral topology - the non-reciprocal Su-Schrieffer-Heeger
model. We numerically study the effect of disorder in on-site and non-reciprocal hopping terms.
Using a real-space winding number, we investigate the impact of disorder on the spectral topology
and the anomalous chiral modes under periodic boundary conditions. We discover a remarkable robustness
of chiral current under disorder. The value of the chiral current retains the clean system value,
is independent of disorder strength and is tracked completely by the real-space winding number
for class A which has no symmetries, and class AIII, which has a sub-lattice symmetry. In class $D^\dagger$,
which has $PT$-symmetric on-site gain and loss terms, we find that the disorder-averaged current
is not robust while the winding number is robust. We study the localization physics using the inverse
participation ratio and local density of states. As the disorder strength is increased, a mobility-edge
phase with a finite winding appears. The abrupt vanishing of the winding number marks a transition
from a partially localized to a fully localized phase. Under open boundary conditions, we observe
a series of transitions through skin effect-partial skin effect-no skin effect phases. Further,
we study the non-Hermitian Anderson skin effect (NHASE) for different symmetry classes, where
the system without skin effect develops a disorder-driven skin effect at intermediate disorder
values. Remarkably while NHASE is present for different classes, the real-space winding number
shows a direct correspondence with it only when all symmetries are broken.

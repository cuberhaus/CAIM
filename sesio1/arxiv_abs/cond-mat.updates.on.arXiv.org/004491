The rigid rotor is a classic problem in quantum mechanics, describing the dynamics of a rigid body
with its centre of mass held fixed. The configuration space of this problem is $SO(3)$, the space
of all rotations in three dimensions. This is a topological space with two types of closed loops:
trivial loops that can be adiabatically shrunk to a point and non-trivial loops that cannot. In the
traditional formulation of the problem, stationary states are periodic over both types of closed
loops. However, periodicity conditions may change if Berry phases are introduced. We argue that
time-reversal-symmetry allows for only one new possibility -- a Berry phase of $\pi$ attached to
all non-trivial loops. We derive the corresponding stationary states by exploiting the connection
between $SO(3)$ and $SU(2)$ spaces. The solutions are anti-periodic over any non-trivial loop,
i.e., stationary states reverse sign under a $2\pi$ rotation about any axis. Remarkably, this framework
is realized in the low-energy physics of certain quantum magnets. The magnets must satisfy the following
conditions: (a) the classical ground states are unpolarized, carrying no net magnetization, (b)
the set of classical ground states is indexed by $SO(3)$, and (c) the product $N\times S$ is a half-integer,
where $N$ is the number of spins and $S$ is the spin quantum number. We demonstrate this result in a
family of Heisenberg antiferromagnets defined on polygons with an odd number of vertices. At each
vertex, we have a spin-$S$ moment that is coupled to its nearest neighbours. In the classical limit,
these magnets have coplanar ground states. Their quantum spectra, at low energies, correspond
to `spherical top' and `symmetric top' rigid rotors. For integer values of $S$, we recover traditional
rigid rotor spectra. With half-integer-$S$, we obtain rotor spectra with a Berry phase of $\pi$.

Magnetorheological fluids (MRF) are suspensions of magnetic particles that solidify in the presence
of magnetic fields due to the particles forming chains along field lines. The magnetic forces between
particles dominate the solidification process and determine the yield stress of the material.
Here, we investigate how reversible chemical links between particles influence MRF yield stress
and stiffness through rheological testing in flow and oscillation mode. First, we functionalize
particles with phosphonate groups that are expected to link through hydrogen bonding and find that
this MRF exhibits up to 40% higher yield stress and 100% higher stiffness than an MRF composed of unfunctionalized
particles. To explain this, we model the chemical attraction as an adhesion that supplements dipole-dipole
interactions between particles. Interestingly, we find that the increase in yield stress is largest
for dilute suspensions that are expected to solidify into isolated chains, while the proportional
increase in yield stress is less for MRF with higher concentrations. This is explained by the higher
concentration MRF forming a body-centered tetragonal (BCT) lattice in which interparticle adhesion
forces are no longer aligned with the field. To explore the possibility of dynamically tuning interparticle
interactions, we functionalize particles with polystyrene polymers with thymine terminal groups
that will only exhibit interparticle hydrogen bonding in the presence of a linking molecule, namely
melamine. We find that MRF formed with these particles also exhibit up to a 40% increase in yield stress
and ~100% increase in stiffness, but only in the presence of melamine. In addition to confirming
the role of hydrogen bonding in increasing MRF performance, these results highlight the possibility
of dynamically tuning MRF performance using magnetic fields and chemical modifications.

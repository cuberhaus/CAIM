We report the physical properties of $R$Cd$_{3}$As$_{3}$ ($R$ = La and Ce) compounds, crystallized
into a hexagonal ScAl$_{3}$C$_{3}$-type structure ($P$6$_{3}$/mmc) such that the $R$ sublattice
forms a spin-orbit coupled triangular lattice. Magnetic susceptibility measurements indicate
the 4$f$ electrons of Ce$^{3+}$ ions are well localized and reveal a large magnetic anisotropy.
The electrical resistivity and specific heat measurement for $R$Cd$_{3}$As$_{3}$ exhibit an
anomaly at high temperatures ($T_{0}$ $\sim$ 63 K for $R$ = La and $T_{0}$ $\sim$ 136 K for $R$ = Ce),
most likely due to a structural transition. Specific heat measurements for CeCd$_{3}$As$_{3}$
clearly indicate a long range magnetic order below $T_{N}$ = 0.42 K. Although the magnetic contribution
to the specific heat $C_{m}/T$ increases significantly below $\sim$ 10 K, the electrical resistivity
for CeCd$_{3}$As$_{3}$ follows typical, metallic behavior inconsistent with Kondo lattice systems.
In CeCd$_3$As$_3$ only $\sim$ 40 $\%$ of the $R \ln(2)$ magnetic entropy is recovered by $T_N$ and
the $R$ln(2) entropy is fully achieved at about the Curie-Weiss temperature $|\theta_{p}|$. Unusually,
based on our current investigations, the magnetic specific heat below $|\theta_{p}|$ is not attributed
to a Kondo contribution, but rather associated with the magnetic ordering and frustration on the
triangular lattice. Specific heat measurements in applied magnetic field show a negligible variation
of $T_{N}$ for $H \parallel c$, whereas a suppression of $T_{N}$ is observed above 40 kOe for $H \parallel
ab$. Such behavior is consistent with the application a magnetic field within the $ab$-plane breaking
the triangular symmetry and partially relieving the magnetic frustration in this system.

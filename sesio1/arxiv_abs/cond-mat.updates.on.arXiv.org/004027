The design of Proportional Integral-Derivative (PID) controller is involved to gain infinite
stiffness using active vibration control system and it is a modification of previous work. The PID
controller is a control loop feedback mechanism which steadily calculates a fallacy value as the
difference between a desired set point and a variable process and applies correction based on proportional,
integral, and derivative terms. In this paper to achieve infinite stiffness magnetic field has
been created by passing current, the input of the electromagnet is the output voltage of the sensor.
Depending upon the gap between electromagnet and suspended object vibration is isolated by the
attractive force of the electromagnet. This paper also presents the application, limitation,
and scope of this system. In our system current is controlled by Analog Circuit (PID). The current
moves through the electromagnet which creates magnetic force. If the load increases the proximity
sensor senses the distance and delivers signal to the controller circuit. After receiving the signal
controller circuit increased current supply to the electromagnet through power amplifier circuit.
Magnetic force is expanded then, and object is levitated in a stable position. If the load is decreased
the proximity sensor senses the distance and delivers signal to the controller circuit. Controller
circuit receives the signal and decreases current supply to the electromagnet through power amplifier
circuit. Thus, magnetic force is increased, and object is levitated in a stable position. This paper
reveals the feasibility of vibration control techniques for number of diverse applications. This
paper is highly applicable for detecting direction that is magnetic levitation system and magnetic
bearing.

Among the class of strongly-correlated oxides, La1-xSrxMnO3 $-$ a half metallic ferromagnet with
a Curie temperature above room temperature $-$ has sparked a huge interest as a functional building
block for memory storage and spintronic applications. In this respect, defect engineering has
been in the focus of a long-standing quest for fabricating LSMO thin films with highest quality in
terms of both structural and magnetic properties. Here, we discuss the correlation between structural
defects, such as oxygen vacancies and impurity islands, and magnetism in La0.74Sr0.26MnO3/SrTiO3
(LSMO/STO) epitaxial heterostructures by systematic control of the growth temperature and post-deposition
annealing conditions. Upon increasing the growth temperature within the 500 $-$ 700 $^{\circ}$C
range, the epitaxial LSMO films experience a progressive improvement in oxygen stoichiometry,
leading to enhanced magnetic characteristics. Concurrently, however, the use of a high growth
temperature triggers the diffusion of impurities from the bulk of STO, which cause the creation
of off-stoichiometric, dendritic-like SrMoOx islands at the film/substrate interface. As a valuable
workaround, post-deposition annealing of the LSMO films grown at a relatively-low temperature
of about 500 $^{\circ}$C permits to obtain high-quality epitaxy, atomically-flat surface as well
as a sharp magnetic transition above room temperature and robust ferromagnetism. Furthermore,
under such optimized fabrication conditions possible scenarios for the formation of the magnetic
dead layer as a function of LSMO film thickness are discussed. Our findings offer effective routes
to finely tailor the complex interplay between structural and magnetic properties of LSMO thin
films via temperature-controlled defect engineering.

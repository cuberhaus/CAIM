We address the existence and stability of one-dimensional (1D) holes and kinks and two-dimensional
(2D) vortex-holes nested in extended binary Bose mixtures, which emerge in the presence of Lee-Huang-Yang
(LHY) quantum corrections to the mean-field energy, along with self-bound quantum droplets. We
consider both the symmetric system with equal intra-species scattering lengths and atomic masses,
modeled by a single (scalar) LHY-corrected Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), and the general asymmetric
case with different intra-species scattering lengths, described by two coupled (spinor) GPEs.
We found that in the symmetric setting, 1D and 2D holes can exist in a stable form within a range of chemical
potentials that overlaps with that of self-bound quantum droplets, but that extends far beyond
it. In this case, holes are found to be stable in 1D and they transform into pairs of stable out-of-phase
kinks at the critical chemical potential at which localized droplets turn into flat-top states,
thereby revealing the connection between localized and extended nonlinear states. In contrast,
spinor nature of the asymmetric systems may lead to instability of 1D holes, which tend to break into
two gray states moving in the opposite directions. Such instability arises due to spinor nature
of the system and it affects only holes nested in extended modulationally-stable backgrounds,
while localized quantum droplet families remain completely stable, even in the asymmetric case,
while 1D holes remain stable only close to the point where they transform into pairs of kinks. We also
found that symmetric systems allow fully stable 2D vortex-carrying single-charge states at moderate
amplitudes, while unconventional instabilities appear also at high amplitudes. Symmetry also
strongly inhibits instabilities for double-charge vortex-holes, which thus exhibit unexpectedly
robust evolutions at low amplitudes.

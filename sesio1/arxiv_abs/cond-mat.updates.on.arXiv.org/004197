Computational stress analysis is an important step in the design of material systems. Finite element
method (FEM) is a standard approach of performing stress analysis of complex material systems.
A way to accelerate stress analysis is to replace FEM with a data-driven machine learning based stress
analysis approach. In this study, we consider a fiber-reinforced matrix composite material system
and we use deep learning tools to find an alternative to the FEM approach for stress field prediction.
We first try to predict stress field maps for composite material systems of fixed number of fibers
with varying spatial configurations. Specifically, we try to find a mapping between the spatial
arrangement of the fibers in the composite material and the corresponding von Mises stress field.
This is achieved by using a convolutional neural network (CNN), specifically a U-Net architecture,
using true stress maps of systems with same number of fibers as training data. U-Net is a encoder-decoder
network which in this study takes in the composite material image as an input and outputs the stress
field image which is of the same size as the input image. We perform a robustness analysis by taking
different initializations of the training samples to find the sensitivity of the prediction accuracy
to the small number of training samples. When the number of fibers in the composite material system
is increased for the same volume fraction, a finer finite element mesh discretization is required
to represent the geometry accurately. This leads to an increase in the computational cost. Thus,
the secondary goal here is to predict the stress field for systems with larger number of fibers with
varying spatial configurations using information from the true stress maps of relatively cheaper
systems of smaller fiber number.

Iron- and steelmaking cause ~7% of the global CO2 emissions, due to the use of carbon for the reduction
of iron ores. Replacing carbon by hydrogen as the reductant offers a pathway to reduce emissions.
However, production of hydrogen using renewable energy will remain a bottlenecks, because making
the annual crude steel production of 1.8 billion tons sustainable requires a minimum amount of ~97
million tons of green hydrogen per year. Another fundamental aspect to make ironmaking sector more
sustainable lies in an optimal utilization of green hydrogen and energy, thus reducing efforts
for costly in-process hydrogen recycling. We therefore demonstrate here how the efficiency in
hydrogen and energy consumption during iron ore reduction can be dramatically improved by the knowledge-based
combination of two technologies: partially reducing the ore at low temperature via solid-state
direct reduction (DR) to a kinetically defined degree, and subsequently melting and completely
transforming it to iron under a reducing plasma (i.e. via hydrogen plasma reduction, HPR). Results
suggest that an optimal transition point between these two technologies occurs where their efficiency
in hydrogen utilization is equal. We found that the reduction of hematite through magnetite into
wustite via DR is clean and efficient, but it gets sluggish and inefficient when iron forms at the
outermost layers of the iron ore pellets. Conversely, HPR starts violent and unstable with arc delocalization,
but proceeds smoothly and efficiently when processing semi-reduced oxides. We performed hybrid
reduction experiments by partially reducing hematite pellets via DR at 700{\deg}C to 38% global
reduction (using a standard thermogravimetry system) and subsequently transferring them to HPR,
conducted with a gas mixture of Ar-10%H2 in an arc-melting furnace, to achieve conversion into liquid
iron.

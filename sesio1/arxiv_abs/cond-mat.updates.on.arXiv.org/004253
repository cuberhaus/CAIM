Recent developments in the area of resonant dielectric nanostructures has created attractive
opportunities for the concentrating and manipulating light at the nanoscale and the establishment
of new exciting field of all-dielectric nanophotonics. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs)
with nanopatterned surfaces are especially promising for these tasks. Still, the fabrication
of these structures requires sophisticated lithographic processes, drastically complicating
application prospects. To bridge this gap and broaden the application scope of TMDC nanomaterials,
we report here femtosecond laser-ablative fabrication of water-dispersed spherical TMDC (MoS2
and WS2) nanoparticles (NPs) of variable size (5 - 250 nm). Such nanoparticles demonstrate exciting
optical and electronic properties inherited from TMDC crystals, due to preserved crystalline
structure, which offers a unique combination of pronounced excitonic response and high refractive
index value, making possible a strong concentration of electromagnetic field in the nanoparticles.
Furthermore, such nanoparticles offer additional tunability due to hybridization between the
Mie and excitonic resonances. Such properties bring to life a number of nontrivial effects, including
enhanced photoabsorption and photothermal conversion. As an illustration, we demonstrate that
the nanoparticles exhibit a very strong photothermal response, much exceeding that of conventional
dielectric nanoresonators based on Si. Being in a mobile colloidal state and exhibiting superior
optical properties compared to other dielectric resonant structures, the synthesized TMDC nanoparticles
offer opportunities for the development of next-generation nanophotonic and nanotheranostic
platforms, including photothermal therapy and multimodal bioimaging.

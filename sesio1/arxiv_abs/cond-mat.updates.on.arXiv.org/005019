Depinning of elastic systems advancing on disordered media can usually be described by the quenched
Edwards-Wilkinson equation (qEW). However, additional ingredients such as anharmonicity and
forces that cannot be derived from a potential energy may generate a different scaling behavior
at depinning. An example is the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) term, proportional to the square of the
slope at each site, which drives the critical behavior into the so-called quenched KPZ (qKPZ) universality
class. Here, we show by using exact mappings supported by extensive numerical simulations that,
at least for 1- and 2-dimensional interfaces, this class encompasses not only the qKPZ equation
itself, but also anharmonic depinning and a well-known class of cellular automata introduced by
Tang and Leschhorn. On the other hand, we cannot rule out the existence of distinct universality
classes for $d>2$. We then develop scaling arguments for all critical exponents. Dimension $d=1$
is special since blocking configurations are directed-percolation (DP) clusters, allowing us
to check scaling exponents against high-precision results from DP. To show that qKPZ is the effective
field theory for all these models, we develop an algorithm to measure the effective scale-dependent
elasticity $c$, the effective KPZ non-linearity $\lambda$, and the effective disorder correlator
$\Delta(w)$. This allows us to define the correlation length of the disorder $\rho:=\Delta(0)/|\Delta'(0)|$,
and a dimensionless universal KPZ amplitude ${\cal A}:=\rho \lambda /c$, that takes the value ${\cal
A}=1.10(2)$ in all systems considered in $d=1$. Using GPUs, we make further predictions in $d=1$
and $d=2$, and to some degree in $d=3$. Our work paves the way for a deeper understanding of depinning
in the qKPZ class, and in particular, for the construction of a field theory that we describe in a companion
paper.

The optical and spin properties of quantum dots position them as promising candidates for photonic
quantum information processing and as building blocks of quantum networks. To utilize quantum
dots for such applications requires efficiently interfacing them with arbitrarily polarized
light in photonic cavity structures. However, coupling quantum dots to cavities with sufficient
cooperativity for quantum information processing while providing an efficient optical access
to the dots from free-space optics remains challenging. Here, we efficiently couple InAs/GaAs
quantum dots in a charge tunable device (a p-i-n-i-n diode) to a promising photonic structure, the
nearly polarization-degenerate bullseye cavity, which improves the optical interface with the
dots by over an order of magnitude. By leveraging the low charge noise associated with the diode,
we observe spontaneous emission lifetimes of quantum dots as short as $80$ ps (a Purcell enhancement
of $\approx 15$). These emission rates are four times faster than the rates previously observed
on InAs quantum dots utilizing bullseye cavities with nearly degenerate polarization modes, and
are close to the state-of-the-art emission rates observed on dots in microcavities. In addition
to Purcell enhancement, the interaction between the bullseye cavity and the quantum dot with a cooperativity
as high as $8$ leads to a $\approx 80\%$ dipole-induced transparency of light reflected from the
cavity, which can be used for photon switching in quantum networks. Finally, due to the nearly degenerate
polarization modes of the bullseye cavity, we can optically pump the spin of an electrically charged
quantum dot coupled to it. Coherently controlling the quantum dot spin while leveraging the improved
optical interface offered by the bullseye cavity could upgrade the potential of such dots for quantum
information processing.

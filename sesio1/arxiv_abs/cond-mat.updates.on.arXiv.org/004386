Significant characteristics of the superconducting transitions reported for carbonaceous sulfur
hydride [Snider et al., Nature $\textbf{585}$, 373 (2020)] are the exceptionally abrupt onset
temperatures and their marked increase toward room temperature at high pressure. Theoretical
and experimental studies addressing the superconducting composition and structure have thus
far returned mixed results. One possibility, consistent with the experimentally suggested stoichiometry
of CSH$_{\textrm{x}}$, is the theoretically-discovered compressed $I\bar{4}3m$ CSH$_7$ structure
[Sun et al., Phys. Rev. B $\textbf{101}$, 174102 (2020)], which comprises a sublattice similar
to $Im\bar{3}m$ H$_3$S with CH$_4$ intercalates. Positing an electronic genesis of the superconductivity,
a model is presented in analogy with earlier work on superconductivity in $Im\bar{3}m$ H$_3$S,
in which pairing is induced via purely electronic Coulomb interactions across the mean distance
$\zeta$ between the S and H$_4$ tetrahedra enclosing C. Theoretical superconducting transition
temperatures for $I\bar{4}3m$ CSH$_7$ are derived as $T_{C0}=(2/3)^{1/2}\sigma^{1/2}\beta/a\zeta$,
where $\beta$=1247.4 $\r{A}$$^2$K is a universal constant, $\sigma$ is the participating charge
fraction, and $a$ is the lattice parameter. Analysis suggests persistent bulk superconductivity
with a pressure-dependent $\sigma$, increasing from $\sigma$=3.5, determined previously for
$Im\bar{3}m$ H$_3$S, to $\sigma$=7.5 at high pressure owing to additionally participating C-H
bond electrons. With $a$ and $\zeta$ determined by theoretical structure, $T_{C0}=283.6\pm$3.5
K is predicted at 267$\pm$10 GPa, in excellent agreement (within uncertainty) with the corresponding
experimental $T_C=287.7\pm$1.2 K. Pressure-induced variations in $\sigma$ combined with experimental
uncertainties in pressure yield overall average ($T_C-T_{C0})=(-0.8\pm$3.5) K.

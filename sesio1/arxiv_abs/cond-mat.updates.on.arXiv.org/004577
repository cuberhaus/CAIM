Observational entropy is interpreted as the uncertainty an observer making measurements associates
with a system. So far, properties that make such an interpretation possible rely on the assumption
of ideal projective measurements. Here we show that the same properties hold even when considering
generalized measurements, and therefore such an interpretation stands completely general. Thus,
observational entropy is a well-defined quantifier applicable to many physical scenarios that
test how influential a given series of measurements is in information extraction. Using observation
entropy as a quantifier, we demonstrate how different indirect measurement schemes, those using
a probe, compare with direct measurement. In particular, we find that a qubit system can be used to
efficiently study any multi-dimensional quantum system. Thus, giving a theoretical bound on the
amount of resources needed for perfect information extraction. Within the indirect measurement
schemes, we study how information extraction is affected and compare the repeated measurement
scheme with the less-invasive repeated contact scheme. In the latter, the pointer repeatedly stores
information of the measured observable and is measured only at the end of the protocol. We find that
in most cases the repeated contact scheme has a higher observational entropy value implying that
the observer can extract the most amount of quantum information using this scheme. Finally, we connect
observational entropy with quantum tomography, which gives observational entropy its operational
meaning. Further developed, this quantity could find wide applications in quantum information
processing and help determine the best read-out procedures for quantum memories and computation
outputs of quantum computers.

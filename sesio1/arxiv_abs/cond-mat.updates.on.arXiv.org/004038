Mott transitions in real materials are first order and almost always associated with lattice distortions,
both features promoting the emergence of nanotextured phases. This nanoscale self-organization
creates spatially inhomogeneous regions, which can host and protect transient non-thermal electronic
and lattice states triggered by light excitation. However, to gain full control of the Mott transition
for potential applications in the field of ultrafast switching and neuromorphic computing it is
necessary to develop novel spatial and temporal multiscale experimental probes as well as theoretical
approaches able to distill the complex microscopic physics into a coarse-grained modelling. Here,
we combine time-resolved X-ray microscopy, which snaps phase transformations on picosecond timescales
with nanometric resolution, with a Landau-Ginzburg functional approach for calculating the strain
and electronic real-space configurations. We investigate V$_2$O$_3$, the archetypal Mott insulator
in which nanoscale self-organization already exists in the low-temperature monoclinic phase
and strongly affects the transition towards the high-temperature corundum metallic phase. Our
joint experimental-theoretical approach uncovers a remarkable out-of-equilibrium phenomenon:
the photoinduced stabilisation of the long sought monoclinic metal phase, which is absent at equilibrium
and in homogeneous materials, but emerges as a metastable state solely when light excitation is
combined with the underlying nanotexture of the monoclinic lattice. Our results provide full comprehension
of the nanotexture dynamics across the insulator-to-metal transition, which can be readily extended
to many families of Mott insulating materials. The combination of ultrafast light excitation and
spatial nanotexture turns out to be key to develop novel control protocols in correlated quantum
materials.

The LDA+U method is widely used to study the properties of realistic solids with strong electron
correlations. One of its main shortcomings is that it does not provide direct access to the temperature
dependence of material properties such as the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, the anomalous
Hall conductivity, and the spin-orbit torque. While the method of spectral moments allows us in
principle to compute these quantities directly at finite temperatures, the standard two-pole
approximation can be applied only to Hamiltonians that are effectively of single-band type. We
do a first step to explore if the method of spectral moments may replace the LDA+U method in first-principles
calculations of correlated solids with many bands in cases where the direct assessment of the temperature
dependence of equilibrium and response functions is desired: The spectral moments of many-band
Hamiltonians of correlated electrons do not commute and therefore they do not possess a system of
common eigenvectors. We show that nevertheless the spectral function may be constructed from the
spectral moments by solving a system of coupled non-linear equations. Additionally, we show how
to compute the anomalous Hall conductivity of correlated electrons from this spectral function.
We demonstrate the method for the Hubbard-Rashba model, where the standard two-pole approximation
cannot be applied, because spin-orbit interaction (SOI)couples the spin-up and the spin-down
bands. In the quest for new quantum states that arise from the combination of SOI and correlation
effects, the Hartree-Fock approximation is frequently used to obtain a first approximation for
the phase diagram. We propose that using the many-band generalization of the selfconsistent moment
method instead of Hartree-Fock in such exploratory model calculations may improve the accuracy
significantly, while keeping the computational burden low.

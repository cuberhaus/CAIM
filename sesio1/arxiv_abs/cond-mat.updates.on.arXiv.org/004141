Direct and inverse spin Hall effects lie at the heart of novel applications that utilize spins of
electrons as information carriers, allowing generation of spin currents and detecting them via
the electric voltage. In the standard arrangement, applied electric field induces transverse
spin current with perpendicular spin polarization. Although conventional spin Hall effects are
commonly used in spin-orbit torques or spin Hall magnetoresistance experiments, the possibilities
to configure electronic devices according to specific needs are quite limited. Here, we investigate
unconventional spin Hall effects that have the same origin as conventional ones, but manifest only
in low-symmetry crystals where spin polarization, spin current and charge current are not enforced
to be orthogonal. Based on the symmetry analysis for all 230 space groups, we have identified crystal
structures that could exhibit unusual configurations of charge-to-spin conversion. The most
relevant geometries have been explored in more detail; in particular, we have analyzed the collinear
components yielding transverse charge and spin current with spin polarization parallel to one
of them, as well as the longitudinal ones, where charge and spin currents are parallel. In addition,
we have demonstrated that unconventional spin Hall effect can be induced by controllable breaking
the crystal symmetries by an external electric field, which opens a perspective for external tuning
of spin injection and detection by electric fields. The results have been confirmed by density functional
theory calculations performed for various materials relevant for spintronics. We are convinced
that our findings will stimulate further computational and experimental studies of unconventional
spin Hall effects.

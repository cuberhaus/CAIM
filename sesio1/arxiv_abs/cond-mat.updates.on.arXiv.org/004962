Hydrogen is a promising fossil-fuel alternative fuel owing to its environmentally neutral emissions
and high energy density. However, the need for purified water and external power are critical hindrances
to implementation of hydrogen production. The present work reveals the potential to overcome these
shortcomings through piezo-photocatalysis of seawater using BaTiO3-x (BTO) nanoparticles.
This material was made piezoelectrically active by annealing under different atmospheres, including
O2, N2, Ar, and H2, the latter of which caused Ti4+ to Ti(4-x)+ multiple reductions and structural
expansions that stabilized piezoelectric tetragonal BTO domains. The resultant defect equilibria
combine ionic and electron effects, including Ti redox reactions, charge-compensating surface
oxygen vacancy formation, and color centre alterations. Further, variety of experimental techniques
revealed the effects of reduction on the energy band structure. A strong piezoelectric effect and
the presence of self-polarization were confirmed by piezoresponse force microscopy, while simulation
work clarified the role of vibration on band bending deriving from the former. The performance data
contrasted H2 evolution using deionized (DI) water, simulated seawater, and natural seawater
subjected to photocatalysis, piezocatalysis, and piezo-photocatalysis. An efficient H2 evolution
rate of 132.4 micromol/g/h was achieved from DI water using piezo-photocatalysis for 5 h. In contrast,
piezocatalysis for 2 h followed by piezo-photocatalysis for 3 h resulted in H2 evolution rates of
100.7 micromol/g/h for DI water, 63.4 micromol/g/h for simulated seawater, and 48.7 micromol/g/h
for natural seawater. This work provides potential new strategies for large-scale green H2 production
using abundant natural resources with conventional piezoelectric material while leveraging
the effects of ions dissolved in seawater.

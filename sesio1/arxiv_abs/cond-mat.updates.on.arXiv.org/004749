Both SnS and SnSe have been experimentally and theoretically confirmed as topological crystalline
insulators in native rocksalt structure. Here, phononic structure, thermodynamical properties
and temperature dependent electron-phonon interaction (EPI) have investigated for both the materials
in rocksalt phase. Previously performed theoretical studies have predicted the phase instability
of SnS in this crystal structure at ambient condition. But, after a detailed study performing on
the phonon calculation of SnS, we have predicted the phase stability of SnS with considering the
Sn 4$p$ orbitals as valence states in $ab-initio$ calculation. The importance of long range Coulomb
forces along with the themodynamical properties are also described in detailed for both materials.
The preliminary evidence of topological phonon is found along X-W direction, where the linear band
touching is observed as compared to type II Weyl phononic material ZnSe. The topological phase transition
is seen for these materials due to EPI, where non-linear temperature dependent bandgap is estimated.
The predicted value of transition temperature for SnS (SnSe) is found to be $\sim$700 K, where after
this temperature the non-trivial to trivial topological phase is seen. The strength of EPI shows
more stronger impact on the electronic structure of SnS than SnSe material. The reason of non-linear
behaviour of bandgap with rise in temperature is discussed with the help of temperature dependent
linewidths and lineshifts of conduction band and valence band due to EPI. The present study reveals
the phase stability of SnS along with the comparative study of thermal effect on EPI of SnS and SnSe.
Further, the possibility of temperature induced topological phase transition provides one of
important behaviour to apply these two materials for device making application.

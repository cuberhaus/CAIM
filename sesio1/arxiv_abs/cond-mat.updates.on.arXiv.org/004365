We investigate the tunability of the structural, electronic and magneto transport properties
of polycrystalline Sr2IrO4 sample. The extent of bifurcation of the magnetisation curves during
the field cooled and zero field cooled cycles establishes that the magnetic anisotropy in the as-prepared
sample is more as compared to the vacuum annealed one. Based on the behaviours of the structural parameters
and the magnetic studies, our results show that the canted AFM structure is stabilised in a larger
temperature range in the case of the annealed sample as compared to the as prepared one. At low temperatures,
for both the samples, a phase, possibly of glassy nature competes with the canted AFM phase. The temperature
extent to which both these phases co-exist for the as-prepared and the annealed one is around 115K
an 70K, respectively. The transport studies reveal that for both the samples, in the high temperature
region of study, the conduction mechanism is governed by the Arrhenius model. In the intermediate
temperature range, variable range hopping(VRH) and Arrhenius models govern the transport in the
as-prepared and the annealed one, respectively. At low temperatures, the conduction mechanism
occurs through Efros-Shklovskii-VRH and VRH mechanisms for the as-prepared and the annealed samples,
respectively. The magneto resistance measurements indicate higher negative magneto resistance
in the annealed sample at all temperatures. The field dependence of magneto resistance at 10K suggests
a co-existing glassy magnetic phase along with the canted antiferromagnetic structure in the as
prepared sample and a suppression of this glassy magnetic phase in the annealed sample. The combined
analyses of all the results highlight the role of disorder for the magnetic and trasnport properties
of this compound.

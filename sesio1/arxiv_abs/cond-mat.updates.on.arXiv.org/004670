Space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurements are used to estimate charge carrier mobilities
and electronic trap densities of semiconductors by analysing the current density-voltage (JV)
relationship for unipolar devices predicted by the Mott-Gurney (MG) law. However, the interpretation
of SCLC measurements for metal-halide perovskites is problematic due to mobile ionic defects which
redistribute to screen electrostatic fields in devices during measurements. To overcome this,
an SCLC measurement protocol was recently suggested that minimises ionic charge redistribution
by probing the current during millisecond voltage pulses superimposed on a background bias. Here,
we use drift-diffusion simulations with mobile ions to assess the validity of the MG law for analysing
both the standard and new protocol JV measurements. We simulated idealised perovskite devices
with differing mobile ion densities and compared them with simulations and measurements of devices
with typical contact materials. We found the validity region for the MG law is limited to perovskites
with mobile ion densities lower than the device's equilibrium charge carrier density (<10^17 cm-3
for 400 nm thick methylammonium lead iodide films) and contacts with injection/extraction barriers
<=0.1 eV. The latter limitation can be partially overcome by increasing the device thickness, whereas
the former limitation cannot. This restricts the range of perovskite layer compositions and viable
contact materials that can be reliably analysed with the MG law. Approaches such as estimating trap
densities from the apparent voltage onset to trap-free SCLC regime should also be critically reviewed
since they rely on the same potentially invalid assumptions as the MG law. Our results demonstrate
that extracting meaningful and accurate values for metal halide perovskite material properties
from SCLC maybe challenging, or often not possible.

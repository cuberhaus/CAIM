Linear long-chain organic molecules are known to form lamellar intermediate phases (called also
rotator phases) between their fully ordered crystalline phases and their isotropic liquid phases.
The properties of intermediate rotator phases are crucially important for various industrial
and living nature processes, but the data for their rheological properties are almost missing,
due to the specific difficulties in the respective experiments. In the current study we describe
a methodology for measuring and comparing the shear rheological properties of rotator (R) and crystalline
(C) phases formed in bulk hydrocarbons at temperatures below the melting temperature. We apply
this approach to characterize the rheological properties of R and C phases formed upon cooling of
alkanes with chain length varied between 17 and 30 carbon atoms. For comparison, we study also several
alkane mixtures and one alkene with double bond at the end of its chain. The obtained results show
that the storage and loss moduli of the rotator phases are ca. 10-times lower than those of the respective
crystalline phases. We found also that the rheological properties of the crystal phases depend
mainly on the subcooling temperature below the crystallization temperature, while the R phases
become softer with the increase of the molecular length. We explain these results by assuming that
the rheological properties of the crystal phases are determined mainly by the sliding of the ordered
crystal domains with respect to each other, while in the rotator phases we have multiple defects
in the molecular packing which increase with the alkane length. The proposed methodology and the
obtained results serve as a solid basis for further rheological studies of this important class
of technological systems.

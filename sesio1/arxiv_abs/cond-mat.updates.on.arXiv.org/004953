Durable interfacing of hard and soft materials is a major design challenge caused by the ensuing
stress concentrations. In nature, soft-hard interfaces exhibit remarkable mechanical performance,
with failures rarely happening at the interface but in the hard or soft material. This superior performance
is mechanistically linked to such design features as hierarchical structures, multiple types
of interlocking, and functional gradients. Here, we mimic these strategies to design efficient
soft-hard interfaces using voxel-based multi-material 3D printing. We designed several types
of soft-hard interfaces with interfacial functional gradients and various types of bio-inspired
interlocking mechanisms. The geometrical designs were based on triply periodic minimal surfaces
(i.e., octo, diamond, and gyroid), collagen-like triple helices, and randomly distributed particles.
We utilized a combination of the finite element method and experimental techniques, including
uniaxial tensile tests, quad-lap shear tests, and full-field strain measurement using digital
image correlation, to characterize the mechanical performance of different groups. The analysis
of the best performing designs (i.e., the gyroid, collagen, and particle designs) suggests that
smooth interdigitated connections, compliant gradient transitions, and either decreasing or
constraining the strain concentrations regions between the hard and soft phases led to simultaneously
strong and tough interfaces. Increasing the gradient length was only beneficial when the resulting
interface geometry reduced strain concentrations (e.g., in collagen and particles). Combining
the gyroid-based architecture with a random distribution of particles yielded the best-performing
soft-hard interface, with strengths approaching the upper limit of the possible strengths and
up to 50% toughness enhancement as compared to the control group.

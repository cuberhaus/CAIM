Two-dimensional materials composed of transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) are poised
to revolutionize energy conversion and storage. In this work, we used density functional theory
(DFT) to investigate adsorption of Mg and Na adatoms on five M$_{2}$CS$_{2}$ monolayers (where
M= Mo, Nb, Ti, V, Zr) for battery applications. We assessed the stability of the adatom (i.e. Na and
Mg)-monolayer systems by calculating adsorption and formation energies, as well as voltages as
a function of surface coverage. For instance, we found that Mo$_{2}$CS$_{2}$ cannot support a full
layer of Na nor even a single Mg atom. Na and Mg exhibit the strongest binding on Zr$_{2}$CS$_{2}$,
followed by Ti$_{2}$CS$_{2}$, Nb$_{2}$CS$_{2}$ and V$_{2}$CS$_{2}$. Using the nudged elastic
band method (NEB) we computed promising diffusion barriers for both dilute and nearly-full ion
surface coverage cases. In the dilute ion adsorption case, a single Mg and Na atom on Ti$_{2}$CS$_{2}$
experience $\sim$0.47 eV and $\sim$0.10 eV diffusion barriers between the lowest energy sites,
respectively. For a nearly full surface coverage, a Na ion moving on Ti$_{2}$CS$_{2}$ experiences
a $\sim$0.33 eV energy barrier, implying a concentration dependent diffusion barrier. Our molecular
dynamics results indicate that three (one) layers (layer) of Mg (Na) ion on both surfaces of Ti$_{2}$CS$_{2}$
remain stable at T=300 K. While, according to voltage calculations, Zr$_{2}$CS$_{2}$ can store
Na up to three atomic layers, our MD simulations predict that the outermost layers detach from Zr$_{2}$CS$_{2}$
monolayer due to weak interaction between Na ions and the monolayer. This suggests that MD simulations
are essential to confirming the stability of an ion-electrode system - an insight that is mostly
absence in previous studies.

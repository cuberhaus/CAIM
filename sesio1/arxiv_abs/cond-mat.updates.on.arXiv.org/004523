The tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) effect observed in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) is commonly
used in many spintronic applications because the effect can easily convert from local magnetic
states to electric signals in a wide range of device resistances. In this study, we demonstrated
TMR ratios of up to 631% at room temperature (RT), which is two or more times larger than those used
currently for magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM) devices, using CoFe/MgO/CoFe(001)
epitaxial MTJs. The TMR ratio increased up to 1143% at 10 K, which corresponds to an effective tunneling
spin polarization of 0.923. The observed large TMR ratios resulted from the fine-tuning of atomic-scale
structures of the MTJs, such as crystallographic orientations and MgO interface oxidation, in
which the well-known Delta1 coherent tunneling mechanism for the giant TMR effect is expected to
be pronounced. However, behavior that is not covered by the standard coherent tunneling theory
was unexpectedly manifested; i.e., (i) TMR saturation at a thick MgO barrier region and (ii) enhanced
TMR oscillation with a 0.32 nm period in MgO thickness. Particularly, the TMR oscillatory behavior
dominates the transport in a wide range of MgO thicknesses; the peak-to-valley difference of the
TMR oscillation exceeded 140% at RT, attributable to the appearance of large oscillatory components
in resistance area product (RA). Further, we found that the oscillatory behaviors of the TMR ratio
and RA survive, even under a +-1 V bias voltage application, indicating the robustness of the oscillation.
Our demonstration of the giant RT-TMR ratio will be an essential step for establishing spintronic
architectures, such as large-capacity MRAMs and spintronic artificial neural networks. More
essentially, the present observations can trigger us to revisit the true TMR mechanism in crystalline
MTJs.

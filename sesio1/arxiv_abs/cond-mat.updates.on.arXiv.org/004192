Biomembranes adopt varying morphologies that are vital to cellular functions. Many studies use
computational modeling to understand how various mechanochemical factors contribute to membrane
shape transformations. Compared to approximation-based methods (e.g., finite element method),
the class of discrete mesh models offers greater flexibility to simulate complex physics and shapes
in three dimensions; its formulation produces an efficient algorithm while maintaining coordinate-free
geometric descriptions. However, ambiguities in geometric definitions in the discrete context
have led to a lack of consensus on which discrete mesh model is theoretically and numerically optimal;
a bijective relationship between the terms contributing to both the energy and forces from the discrete
and smooth geometric theories remains to be established. We address this and present an extensible
framework, $\texttt{Mem3DG}$, for modeling 3D mechanochemical dynamics of membranes based on
Discrete Differential Geometry (DDG) on triangulated meshes. The formalism of DDG resolves the
inconsistency and provides a unifying perspective on how to relate the smooth and discrete energy
and forces. To demonstrate, $\texttt{Mem3DG}$ is used to model a sequence of examples with increasing
mechanochemical complexity: recovering classical shape transformations such as 1) biconcave
disk, dumbbell, and unduloid and 2) spherical bud on spherical, flat-patch membrane; investigating
how the coupling of membrane mechanics with protein mobility jointly affects phase and shape transformation.
As high-resolution 3D imaging of membrane ultrastructure becomes more readily available, we envision
Mem3DG to be applied as an end-to-end tool to simulate realistic cell geometry under user-specified
mechanochemical conditions.

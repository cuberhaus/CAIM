Surfactants are often used to stabilise two-dimensional (2D) materials in environmentally friendly
solvents such as water. Aqueous-surfactant solutions prevent agglomeration of nanosheets through
steric and electrostatic repulsion, facilitating the production of high concentration nanomaterial
dispersions. Turbulent, shear-assisted liquid exfoliation of layered precursor materials produces
defect-free nanosheets by promoting mixing and generating sufficiently high shear rates to overcome
out-of-plane van der Waals bonds. In the presence of a liquid-gas interface, a consequence of using
surfactants in turbulent flows is the formation of foam. In this experimental study, batch exfoliation
of graphite particles into few-layer graphene was performed using a kitchen blender modified to
operate across Reynolds numbers, $Re \sim 10^{5} - 10^{6}$. Foam formation during turbulent operation
was found to influence the hydrodynamics of the liquid exfoliation process. Measurements on the
motion of graphite particles indicate that surfactant concentration alters the rheology of the
mixture under dynamic conditions and changes the material flow patterns within the device. As a
result, the surfactant concentration that maximised graphene concentration was non-unique.
This highlights that the design and selection of surfactants should consider both molecular scale
repulsion effectiveness and macroscale hydrodynamics of the liquid exfoliation process. Furthermore,
the multi-phase turbulent flows and complex fluids that exist during batch exfoliation in aqueous-surfactants
create major challenges for realising $\textit{in situ}$ 2D material characterisation and quality
control. Here, we have developed a protocol to enable inline uv-vis-nIR spectroscopy to determine
graphene production and atomic layer number changes in-process.

Single-crystal europium iron garnet (EuIG) thin films epitaxially strain-grown on gadolinium
gallium garnet (GGG)(100) substrates using off-axis sputtering have strain-induced perpendicular
magnetic anisotropy (PMA). By varying the sputtering conditions, we have tuned the europium/iron
(Eu/Fe) composition ratios in the films to tailor the film strains. The films exhibited an extremely
smooth, particle-free surface with roughness as low as 0.1 nm as observed using atomic force microscopy.
High-resolution x-ray diffraction analysis and reciprocal space maps showed in-plane epitaxial
film growth, very smooth film/substrate interface, excellent film crystallinity with a small
full width at half maximum of 0.012$^{\circ}$ in the rocking curve scans, and an in-plane compressive
strain without relaxation. In addition, spherical aberration-corrected scanning transmission
electron microscopy showed an atomically abrupt interface between the EuIG film and GGG. The measured
squarish out-of-plane magnetization-field hysteresis loops by vibrating sample magnetometry
in conjunction with the measurements from angle-dependent x-ray magnetic dichroism demonstrated
the PMA in the films. We have tailored the magnetic properties of the EuIG thin films, including saturation
magnetization ranging from 71.91 to 124.51 emu/c.c. (increase with the (Eu/Fe) ratios), coercive
field from 27 to 157.64 Oe, and the strength of PMA field ($H_\bot$) increasing from 4.21 to 18.87
kOe with the in-plane compressive strain from -0.774 to -1.044%. We have also investigated spin
transport in Pt/EuIG bi-layer structure and evaluated the real part of spin mixing conductance
to be $3.48\times10^{14} {\Omega}^{-1}m^{-2}$. We demonstrated the current-induced magnetization
switching with a low critical switching current density of $3.5\times10^6 A/cm^2$, showing excellent
potential for low-dissipation spintronic devices.

Accelerating the design of materials with targeted properties is one of the key materials informatics
tasks. The most common approach takes a data-driven motivation, where the underlying knowledge
is incorporated in the form of domain-inspired input features. Machine learning (ML) models are
then built to establish the input-output relationships. An alternative approach involves leveraging
mechanistic models, where the domain knowledge is incorporated in a predefined functional form.
These mechanistic models are meticulously formulated through observations to validate specific
hypotheses, and incorporate elements of causality missing from data-driven ML approaches. In
this work, we demonstrate a computational approach that integrates mechanistic models with phenomenological
and ML models to rapidly predict the temperature-dependent yield strength of high entropy alloys
(HEAs) that form in the single-phase face-centered cubic (FCC) structure. Our main contribution
is in establishing a quantitative relationship between the HEA compositions and temperature-dependent
elastic constants. This allows us to improve the treatment of elastic constant mismatch to the solid
solution strengthening effect in the mechanistic model, which is important for reliable prediction
of yield strength as a function of temperature in single-phase FCC-based HEAs. We accomplish this
by combining Bayesian inference with ensemble ML methods. The outcome is a probability distribution
of elastic constants which, when propagated through the mechanistic model, yields a prediction
of temperature-dependent yield strength, along with the uncertainties. The predicted yield strength
shows good agreement with published experimental data, giving us confidence in applying the developed
approach for the rapid search of novel FCC-based HEAs with excellent yield strength at various temperatures.

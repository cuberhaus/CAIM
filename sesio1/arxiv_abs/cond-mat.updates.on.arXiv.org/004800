Micromagnetic modelling provides the ability to simulate large magnetic systems accurately without
the computational cost limitation imposed by atomistic modelling. Through micromagnetic modelling
it is possible to simulate systems consisting of thousands of grains over a time range of nanoseconds
to years, depending upon the solver used. Here we present the creation and release of an open-source
multi-timescale micromagnetic code combining three key solvers: Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert;
Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch; Kinetic Monte Carlo. This code, called MARS (Models of Advanced Recording
Systems), is capable of accurately simulating the magnetisation dynamics in large and structurally
complex single- and multi-layered granular systems. The short timescale simulations are achieved
for systems far from and close to the Curie point via the implemented Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert and
Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch solvers respectively. This enables read/write simulations for general
perpendicular magnetic recording and also state of the art heat assisted magnetic recording (HAMR).
The long timescale behaviour is simulated via the Kinetic Monte Carlo solver, enabling investigations
into signal-to-noise ratio and data longevity. The combination of these solvers opens up the possibility
of multi-timescale simulations within a single software package. For example the entire HAMR process
from initial data writing and data read back to long term data storage is possible via a single simulation
using MARS. The use of atomistic parameterisation for the material input of MARS enables highly
accurate material descriptions which provide a bridge between atomistic simulation and real world
experimentation. Thus MARS is capable of performing simulations for all aspects of recording media
research and development. This ranges from material characterisation and optimisation to system
design and implementation.

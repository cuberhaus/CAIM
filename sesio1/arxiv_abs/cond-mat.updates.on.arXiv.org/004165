Active nematic fluids confined in narrow channels generate spontaneous flows when the activity
is sufficiently intense. Recently, it was shown that if the molecular anchoring at the channel walls
is conflicting flows are initiated even in the zero activity limit. An analytical laminar velocity
profile for this specific configuration was derived within a simplified nematohydrodynamic model
in which the nematic order parameter is a fixed-magnitude unit vector n. In this study we explore
systematically active flows in this confined geometry with a more general theoretical model that
uses a second-rank tensor order parameter Q to express both the magnitude and orientation of the
nematic phase. The Q-model allows for the presence of defects and biaxial, in addition to uniaxial,
molecular arrangements. Our aim is to provide a unified picture, beyond the limiting regime explored
previously, to serve as a guide for potential microfluidic applications. We reveal how the nematic-flow
coupling is not only dependent on geometrical constraints but also highly sensitive to material
and flow parameters. We specifically stress the key role played by the activity and the flow aligning
parameter and we show that solutions depend on two dimensionless parameters. We find that for large
values of the activity parameter the flow is suppressed for contractile particles while is either
sustained or suppressed for extensile particles depending on whether they tend to align or tumble
when subject to shear. We explain these distinct behaviors by an argument based on the results of
the stability analysis applied to simpler configurations. We finally provide a numerical example
of a biaxial three-dimensional thresholdless active flow for which we show that biaxiality is specially
relevant for a weakly first-order isotropic-nematic phase transition.

The ability to minimize the thermal conductivity of dielectrics with minimal structural intervention
that could affect electrical properties is an important capability for engineering thermoelectric
efficiency in low-cost materials such as Si. We recently reported the discovery of special arrangements
for nanoscale pores in Si that produce a particularly large reduction in thermal conductivity accompanied
by strongly anticorrelated heat current fluctuations, a phenomenon that is missed by the diffuse
adiabatic boundary conditions conventionally used in numerical Boltzmann transport models.
This manuscript presents the results of molecular dynamics simulations and a Monte Carlo ray tracing
model that teases apart this phenomenon to reveal that special pore layouts elastically backscatter
long-wavelength heat-carrying phonons. This means that heat carriage by a phonon before scattering
is undone by the scattered phonon, resulting in an effective mean-free-path that is significantly
shorter than the geometric line-of-sight to the pores. This effect is particularly noticeable
for the long-wavelength, long mean-free-path phonons whose transport is impeded drastically
more than is expected purely from the usual considerations of scattering defined by the distance
between defects. This super-suppression of the mean-free-path below the characteristic length
scale of the nanostructuring offers a route for minimizing thermal conductivity with minimal structural
impact, while the stronger impact on long wavelengths offers possibilities for the design of band-pass
phonon filtering. Moreover, the ray tracing model developed in this paper shows that different
forms of correlated scattering imprint a unique signature in the heat current autocorrelation
function that could be used as a diagnostic in other nanostructured systems.

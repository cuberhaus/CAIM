Plasticity in amorphous materials, such as glasses, colloids, or granular materials, is mediated
by local rearrangements called "soft spots". Experiments and simulations have shown that soft
spots are two-state entities interacting via quadrupolar displacement fields generated when
they switch states. When the system is subjected to cyclic strain driving, the soft spots can return
to their original state after one or more forcing cycles. In this case, the system has periodic dynamics
and will always repeat the same microscopic states. Here we focus on multi-periodic dynamics, i.e.
dynamics that has periodicity larger than the periodicity of the drive, and use a graph-theoretical
approach to analyze the dynamics obtained from numerical simulations. In this approach, mechanically
stable configurations that transform purely elastically into each other over a range of applied
strains, are represented by vertices, and plastic events leading from one stable configuration
to the other, are represented by directed edges. An algorithm based on the graph topology and the
displacement fields of the soft spots reveals that multi-periodic behavior results from the states
of some soft spots repeating after more than one period and provides information regarding the mechanisms
that allow for such dynamics. To better understand the physical mechanisms behind multi-periodicity,
we use a model of interacting hysterons. Each hysteron is a simplified two-state element representing
hysteretic soft-spot dynamics. We identify several mechanisms for multi-periodicity in this
model, some involving direct interactions between multi-periodic hysterons and another resulting
from cooperative dynamics involving several hysterons. These cooperative events are naturally
more common when more hysterons are present, thus explaining why multi-periodicity is more prevalent
at large drive amplitudes.

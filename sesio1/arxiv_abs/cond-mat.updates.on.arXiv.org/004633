Epitaxial Si-doped GaN films were grown on $\textit{c}$-sapphire by rf magnetron reactive co-sputtering
of GaAs and Si at different N$_2$ percentages in Ar-N$_2$ atmosphere. High-resolution x-ray diffraction
and $\phi$-scans reveal the mosaic growth of $\textit{c}$-axis oriented GaN films. Energy dispersive
x-ray spectroscopy reveal $\thicksim$2 at.% Si in all the films, while the N/Ga ratio decreased
substantially with N$_2$ percentage in sputtering atmosphere. The micro-strain, screw and edge
dislocation densities were respectively obtained from $\omega$-2$\theta$, $\omega$, and in-plane
$\phi$-rocking scans. The films grown at 30%-100% N$_2$ reveal dominance of edge over screw dislocations,
with both approaching similar densities at lower N$_2$ percentages. The $\textit{c}$ and $\textit{a}$
parameters were independently determined to obtain the out-of-plane and in-plane strain components.
The strain data was analyzed to separate hydrostatic and biaxial contributions and their dependences
on N$_2$ percentage. The film grown at 100% N$_2$ displays large hydrostatic strain and micro-strain,
attributed to excess/interstitial nitrogen. Both hydrostatic strain and micro-strain decrease
substantially with initial decrease of N$_2$ percentage, but increase slightly in the films grown
below 30% N$_2$, due to the incorporation of Ar. The films grown at $\gtrsim$75% N$_2$ reveal growth
related, intrinsic biaxial stress, which is compressive and is attributed to the incorporation
of excess nitrogen into grain boundaries and tensile side of edge dislocations. The films grown
below 75% N$_2$ display stress reversal owing to the prevalence of coalescence related intrinsic
tensile stress, which decreases in the films grown below 30% N$_2$, due to the incorporation of Ar
and their voided structure.

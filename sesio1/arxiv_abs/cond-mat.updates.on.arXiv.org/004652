In a heterogeneous medium, the wavefield can be decomposed as an infinite series known as the Born
expansion. Each term of the Born expansion corresponds to a scattering order, it is thus theoretically
possible to discriminate single and multiple scattering field components. Experimentally, what
is actually measured is the total field in which all scattering orders interfere. Conventional
imaging methods usually rely on the assumption that the multiple scattering contribution can be
disregarded. In a back-scattering configuration, this assumption is valid for small depths, and
begins to fail for depths larger than the scattering mean-free path $\ell_s$. It is therefore a key
issue to estimate the relative amount of single and multiple scattering in experimental data. To
this end, a single scattering estimator $\hat{\rho}$ computed from the reflection matrix has been
introduced in order to assess the weight of single scattering in the backscattered wavefield. In
this article, the meaning of this estimator is investigated and a particular attention is given
to recurrent scattering. In a diffraction-limited experiment, a multiple scattering sequence
is said to be recurrent if the first and last scattering events occur in the same resolution cell.
Recurrent scattering is shown to be responsible for correlations between single scattering and
higher scattering orders of the Born expansion, inducing a bias to the estimator $\hat{\rho}$ that
should rather be termed confocal scattering ratio. Interestingly, a more robust estimator is built
by projecting the reflection matrix in a focused basis. The argument is sustained by numerical simulations
as well as ultrasonic data obtained around 1.5~MHz in a model medium made of nylon rods immersed in
water. From a more general perspective, this work raises fundamental questions about the impact
of recurrent scattering on wave imaging.

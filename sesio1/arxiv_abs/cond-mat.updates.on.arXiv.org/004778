Space-time correlations are central objects in the statistical theory of turbulence and their
modelling plays a crucial role in many applications. Simple phenomenological arguments, such
as the Tennekes-Kraichnan random sweeping hypothesis, has proven particularly useful in this
respect. However, it remains to be explained how such a simple description can emerge from the highly
complex multi-scale nature of turbulence. Recently, the functional renormalisation group (FRG)
has rooted important progress in this direction for homogeneous isotropic and stationary turbulence.
Indeed, it has allowed for the rigorous derivation, from the Navier-Stokes equation, of an analytical
expression for any Eulerian multi-point multi-time correlation function in the limit of large
wavenumbers. The corresponding expression for the two-point function confirms the effect of sweeping
at small time-delays and yields its precise form, while it unveils a crossover to another regime
at large time delays characterised by a slower decay. Moreover, the description of the spatio-temporal
behaviour is extended for all $n$-point correlation functions. In this paper, we propose an overview
of these results and more generally of the FRG method for turbulence. We give a basic introduction
to the FRG and emphasise how the field-theoretical framework allows one to systematically and profoundly
exploit the symmetries. We show the existence of a fixed-point which controls turbulence for large-scale
forcing, which is accessible owing to the non-perturbative nature of the FRG. The major part of the
paper is devoted to expounding the spatio-temporal behaviour of correlation functions, and largely
illustrating these results through the analysis of direct numerical simulations of homogeneous
isotropic turbulence, and also scalar turbulence.

In the modern electronics overheating is one of the major reasons for device failure. Overheating
causes irreversible damage to circuit components and can also lead to fire, explosions, and injuries.
Accordingly, in the advent of 2D material-based electronics, an understanding of their thermal
properties in addition to their electric ones is crucial to enable efficient transfer of excess
heat away from the electronic components. In this work we propose structures based on free-standing,
few-layer, nanopatterned MoS2 that insulate and guide heat in the in-plane direction. We arrive
at these designs via a thorough study of the in-plane thermal conductivity as a function of thickness,
porosity, and temperature in both pristine and nanopatterned MoS2 membranes. Two-laser Raman
thermometry was employed to measure the thermal conductivities of a set of free-standing MoS2 flakes
with diameters greater than 20 um and thicknesses from 5 to 40 nm, resulting in values from 30 to 85
W/mK, respectively. After nanopatterning a square lattice of 100-nm diameter holes with a focused
ion beam we have obtained a greater than 10-fold reduction of the thermal conductivities for the
period of 500 nm and values below 1 W/mK for the period of 300 nm. The results were supported by equilibrium
molecular dynamic simulations for both pristine and nanopatterned MoS2. The selective patterning
of certain areas results in extremely large difference in thermal conductivities within the same
material. Exploitation of this effect enabled for the first time thermal insulation and heat guiding
in the few-layer MoS2. The patterned regions act as high thermal resistors: we obtained a thermal
resistance of 4x10-6 m2K/W with only four patterned lattice periods of 300 nm, highlighting the
significant potential of MoS2 for thermal management applications.

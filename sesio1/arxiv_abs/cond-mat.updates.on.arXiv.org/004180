Applying the strong pinning formalism to the mixed state of a type II superconductor, we study the
effect of thermal fluctuations (or creep) on the penetration of an ac magnetic field as quantified
by the so-called Campbell length $\lambda_\textrm{C}$. Within strong pinning theory, vortices
get pinned by individual defects, with the jumps in the pinning energy ($\Delta e_\mathrm{pin}$)
and force ($\Delta f_\mathrm{pin}$) between bistable pinned and free states quantifying the pinning
process. We find that the evolution of the Campbell length $\lambda_{\rm C}(t)$ as a function of
time $t$ is the result of two competing effects, the change in the force jumps $\Delta f_\mathrm{pin}(t)$
and a change in the trapping area $S_\mathrm{trap}(t)$ of vortices; the latter describes the area
around the defect where a nearby vortex gets and remains trapped. Contrary to naive expectation,
we find that during the decay of the critical state in a zero-field cooled (ZFC) experiment, the Campbell
length $\lambda_{\rm C}(t)$ is usually nonmonotonic, first decreasing with time $t$ and then increasing
for long waiting times. Field cooled (FC) experiments exhibit hysteretic effects in $\lambda_\textrm{C}$;
relaxation then turns out to be predominantly monotonic, but its magnitude and direction depends
on the specific phase of the cooling--heating cycle. Furthermore, when approaching equilibrium,
the Campbell length relaxes to a finite value, different from the persistent current which vanishes
at long waiting times $t$, e.g., above the irreversibility line. Finally, measuring the Campbell
length $\lambda_\textrm{C}(t)$ for different states, zero-field cooled, field cooled, and relaxed,
as a function of different waiting times $t$ and temperatures $T,$ allows to "spectroscopyse" the
pinning potential of the defects.

Reversible logic can provide lower switching energy costs relative to all irreversible logic,
including those developed by industry in semiconductor circuits, however, more research is needed
to understand what is possible. Superconducting logic, an exemplary platform for both irreversible
and reversible logic, uses flux quanta to represent bits, and the reversible implementation may
switch state with low energy dissipation relative to the energy of a flux quantum. Here we simulate
reversible shift register gates that are ballistic -- their operation is powered by the input bits
alone. A storage loop is added relative to previous gates as a key innovation, which bestows an asynchronous
property such that input bits can arrive at different times as long as their order is clearly preserved.
The shift register represents bit states by flux polarity, both in the stored bit as well as the ballistic
input and output bits. Its operation consists of the elastic swapping of flux between the stored
and the moving bit. This is related to a famous irreversible shift register, developed prior to the
advent of superconducting flux quanta logic (which used irreversible gates). In the base design
of our ballistic shift register (BSR) there is one 1-input and 1-output port, but we find that we can
make other asynchronous ballistic gates by extension. For example, we show that two BSRs operate
in sequence without power added, giving a 2-bit sequential memory. We also show that a BSR with two
input and two output ports allows a bit state to be set from one input port and then conveyed out on either
output port. The gate constitutes the first asynchronous reversible 2-input gate. Finally, for
a better insight into the dynamics, we introduce a collective coordinate model, where motion reduces
to two coordinates and is subject to a potential determined by the input bit and initial stored flux
quantum.

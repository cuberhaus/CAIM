In the few-body problems, it is not a trivial task to make use of the zero-range model for two-body
interaction, which manifests, e.~g., in the appearance of Efimov or Thomas effects. One particular
modification of zero-range interaction in the three-body problem was suggested in the influential
paper by Minlos and Faddeev. A main idea was to introduce an additional regularizing term, which
diminishes the interaction strength in vicinity of the triple-collision point. It was shown and
approved in a number of following papers that the Efimov or Thomas effects are suppressed if the parameter
$\sigma$, which characterizes a strength of the regularizing term, exceeds the explicitly given
critical value $\sigma_c$. Furthermore, it was declared that the condition $ \sigma \ge \sigma_c
$ is sufficient for unambiguous description of the three-body problem. In the present study of the
modification proposed by Minlos and Faddeev, another critical value $\sigma_r$ ($\sigma_r >\sigma_c$)
is found and it is shown that the parameter $ \sigma $ should exceed $ \sigma_r $ in order to regularize
the three-body problem. A detailed analysis is given for the interval $\sigma_c\le\sigma<\sigma_r$,
in which the three-body problem is unambiguously defined by imposing an additional one-parameter
boundary condition in the triple-collision point. These considerations are explicitly demonstrated
and the critical values of $\sigma$ are determined for a two-component system consisting of two
identical bosons interacting with a distinct particle and for three identical bosons. To elucidate
the described formulation of the regularizing problem, dependence of the bound-state energy on
$\sigma$ and the parameter describing a boundary condition in the triple-collision point is determined
for three identical bosons and $\sigma_c\le\sigma<\sigma_r$.

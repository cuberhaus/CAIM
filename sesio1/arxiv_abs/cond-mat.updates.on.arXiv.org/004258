Accurate and economical modeling of near-surface transport processes is a standing challenge
for various engineering and atmospheric boundary-layer flows. In this paper, we address this challenge
by utilizing a stochastic one-dimensional turbulence (ODT) model. ODT aims to resolve all relevant
scales of a turbulent flow for a one-dimensional domain. Here ODT is applied to turbulent channel
flow as stand-alone tool. The ODT domain is a wall-normal line that is aligned with the mean shear.
The free model parameters are calibrated once for the turbulent velocity boundary layer at a fixed
Reynolds number. After that, we use ODT to investigate the Schmidt ($Sc$), Reynolds ($Re$), and
Peclet ($Pe$) number dependence of the scalar boundary-layer structure, turbulent fluctuations,
transient surface fluxes, mixing, and transfer to a wall. We demonstrate that the model is able to
resolve relevant wall-normal transport processes across the turbulent boundary layer and that
it captures state-space statistics of the surface scalar-flux fluctuations. In addition, we show
that the predicted mean scalar transfer, which is quantified by the Sherwood ($Sh$) number, self-consistently
reproduces established scaling regimes and asymptotic relations. For high asymptotic $Sc$ and
$Re$, ODT results fall between the Dittus--Boelter, $Sh\sim Re^{4/5}\,Sc^{2/5}$, and Colburn,
$Sh\sim Re^{4/5}\,Sc^{1/3}$, scalings but they are closer to the former. For finite $Sc$ and $Re$,
the model prediction reproduces the relation proposed by Schwertfirm and Manhart (Int. J. Heat
Fluid Flow, vol. 28, pp. 1204-1214, 2007) that yields locally steeper effective scalings than any
of the established asymptotic relations. The model extrapolates the scalar transfer to small asymptotic
$Sc\ll Re_\tau^{-1}$ (diffusive limit) with a functional form that has not been previously described.

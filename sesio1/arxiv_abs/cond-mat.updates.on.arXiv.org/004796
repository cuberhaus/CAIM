Tiny-shaped particles are the building blocks for bigger-shaped particles. In a solution-based
process, atoms amalgamate at an electronically flat solution surface on dissociation from the
precursor. The monolayer assembly is related to the amalgamated atoms at the solution surface.
Supplied packets of nanoenergy under the input source develop triangular shape tiny particles
from the monolayer assembly. Due to the formation of the concave meniscus, such tiny particles,
when just entering the electronically decreasing level solution surface, convert atoms of arrays
into the structures of smooth elements. Triangular shape tiny particles assemble to nucleate a
mono layer shape. Monolayer and mono layer stand for different meanings here. To extend the mono
layer shape, structures of smooth elements in later coalesced tiny-shaped particles adhere adjacently.
At an electronically flat solution surface, atoms bind in the shapes of supplied nanoenergy packets.
A block of connected triangular shape tiny particles gets developed under the bipolar mode of the
pulse. When leaving the electronically flat solution surface, the block of connected triangular
shape tiny particles dismantles into two equal tiny-shaped particles. At an electronically decreasing
level solution surface, the combined action of forces exerting in the immersing format elongates
the atoms. In elongation, an array of atoms converts into the smooth element structure. Those photons,
which are traveling parallel with the air-solution interface, they further flatten the structures
of smooth elements. On assembling the tiny-shaped particles and adhering to the structures of smooth
elements in an adjacent manner, a nucleated mono layer extends. In the upper shaped mono layer, a
force of gravity becomes more significant than the force of levity. The opposite is the case in the
lower shaped mono layer. Only a few microseconds ...

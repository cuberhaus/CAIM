The optimization of surface finish to improve performance, such as adhesion, friction, wear, fatigue
life, or interfacial transport, occurs largely through trial-and-error, despite significant
advancements in the relevant science. There are three central challenges that account for this
disconnect: (1) the challenge of integration of many different types of measurement for the same
surface to capture the multi-scale nature of roughness; (2) the technical complexity of implementing
spectral analysis methods and mechanical or numerical models describing surface performance;
(3) a lack of consistency between researchers and industries in how surfaces are measured, quantified,
and communicated. Here we present a freely-available internet-based application (available
at https://contact.engineering) which attempts to overcome all three challenges. First, the
application enables the user to upload a set of topography measurements from a single surface, and
then integrates all of them together to create a digital surface twin. Second, the application calculates
many of the commonly used topography metrics, such as root-mean-square parameters, power spectral
density (PSD), and autocorrelation function (ACF), as well as implementing analytical and numerical
calculations, such as boundary element modeling (BEM) for elastic and plastic deformation. Third,
the application serves as a repository for users to securely store surfaces, and if they choose,
to share these with collaborators or even publish them (with a digital object identifier) for all
to access. The primary goal of this application is to enable experimental researchers to quickly
and easily characterize the topography, and predict the contact properties for real-world surfaces.
An additional goal is that computer-generated topographies can be analyzed to aid in the search
for alternative surface finishes with improved properties.

The perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) at magnetic transition metal/oxide interfaces is
a key element in building out-of-plane magnetized magnetic tunnel junctions for spin-transfer-torque
magnetic random access memory (STT-MRAM). Size downscaling renders magnetic properties more
sensitive to thermal effects. Thus, understanding the temperature dependence of the magnetic
anisotropy is crucial. In this work, we theoretically address the correlation between temperature
dependence of PMA and magnetization in typical Fe/MgO-based structures. In particular, the possible
mechanisms behind the experiments reporting deviations from the Callen and Callen scaling power
law are analyzed. At ideal interfaces, first-principles calculations reveal (i) small high-order
anisotropy constants compared to first order and (ii) enhanced exchange constants. Considering
these two intrinsic effects in the atomistic simulations, the temperature-dependence of the total
and layer-resolved anisotropy are found to follow the Callen and Callen scaling power law, thus
ruling out an intrinsic microscopic mechanism underlying deviations from this law. Besides, two
possible extrinsic macroscopic mechanisms are unveiled namely the influence of the dead layer,
often present in the storage layer of STT-MRAM cells, and the spatial inhomogeneities of the interfacial
magnetic anisotropy. About the first mechanism, we show that the presence of a dead layer tends to
reduce the scaling exponents. In the second mechanism, increasing the percentage of inhomogeneity
in the interfacial PMA is revealed to decrease the scaling exponent. These results allow us to explain
the difference in scaling exponents relating anisotropy and magnetization thermal variations
reported in earlier experiments. This is crucial for the understanding of the thermal stability
of the storage layer magnetization in STT-MRAM applications.

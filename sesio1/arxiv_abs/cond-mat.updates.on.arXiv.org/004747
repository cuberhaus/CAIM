Thermally expanded graphite (EG) polymer composite has high potential in modern thermoelectronic
industry due to cost effectiveness, excellent electrical and thermal properties. In this study,
we report that expanded graphite polyetherimide(EG/PEID) composite has been fabricated by simple
solution mixing technique, reinforcing a low cost EG filler into host polymer matrix, polyetherimide
(PEID). This technique enables the inclusion of 3D graphitic filler into polymer matrix retaining
the worm structure of expanded graphite, thus developing continuous network throughout the composite.
In result, ~19 orders of magnitude rise of the polymers electrical conductivity up to 969 S/m has
been achieved upon the inclusion of the 10wt% of EG filler. Theoretical prediction using effective
medium approach reveals the impact of an imperfectly conducting interface and interfacial tunneling
on electrical conductivity of the composites. We also report that 10wt% EG filler composition composite
exhibits the thermal conductivity (k) value of 7.3W/mK, implying significant enhancement of 3070%
compared to pure PEID. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) represents the morphology of fillers
and composites, revealing the preserved structure of EG to develop the conductive pathway between
polymer and filler. Investigation on the structural properties before and after the thermal expansion
of EG fillers has been performed using Raman, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
(XPS) analysis. In summary, a simple fabrication route of solution mixing has been demonstrated
to achieve an outstanding electrically and thermally conductive EG/PEID composite without compromising
the efficiency of EG filler structure. The expanded graphite-based polymer composites can retain
their outstanding properties in wide range of thermal and electronic industry.

We discuss the properties of topologically nontrivial superconducting phases and the conditions
for their realization in condensed matter, and the principles for identifying Majorana bound states
(MBSs). Along with the well-known Kitaev chain and superconducting nanowire (SW) models with spin-orbit
coupling in an external magnetic field, we discuss models of quasi-2D materials in which MBSs are
realized in the presence of noncollinear spin ordering. For finite-length SWs, we demonstrate
a cascade of quantum transitions occurring with a change in the magnetic field, accompanied by a
change in the fermion parity of the ground state. The corresponding anomalous behavior of the magnetocaloric
effect can be used as a tool for identifying MBSs. We devote considerable attention to the analysis
of the transport characteristics of devices that contain topologically nontrivial materials.
The results of studying the conductance of an Aharonov-Bohm ring whose arms are connected by an SW
are discussed in detail. An important feature of this device is the appearance of Fano resonances
in the dependence of conductance on the magnetic field when the SW is in a topologically nontrivial
phase. We establish a relation between the characteristics of such resonances and the spatial structure
of the lowest-energy SW state. The conditions for the occurrence of an MBS in the phase of the coexistence
of chiral $d+id$ superconductivity and 120-degree spin ordering are determined in the framework
of the $t-J-V$ model on a triangular lattice. We take electron-electron interactions into account
in discussing the topological invariants of low-dimensional superconducting materials with
noncollinear spin ordering. The formation of Majorana modes in regions with an odd value of a topological
$\mathbb{Z}$ invariant is demonstrated. The spatial structure of these excitations in the Hubbard
fermion ensemble is determined.

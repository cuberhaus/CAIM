We propose a versatile, user-friendly approach, named (Computing Debye's scattering formula
for Extraordinary Formfactors) (CDEF), to approximately calculate scattering profiles of arbitrarily
shaped nanoparticles for small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) using Debye's scattering formula.
This equation generally allows to compute the scattering pattern of an ensemble of scatterers with
a known form factor in the kinematic limit. The ensemble can hereby consist of atoms, atomic nuclei
or larger shapes. In the method proposed in this paper, a quasi-randomly distributed point cloud
in the desired particle shape is generated. Then, Debye's formula is applied to this ensemble of
point scatterers to calculate the SAXS pattern of a single particle with random orientation. The
quasi-random distribution ensures faster convergence compared to a true random distribution
of scatterers, especially in the higher region of the momentum transfer. In order to compute realistic
SAXS curves of polydisperse nanoparticle ensembles with a given size distribution, the single
particle master curve is rescaled and convolved with the size distribution. This allows us to fit
measured data in reasonable time. We have used the method to evaluate scattering data of Au nanocubes
with truncated or rounded edges. Our implementation of this method is fast enough to run on a single
desktop computer and perform model fits within minutes. The accuracy of the method was analyzed
by comparison with analytically known form factors and another implementation, the SPONGE, based
on a similiar principle but with fewer assumptions. Additionally, the SPONGE coupled to McSAS3
allows us to further retrieve information on the uncertainty of the size distribution using a Monte-Carlo
uncertainty estimation algorithm.

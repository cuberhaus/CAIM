An original thermodynamically consistent large strains-based multiphase phase-field (PF) approach
of Ginzburg-Landau type is developed for studying the grain boundary (GB)-induced martensitic
transformations (MTs) in polycrystalline materials at the nanoscale considering the structural
stresses within the interfaces. In this general PF approach, N independent order parameters are
used for describing the austenite (A)<->martensite (M) transformations and N(>1) martensitic
variants, and another M independent order parameters are considered for describing M(>1) grains
in the polycrystalline samples. The change in the GB energy due to its structural rearrangement
during MTs is considered using variable energy for the GB(s) as a function of the order parameter
related to the A<->M transformation. A rich plot for the temperatures of transformations between
the A, premartensite, and M in a bicrystal with a symmetric planar tilt GB are plotted for the varying
austenitic GB width. The strong effects of the parameters, including the austenitic GB width, change
in GB energy due to MTs, GB misorientation, applied strains, and sample size on heterogeneous nucleation
of the phases and the subsequent complex martensitic microstructures evolution are explored in
various bicrystals with symmetric or asymmetric planar or circular tilt GBs during the forward
and reverse transformations. The triple junction (TJ) energy and the energy and width of the adjacent
GBs are also shown to strongly influence the nucleation and microstructures using the tricrystals
having three symmetric planar tilt GBs. The compatibility of the microstructures across the GBs
is studied. The elastic and structural stresses across the GBs and TJ regions are plotted, which
is essential for understanding the role of GBs and TJs in materials failure.

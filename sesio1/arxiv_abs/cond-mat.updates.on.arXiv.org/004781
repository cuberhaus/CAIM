The constant potential molecular dynamics simulation method proposed by Siepmann and Sprik and
reformulated later by Reed (SR-CPM) has been widely employed to investigate the metallic electrolyte/electrode
interfaces, especially for conducting nanochannels with complex connectivity, *e.g.*, carbide-derived
carbon or graphene-assembled membrane. This work makes substantial extensions of this seminal
SR-CPM approach. First, we introduce two numerical techniques to determine electrode atom charges
with an order of magnitude improvement in computational efficiency compared with those widely
employed methods. The first numerical technique dramatically accelerates the to calculation
of the Ewald interaction matrix $\mathbf{E}$, which takes advantage of the existing highly optimised
electrostatic codes. The second technique introduces a new preconditioning technique in the conjugate
gradient method to considerably increase the computational efficiency of a linear equation system
that determines electrode atomic charges. Our improved SR-CPM implemented in the LAMMPS package
can handle extra-large systems, *e.g.*, over 8.1 million electrode atoms. Second, after demonstrating
the importance of the electroneutrality constraint, we propose a two-step method to enforce electroneutrality
in the following post-treatment step, applicable for matrix and iterative techniques. Third,
we propose a solid theoretical analysis for the adjustable parameter $\alpha_i$ (namely the atomic
Hubbard-U $U_i^0$), which is arbitrarily selected in many SR-CPM simulation practices. We proposed
that the optimised $\alpha_i$ or $U_i^0$ should compensate for the electrical potential/energy
discrepancy between the discrete atomistic model and the continuum limit. The analytical and optimal
${\alpha}_i^0$ values are derived for a series of 2D materials.

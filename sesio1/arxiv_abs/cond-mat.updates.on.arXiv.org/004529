We report multipronged progress on the stochastic averaging approach to numerical analytic continuation
of quantum Monte Carlo data. With the sampled spectrum parametrized with delta-functions in continuous
frequency space, a calculation of the configurational entropy lends support to a simple goodness-of-fit
criterion for the optimal sampling temperature. To further investigate entropic effects, we compare
spectra sampled in continuous frequency with results of amplitudes sampled on a fixed frequency
grid. We demonstrate equivalences between sampling and optimizing spectral functions with the
maximum-entropy approach with different forms of the entropy. These insights revise prevailing
notions of the maximum-entropy method and its relationship to stochastic analytic continuation.
We further explore various adjustable (optimized) constraints that allow sharp spectral features
to be resolved, in particular at the lower frequency edge. The constraints, e.g., the location of
the edge or the spectral weight of a quasi-particle peak, are optimized using a statistical criterion.
We show that this method can correctly reproduce both narrow and broad quasi-particle peaks. We
next introduce a parametrization for more intricate spectral functions with sharp edges, e.g.,
power-law singularities. Tests with synthetic data as well as with real simulation data for the
spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain demonstrate that constrained sampling methods can reproduce spectral
functions with sharp edge features at unprecedented fidelity. We present new results for S=1/2
Heisenberg 2-leg and 3-leg ladders to illustrate the ability of the methods to resolve spectral
features arising from both elementary and composite excitations. Finally, we also propose how
the methods developed here could be used as "pre processors" for analytic continuation by machine
learning.

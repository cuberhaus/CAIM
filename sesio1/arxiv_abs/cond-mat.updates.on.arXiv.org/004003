Motivated by the recent proposals for unconventional emergent physics in twisted bilayers of nodal
superconductors, we study the peculiarities of the Josephson effect at the twisted interface between
$d$-wave superconductors. We demonstrate that for clean interfaces with a twist angle $\theta_0$
in the range $0^\circ<\theta_0<45^\circ$ the critical current can exhibit nonmonotonic temperature
dependence with a maximum at a nonzero temperature as well as a complex dependence on the twist angle
at low temperatures. The former is shown to arise quite generically due to the contributions of the
momenta around the gap nodes, which are negative for nonzero twist angles. It is demonstrated that
these features reflect the geometry of the Fermi surface and are sensitive to the form of the momentum
dependence of the tunneling at the twisted interface. Close to $\theta_0=45^\circ$ we find that
the critical current does not vanish due to Cooper pair cotunneling, which leads to a transition
to a time-reversal breaking topological superconducting $d+id$ phase. Weak interface roughness,
quasiperiodicity, and inhomogeneity broaden the momentum dependence of the interlayer tunneling
leading to a critical current $I_c\sim \cos(2\theta_0)$ with $\cos(6\theta_0)$ corrections.
Furthermore, strong disorder at the interface is demonstrated to suppress the time-reversal breaking
superconducting phase near $\theta_0=45^\circ$. Last, we provide a comprehensive theoretical
analysis of experiments that can reveal the full current-phase relation for twisted superconductors
close to $\theta_0=45^\circ$. In particular, we demonstrate the emergence of the Fraunhofer interference
pattern near $\theta_0=45^\circ$, while accounting for realistic sample geometries, and show
that its temperature dependence can yield unambiguous evidence of Cooper pair cotunneling, necessary
for topological superconductivity.

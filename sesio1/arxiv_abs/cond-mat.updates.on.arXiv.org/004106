Magnetic ordering in topological insulators (TI) is crucial for breaking time-reversal symmetry
(TRS) and thereby opening a gap in the topological surface states (TSSs) [1-6], which is the key for
realizing useful topological properties such as the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect, axion
insulator state and the topological magnetoelectric effect. Combining TIs with magnetic materials
can be expected to yield interfaces [26-28] with unique topological and magnetic phases but such
interfaces largely remain unexplored. Here, we report the discovery of a novel antiferromagnetic
(AFM) Van der Waals (VdW) phase at the interface of a sputtered c-axis oriented TI/FM (Bi2Te3/Ni80Fe20)
heterostructure due to the formation of a Ni-intercalated Bi2Te3 VdW interfacial layer. The TI/FM
heterostructure is shown to possess a significant spontaneous exchange bias and the presence of
an AFM order at the interface via measurements of the hysteresis loop as well as the observation of
compensated magnetic moments at the interface using polarized neutron reflectometry (PNR). An
in-depth analysis of the structural and chemical properties of the interfacial AFM phase was carried
out using selected area electron diffraction (SAED), electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS),
and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). These studies show evidence of solid-state reaction
between the intercalated Ni atoms and Bi2Te3 layers and of the formation of topologically nontrivial
magnetic VdW compounds. The N\'eel temperature of the interfacial AFM phase is 63 K, which is higher
than that of typical magnetic topological insulators [53]. Our study shows how industrial CMOS-process-compatible
sputtered TI/FM heterostructures can provide a novel materials platform for exploring the emergence
of interfacial topological magnetic phases and high-temperature topological magnetic states.

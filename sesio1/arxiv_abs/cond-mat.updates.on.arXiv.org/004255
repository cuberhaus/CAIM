Spintronics and quantum information science are two promising candidates for innovating information
processing technologies. The combination of these two fields enables us to build solid-state platforms
for studying quantum phenomena and for realizing multi-functional quantum tasks. For a long time,
however, the intersection of these two fields was limited. This situation has changed significantly
over the last few years because of the remarkable progress in coding and processing information
using magnons. On the other hand, significant advances in understanding the entanglement of quasi-particles
and in designing high-quality qubits and photonic cavities for quantum information processing
provide physical platforms to integrate magnons with quantum systems. From these endeavours,
the highly interdisciplinary field of quantum magnonics emerges, which combines spintronics,
quantum optics and quantum information science.Here, we give an overview of the recent developments
concerning the quantum states of magnons and their hybridization with mature quantum platforms.
First, we review the basic concepts of magnons and quantum entanglement and discuss the generation
and manipulation of quantum states of magnons, such as single-magnon states, squeezed states and
quantum many-body states including Bose-Einstein condensation and the resulting spin superfluidity.
We discuss how magnonic systems can be integrated and entangled with quantum platforms including
cavity photons, superconducting qubits, nitrogen-vacancy centers, and phonons for coherent
information transfer and collaborative information processing. The implications of these hybrid
quantum systems for non-Hermitian physics and parity-time symmetry are highlighted, together
with applications in quantum memories and high-precision measurements. Finally, we present an
outlook on the opportunities in quantum magnonics.

We study the evolution of temperature-dependent resistivity with controlled point-like disorder
induced by 2.5 MeV electron irradiation in stoichiometric compositions of the "3-4-13" stannides,
$(\text{Ca,Sr})_{3}(\text{Ir,Rh})_{4}\text{Sn}_{13}$.Three of these cubic compounds exhibit
a microscopic coexistence of charge-density wave (CDW) order and superconductivity (SC), while
$\text{Ca}_{3}\text{Rh}_{4}\text{Sn}_{13}$ does not develop CDW order. As expected, the CDW
transition temperature, $T_{\text{CDW}}$, is universally suppressed by irradiation in all three
compositions. The superconducting transition temperature, $T_{c}$, behaves in a more complex
manner. In $\text{Sr}_{3}\text{Rh}_{4}\text{Sn}_{13}$, it increases initially in a way consistent
with a direct competition of CDW and SC, but quickly saturates at higher irradiation doses. In the
other three compounds, $T_{c}$ is monotonically suppressed by irradiation. The strongest suppression
is found in $\text{Ca}_{3}\text{Rh}_{4}\text{Sn}_{13}$, which does not have CDW order. We further
examine this composition by measuring the London penetration depth, $\lambda(T)$, from which
we derive the superfluid density. The result unambiguously points to a weak-coupling, full single
gap, isotropic superconducting state. Therefore, we must explain two seemingly incompatible
experimental observations: a single isotropic superconducting gap and a significant suppression
of $T_{c}$ by non-magnetic disorder. We conduct a quantitative theoretical analysis based on a
generalized Anderson theorem which points to an unconventional multiband $s^{+-}$-pairing state
where the sign of the order parameter is different on one (or a small subset) of the smaller Fermi surface
sheets, but remains overall fully-gapped.

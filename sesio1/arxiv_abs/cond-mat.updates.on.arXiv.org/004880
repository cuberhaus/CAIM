We develop a mesoscopic model to study the plastic behavior of an amorphous material under cyclic
loading. The model is depinning-like and driven by a disordered thresholds dynamics which are coupled
by long-range elastic interactions. We propose a simple protocol of "glass preparation" which
allows us to mimic thermalisation at high temperature, as well as aging at vanishing temperature.
Various levels of glass stabilities (from brittle to ductile) can be achieved by tuning the aging
duration. The aged glasses are then immersed into a quenched disorder landscape and serve as initial
configurations for various protocols of mechanical loading by shearing. The dependence of the
plastic behavior upon monotonous loading is recovered. The behavior under cyclic loading is studied
for different ages and system sizes. The size and age dependence of the irreversibility transition
is discussed. A thorough characterization of the disorder-landscape is achieved through the analysis
of the transition graphs, which describe the plastic deformation pathways under athermal quasi-static
shear. In particular, the analysis of the stability ranges of the strongly connected components
of the transition graphs reveals the emergence of a phase-separation like process associated with
the aging of the glass. Increasing the age and hence stability of the initial glass, results in a gradual
break-up of the landscape of dynamically accessible stable states into three distinct regions:
one region centered around the initially prepared glass phase, and two additional regions, characterized
by well-separated ranges of positive and negative plastic strains, each of which is accessible
only from the initial glass phase by passing through the stress peak in the forward, respectively,
backward shearing directions.

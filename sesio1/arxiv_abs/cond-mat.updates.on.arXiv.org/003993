The dominance of Coulomb interactions over kinetic energy of electrons in narrow, non-trivial
moir\'{e} bands of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) gives rise to a variety of correlated
phases such as correlated insulators, superconductivity, orbital ferromagnetism, Chern insulators
and nematicity. Most of these phases occur at or near an integer number of carriers per moir\'{e}
unit cell. Experimental demonstration of ordered states at fractional moir\'{e} band-fillings
at zero applied magnetic field $B$, is a challenging pursuit. In this letter, we report the observation
of states at half-integer band-fillings of $\nu = 0.5$ and $3.5$ at $B\approx 0$ in a TBG proximitized
by a layer of tungsten diselenide (WSe$_2$). The magnetotransport data enables us to deduce features
in the underlying band structure consistent with a spontaneously broken translational symmetry
supercell with twice the area of the original TBG moir\'{e} cell. A series of Lifshitz transitions
due to the changes in the topology of the Fermi surface implies the evolution of van Hove singularities
(VHS) of the diverging density of states at a discrete set of partial fillings of flat bands. Further,
we observe reset of charge carriers at $\nu = 2, 3$. In addition to magnetotransport, we employ thermoelectricity
as a tool to probe the system at $B=0$. Band structure calculations for a TBG moir\'{e} pattern, together
with a commensurate density wave potential and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) terms, allow to obtain
degeneracy-lifted, zone-folded moir\'{e} bands with spin-valley isospin ordering anisotropy
that describe the states at half-integer fillings observed experimentally. Our results suggest
the emergence of a spin-charge density wave ground state in TBG in the zero $B-$ field limit.

Arrays of Rydberg atoms constitute a highly tunable, strongly interacting venue for the pursuit
of exotic states of matter. We develop a new strategy for accessing a family of fractionalized phases
known as quantum spin liquids in two-dimensional Rydberg arrays. We specifically use effective
field theory methods to study arrays assembled from Rydberg chains tuned to an Ising phase transition
that famously hosts emergent fermions propagating within each chain. This highly entangled starting
point allows us to naturally access spin liquids familiar from Kitaev's honeycomb model, albeit
from an entirely different framework. In particular, we argue that finite-range repulsive Rydberg
interactions, which frustrate nearby symmetry-breaking orders, can enable coherent propagation
of emergent fermions between the chains in which they were born. Delocalization of emergent fermions
across the full two-dimensional Rydberg array yields a gapless Z2 spin liquid with a single massless
Dirac cone. Here, the Rydberg occupation numbers exhibit universal power-law correlations that
provide a straightforward experimental diagnostic of this phase. We further show that explicitly
breaking symmetries perturbs the gapless spin liquid into gapped, topologically ordered descendants:
Breaking lattice symmetries generates toric-code topological order, whereas introducing chirality
generates non-Abelian Ising topological order. In the toric-code phase, we analytically construct
microscopic incarnations of non-Abelian defects, which can be created and transported by dynamically
controlling the atom positions in the array. Our work suggests that appropriately tuned Rydberg
arrays provide a cold-atoms counterpart of solid-state 'Kitaev materials' and, more generally,
spotlights a new angle for pursuing experimental platforms for Abelian and non-Abelian fractionalization.

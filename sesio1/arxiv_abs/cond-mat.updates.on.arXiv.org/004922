We propose bi-critical and tri-critical theories between chiral spin liquid (CSL), topological
superconductor (SC) and charge density wave (CDW) ordered Chern insulator with Chern number $C=2$
on square, triangular and kagome lattices. The three CDW order parameters form a manifold of $S^2$
or $S^1$ depending on whether there is easy-plane anisotropy. The skyrmion defect of the CDW order
carries physical charge $2e$ and its condensation leads to a topological superconductor. The CDW-SC
transitions are in the same universality classes as the celebrated deconfined quantum critical
points (DQCP) between Neel order and valence bond solid order on square lattice. Both SC and CDW order
can be accessed from the CSL phase through a continuous phase transition. At the CSL-SC transition,
there is still CDW order fluctuations although CDW is absent in both sides. We propose three different
theories for the CSL-SC transition (and CSL to easy-plane CDW transition): a $U(1)$ theory with
two bosons, a $U(1)$ theory with two Dirac fermions, and an $SU(2)$ theory with two bosons. Our construction
offers a derivation of the duality between these three theories as well as a promising physical realization.
The $SU(2)$ theory offers a unified framework for a series of fixed points with explicit $SO(5),
O(4)$ or $SO(3)\times O(2)$ symmetry. There is also a transparent duality transformation mapping
SC order to easy-plane CDW order. The CSL-SC-CDW tri-critical points are invariant under this duality
mapping and have an enlarged $SO(5)$ or $O(4)$ symmetry. The DQCPs between CDW and SC inherit the
enlarged symmetry, emergent anomaly, and self-duality from the tri-critical point. Our analysis
unifies the well-studied DQCP between symmetry breaking phases into a larger framework where they
are proximate to a topologically ordered phase.

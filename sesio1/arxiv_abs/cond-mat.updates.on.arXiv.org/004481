For corrosion-induced cracking in reinforced concrete, naturally occurring corrosion rates
are so low that rust accumulates often over tens of years near the surface of the reinforcement bars
before sufficient pressure in the surrounding concrete is generated to induce cracking in the concrete
cover. To speed up the process, corrosion tests with impressed currents have been developed in which
the corrosion rate is controlled to be so high that cracking of the concrete cover occurs within a
few days. Extrapolating the results of these accelerated tests to those of naturally occurring
corrosion requires an understanding of the influence of long-term creep deformations of concrete
on the corrosion-induced cracking process. In mathematical models in the literature, creep deformations
are often ignored for accelerated but considered for natural corrosion rates in the form of an effective
modulus. Here, three numerical models of increasing complexity are proposed with the aim to investigate
the effect of creep on corrosion-induced cracking. The simplest approach is based on an uncracked
axis-symmetric thick-walled cylinder combined with a plastic limit on the radial pressure-induced
by the accumulation of rust. The model with intermediate complexity comprises a thick-walled cylinder
model divided into an inner cracked and an outer uncracked layer. The most comprehensive model consists
of a thick-walled cylinder discretised by a three-dimensional lattice approach. Basic creep is
predicted in all three approaches by means of the B3 model developed by Ba\v{z}ant and co-workers.
Time dependence of strength of concrete is modelled using fib Model Code expressions. It is shown
that for the comprehensive lattice model, creep has limited influence on critical corrosion penetration,
which indicates that the dependence of the critical corrosion penetration on corrosion rate must
have other sources.

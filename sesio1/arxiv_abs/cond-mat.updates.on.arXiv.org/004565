Stacking order in van der Waals materials determines the coupling between atomic layers and is therefore
key to the materials' properties. By exploring different stacking orders, many novel physical
phenomena have been realized in artificial vdW stacks. Recently, 2D ferroelectricity has been
observed in zero-degree aligned hBN and graphene-hBN heterostructures, holding promise in a range
of electronic applications. In those artificial stacks, however, the single domain size is limited
by the stacking-angle misalignment to about 0.1 to 1 $\mu$m, which is incompatible with most optical
or optoelectronic applications. Here we show MoS$_2$ in the rhombohedral phase can host a homogeneous
spontaneous polarization throughout few-$\mu$m-sized exfoliated flakes, as it is a natural crystal
requiring no stacking and is, therefore free of misalignment. Utilizing this homogeneous polarization
and its induced depolarization field (DEP), we build a graphene-MoS$_2$ based photovoltaic device
with high efficiency. The few-layer MoS$_2$ is thinner than most oxide-based ferroelectric films,
which allows us to maximize the DEP and study its impact at the atomically thin limit, while the highly
uniform polarization achievable in the commensurate crystal enables a tangible path for up-scaling.
The external quantum efficiency of our device is up to 16% at room temperature, over one order larger
than the highest efficiency observed in bulk photovoltaic devices, owing to the reduced screening
in graphene, the exciton-enhanced light-matter interaction, and the ultrafast interlayer relaxation
in MoS$_2$. In view of the wide range of bandgap energy in other TMDs, our findings make rhombohedral
TMDs a promising and versatile candidate for applications such as energy-efficient photo-detection
with high speed and programmable polarity.

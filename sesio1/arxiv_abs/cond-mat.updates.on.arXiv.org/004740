Today, fast-growing energy demands and fuel resource depletion are among the hottest concerning
issues that treating our world. So, a huge need is felt to find efficient, affordable and eco-friendly
energy storage and production systems. Much current research effort proved that gaseous energy
carriers such as CH4 and H2 seem to be the right choice for alternative fuel resources. However, the
most important challenge with this new-faced resource is the comparatively low volumetric energy
storage density. Fortunately, the high-pressure gas storage technique inside the porous media
of solid adsorbent is considered as one best way to tackle the energy density problem. Famous family
of porous carbon materials, with a suitable pore size distribution centred in the micropore range
and a large number of adsorption sites per volume of solid, open up a great scope for gas storing applications.
This review article represents the state-of-the-art with a precise focus on what has and can be done
to improve/enhance the gas/energy storage capacity of traditional and novel structures of low-cost
carbon-based adsorbents. We review a wide variety of design strategies to synthesis carbonaceous
adsorbents, with a strong focus on creating the connection between structural properties and gas
adsorption performance. In this regard, various synthesis techniques have been studied with emphasis
on the more interesting recent progress that allows better control and optimisation of porosity
of porous carbons for maxing gas storage capacity. We will also show that carbon-based adsorbents,
particularly activated carbons, have been extensively studied and remain a powerful candidate
in the search for an energy carrier economy. In the end, a perspective is provided to forecast the
future development of carbon-based materials.

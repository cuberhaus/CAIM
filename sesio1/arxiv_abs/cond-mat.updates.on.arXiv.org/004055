Consider the time-dependent problem of mass transfer of a solute between two phases and assume that
the solute is initially distributed in one phase (phase 2) and absent from the other (phase 1). We
desire the fraction of total solute present in phase 1 as a function of time, ${\cal S}(t)$, which
we call the {\it spreadability}, since it is a measure of the spreadability of diffusion information
as a function of time. We derive exact direct-space formulas for ${\cal S}(t)$ in any Euclidean space
dimension $d$ in terms of the autocovariance function as well as corresponding Fourier representations
of ${\cal S}(t)$ in terms of the spectral density. We derive closed-form general formulas for the
short- and long-time behaviors of the spreadability in terms of crucial small- and large-scale
microstructural information, respectively. The long-time behavior of ${\cal S}(t)$ enables
one to distinguish the entire spectrum of microstructures that span from hyperuniform to nonhyperuniform
media. For hyperuniform media, disordered or not, we show that the "excess" spreadability, ${\cal
S}(\infty)-{\cal S}(t)$, decays to its long-time behavior exponentially faster than that of any
nonhyperuniform two-phase medium, the "slowest" being antihyperuniform media. The stealthy
hyperuniform class is characterized by an excess spreadability with the fastest decay rate among
all translationally invariant microstructures. Moreover, we establish a remarkable connection
between the spreadability and an outstanding problem in discrete geometry, namely, microstructures
with "fast" spreadabilities are also those that can be derived from efficient "coverings" of space.
We also identify heretofore unnoticed remarkable links between the spreadability ${\cal S}(t)$
and NMR pulsed field gradient spin-echo amplitude as well as diffusion MRI measurements.

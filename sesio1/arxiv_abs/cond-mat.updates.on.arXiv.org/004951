Variational methods have been widely used in soft matter physics for both static and dynamic problems.
These methods are mostly based on two variational principles: the variational principle of minimum
free energy (MFEVP) and Onsager's variational principle (OVP). Our interests lie in the applications
of these variational methods to active matter physics. In our former work [Soft Matter, 2021, 17,
3634], we have explored the applications of OVP-based variational methods for the modeling of active
matter dynamics. In the present work, we explore variational (or energy) methods that are based
on MFEVP for static problems in active elastic solids. We show that MFEVP can be used not only to derive
equilibrium equations, but also to develop approximate solution methods, such as Ritz method,
for active solid statics. Moreover, the power of Ritz-type method can be further enhanced using
deep learning methods if we use deep neural networks to construct the trial solutions of the variational
problems. We then apply these variational methods and the deep Ritz method to study the spontaneous
bending and contraction of a thin active circular plate that is induced by internal asymmetric active
contraction. The circular plate is found to be bent towards its contracting side. The study of such
a simple toy system gives implications for understanding the morphogenesis of solid-like confluent
cell monolayers. In addition, we introduce a so-called activogravity length to characterize the
importance of gravitational forces relative to internal active contraction in driving the bending
of the active plate. When the lateral plate dimension is larger than the activogravity length (about
100 micron), gravitational forces become important. Such gravitaxis behaviors at multicellular
scales may play significant roles in the morphogenesis and in the up-down symmetry broken during
tissue development.

Colloidal Quantum Dots (CQDs), major building blocks in modern opto-electronic devices, have
so far been synthesized with only one emission center where the exciton resides. Recent development
of coupled Colloidal Quantum Dots Molecules (CQDM), where two core-shell CQDs are fused to form
two emission centers in close proximity, allows to explore how charge carriers in one CQD affect
the charge carriers in the other CQD. Cryogenic single particle spectroscopy reveals that while
CQD monomers manifest a simple emission spectrum comprising a main emission peak with well-defined
phonon sidebands, CQDMs exhibit a complex spectrum with multiple peaks that are not all spaced according
to the known phonon frequencies. Based on complementary emission polarization and time-resolved
analysis, this is assigned to fluorescence of the two coupled emission centers. Moreover, the complex
peak structure shows correlated spectral diffusion indicative of the coupling between the two
emission centers. Utilizing Schrodinger-Poisson self-consistent calculations, we directly
map the spectral behavior, alternating between neutral and charged states of the CQDM. Spectral
shifts related to electrostatic interaction between a charged emission center and the second emission
center are thus fully mapped. Furthermore, effects of moving surface charges are identified, whereby
the emission center proximal to the charge shows larger shifts. Instances where the two emission
centers are negatively charged simultaneously are also identified. Such detailed mapping of charging
states is enabled by the coupling within the CQDM and its anisotropic structure. This understanding
of the coupling interactions is a progress towards quantum technology and sensing applications
based on CQDMs.

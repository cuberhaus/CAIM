The mean-field approximation based on effective interactions or density functionals plays a pivotal
role in the description of finite quantum many-body systems that are too large to be treated by ab
initio methods. Some examples are strongly interacting medium and heavy mass atomic nuclei and
mesoscopic condensed matter systems. In this approach, the linear Schrodinger equation for the
exact many-body wave function is mapped onto a non-linear density-dependent one-body potential
problem. This approximation, not only provides computationally very simple solutions even for
systems with many particles, but due to the non-linearity, it also allows for obtaining solutions
that break essential symmetries of the system, often connected with phase transitions. In this
way, additional correlations are subsumed in the system. However, the mean-field approach suffers
from the drawback that the corresponding wave functions do not have sharp quantum numbers and, therefore,
many results cannot be compared directly with experimental data. In this article, we discuss general
group-theory techniques to restore the broken symmetries, and provide detailed expressions on
the restoration of translational, rotational, spin, isospin, parity and gauge symmetries, where
the latter corresponds to the restoration of the particle number. In order to avoid the numerical
complexity of exact projection techniques, various approximation methods available in the literature
are examined. Applications of the projection methods are presented for simple nuclear models,
realistic calculations in relatively small configuration spaces, nuclear energy density functional
theory, as well as in other mesoscopic systems. Further, unresolved problems in the application
of the symmetry restoration methods to the energy density functional theories are highlighted
in the present work.

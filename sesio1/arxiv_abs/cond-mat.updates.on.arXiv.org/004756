As a result of a hundred million years of evolution, living animals have adapted extremely well to
their ecological niche. Such adaptation implies species-specific interactions with their immediate
environment by processing sensory cues and responding with appropriate behavior. Understanding
how living creatures perform pattern recognition and cognitive tasks is of particular importance
for computing architectures: by studying these information pathways refined over eons of evolution,
researchers may be able to streamline the process of developing more highly advanced, energy efficient
autonomous systems. With the advent of novel electronic and ionic components along with a deeper
understanding of information pathways in living species, a plethora of opportunities to develop
completely novel information processing avenues are within reach. Here, we describe the basal
information pathways in nervous systems, from the local neuron level to the entire nervous system
network. The dual importance of local learning rules is addressed, from spike timing dependent
plasticity at the neuron level to the interwoven morphological and dynamical mechanisms of the
global network. Basal biological principles are highlighted, including phylogenies, ontogenesis,
and homeostasis, with particular emphasis on network topology and dynamics. While in machine learning
system training is performed on virgin networks without any a priori knowledge, the approach proposed
here distinguishes itself unambiguously by employing growth mechanisms as a guideline to design
novel computing architectures. Including fundamental biological information pathways that
explore the spatiotemporal fundamentals of nervous systems has untapped potential for the development
of entirely novel information processing systems. Finally, a benchmark for neuromorphic systems
is suggested.

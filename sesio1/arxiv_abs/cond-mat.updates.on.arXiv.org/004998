The relationship between crystal structures and superconducting critical temperatures has attracted
considerable attention as a clue to designing higher-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductors. In particular,
the relationship between the number $n$ of CuO$_2$ layers in a unit cell of cuprate superconductors
and the optimum superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}^{\rm opt}$ is intriguing.
As experimentally observed in layered cuprates, $T_{\rm c}^{\rm opt}$ increases when $n$ is increased,
up to $n=3$, and, then, decreases for larger $n$. However, the mechanism behind the $n$ dependence
of $T_{\rm c}^{\rm opt}$ remains elusive although there have been many studies on the $n$ dependence.
In this paper, we studied a bilayer $t$-$t'$ Hubbard model to clarify the effects of the adjacent
CuO$_2$ layers on the stability of the superconductivity by using a many-variable variational
Monte Carlo method. We calculate the superconducting correlation at long distance and zero temperature,
and the amplitude of the superconducting gap functions estimated from the momentum distribution
as the observables correlated with $T_{\rm c}^{\rm opt}$. It is found that the in-plane superconducting
correlation is not enhanced in comparison with that in the single-layer $t$-$t'$ Hubbard model.
The superconducting correlations of the bilayer Hamiltonian are significantly small in the overdoped
region in comparison with those of single-layer Hamiltonian, which is attributed to the van Hove
singularity. In addition, we found that the amplitude of the superconducting gap functions is also
similar in both the single-layer and bilayer $t$-$t'$ Hubbard model at the optimal doping. Therefore,
we conclude that the adjacent Hubbard layers are not relevant to the enhancement of $T_{\rm c}^{\rm
opt}$ in the bilayer cuprates. Possible origins of the enhanced $T_{\rm c}^{\rm opt}$ other than
the adjacent layers are also discussed.

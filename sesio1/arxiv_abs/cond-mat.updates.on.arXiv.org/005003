Here $\underline{M}$ denotes a pair $(M,A)$ of a manifold and a subset (e.g. $A=\partial M$ or $A=\emptyset$).
We construct for each $\underline{M}$ its motion groupoid $\mathrm{Mot}_{\underline{M}}$,
whose object set is the power set $ {\mathcal P} M$ of $M$, and whose morphisms are certain equivalence
classes of continuous flows of the `ambient space' $M$, that fix $A$, acting on ${\mathcal P} M$.
These groupoids generalise the classical definition of a motion group associated to a manifold
$M$ and a submanifold $N$, which can be recovered by considering the automorphisms in $\mathrm{Mot}_{\underline{M}}$
of $N\in {\mathcal P} M$. We also construct the mapping class groupoid $\mathrm{MCG}_{\underline{M}}$
associated to a pair $\underline{M}$ with the same object class, whose morphisms are now equivalence
classes of homeomorphisms of $M$, that fix $A$. We recover the classical definition of the mapping
class group of a pair by taking automorphisms at the appropriate object. For each pair $\underline{M}$
we explicitly construct a functor $\mathsf{F}\colon \mathrm{Mot}_{\underline{M}} \to \mathrm{MCG}_{\underline{M}}$
and prove that this is an isomorphism if $\pi_0$ and $\pi_1$ of the appropriate space of self-homeomorphisms
of $M$ are trivial. In particular, we have an isomorphism in the physically important case $\underline{M}=([0,1]^n,
\partial [0,1]^n)$, for any $n\in \mathbb{N}$. We show that the congruence relation used in the
construction $\mathrm{Mot}_{\underline{M}}$ can be formulated entirely in terms of a level preserving
isotopy relation on the trajectories of objects under flows -- worldlines (e.g. monotonic `tangles').
We examine several explicit examples of $\mathrm{Mot}_{\underline{M}}$ and $\mathrm{MCG}_{\underline{M}}$
demonstrating the utility of the constructions.

We carry out overdamped simulations in a simple model of jamming - a collection of bi-disperse soft
core frictionless disks in two dimensions - with the aim to explore the finite size dependence of
different quantities, both the relaxation time obtained from the relaxation of the energy and the
pressure-equivalent of the shear viscosity. The motivation for the paper is the observation [Nishikawa
et al., J. Stat. Phys, 182, 37 (2021)] that there are finite size effects in the relaxation time, $\tau$,
that give problems in the determination of the critical divergence, and the claim that this is due
to a finite size dependence, $\tau\sim\ln N$, which makes $\tau$ an ill-defined quantity. Beside
analyses to determine the relaxation time for the whole system we determine particle relaxation
times which allow us to determine both histograms of particle relaxation times and the average particle
relaxation times - two quantities that are very useful for the analyses. The starting configurations
for the relaxation simulations are of two different kinds: completely random or taken from steady
shearing simulations, and we find that the difference between these two cases are bigger than previously
noted and that the observed problems in the determination of the critical divergence obtained when
starting from random configurations are not present when instead starting the relaxations from
shearing configurations. We also argue that the the effect that causes the $\ln N$-dependence is
not as problematic as asserted. When it comes to the finite size dependence of the pressure-equivalent
of the shear viscosity we find that our data don't give support for the claimed strong finite size
dependence, but also that it is at odds with what one would normally expect for a system with a diverging
correlation length, and that this calls for a novel understanding of the phenomenon of shear-driven
jamming.

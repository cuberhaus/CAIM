Stacking variations in quasi-2D materials can have an important influence on material properties,
such as changing the topology of the band structure. Unfortunately, the weakness of van der Waals
interactions makes it difficult to compute the stacking dependence of properties, and even in a
material as simple as graphite the stacking energetics remain unclear. Mo$_{1-x}$W$_{x}$Te$_{2}$
is a material in which three differently-stacked phases are conveniently accessible by temperature
changes: $1T^{\prime}$, $T^*_d$, and the reported Weyl semimetal phase $T_d$. The transitions
proceed via layer sliding, and the corresponding interlayer shear mode (ISM) is relevant not just
for the stacking energetics, but for understanding the relationship between the Weyl physics and
structural changes. However, the interlayer interactions of Mo$_{1-x}$W$_{x}$Te$_{2}$ are
not well understood, with wide variation in computed properties. We report inelastic neutron scattering
of the ISM in a Mo$_{0.91}$W$_{0.09}$Te$_{2}$ crystal. The ISM energies are generally consistent
with the linear chain model (LCM), as expected given the weak interlayer interaction, though there
are some discrepancies from predicted intensities. However, the interlayer force constants $K_x$
in the $T^*_d$ and $1T^{\prime}$ phases are substantially weaker than that of $T_d$, at 76(3)% and
83(3)%, respectively. Considering that the relative positioning of atoms in neighboring layers
is approximately the same regardless of overall stacking, our results suggest that longer-range
influences, such as stacking-induced band structure changes, may be responsible for the substantial
change in the interlayer vibrational coupling. These findings should elucidate the stacking energetics
of Mo$_{1-x}$W$_{x}$Te$_{2}$ and other van der Waals layered materials.

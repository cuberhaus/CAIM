We report on first-principles calculations of spin-transfer torque (STT) in epitaxial magnetic
tunnel junctions (MTJs) based on ferrimagnetic tetragonal Mn$_3$Ga electrodes, both as analyzer
in an Fe/MgO stack, and also in an analogous stack with a second Mn$_3$Ga electrode (instead of Fe)
as polarizer. Solving the ballistic transport problem (NEGF + DFT) for the nonequilibrium spin
density in a scattering region extended to over 7.6 nm into the Mn$_3$Ga electrode, we find long-range
spatial oscillations of the STT decaying on a length scale of a few tens of angstroms, both in the linear
response regime and for finite bias. The oscillatory behavior of the STT in Mn$_3$Ga is robust against
variations in the stack geometry and the applied bias voltage, which may affect the phase and the
amplitude of the spatial oscillation, but the wave number is only responsive to variations in the
longitudinal lattice constant of Mn$_3$Ga (for fixed in-plane geometry) without being commensurate
with the lattice. Our interpretation of the long-range STT oscillations is based on the bulk electronic
structure of Mn$_3$Ga, taking also into account the spin-filtering properties of the MgO barrier.
Comparison to a fully Mn$_3$Ga-based stack shows similar STT oscillations, but a significant enhancement
of both the TMR effect at the Fermi level and the STT at the interface, due to resonant tunneling for
the mirror-symmetric junction with thinner barrier (three monoatomic layers). From the calculated
energy dependence of the spin-polarized transmissions at 0 V, we anticipate asymmetric or symmetric
TMR as a function of the applied bias voltage for the Fe-based and the all-Mn$_3$Ga stacks, respectively,
which also both exhibit a sign change below 1 V. In the latter (symmetric) case we expect a TMR peak
at zero, which is larger for the thinner barriers because of a spin-polarized resonant tunneling
contribution.

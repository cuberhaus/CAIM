NaCl crystal nucleation from metastable solutions has long been considered to occur according
to a single-step mechanism. Recent experimental observations suggest that NaCl crystals emerge
from disordered intermediates which is seemingly at odds with this established view. Here, we performed
biased and unbiased molecular dynamics simulations to analyse and characterise the pathways to
crystalline phases from solutions far into the metastable region. We find that large liquid-like
NaCl clusters emerge as the solution concentration is increased and two-step nucleation pathways
are more dominant than one-step pathways to phase separation. Analyses of cluster size populations
and the ion pair association constant show that these clusters are transient, unlike the thermodynamically
stable prenulceation cluster solute species that were suggested in other mineralising systems.
A Markov State Model was developed to analyse the mechanisms and timescales for nucleation from
unbiased molecular dynamics trajectories in a reaction coordinate space characterising the dense
regions in clusters and crystalline order. This allowed calculation of the committor probabilities
for the system to relax to the solution or crystal states, and to estimate the rate of nucleation,
which shows excellent agreement with literature values. From a fundamental nucleation perspective,
our work highlights the need to extend the attribute 'critical' to an ensemble of clusters which
can display a broad range of structures and include sizeable disordered domains depending upon
the reaction conditions.Moreover, our recent simulation studies demonstrated that carbon surfaces
catalyse the formation of liquid-like NaCl networks which, combined with the observations here,
suggests that alternative pathways beyond the single-step mechanism can be exploited to control
the crystallisation of NaCl.

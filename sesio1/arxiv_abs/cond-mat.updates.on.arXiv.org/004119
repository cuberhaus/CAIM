While lean Mg-Zn-Ca alloys are promising materials for temporary implants, questions remain on
the impact of Zn and Ca. In this context, the precipitation in Mg-1.5Zn-0.25Ca (ZX20, in wt.%) was
investigated upon linear heating from about room temperature to 400 C, with a particular focus on
the debated ternary precipitate phase. Three exothermic differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
peaks were observed at 125, 250 and 320 C. The microstructure at the end of these peaks (205, 260 and
350 C) was probed in a multiscale correlative approach using atom probe tomography (APT) and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM). At 205 C, APT analysis revealed Ca-rich, Zn-rich and Zn-Ca-rich clusters
of about 3 nm in size and with a number density of 5.7 x 10^23 m^-3. At 260 C, APT and TEM showed mono-layered
Zn-Ca-rich Guinier-Preston (GP) zones of about 8 nm in size and with a number density of 1.3 x 10^23
m^-3. At 350 C, there are larger, highly coherent elongated precipitates of about 50 nm in size, in
a lower number density, and of two types: either binary Mg2Ca precipitates or less numerous ternary
Ca2Mg6Zn3 precipitates, as deduced from scanning TEM-based energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry
(EDS) and nanodiffraction in TEM. The highest hardening, probed by Vickers testing, relates to
the end of the 125 C DSC peak and thus to GP zones, which outperform the hardening induced by the nanoscale
clusters and the larger intermetallic particles. Precipitation in ZX20 upon linear heating was
compared to the one induced by hot extrusion at 330 C. Here, ternary precipitates outnumber the binary
ones and are larger, incoherent, and in a much lower number density. They are unequivocally made
of hexagonal Ca2Mg5Zn5, as deduced by atomically resolved EDS mapping and scanning TEM imaging,
and supported by simulations. Precipitation complexity of in lean Mg-Zn-Ca alloys and its kinetic
path are discussed.

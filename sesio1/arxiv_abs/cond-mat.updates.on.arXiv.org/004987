We present measurements and simulations of semiconductor-superconductor heterostructure devices
that are consistent with the observation of topological superconductivity and Majorana zero modes.
The devices are fabricated from high-mobility two-dimensional electron gases in which quasi-one-dimensional
wires are defined by electrostatic gates. These devices enable measurements of local and non-local
transport properties and have been optimized via extensive simulations for robustness against
non-uniformity and disorder. Our main result is that several devices, fabricated according to
the design's engineering specifications, have passed the topological gap protocol defined in
Pikulin {\it et al.}\ [arXiv:2103.12217]. This protocol is a stringent test composed of a sequence
of three-terminal local and non-local transport measurements performed while varying the magnetic
field, semiconductor electron density, and junction transparencies. Passing the protocol indicates
a high probability of detection of a topological phase hosting Majorana zero modes. Our experimental
results are consistent with a quantum phase transition into a topological superconducting phase
that extends over several hundred millitesla in magnetic field and several millivolts in gate voltage,
corresponding to approximately one hundred micro-electron-volts in Zeeman energy and chemical
potential in the semiconducting wire. These regions feature a closing and re-opening of the bulk
gap, with simultaneous zero-bias conductance peaks at {\it both} ends of the devices that withstand
changes in the junction transparencies. The measured maximum topological gaps in our devices are
20-$30\,\mu$eV. This demonstration is a prerequisite for experiments involving fusion and braiding
of Majorana zero modes.

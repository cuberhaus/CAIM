Copper oxide high temperature superconductors universally exhibit multiple forms of electronically
ordered phases that break the native translational symmetry of the CuO2 planes. The interplay between
these orders and the superconducting ground state, as well as how they arise through doping a Mott
insulator, is essential to decode the mechanisms of high-temperature superconductivity. Over
the years, various forms of electronic liquid crystal phases including charge/spin stripes and
incommensurate charge-density-waves (CDWs) were found to emerge out of a correlated metallic
ground state in underdoped cuprates. Early theoretical studies also predicted the emergence of
a Coulomb-frustrated 'charge crystal' phase in the very lightly-doped, insulating limit of the
CuO2 planes. Here, we use resonant X-ray scattering, electron transport, and muon spin rotation
measurements to fully resolve the electronic and magnetic ground state and search for signatures
of charge order in very lightly hole-doped cuprates from the RBa2Cu3O7-d family (RBCO; R: Y or rare
earth). X-ray scattering data from RBCO films reveal a breaking of translational symmetry more
pervasive than was previously known, extending down to the Mott limit. The ordering vector of this
charge crystal state is linearly connected to the charge-density-waves of underdoped RBCO, suggesting
that the former phase is a precursor to the latter as hole doping is increased. Most importantly,
the coexistence of charge and spin order in RBCO suggests that this electronic symmetry-breaking
state is common to the CuO2 planes in the very lightly-doped regime. These findings bridge the gap
between the Mott insulating state and the underdoped metallic state and underscore the prominent
role of Coulomb-frustrated electronic phase separation among all cuprates.

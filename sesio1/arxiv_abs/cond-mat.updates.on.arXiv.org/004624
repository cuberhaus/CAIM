Nucleation and growth (N&G) - the emergence of a new phase within an initially homogeneous one - is
one of the most important physical phenomena by which gas-liquid, liquid-liquid and solid-liquid
phase separation takes place. Accordingly, thermodynamics sets the asymptotic boundaries towards
which the system must evolve, while kinetics tries to cope with it by imposing the transport rates
at which phase separation is realized. In all heterogeneous colloidal systems observed in nature,
the composition, shape, structure and ultimately physical properties result from the trade-off
between thermodynamics and kinetics. In this work we demonstrate, by carefully selecting colloidal
systems and controlling phase separation in microfluidic devices, that it becomes possible to
go beyond N&G, disentangling kinetics effects from thermodynamics in composition, structure
and physical properties of the final system. Using amyloid fibril and cellulose nanocrystal filamentous
colloids for which the binodal curve defining the two-phase region in the phase diagram is given
by two separate vertical lines, we extrude a solution set at one thermodynamic branch inside the
other branch, realizing nematic or cholesteric droplets where the composition is set by thermodynamics,
while the structure and morphology are defined by dynamic flow parameters. We demonstrate that
departing from the N&G paradigm unveils new physical phenomena, such as orders of magnitude shorter
timescales, a wider phase diagram and internal cholesteric structures that are not observable
via conventional LLPS. We also show that by co-dispersing plasmonic gold nanoparticles within
colloidal liquid crystalline droplets, our approach enables on-demand fabrication of multicomponent
heterogeneous liquid crystals, enhancing their potential, and introducing original fundamental
and technological directions in multicomponent structured fluids.

We compute the mean square displacement (MSD) of intruders immersed in a freely cooling granular
gas made up of smooth inelastic hard spheres. In general, intruders and particles of the granular
gas are assumed to have different mechanical properties, implying that non-equipartition of energy
must be accounted for in the computation of the diffusion coefficient $D$. In the hydrodynamic regime,
the time decay of the granular temperature $T$ of the cooling granular gas is known to be dictated
by Haff's law; the corresponding decay of the intruder's collision frequency entails a time decrease
of the diffusion coefficient $D$. Explicit knowledge of this time dependence allows us to determine
the MSD by integrating the corresponding diffusion equation. As in previous studies of self-diffusion
(intruders mechanically equivalent to gas particles) and the Brownian limit (intruder's mass
much larger than the grain's mass), we find a logarithmic time dependence of the MSD as a consequence
of Haff's law. This dependence extends well beyond the two aforementioned cases, as it holds in all
spatial dimensions for arbitrary values of the mechanical parameters of the system (masses and
diameters of intruders and grains, as well as their coefficients of normal restitution). Our result
for self-diffusion in a three-dimensional granular gas agrees qualitatively, but not quantitatively,
with that recently obtained by Blumenfeld [arXiv: 2111.06260] in the framework of a random walk
model. Beyond the logarithmic time growth, we find that the MSD depends on the mechanical system
parameters in a highly complex way. To explain the observed behaviour, we analyze in detail the intruder's
random walk, consisting of ballistic displacements interrupted by anisotropic deflections caused
by the collisions with the hard spheres.

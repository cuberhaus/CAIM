We report observation of electric-field-driven resistive transition at a characteristic threshold
field $E_{th}(T)$ across a temperature range 10-200 K in an off-stoichiometric composite of (~80
vol%) W- and (~20 vol%) Z-type hexaferrites. The dielectric constant $\epsilon$ and the relaxation
time constant $\tau$ too exhibit anomalous jump at $E_{th}(T)$. The $E_{th}(T)$, the extent of
jump in resistivity ($\Delta\rho$), and the hysteresis associated with the jump [$\Delta E_{th}(T)$]
are found to decrease systematically with the increase in temperature ($T$). Several temperature-driven
phase transitions have also been noticed in low and high resistive states (LRS and HRS). The temperature-driven
conduction turns out to be governed by activated hopping of small polarons at all the phases with
electric ($E$) and magnetic ($H$) field dependent activation energy $U(E,H)$. Interestingly,
as the temperature is raised, the $E$-driven conduction at a fixed temperature evolves from $\textit{Ohmic}$
to $\textit{non-Ohmic}$ across 10-200 K and within 110-200 K, $\rho$ follows three-dimensional
variable range hopping (3D-VRH) with stretched exponential $\sim$ $exp[(E_0/E)^4]$ or power
law $\sim$ $(E_0/E)^m$ ($m$ varies within $\sim$0.6-0.7 and $\sim$0.6-0.8 at LRS and HRS, respectively)
dependence depending on the localization length ($\zeta_E$) to diffusion length ($d_E$) ratio
associated with $E$-driven conduction. The $\rho(E,T)$ follows universal scaling only at LRS
within 10-110 K but not at higher temperature or at HRS. The entire set of observations has been discussed
within the framework of structural evolution of the point-defect (cation vacancies or oxygen excess)
network. This comprehensive map of esoteric $\rho-E-T-H$ and $\epsilon-E-T-H$ patterns provides
insights on defect driven effects in a composite useful for tuning both the resistive transition
and multiferroicity.

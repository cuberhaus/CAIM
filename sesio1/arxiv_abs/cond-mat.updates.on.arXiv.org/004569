The evolution of interfaces is intrinsic to many physical processes ranging from cavitation in
fluids to recrystallization in solids. Computational modeling of interface motion entails a number
of challenges, largely due to the range of topological transitions that can occur over the course
of the simulation. Microstructure evolution in a polycrystalline material that involves grain
boundary motion is a particularly complex example due to the extreme variety, heterogeneity, and
anisotropy of grain boundary properties. Accurately modeling this process is essential to determining
processing-structure-property relationships in polycrystalline materials though, making
modeling efforts central to the eventual rational design of materials. Simulations of microstructure
evolution often use diffuse interface methods, and specifically the phase field method; these
are advantageous for their versatility and ease of handling complex geometries, but can be prohibitively
expensive due to the need for high interface resolution. Discrete interface methods require fewer
grid points and can consequently exhibit better performance but have received comparatively little
attention, perhaps due to the difficulty of consistently implementing topological transitions.
This work considers a recently developed discrete-interface method for microstructure evolution,
and provides an explicit comparison to diffuse interface methods by comparing against a multiphase
field method in a number of classical microstructure evolution problems: the shrinking of a spherical
grain, determination of a triple junction diheral angle, and determination of a quadruple point
dihedral angle. In each case, the discrete method is found to meet or outperform the multiphase field
method in terms of accuracy for comparable levels of refinement, demonstrating its potential efficacy
as a numerical approach for microstructure evolution.

Motivated by the observation of nematic superconductivity in several systems, we revisit the problem
of the leading pairing instability of two-component unconventional superconductors on the triangular
lattice -- such as $(p_{x},\,p_{y})$-wave and $(d_{x^{2}-y^{2}},\,d_{xy})$-wave. Such a system
has two possible superconducting states: the chiral state (e.g. $p+ip$ or $d+id$), which breaks
time-reversal symmetry, and the nematic state (e.g. $p+p$ or $d+d$), which breaks the threefold
rotational symmetry of the lattice. Weak-coupling calculations generally favor the chiral over
the nematic superconducting state, raising the question of what mechanism can stabilize the latter.
Here, we show that the electromagnetic field fluctuations can play a crucial role in selecting between
these two states. Specifically, we derive and analyze the effective free energy for the two-component
superconducting order parameter after integrating out the gauge-field fluctuations, which is
formally justified if the spatial order parameter fluctuations can be neglected. A non-analytic
cubic term arises, as in the case of a conventional $s$-wave superconductor. However, unlike the
latter, the cubic term depends on the relative phase and on the relative amplitudes between the two
order parameter components, in such a way that it generally favors the nematic state. This result
is a direct consequence of the fact that the stiffness of the superconducting order parameter is
not isotropic. Competition with the quartic term, which favors the chiral state, leads to a renormalized
phase diagram in which the nematic state displaces the chiral state over a wide region in the parameter
space. We analyze the stability of the fluctuation-induced nematic phase, generalize our results
to tetragonal lattices, and discuss their applicability to candidate nematic superconductors,
including twisted bilayer graphene.

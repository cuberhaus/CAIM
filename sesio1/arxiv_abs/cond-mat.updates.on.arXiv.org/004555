Understanding the competition between brittleness and plasticity in refractory ceramics is of
importance for aiding design of hard materials with enhanced fracture resistance. We carry out
ab initio and classical molecular dynamics (AIMD and CMD) investigations at temperatures between
300 and 1200 K to identify atomic-scale mechanisms responsible for brittle fracture vs slip-induced
crack-blunting in Ti-N ceramics. AIMD simulations of single-crystal and notched TiN lattices
(1100 atoms) subject to tensile and shear deformation serve to verify predictions of mechanical
properties separately obtained by CMD. Benchmarked by AIMD results, CMD is thus confidently used
to probe the mechanical response of large (40000 atoms) notched TiN and TiNx models under mode-I
tension. Although crack growth occurs in most cases, CMD simulations reveal that typically-brittle
TiN and TiNx ceramics can - for comparable rates of accumulation of tensile and shear stress around
a flaw - prevent fracture via nucleation and emission of dislocations from the notch tip. Furthermore,
we identify descriptors based on properties calculated for ideal single-crystals which reproduce
trends in mechanical behavior of flawed lattices. Specifically: (i) the probability of notched
ceramics to resist fracture via slip-induced plasticity exhibits linear relationship with ideal
tensile-to-shear strength ratios (Iplasticity), (ii) at parity of Iplasticity values, the effective
strength (fracture stress) of defective systems ranks according to the tensile strength of corresponding
single-crystal phases. The descriptors proposed in this work pave the way for high-throughput
screening of ceramics that may combine high strength to superior fracture resistance at room and
elevated temperature.

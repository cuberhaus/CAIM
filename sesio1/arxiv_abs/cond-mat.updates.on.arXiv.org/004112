Scanning electron diffraction in a transmission electron microscope (TEM), is often used to resolve
spatial information on structures at the nano-scale. By coupling a data reduction and QoI extraction
data analysis pipelines to a relational precession-assisted electron diffraction probing, we
discuss the `scanning nano-structure electron microscopy' (SNEM) approach. SNEM reveals structural
and related compositional information in materials at high spatial and, potentially, temporal
resolution. SNEM provides new horizons for understanding disordered materials. By choose scalar
quantities of interest (QoIs) and mapping them to their positional indexes, SNEM allows following
spatially variations in order. We mainly use electron pair distribution functions (ePDF), which
are reduced from diffraction patterns, from which we extract structurally relevant QoIs. Besides
some straightforward QoIs, we take advantage of the large relational data set and use non-negative
matrix factorization (NMF) to generate `bond type distribution maps' and the related chemical
short-range order distribution maps. We use a composite of a hot-rolled Ni-encapsulated Zr$_{65}$Cu$_{17.5}$Ni$_{10}$Al$_{7.5}$
bulk metallic glass (BMG). We expose structural heterogeneity within the amorphous BMG layer that
is both structural and compositional. We find regions of enhanced crystallinity, compositional
gradients, and tendencies towards chemical clustering or ordering. These are all resolved at the
nm length scale. More specifically, we discover that the crystalline Ni undergoes a non-trivial
amorphization as it mixes with the BMG, which might be the origin for the successful binding between
the BMG and the hosting Ni. We find that Zr-rich regions result in a tendency towards chemical clustering,
while Cu-depleted regions are suspected as effective nucleation centers for crystallization.

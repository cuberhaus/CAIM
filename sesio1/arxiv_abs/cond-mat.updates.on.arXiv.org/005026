Topological insulating (TI) phases were originally highlighted for their disorder-robust bulk
responses, such as the quantized Hall conductivity of 2D Chern insulators. With the discovery of
time-reversal- ($\mathcal{T}$-) invariant 2D TIs, and the recognition that their spin Hall conductivity
is generically non-quantized, focus has since shifted to boundary states as signatures of 2D and
3D TIs and symmetry-enforced topological crystalline insulators (TCIs). However, in $\mathcal{T}$-invariant
(helical) 3D TCIs such as bismuth, BiBr, and MoTe$_2$ - termed higher-order TCIs (HOTIs) - the boundary
signatures manifest as 1D hinge states, whose configurations are dependent on sample details.
It is hence desirable to elucidate bulk signatures of helical TCIs, and their relationship to sample-independent
experimental observables. In this work, we introduce nested spin-resolved Wilson loops and layer
constructions as tools to characterize the bulk topological properties of inversion- and $\mathcal{T}$-protected
helical HOTIs. We discover that helical HOTIs realize one of three spin-resolved phases with distinct
responses that are quantitatively robust to large deformations of the bulk spin-orbital texture:
3D quantum spin Hall insulators, "spin-Weyl" semimetal states with gapless spin spectra, and $\mathcal{T}$-doubled
axion insulator (T-DAXI) states with nontrivial partial axion angles $\theta^\pm = \pi$ indicative
of a 3D spin-magnetoelectric bulk response. We provide experimental signatures of each spin-stable
regime of helical HOTIs, including surface Fermi arcs in spin-Weyl semimetals under strong Zeeman
fields, and half-quantized 2D TI states on the gapped surfaces of T-DAXIs originating from a partial
parity anomaly. Lastly, we use ab-initio calculations to demonstrate that the candidate HOTI $\beta$-MoTe$_2$
realizes a spin-Weyl state with 8 total spin-Weyl points.

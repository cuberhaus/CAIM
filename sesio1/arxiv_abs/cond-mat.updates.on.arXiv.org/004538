We demonstrate the use of matrix product state (MPS) models for discriminating quantum data on quantum
computers using holographic algorithms, focusing on classifying a translationally invariant
quantum state based on $L$ qubits of quantum data extracted from it. We detail a process in which data
from single-shot experimental measurements are used to optimize an isometric tensor network,
the tensors are compiled into unitary quantum operations using greedy compilation heuristics,
parameter optimization on the resulting quantum circuit model removes the post-selection requirements
of the isometric tensor model, and the resulting quantum model is inferenced on either product state
or entangled quantum data. We demonstrate our training and inference architecture on a synthetic
dataset of six-site single-shot measurements from the bulk of a one-dimensional transverse field
Ising model (TFIM) deep in its antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases. We experimentally evaluate
models on Quantinuum's H1-2 trapped ion quantum computer using entangled input data modeled as
translationally invariant, bond dimension 4 MPSs across the known quantum phase transition of
the TFIM. Using linear regression on the experimental data near the transition point, we find predictions
for the critical transverse field of $h=0.962$ and $0.994$ for tensor network discriminators of
bond dimension $\chi=2$ and $\chi=4$, respectively. These predictions compare favorably with
the known transition location of $h=1$ despite training on data far from the transition point. Our
techniques identify families of short-depth variational quantum circuits in a data-driven and
hardware-aware fashion and robust classical techniques to precondition the model parameters,
and can be adapted beyond machine learning to myriad applications of tensor networks on quantum
computers, such as quantum simulation and error correction.

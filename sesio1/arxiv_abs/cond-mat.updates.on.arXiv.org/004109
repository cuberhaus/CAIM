We introduce an exact mapping of Clifford (stabilizer) random tensor networks (RTNs) and monitored
quantum circuits, onto a statistical mechanics model. With Haar unitaries, the fundamental degrees
of freedom ('spins') are permutations because all operators commuting with the action of the unitaries
on a tensor product arise from permutations of the tensor factors ('Schur-Weyl duality'). For unitaries
restricted to the smaller Clifford group, the set of commuting operators, the 'commutant', forming
the new 'spin' degrees of freedom, will be larger. We use the recent full characterization of this
commutant by Gross et al., Comm. Math. Phys. 385, 1325 (2021), to construct the Clifford statistical
mechanics models for on-site Hilbert space dimensions which are powers of a prime number $p$. We
show that the Boltzmann weights are invariant under a symmetry group involving orthogonal matrices
with entries in the finite number field ${\bf F}_p$. This implies that the symmetry group, and consequently
all universal properties of entanglement transitions in Clifford circuits and RTNs will in general
depend on, and only on the prime $p$. We show that Clifford monitored circuits with on-site Hilbert
space dimension $d=p^M$ are described by percolation in the limits $d \to \infty$ at (a) $p=$ fixed
but $M\to \infty$, and at (b) $M= 1$ but $p \to \infty$. In the limit (a) we calculate the effective
central charge, and in the limit (b) we derive the following universal minimal cut entanglement
entropy $S_A =(\sqrt{3}/\pi)\ln p \ln L_A$ for $d=p$ large at the transition. We verify those predictions
numerically, and present extensive numerical results for critical exponents at the transition
in monitored Clifford circuits for prime number on-site Hilbert space dimension $d=p$ for a variety
of different values of $p$, and find that they approach percolation values at large $p$.

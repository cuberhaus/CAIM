Phonon-plasmon coupled excitations in heavily doped polar materials are addressed by examining
bare and integrated electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and phonon spectra. Results are obtained
in the zero temperature limit for two semiconductors heavily discussed in the literature, namely
GaAs and anatase TiO$_2$, characterized by the weak and the moderate electron-phonon interaction
(EPI), respectively. The most prominent spectral features are identified, not only as a function
of the electron density defining the adiabaticity parameter, yet also from the perspective of the
EPI strength. While the adiabaticity parameter governs excitations' dispersions, our findings
show that the EPI strength profoundly affects the damping of excitations within the electron-hole
continuum and the distribution of the spectral weight in both the EELS and the phonon spectra. For
the weak EPI, the phonon-like excitation is generally well defined and the total EELS spectral weight
is redistributed equally among two excitations in the antiadiabatic and the resonant regime. On
contrary, in these two regimes, when the EPI is stronger there exist no well-defined collective
excitations in a broad range of momenta of the order of magnitude of the Fermi wave vector, with the
damping being enhanced by the increasing plasmonic character of excitations. Furthermore, the
EELS spectral weight is dominated by the higher frequency excitation, allowing for an experimental
estimate of the EPI strength even when the energy resolution is limited. The stronger EPI is accompanied
by the large additional phonon spectral weight unambiguously attributed to the lower frequency
excitation. In the adiabatic regime, this additional phonon spectra weight is a consequence of
the phonon softening effects, while in the antiadiabatic regime it arises due to the virtual cloud
of phonons that accompanies the plasma oscillations.

We demonstrate the presence of an optical phase transition with frustration-induced spontaneous
symmetry breaking in a triangular planar atomic array due to cooperative light-mediated interactions.
We show how the array geometry of triangle unit cells at low light intensities leads to degenerate
collective radiative excitations forming nearly flat bands. We drive degenerate pairs of collective
excitations to be equally populated in both cases of the atomic polarization in the lattice plane
and perpendicular to it. At higher intensities, above specific threshold values, this symmetry
in the populations is spontaneously broken. We also develop an effective few-mode model that provides
semianalytic descriptions of the symmetry-breaking threshold and infinite-lattice limit phase
transition. Surprisingly, we find how excitations due to dipolar interactions correspond to optical
analogs of those found in frustrated magnets and superfluids, with closely related symmetry-breaking
mechanisms despite the significant physical differences between these systems, opening potential
for simulating even quantum magnetism. Transmitted light through the array conveys information
about symmetry breaking in the hysteresis behavior of the spectrum. Moreover, in a Mott-insulator
state, the atomic positions are subject to zero-point quantum fluctuations. Interpreting each
stochastic realization as a light-induced quantum measurement of the atomic position configuration,
we find how strong nonlinearities and even weak position uncertainties lead to considerable measurement-induced
symmetry breaking, while ensemble-averaging over many realizations restores the original symmetry
and the unbroken state. Larger position uncertainty results in the formation of domains of different
broken symmetries.

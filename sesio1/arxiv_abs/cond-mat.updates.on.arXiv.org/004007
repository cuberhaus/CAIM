Graphene grown via chemical vapour deposition (CVD) on copper foil has emerged as a high-quality,
scalable material, that can be easily integrated on technologically relevant platforms to develop
promising applications in the fields of optoelectronics and photonics. Most of these applications
require low-contaminated high-mobility graphene (i.e., approaching 10 000 $cm^2 V^{-1} s^{-1}$)
at room temperature) to reduce device losses and implement compact device design. To date, these
mobility values are only obtained when suspending or encapsulating graphene. Here, we demonstrate
a rapid, facile, and scalable cleaning process, that yields high-mobility graphene directly on
the most common technologically relevant substrate: silicon dioxide on silicon (SiO$_2$/Si).
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and spatially-resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
demonstrate that this approach is instrumental to rapidly eliminate most of the polymeric residues
which remain on graphene after transfer and fabrication and that have adverse effects on its electrical
properties. Raman measurements show a significant reduction of graphene doping and strain. Transport
measurements of 50 Hall bars (HBs) yield hole mobility ${\mu}_h$ up to 9000 $cm^2 V^{-1} s^{-1}$
and electron mobility ${\mu}_e$ up to 8000 $cm^2 V^{-1} s^{-1}$, with average values ${\mu}_h$
7500 $cm^2 V^{-1} s^{-1}$ and ${\mu}_e$ 6300 $cm^2 V^{-1} s^{-1}$. The carrier mobility of ultraclean
graphene reach values nearly double of that measured in graphene HBs processed with acetone cleaning,
which is the method widely adopted in the field. Notably, these mobility values are obtained over
large-scale and without encapsulation, thus paving the way to the adoption of graphene in optoelectronics
and photonics.

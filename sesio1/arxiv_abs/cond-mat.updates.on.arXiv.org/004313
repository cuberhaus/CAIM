To implement quantum light sources based on quantum emitters in applications, it is desirable to
improve the extraction efficiency of single photons. In particular controlling the directionality
and solid angle of the emission are key parameters, for instance, to couple single photons into optical
fibers and send the information encoded in quantum light over long distances, for quantum communication
applications. In addition, fundamental studies of the radiative behavior of quantum emitters,
including studies of coherence and blinking, benefit from such improved photon collection. Quantum
dots grown via Stranski-Krastanov technique have shown to be good candidates for bright, coherent,
indistinguishable quantum light emission. However, one of the challenges associated with these
quantum light sources arises from the fact that the emission wavelengths can vary from one emitter
to the other. To this end, broadband light extractors that do not rely on high-quality factor optical
cavities would be desirable, so that no tuning between the quantum dot emission wavelength and the
resonator used to increase the light extraction is needed. Here, we show that metallic nano-rings
combined with gold back reflectors increase the collection efficiency of single photons and we
study the statistics of this effect when quantum dots are spatially randomly distributed within
the nano-rings. We show an average increase in the brightness of about a factor 7.5, when comparing
emitters within and outside the nano-rings in devices with a gold back reflector, we measure count
rates exceeding 7 x 10^6 photons per second and single photon purities as high as 85% +/- 1%. These
results are important steps towards the realisation of scalable, broadband, easy to fabricate
sources of quantum light for quantum communication applications.

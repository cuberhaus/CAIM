Interactions of charge carriers with lattice vibrations, or phonons, play a critical role in unconventional
electronic transport of metals and semimetals. Recent observations of phonon-mediated collective
electron flow in bulk semimetals, termed electron hydrodynamics, present new opportunities in
the search for strong electron-electron interactions in high carrier density materials. Here
we present the general transport signatures of such a second-order scattering mechanism, along
with analytical limits at the Eliashberg level of theory. We study electronic transport, using
$ab$ $initio$ calculations, in finite-size channels of semimetallic ZrSiS and TaAs$_2$ with and
without topological band crossings, respectively. The order of magnitude separation between
momentum-relaxing and momentum-conserving scattering length-scales across a wide temperature
range make both of them promising candidates for further experimental observation of electron
hydrodynamics. More generally, our calculations show that the hydrodynamic transport regime
can be realized in a much broader class of anisotropic metals and does not, to first order, rely on
the topological nature of the bands. Finally, we discuss general design principles guiding future
search for hydrodynamic candidates, based on the analytical formulation and our $ab$ $initio$
predictions. We find that systems with strong electron-phonon interactions, reduced electronic
phase space, and suppressed phonon-phonon scattering at temperatures of interest are likely to
feature hydrodynamic electron transport. We predict that layered and/or anisotropic semimetals
composed of half-filled $d$-shells and light group V/VI elements with lower crystal symmetry are
ideal candidates to observe hydrodynamic phenomena in future.

Experimental studies of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at nitrogen doped graphene electrodes
have reported a remarkably low overpotential, on the order of 0.5 V, similar to Pt based electrodes.
Theoretical calculations using density functional theory have lent support for this claim. However,
other measurements have indicated that transition metal impurities are actually responsible
for the ORR activity, thereby raising questions about the reliability of both the experiments and
the calculations. In order to assess the accuracy of the theoretical calculations, various generalized
gradient approximation (GGA), meta-GGA and hybrid functionals are employed here and calibrated
against high-level wave function based coupled cluster calculations (CCSD(T)) of the overpotential
as well as self-interaction corrected density functional calculations and published quantum
Monte Carlo calculations of O adatom binding to graphene. The PBE0 and HSE06 hybrid functionals
are found to give more accurate results than the GGA and meta-GGA functionals, as would be expected,
and for low dopant concentration, 3.1%, the overpotential is calculated to be 1.0 V. The GGA and meta-GGA
functionals give a lower estimate by as much as 0.4 V. When the dopant concentration is doubled, the
overpotential calculated with hybrid functionals drops, while it increases in GGA functional
calculations. The opposite trends result from different potential determining steps, the *OOH
species being of central importance in the hybrid functional calculations while the reduction
of *O determines the overpotential obtained in GGA and meta-GGA calculations. The results presented
here are mainly based on calculations of periodic representations of the system, but a comparison
is also made with molecular flake models which are found to give erratic results.

We report the charge storing 2D carbon nitride potassium poly(heptazine imide), K-PHI, as a direct
memristive (bio)sensing platform. Memristive devices have the potential to innovate current
(bio)electronic systems such as photo-electrochemical sensors by incorporating new sensing
capabilities including non-invasive, wireless remote and time-delayed (memory) readout. We
demonstrate a direct photomemristive sensing platform that capitalizes on K PHI's visible light
bandgap, large oxidation potential and intrinsic optoionic light energy storage properties.
Our system simultaneously enables analyte concentration information storage as well as potentiometric,
impedimetric and coulo-metric readouts on the same material, with no additional reagents required.
Utilizing the light-induced charge storage function of K-PHI, we demonstrate analyte sensing
via charge accumulation and present various methods to write/erase this information from the material.
Additionally, fully wireless colorimetric and fluorometric detection of the charged state of
K-PHI is demonstrated and could facilitate its use as particle-based in-situ sensing probe. The
various readout options of the K PHI's response enable us to adapt the sensitivities and dynamic
ranges without modifying the sensor. We demonstrate these features using glucose as an example
analyte over a wide range of concentrations (50 $\mu$M to 50 mM). Moreover, due to the strong oxidative
power of K-PHI, this sensing platform is able to detect a large variety of organic or biologically
relevant analytes. Since PHI is easily synthesized, based on earth abundant precursors, biocompatible,
chemically robust and responsive to visible light, we anticipate that the sensing platform presented
herein opens up novel memristive and neuromorphic functions.

Corrosion is a ubiquitous failure mode of materials in extreme environments. The more localized
it is, the more difficult it is to detect and more deleterious its effects. Often, the progression
of localized corrosion is accompanied by the evolution of porosity in materials, creating internal
void-structures that facilitate the ingress of the external environment into the interior of the
material, further accelerating the internal corrosion. Previously, the dominant morphology
of such void-structures has been reported to be either three-dimensional (3D) or two-dimensional
(2D). Here, we report a more localized form of corrosion, which we call 1D wormhole corrosion. Using
electron tomography, we show multiple examples of this 1D and percolating morphology that manifests
a significantly high aspect ratio differentiable from 2D and 3D corrosion. To understand the origin
of this mechanism in a Ni-Cr alloy corroded by molten salt, we combined energy-filtered four-dimensional
scanning transmission electron microscopy (EF-4D-STEM) and ab initio density functional theory
(DFT) calculations to develop a vacancy mapping method with nanometer-resolution, identifying
a remarkably high vacancy concentration in the diffusion-induced grain boundary migration (DIGM)
zone, up to 100 times the equilibrium value at the melting point. These vacancy supersaturation
regions act as the precursors of wormholes, and lead to the asymmetrical growth of voids along GBs.
We show that similar 1D penetrating corrosion morphologies could also occur in other materials
or corrosion conditions, implying the broad impact of this extremely localized corrosion mechanism.
Deciphering the origins of 1D corrosion is an important step towards designing structural materials
with enhanced corrosion resistance, and also offers new pathways to create ordered-porous materials
for functional applications.

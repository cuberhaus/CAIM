The interplay of magnetism and topology lies at the heart of condensed matter physics, which offers
great opportunities to design intrinsic magnetic topological materials hosting a variety of exotic
topological quantum states including the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE), axion insulator
state, and Majorana bound states. Extending this concept to one-dimension (1D) systems offers
additional rich quantum spin physics with great promise for molecular-scale spintronics. Despite
recent progress in the discovery of symmetry-protected topological quantum phases in 1D graphene
nanoribbons (GNRs), the rational design and realization of magnetic topological GNRs (MT-GNRs)
represents a grand challenge, as one must tackle multiple dimensions of complexity including time-reversal
symmetry (TRS), spatial symmetry (width, edge, end geometry) and many-electron correlations.
Here, we devised a new route involving the real- and reciprocal-space descriptions by unifying
the chemists and physicists perspectives, for the design of such MT-GNRs with non-trivial electronic
topology and robust magnetic terminal. Classic Clar's rule offers a conceptually qualitative
real-space picture to predict the transition from closed-shell to open-shell with terminal magnetism,
and band gap reopening with possible non-trivial electronic topology in a series of wave-like GNRs,
which are further verified by first principle calculations of band-structure topology in a momentum-space.
With the advance of on-surface synthesis and careful design of molecular precursors, we have fabricated
these MT-GNRs with observation of topological edge bands, whose terminal pi-magnetism can be directly
captured using a single-nickelocene spin sensor. Moreover, the transition from strong anti-ferromagnetic
to weak coupling (paramagnetism-like) between terminal spins can be controlled by tuning the length
of MT-GNRs.

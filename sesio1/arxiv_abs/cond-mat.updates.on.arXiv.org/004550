Epitaxial semiconductor-superconductor (SM-SC) hybrid nanowires are potential candidates
for implementing Majorana qubits. Recent experimental and theoretical works show that charged
impurities in SM remain a major problem in all existing hybrid nanowires, in which the SM is either
InAs or InSb while the SC is mainly Al. Here, we theoretically validate the recently proposed PbTe-Pb
hybrid nanowire as a potential candidate for Majorana devices. By studying the electrostatic and
electronic properties of PbTe nanowires, we demonstrate that the huge dielectric constant of PbTe
endows itself a high tolerance of charged impurity, which is a potential advantage over InAs and
InSb nanowires. Moreover, we find that the effective axial Land\'{e} $g$ factor and Rashba spin-orbit
coupling strength of PbTe nanowires are comparable to those of InAs nanowires. The conceivable
merits of using Pb as the SC are (i) Pb has a larger superconducting gap, higher critical temperature,
and higher parallel critical magnetic field than those of Al; (ii) a superconducting gap comparable
with those of InAs-Al and InSb-Al can be induced in PbTe-Pb even by a weak coupling between Pb and PbTe,
which simultaneously relieves the adverse renormalization and induced disorder effects on SM
from SC; and (iii) Pb film can be grown on PbTe with a thin buffer CdTe layer in between, solving the
lattice mismatch problem as an important source of disorder. In the presence of a parallel magnetic
field, we show that the typical BdG energy spectrum and tunneling spectroscopy of PbTe-Pb resemble
those of InAs and InSb based hybrid nanowires exposed to a tilting magnetic field, as a result of the
highly anisotropic Land\'{e} $g$ factors of PbTe nanowires. The calculated topological phase
diagrams of PbTe-Pb indicate that the multivalley character of PbTe makes it easier than InAs and
InSb to access topological superconducting phases.

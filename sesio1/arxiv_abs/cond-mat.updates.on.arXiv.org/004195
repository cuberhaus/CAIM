The atomization energies of molecules from first-principles density functional approximations
improve from the local spin-density approximation (LSDA) to the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE))
generalized gradient approximation (GGA) to the strongly constrained and appropriately normed
(SCAN) meta-GGA, and their sensitivities to non-spherical components of the density increase
in the same order. Thus, these functional advances increase density sensitivity and imitate the
exact constrained search over correlated wavefunctions better than that over ensembles. The diatomic
molecules studied here, singlet C2 and F2 plus triplet B2 and O2, have cylindrically symmetric densities.
Because the densities of the corresponding atoms are non-spherical, the approximate Kohn-Sham
potentials for the atoms have a lower symmetry than that of the external (nuclear) potential, so
that the non-interacting wavefunctions are not eigenstates of the square of total orbital angular
momentum, breaking a symmetry that yields a feature of the exact ground-state density. That spatial
symmetry can be preserved by a non-self-consistent approach in which a self-consistent equilibrium-ensemble
calculation is followed by integer re-occupation of the Kohn-Sham orbitals, as the first of several
steps. The symmetry-preserving approach is different from symmetry restoration based upon projection.
First-step space- (and space-spin-) symmetry preservation in atoms is shown to have a small effect
on the atomization energies of molecules, quantifying earlier observations by Fertig and Kohn.
Thus, the standard Kohn-Sham way of calculating atomization energies, with self-consistent symmetry
breaking to minimize the energy, is justified, at least for the common cases where the molecules
cannot break symmetry.

As a platform for optoelectronic devices based on exciton dynamics, monolayer transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are often placed near metal interfaces or inside planar cavities. While
the radiative properties of point dipoles at metal interfaces has been studied extensively, those
of excitons, which are delocalized and exhibit a temperature-dependent momentum distribution,
lack a thorough treatment. Here, we analyze the emission properties of excitons in TMDCs near planar
metal interfaces and explore their dependence on exciton center-of-mass momentum, transition
dipole orientation, and temperature. Defining a characteristic energy scale $k_B T_c = (\hbar
k)^2/2m$~($k$ being the radiative wavevector and $m$ the exciton mass), we find that at temperatures
$T\gg T_c$ and low densities where the momentum distribution can be characterized by Maxwell-Boltzmann
statistics, the modified emission rates~(normalized to free space) behave similarly to point
dipoles at temperatures $T\gg T_c$. This similarity in behavior arises due to the broad nature of
wavevector components making up the exciton and point dipole emission. On the other hand, the narrow
momentum distribution of excitons for $T<T_c$ can result in significantly different emission
behavior as compared to point dipoles. These differences can be further amplified by considering
excitons with a Bose Einstein distribution at high phase space densities. We find suppression or
enhancement of emission relative to the point dipole case by several orders of magnitude. These
insights can help optimize the performance of optoelectronic devices that incorporate 2D semiconductors
near metal electrodes and can inform future studies of exciton radiative dynamics at low temperatures.
Additionally, these studies show that nanoscale optical cavities are a viable pathway to generating
long-lifetime exciton states in TMDCs.

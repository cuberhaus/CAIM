Hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites are exceedingly interesting candidates for new solar energy
technologies, for both ground-based and space applications. However, their large-scale production
is hampered by the lack of long-term stability, mostly associated to ion migration. The specific
role of non-covalent bonds in contributing to the stability remains elusive, and in certain cases
controversial. Here, we perform an investigation on a large perovskite chemical space via a combination
of first-principles calculations for the bond strengths and the recently developed Sure Independent
Screening and Sparsifying Operator (SISSO) algorithm. The latter is used to formulate mathematical
descriptors that, by highlighting the importance of specific non-covalent molecular bonds, can
guide the design of perovskites with suppressed ion migration. The results unveil the distinct
nature of different non-covalent interactions, with remarkable differences compared to previous
arguments and interpretations in the literature on the basis of smaller chemical spaces. In particular,
we clarify the origin of the higher stability offered by FA compared to MA, which shows to be different
from previous arguments in the literature, the reasons of the improved stability given by the halogen
F, and explain the exceptional case of overall stronger bonds for Guanidiunium. The found descriptors
reveal the criteria that, within the stability boundaries given by the Goldschmidt factor, give
an all-in-one picture of non-covalent interactions which provide the more stable configurations,
also including interactions other than H-bonds. Such descriptors are more informative than previously
used quantities and can be used as universal input to better inform new machine learning studies.

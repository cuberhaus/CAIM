Everyday experience confirms the tendency of adhesive films to detach from spheroidal regions
of rigid substrates -- what is a petty frustration when placing a sticky bandage onto an elbow or knee
is a more serious matter in the coating and painting industries. Irrespective of their resistance
to bending, a key driver of such phenomena is Gauss' \textit{Theorema Egregium}, which implies
that naturally flat sheets cannot conform to doubly-curved surfaces without developing a strain
whose magnitude grows sharply with the curved area. Previous attempts to characterize the onset
of curvature-induced delamination, and the complex patterns it gives rise to, assumed a dewetting-like
mechanism in which the propensity of two materials to form contact through interfacial energy is
modified by an elastic energy penalty. We show that this approach may characterize moderately bendable
adhesive sheets, but fails qualitatively to describe the curvature-induced delamination of ultrathin
films, whose mechanics is governed by their propensity to buckle under minute levels of compression.
Combining mechanical and geometrical considerations, we introduce a minimal model for curvature-induced
delamination that accounts for two elementary buckling motifs, shallow "rucks" and localized
"folds". We predict nontrivial scaling rules for the onset of curvature-induced delamination
and various features of the emerging patterns, which compare well with experimental observations.
Beyond gaining control on the use of ultrathin adhesives in cutting edge technologies such as stretchable
electronics, our analysis is a significant step towards quantifying the multiscale morphological
complexity that emerges upon imposing geometrical and mechanical constraints on highly bendable
solid objects.

We grafted polyacrylic acid brushes containing cysteine side chains at a defined surface density
on planar lipid membranes. Specular X-ray reflectivity data indicated that the addition of Cd2+
ions induces the compaction of the polymer brush layer and modulates the adhesion of lipid vesicles.
The critical threshold level inducing the switch from non-wetting to partial wetting state, [Cd2+]
= 0.25 mM, was determined by microinterferometry. The interactions between vesicles and brushes
were evaluated by height fluctuations of the membrane in contact with brushes and the shape of vesicles
near the surface. To analyze these experiments, we have studied adhesion of axially symmetric vesicles
for finite-range membrane-substrate interaction and buoyancy through simulations. We found
that the local transversality condition that relates the maximal curvature at the edge of the adhesion
zone to the adhesion strength remains rather accurate. Thus, although it is not experimentally
possible to prepare vesicles at zero buoyancy, we can use the transversality condition to estimate
the adhesion strength. However, the adhesion diagram is significantly modified by a finite range
of membrane-substrate interaction and buoyancy. For downward buoyancy, vesicles merely sediment
onto the substrate and there is no mean-field adhesion transition. For upward buoyancy, adhered
vesicles are metastable at best. Thus, a mean-field adhesion transition can only occur at vanishing
buoyancy. Only for zero-range membrane-substrate interaction does a second-order adhesion transition
occur at finite interaction strength. For any finite-range interaction, the transition occurs
when the membrane-substrate interaction changes from repulsive to attractive. We present a adhesion
diagram as a function of adhesion strength and buoyancy and compare the adhesion behavior of vesicles
to the wetting behavior of droplets of liquids.

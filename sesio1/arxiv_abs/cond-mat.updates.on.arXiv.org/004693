Defects in two-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs) contain signatures of their characteristics.
In this work, we compute the entanglement entropy (EE) and the entanglement negativity (EN) of subsystems
in the presence of energy and duality defects in the Ising CFT using the density matrix renormalization
group (DMRG) technique. We show that the EE for the duality defect exhibits fundamentally different
characteristics compared to the energy defect due to the existence of localized and delocalized
zero energy modes. Of special interest is the nontrivial `finite-size correction' in the EE obtained
recently using free fermion computations. These corrections arise when the subsystem size is appreciable
compared to the total system size and lead to a deviation from the usual logarithmic scaling characteristic
of one-dimensional quantum-critical systems. Using matrix product states with open and infinite
boundary conditions, we numerically demonstrate the disappearance of the zero mode contribution
for finite subsystem sizes in the thermodynamic limit. Our results provide further support to the
recent free fermion computations, but clearly contradict earlier analytical field theory calculations
based on twisted torus partition functions. Subsequently, we compute the logarithm of the EN (log-EN)
between two disjoint subsystems separated by a defect. We show that the log-EN scales logarithmically
with the separation of the subsystems. However, the coefficient of this logarithmic scaling yields
a continuously-varying effective central charge that is different from that obtained from analogous
computations of the EE. The defects leave their fingerprints in the subleading term of the scaling
of the log-EN. Furthermore, the log-EN receives similar `finite size corrections' like the EE which
leads to deviations from its characteristic logarithmic scaling.

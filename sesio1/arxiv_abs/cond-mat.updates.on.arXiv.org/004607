Capture, selective collection and flight manipulation of airborne particulate are three important
functional requirements in various actively growing aerosol technology applications. Aerodynamic
drag, particle inertia and dielectrophoretic (DEP) force due to externally applied electrostatic
forces influence the behavior of micron sized particles significantly, in such situations. In
this work, we numerically study how a combination of these forces uniquely influences the behavior
of uncharged or mildly charged airborne particles, distinct from that with their individual influences.
Uncharged particle movements in a numerically fabricated well structured steady vortical flow
between two curved electrode surfaces are analyzed. Vortical air circulation towards and away
from the electrode tip enhances and deteriorates electrostatic particulate capture on the electrodes,
termed as co and counter directions with respect to the electrostatic force on particles respectively.
Particles in counter vortices under an electric field reveals a rich variety of unique behaviors
due to the interplay of drag, inertia and DEP forces. Distortion of the vortex structure due to convexity
of electrode surfaces results in an inverse inertial limit cycle trajectory trapping of particles;
with the airborne particles spatially segregated, trapping larger particles further inside the
vortex than the smaller particles.Value of a dimensionless number $\xi_v$, the ratio of DEP force
and particle inertia, represents the combination of the operating flow and electric field strengths.
Inertial cut-off of particle capture in this configuration abruptly shift to DEP capture at a critical
value of $\xi_v\approx 0.2$, as its value increases. Selective deposition of particles within
a closed range of size and density, emerges due to the interplay of vortex trapping, inertial expulsion
and electrostatic capture.

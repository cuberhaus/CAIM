A theoretical framework is developed to describe the Topological Langmuir-Cyclotron Wave (TLCW),
a recently identified topological surface excitation in magnetized plasmas. As a topological
wave, the TLCW propagates unidirectionally without scattering in complex boundaries. The TLCW
is studied theoretically as a spectral flow of the Hamiltonian Pseudo-Differential-Operator
(PDO) $\hat{H}$ for waves in an inhomogeneous plasma. The semi-classical parameter of the Weyl
quantization for plasma waves is identified to be the ratio between electron gyro-radius and the
inhomogeneity scale length of the system. Hermitian eigenmode bundles of the bulk Hamiltonian
symbol H for plasma waves are formally defined. Because momentum space in classical continuous
media is contractible in general, the topology of the eigenmode bundles over momentum space is trivial.
This is in stark contrast to condensed matters. Nontrivial topology of the eigenmode bundles in
classical continuous media only exists over phase space. A boundary isomorphism theorem is established
to facilitate the calculation of Chern numbers of eigenmode bundles over non-contractible manifolds
in phase space. It also defines a topological charge of an isolated Weyl point in phase space without
adopting any connection. Using these algebraic topological techniques and an index theorem formulated
by Faure, it is rigorously proven that the nontrivial topology at the Weyl point of the Langmuir wave-cyclotron
wave resonance generates the TLCW as a spectral flow. It is shown that the TLCW can be faithfully modeled
by a tilted Dirac cone in phase space. An analytical solution of the entire spectrum of the PDO of a
generic tilted phase space Dirac cone, including its spectral flow, is given. The spectral flow
index of a tilted Dirac cone is one, and its mode structure is a shifted Gaussian function.

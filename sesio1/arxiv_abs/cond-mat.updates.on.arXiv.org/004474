Microgels, cross-linked polymers with submicrometer size, are ideal soft model systems. While
spherical microgels have been studied extensively, anisotropic microgels have been hardly investigated.
In this study, we compare the interfacial deformation and assembly of anisotropic core-shell and
hollow microgels. The core-shell microgel consists of an elliptical core of hematite covered with
a thin silica layer and a thin shell made of PNiPAM. The hollow microgels were obtained after a two
step etching procedure of the inorganic core. The behavior of these microgels at the oil-water interface
was investigated in a Langmuir Blodgett trough combined with ex-situ AFM. First, the influence
of the architecture of anisotropic microgels on their spreading at the interface was investigated
experimentally and by dissipative particle dynamic simulations. Hereby, the importance of the
local shell thickness on the lateral and longitudinal interfacial deformation was highlighted
as well as the differences between the core-shell and hollow architectures. The shape of the compression
isotherms as well as the dimensions, ordering and orientation of the microgels at the different
compressions were analysed. Due to their anisotropic shape and stiffness, both anisotropic microgels
were found to exhibit significant capillary interactions with a preferential side-to-side assembly
leading to stable microgel clusters at low interfacial coverage. Such capillary interactions
were found to decrease in the case of the more deformable hollow anisotropic microgels. Consequently,
anisotropic hollow microgels were found to distribute more evenly at high surface pressure compared
to stiffer core-shell microgels. Our findings emphasize the complex interplay between the colloid
design, anisotropy and softness on the interfacial assembly and the opportunities it thus offers
to create more complex ordered interfaces.

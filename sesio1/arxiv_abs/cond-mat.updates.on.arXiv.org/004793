Understanding the origin of valence band maxima (VBM) splitting in transition metal dichalcogenides
(TMDs) is important because it governs the unique spin and valley physics in monolayer and multilayer
TMDs. In this work, we present our systematic study of VBM splitting ($\Delta$) in atomically thin
MoS$_2$ and WS$_2$ by employing photocurrent spectroscopy as we change the temperature and the
layer numbers. We found that VBM splitting in monolayer MoS$_2$ and WS$_2$ depends strongly on temperature,
which contradicts the theory that spin-orbit coupling solely determines the VBM splitting in monolayer
TMDs. We also found that the rate of change of VBM splitting with respect to temperature ($m=\frac{\partial\Delta}{\partial
T}$) is the highest for monolayer (-0.14 meV/K for MoS$_2$) and the rate decreases as the layer number
increases ($m ~ 0$ meV/K for 5 layers MoS$_2$). We performed density functional theory (DFT) and
the GW with Bethe-Salpeter Equation (GW-BSE) calculations to determine the electronic band structure
and optical absorption for a bilayer MoS$_2$ with different interlayer separations. Our simulations
agree with the experimental observations and demonstrate that the temperature dependence of VBM
splitting in atomically thin monolayer and multilayer TMDs originates from the changes in the interlayer
coupling strength between the neighboring layers. By studying two different types of TMDs and many
different layer thicknesses, we also demonstrate that VBM splitting also depends on the layer numbers
and type of transition metals. Our study will help understand the role spin-orbit coupling and interlayer
interaction play in determining the VBM splitting in quantum materials and develop next-generation
devices based on spin-orbit interactions.

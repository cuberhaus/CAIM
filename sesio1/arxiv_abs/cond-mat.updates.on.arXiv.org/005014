In magnetic materials, spins sometimes freeze into spatially disordered glassy states. Glass
forming liquids or structural glasses are found very often in three dimensions. However, in two
dimensions(2D) it is believed that both spin glass and structural glass can never exist at a finite
temperature because they are destroyed by thermal fluctuations. Using a large-scale quantum Monte
Carlo simulation, we discover a quantum-mechanically driven 2D glass phase at finite temperatures.
Our platform is an Ising spin model with a quantum transverse field on a frustrated triangular lattice.
How the present glass phase is formed is understood by the following three steps. First, by the interplay
of geometrical frustration and quantum fluctuation, part of the spins spontaneously form an antiferromagnetic
honeycomb spin-superstructure. Then, small randomness in the bond interaction works as a relevant
perturbation to this superstructure and breaks it up into {\it domains}, making it a structural
glass. The glassiness of the superstructure, in turn, generates an emergent random magnetic field
acting on the remaining fluctuating spins and freezes them. The shape of domains thus formed depends
sensitively on the quenching process, which is one of the characteristic features of glass, originating
from a multi-valley free-energy landscape. The present system consists only of {\it a single} bistable
Ising degree of freedom, which naturally does not become a structural glass alone nor a spin glass
alone. Nevertheless, a glass having both types of nature emerges in the form of coexisting two-component
glasses, algebraic structural-glass and long-range ordered spin-glass. This new concept of glass-forming
mechanism opens a way to realize functional glasses even in low dimensional systems.

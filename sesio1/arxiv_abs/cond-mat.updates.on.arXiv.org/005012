In a strongly correlated system, collective excitations contain key information regarding the
electronic order of the underlying ground state. An abundance of collective modes in the spin and
valley isospin channels of magic-angle graphene moir\'e bands has been alluded to by a series of
recent experiments. However, direct observation of collective excitations has remained elusive
due to the lack of a spin probe. In this work, we use a resistively-detected electron spin resonance
technique to look for low-energy collective excitations in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene.
We report direct observation of collective modes in the form of microwave-induced resonance near
half filling of the moir\'e flatbands. The frequency-magnetic field dependence of these resonance
modes sheds light onto the nature of intervalley spin coupling, allowing us to extract parameters
such as intervalley exchange interaction and spin stiffness. Two independent observations testify
that the generation and detection of the microwave resonance relies on the strong correlation within
the flat moir\'e energy band. First, the onset of robust resonance response coincides with the spontaneous
flavor polarization at half moir\'e filling, and remains absent in the density range where the underlying
Fermi surface is isospin unpolarized. Second, we performed the same resonance measurement on graphene
monolayer and bilayer samples, including twisted bilayer with a large twist angle, where flatband
physics is absent. We observe no indication of resonance response in these samples across a large
range of carrier density, microwave frequency and power. A natural explanation is that the resonance
response near the magic angle originates from "Dirac revivals" and the resulting isospin order.

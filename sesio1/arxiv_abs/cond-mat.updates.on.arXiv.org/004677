Spin-$1/2$ chains with alternating antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic couplings have attracted
considerable interest due to the topological character of their spin excitations. Here, using
density functional theory and density matrix renormalization group methods, we have systematically
studied the dimerized chain system Na$_2$Cu$_2$TeO$_6$. Near the Fermi level, the dominant states
are mainly contributed by the Cu $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals highly hybridized with the O $2p$ orbitals
in the nonmagnetic phase, leading to an "effective" single-orbital low-energy model. Furthermore,
the bandwidth of the Cu $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ states is small ($\sim 0.8$ eV), suggesting that electronic
correlations will strongly affect this system. By introducing such electronic correlations,
we found this system is a Mott insulator. Moreover, by calculating the magnetic exchange interactions
($J_1$, $J_2$ and $J_3$), we explained the size and sign of the exchange interactions in Na$_2$Cu$_2$TeO$_6$,
in agreement with neutron experiments. In addition, we constructed a single-orbital Hubbard model
for this dimerized chain system, where the quantum fluctuations are taken into account. Both AFM
and FM coupling ($\uparrow$-$\downarrow$-$\downarrow$-$\uparrow$) along the chain were found
in our DMRG and Lanczos calculations, in agreement with DFT and neutron results. We also calculated
the hole pairing binding energy $\Delta E$ which becomes negative at Hubbard $U \sim 11$ eV, indicating
incipient pairing tendencies. Finally, we also looked at various cases of hole doping that always
exhibit tight pairs. Thus, we believe our results for Na$_2$Cu$_2$TeO$_6$ could provide guidance
to experimentalists and theorists working on this dimerized chain system, such as short-range
magnetic coupling, doping effects, and possible pairing tendencies.

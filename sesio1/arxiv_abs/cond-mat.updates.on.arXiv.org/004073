High-order topological insulator (HOTI) occupies an important position in topological band theory
due to its exotic bulk-edge correspondence. Recently, it has been predicted that external magnetic
field can introduce rich physics into two-dimensional (2D) HOTIs. However, up to now the theoretical
description is still incomplete and the experimental realization is still lacking. Here we investigate
the influence of continuously varying magnetic field on 2D Su-Schriffer-Heeger lattice, which
is one of the most celebrated HOTI models, and proposed a corresponding circuit quantum electrodynamics
(cQED) simulator. Our numerical calculation shows that the zero energy corner modes (ZECMs), which
can serve as evidence of the high order topology of the lattice, exhibit exotic and rich dependence
on the imposed magnetic field and the inhomogeneous hopping strength. Moreover, by exploiting
the parametric conversion method, we can establish time- and site-resolved tunable hopping constants
in the proposed cQED simulator, thus providing an ideal platform for simulating the magnetic field
induced topological phase transitions in 2D HOTIs. Since the high-order topological phases of
the proposed model can be characterized by the existence of the ZECMs on the lattice, we further investigate
the corner site excitation of the lattice in the steady state limit. Our numerical results imply
that the predicted topological phase transitions can be unambiguously identified by the steady-state
photon number measurement of the corner sites and their few neighbors. Requiring only current level
of technology, our scheme can be readily tested in experiment and may pave an alternative way towards
the future investigation of HOTIs in the presence of magnetic field, disorder, and strong correlation.

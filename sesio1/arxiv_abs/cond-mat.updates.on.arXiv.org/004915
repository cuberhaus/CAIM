We apply the functional Renormalisation Group (fRG) to study relaxation in a stochastic process
governed by an overdamped Langevin equation with one degree of freedom, exploiting the connection
with supersymmetric quantum mechanics in imaginary time. After reviewing the functional integral
formulation of the system and its underlying symmetries, including the resulting Ward-Takahashi
identities for arbitrary initial conditions, we compute the effective action $\Gamma$ from the
fRG, approximated in terms of the leading and subleading terms in the gradient expansion: the Local
Potential Approximation and Wavefunction Renormalisation respectively. This is achieved by
coarse-graining the thermal fluctuations in time resulting in e.g. an effective potential incorporating
fluctuations at all timescales. We then use the resulting effective equations of motion to describe
the decay of the covariance, and the relaxation of the average position and variance towards their
equilibrium values at different temperatures. We use as examples a simple polynomial potential,
an unequal Lennard-Jones type potential and a more complex potential with multiple trapping wells
and barriers. We find that these are all handled well, with the accuracy of the approximations improving
as the relaxation's spectral representation shifts to lower eigenvalues, in line with expectations
about the validity of the gradient expansion. The spectral representation's range also correlates
with temperature, leading to the conclusion that the gradient expansion works better for higher
temperatures than lower ones. This work demonstrates the ability of the fRG to expedite the computation
of statistical objects in otherwise long-timescale simulations, acting as a first step to more
complicated systems.

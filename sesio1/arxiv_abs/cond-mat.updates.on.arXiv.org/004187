Novel multicaloric cooling utilizing the giant caloric response of Ni-Mn-based metamagnetic
shape-memory alloys to different external stimuli such as magnetic field, uniaxial load and hydrostatic
pressure is a promising candidate for energy-efficient and environmentally-friendly refrigeration.
However, the role of microstructure when several external fields are applied simultaneously or
sequentially has been scarcely discussed in literature. Here, we synthesized ternary Ni-Mn-In
alloys by suction casting and analyzed the microstructural influence on the response to magnetic
fields and uniaxial load. SEM-EBSD reveals a distinct core-shell microstructure with a radially
symmetric <001> solidification texture resulting in a two-step martensitic transformation.
In correlation with temperature-dependent XRD a significant effect of grain orientation on the
stress-induced martensitic transformation is demonstrated. The influence of microstructure
on the magnetic-field-induced transformation dynamics is studied by strain measurements in static
and pulsed fields. Temperature-stress and temperature-magnetic field phase diagrams are established
and single caloric performances are characterized in terms of ${\Delta}s_{T}$ and ${\Delta}T_{ad}$.
The cyclic ${\Delta}T_{ad}$ values are compared to the ones achieved in the multicaloric exploiting-hysteresis
cycle. It turns out that a tailored microstructure and the combination of both stimuli enable outstanding
caloric effects in moderate external fields which can significantly exceed the single caloric
performances. In particular for Ni-Mn-In, the maximum cyclic effect in magnetic fields of 1.9 T
is increased by more than 200 % to -4.1 K when a moderate sequential stress of 59 MPa is applied. Our
results illustrate the crucial role of microstructure for multicaloric cooling using Ni-Mn-based
metamagnetic shape-memory alloys.

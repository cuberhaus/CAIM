Grain size engineering, particularly reducing grain size into the nanocrystalline regime, offers
a promising pathway to further improve the strength-to-weight ratio of Al alloys. Unfortunately,
the fabrication of nanocrystalline metals often requires non-equilibrium processing routes,
which typically limit the specimen size and require large energy budgets. In this study, multiple
dopant atoms in ternary Al alloys are deliberately selected to enable segregation to the grain boundary
region and promote the formation of amorphous complexions. Three different fully dense bulk nanocrystalline
Al alloys (Al-Mg-Y, Al-Fe-Y, and Al-Ni-Y) with small grain sizes were successfully fabricated
using a simple powder metallurgy approach, with full densification connected directly to the onset
of amorphous complexion formation. All the compositions demonstrate densities above 99% with
grain sizes of <60 nm following consolidation via hot pressing at 585 oC. The very fine grain structure
results in excellent mechanical properties, with nanoindentation hardness values in the range
of 2.2-2.8 GPa. Detailed microstructural characterization verifies the segregation of all dopant
species to grain boundaries as well as the formation of amorphous complexions, which suggests their
influential role in aiding effective consolidation and endowing thermal stability in the alloys.
Moreover, nanorods with a core-shell structure are also observed at the grain boundaries, which
likely contribute to the stabilization of the grain structure and high strength. Finally, intermetallic
particles with a sizes of hundreds of nanometers form. As a whole, the results presented here demonstrate
a general alloy design strategy of segregation and boundary evolution pathway that enables the
fabrication of multiple nanocrystalline Al alloys with hierarchical microstructures and improved
performance.

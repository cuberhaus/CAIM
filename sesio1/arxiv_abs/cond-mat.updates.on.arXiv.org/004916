Quantum computers are anticipated to transcend classical supercomputers for computationally
intensive tasks by exploiting the principles of quantum mechanics. However, the capabilities
of the current generation of quantum devices are limited due to noise or errors, and therefore implementation
of error mitigation and/or correction techniques is pivotal to reliably process quantum algorithms.
In this work, we have performed a comparative analysis of the error mitigation capability of the
[[4,2,2]] quantum error-detecting code (QEC method), duplicate circuit technique, and the Bayesian
read-out error mitigation (BREM) approach in the context of proof-of-concept implementations
of variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm for determining the ground state energy of
H$_2$ molecule. Based on experiments on IBM quantum device, our results show that the duplicate
circuit approach performs superior to the QEC method in the presence of the hardware noise. A significant
impact of cross-talk noise was observed when multiple mappings of the duplicate circuit and the
QEC method were implemented simultaneously $-$ again the duplicate circuit approach overall performed
better than the QEC method. To gain further insights into the performance of the studied error mitigation
techniques, we also performed quantum simulations on IBM system with varying strengths of depolarising
circuit noise and read-out errors which further supported the main finding of our work that the duplicate
circuit offer superior performance towards mitigating of errors when compared to the QEC method.
Our work reports a first assessment of the duplicate circuit approach for a quantum algorithm implementation
and the documented evidence will pave the way for future scalable implementations of the duplicated
circuit techniques for the error-mitigated practical applications of near-term quantum computers.

Machine-matter, of which mechanical metamaterials and meta-devices are important sub-categories,
is emerging as a major paradigm for designing advanced functional materials. Various exciting
applications of these concepts have been recently demonstrated, ranging from exotic mechanical
properties to device-like and adaptive functionalities. The vast majority of the studies published
to date have, however, focused on the quasi-static behavior of such devices, neglecting their rich
dynamic behavior. Recently, we proposed a new class of strain rate-dependent mechanical metamaterials
that are made from bi-beams (i.e., viscoelastic bilayer beams). The buckling direction of such
bi-beams can be controlled with the applied strain rate. The proposed approach, however, suffers
from a major limitation: 3D printing of such bi-beams with such a 'strong' differential strain rate-dependent
response is very challenging. Here, we propose an alternative approach that only requires a 'weak'
differential response and a rationally designed geometric artifact to control the buckling direction
of bi-beams. We present an analytical model that describes the landscape of all possible combinations
of geometric designs and hyperelastic as well as viscoelastic properties that lead to the desired
strain rate-dependent switching of the buckling direction. We also demonstrate how multi- and
single-material 3D printing techniques can be used to fabricate the proposed bi-beams with microscale
and submicron resolutions. More importantly, we show how the requirement for a weak differential
response eliminates the need for multi-material 3D printing, as the change in the laser processing
parameters is sufficient to achieve effective differential responses. Finally, we use the same
3D printing techniques to produce strain rate-dependent gripper mechanisms as showcases of potential
applications.

Starting from a general classical model of many interacting particles we present a well defined
step by step procedure to derive the continuum-mechanics equations of nonlinear elasticity theory
with fluctuations which describe the macroscopic phenomena of a solid crystal. As the relevant
variables we specify the coarse-grained densities of the conserved quantities and a properly defined
displacement field which describes the local translations, rotations, and deformations. In order
to stay within the framework of the conventional density-functional theory we first and mainly
consider the isothermal case and omit the effects of heat transport and warming by friction where
later we extend our theory to the general case and include these effects. We proceed in two steps.
First, we apply the concept of local thermodynamic equilibrium and minimize the free energy functional
under the constraints that the macroscopic relevant variables are fixed. As results we obtain the
local free energy density and we derive explicit formulas for the elastic constants which are exact
within the framework of density-functional theory. Second, we apply the methods of nonequilibrium
statistical mechanics with projection-operator techniques. We extend the projection operators
in order to include the effects of coarse-graining and the displacement field. As a result we obtain
the time-evolution equations for the relevant variables with three kinds of terms on the right-hand
sides: reversible, dissipative, and fluctuating terms. We find explicit formulas for the transport
coefficients which are exact in the limit of continuum mechanics if the projection operators are
properly defined. By construction the theory allows the diffusion of particles in terms of point
defects where, however, in a normal crystal this diffusion is suppressed.

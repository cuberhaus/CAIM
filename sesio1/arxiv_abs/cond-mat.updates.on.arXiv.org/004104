A system of optimal biaxial molecules placed at the sites of a cubic lattice is studied in an extended
Lebwohl-Lasher model. Molecules interact only with their nearest neighbors through the pair potential
that depends on the molecule orientations. It is known that in the homogeneous system there is a direct
second-order transition from the isotropic to the biaxial nematic phase, but properties of confined
systems are less known. In the present paper the lattice has periodic boundary conditions in the
X and Y directions and it has two walls with planar anchoring, perpendicular to the Z direction. We
have investigated the model using Monte Carlo simulations on $N_x \times N_y \times N_z$ lattices,
$N_x = N_y = 10, 16$, $N_z$ from 3 to 19, with and without assuming mirror symmetry. This study is complementary
to the statistical description of hard spheroplatelets near a hard wall by Kapanowski and Abram
[Phys. Rev. E 89, 062503 (2014)]. The temperature dependence of the order-parameter profiles between
walls is calculated for many wall separations. For large wall separations there are the surface
layers with biaxial ordering at both walls (4-5 lattice constants wide) and beyond the surface layers
the order parameters have values as in the homogeneous system. For small wall separations the isotropic-biaxial
transition is shifted and the surface layers are thinner. Above the isotropic-biaxial transition
the preferable orientations in both surface layers can be different. It is interesting that planar
anchoring for biaxial molecules leads to the uniaxial interactions at the wall. As a result we get
the planar Lebwohl-Lasher model with additional (biaxial) interactions with the neighbors from
the second layer, where the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition is present.

Multi-molecular excited states accompanied by an intra- and inter-molecular geometric relaxation
are commonly encountered in optical and electrooptical studies and applications of organic semiconductors
as, for example excimers or charge transfer states. Understanding the dynamics of these states
is crucial to improve organic devices such as light emitting diodes and solar cells. Their full microscopic
description, however, demands for sophisticated tools such as ab-initio quantum chemical calculations
which come at the expenses of high computational costs and are prone to errors by assumptions as well
as iterative algorithmic procedures. Hence, the analysis of spectroscopic data is often conducted
on a phenomenological level only. Here, we present a toolkit to analyze temperature dependent luminescence
data and gain first insights into the relevant microscopic parameters of the molecular system at
hand. By means of a Franck-Condon based approach considering a single effective inter-molecular
vibrational mode and different potentials for the ground and excited state we are able to explain
the luminescence spectra of such multi-molecular states. We demonstrate that by applying certain
reasonable simplifications the luminescence of charge transfer states as well as excimers can
be satisfactorily reproduced for temperatures ranging from cryogenics to above room temperature.
We present a semi-classical and a quantum-mechanical description of our model and, for both cases,
demonstrate its applicability by analyzing the temperature depended luminescence of the amorphous
donor-acceptor heterojunction tetraphenyldibenzoperiflanthene:C$_{60}$ as well as polycrystalline
zinc-phthalocyanine to reproduce the luminescence spectra and extract relevant system parameters
such as the excimer binding energy.

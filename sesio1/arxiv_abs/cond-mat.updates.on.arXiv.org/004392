Researchers are currently exploring nanoporous two-dimensional materials, such as hexagonal
boron nitride (hBN), as potential desalination membranes. Here, we study the effect of grain boundaries
(GBs) and interfacial electrostatic interactions on the desalination performance of bicrystalline
nanoporous hBN, using classical molecular dynamics simulations supported by quantum-mechanical
density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We investigate three different nanoporous bicrystalline
hBN configurations, with symmetric tilt GBs having misorientation angles of 13.2{\deg}, 21.8{\deg},
and 32.2{\deg}. We find that grain boundaries alter the areas and shapes of nanopores in bicrystalline
hBN, as compared to the nanopores in monocrystalline hBN. We observe that, although bicrystalline
nanoporous hBN with a misorientation angle of 13.2{\deg} shows improved water flow rate by ~30%,
it demonstrates reduced Na$^\mathrm{+}$ ion rejection by ~6%, as compared to monocrystalline
hBN. We also uncover the role of the nanopore shape in water desalination, finding that more elongated
pores with smaller sizes (in 21.8{\deg}- and 32.2{\deg}-misoriented bicrystalline hBN) can match
the water permeation through less elongated pores of slightly larger sizes, with a concomitant
~3-4% drop in Na$^\mathrm{+}$ rejection. Simulations also predict that the water flow rate is significantly
affected by interfacial electrostatic interactions. Indeed, the water flow rate is the highest
when altered partial charges on B and N atoms were determined using DFT calculations, as compared
to when no partial charges or bulk partial charges (i.e., charged hBN) were considered. Overall,
our work on water/ion transport through nanopores in bicrystalline hBN indicates that the presence
of GBs and surface charge can lead, respectively, to a drop in the ion rejection and water permeation
performance of hBN membranes.

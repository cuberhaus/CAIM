The recently developed concept of spreadability, $\mathcal{S}(t)$, provides a direct link between
time-dependent diffusive transport and the microstructure of two-phase media across length scales.
We explicitly compute $\mathcal{S}(t)$ for well-known two-dimensional and three-dimensional
model structures, including nonhyperuniform fully penetrable spheres and equilibrium hard spheres,
as well as hyperuniform sphere packings derived from perfect glasses, uniformly randomized lattices
(URL), disordered stealthy point processes and Bravais lattices. We further confirm that the small-,
intermediate- and long-time behaviors of $\mathcal{S}(t)$ sensitively capture the small-, intermediate-
and large-scale characteristics of the models. In instances in which the spectral density $\tilde{\chi}_{_V}(\mathbf{k})$
has a power-law form $B|\mathbf{k}|^\alpha$ in the limit $|\mathbf{k}|\rightarrow 0$, the long-time
spreadability provides a simple means to extract the value of the coefficients $\alpha$ and $B$
that is robust against noise in $\tilde{\chi}_{_V}(\mathbf{k})$ at small wavenumbers. Interestingly,
the excess spreadability $\mathcal{S}(\infty)-\mathcal{S}(t)$ for URL packings has nearly
exponential decay at small to intermediate $t$, but transforms to a power-law decay at large $t$.
Our study of the aforementioned models enables us to devise an algorithm that accurately extracts
large-scale behaviors from diffusion data alone. Lessons learned from such analyses of our models
are used to determine accurately the large-scale structural characteristics of a sample Fontainebleau
sandstone, which we show is nonhyperuniform. Our study demonstrates the practical applicability
of the diffusion spreadability to extract crucial microstructural information from real data
across length scales and provides a basis for the inverse design of materials with desirable time-dependent
diffusion properties.

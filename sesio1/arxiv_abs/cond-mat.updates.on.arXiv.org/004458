We propose a physics and chemistry-based constitutive framework to predict the stress responses
of thermo-chemically aged elastomers and capture their brittle failure using the phase-field
approach. High-temperature aging in the presence of oxygen causes the macromolecular network
of elastomers to undergo complex chemical reactions inducing two main mechanisms: chain-scission
and crosslinking. Chemical crosslinking contributes to the stiffening behavior characterizing
the brittle response of aged elastomers. In this work, we first modify the Helmholtz free energy
to incorporate the effect of thermo-chemically-driven crosslinking processes. Then, we equip
the constitutive description with phase-field to capture the induced brittle failure via a strain-based
criterion for fracture. We show that our proposed framework is self-contained and requires only
four main material properties whose evolution due to thermo-chemical aging is characterized entirely
by the change of the crosslink density obtained based on chemical characterization experiments.
The developed constitutive framework is first solved analytically for the case of uniaxial tension
in a homogeneous bar to highlight the interconnection between all four material properties. Then,
the framework is numerically implemented within a finite element (FE) context via a user-element
subroutine (UEL) in the commercial FE software Abaqus to simulate more complicated geometries
and loading states. The framework is finally validated with respect to a set of experimental results
available in the literature. The comparison confirms that the proposed constitutive framework
can accurately predict the mechanical response of thermo-chemically aged elastomers. Further
numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effects of evolving material properties on
the response of specimens containing pre-existing cracks.

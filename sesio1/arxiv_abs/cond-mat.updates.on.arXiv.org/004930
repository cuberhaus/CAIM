Solution-processed organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) active layers form sophisticated nanostructures
during the drying of the wet-deposited solution, because of complex physical processes such as
crystallization and/or liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). This structure strongly impacts
the photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells. However, the process-structure relationship
still remains poorly understood. In order to reach significant improvements, a better understanding
of the physics driving the active layer formation is required. In this work, we use a recently developed,
coupled phase-field--fluid mechanics framework to simulate the BHJ formation of organic photoactive
layers upon drying. For the first time, this allows to investigate the interplay between all the
relevant physical processes (evaporation, crystal nucleation and growth, liquid-liquid demixing),
as well as the impact of the composition-dependent kinetic properties, within a single coherent
theoretical framework. Using parameters inspired by the well-documented system P3HT-PCBM, first
simulations for real, crystalline photovoltaic systems are presented. We present an exhaustive
and very promising comparison with previously reported in-situ experimental characterization
of the drying structure: the morphology formation pathways, the crystallization kinetics, the
crystal growth kinetics as well as the final morphology are in line with experimental results. Depending
on the process parameters and material properties, the final BHJ morphology is a subtle mixture
of pure crystalline donor and acceptor phases, pure amorphous phases and amorphous mixed regions.
Such a theoretical approach could help identify physics-based design rules for ink formulation
and process parameters to be used in order to gain full control over the photoactive layer structure.

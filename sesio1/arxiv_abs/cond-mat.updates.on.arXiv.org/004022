Carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) sequestration in saline aquifers has been introduced as one of the most
practical, long-term, and safe solutions to tackle a growing threat originating from the emission
of CO$_2$. Successfully executing and planning the process necessitates a comprehensive understanding
of CO$_2$ transport properties -- particularly the diffusion coefficient, influencing the behavior
of CO$_2$ dissolution in water/brine regarding the shape of viscous fingers, the onset of instabilities,
etc. In this research, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation was employed to compute the CO$_2$ diffusion
coefficient in various NaCl saline water concentrations under the broad spectrum of temperatures
and pressures to acquire a data-set. The NaCl concentration increase gives rise to a decrease in
the CO$_2$ diffusion coefficient, by which the reduction is most notably at higher temperatures.
In addition, the rise in the CO$_2$ diffusion at elevated temperatures can be explained by the cation's
hydration shell size reduction with temperature increment due to intensifying repulsive forces
among water molecules. A new precise correlation is proposed for estimating CO$_2$ diffusion coefficients.
Regarding the pressure variation effects, no tangible changes are observed with pressure increase.
Furthermore, the variability of the CO$_2$ diffusion coefficient in the presence of other salts,
namely MgCl2, CaCl2, KCl, and Na2SO4, were computed separately. Comparing the influence of various
salts, CaCl2 and KCl have the highest and lowest effect on the CO$_2$ diffusion coefficient, respectively.
Finally, a set of direct numerical simulations was conducted to study the impact of the CO$_2$ diffusion
coefficient on the CO$_2$ dissolution process. The results shed light on the importance of CO$_2$
diffusion coefficient changes under the saline water condition in predicting dissolution process
behavior and further calculations.

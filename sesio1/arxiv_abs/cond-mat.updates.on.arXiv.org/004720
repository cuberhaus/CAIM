Ferromagnetic insulators (FM-Is) are the materials of interest for new generation quantum electronic
applications. Here, we have investigated the physical observables depicting FM-I ground states
in epitaxial Sm$ _{2} $NiMnO$ _{6} $ (SNMO) double perovskite thin films fabricated under different
conditions to realize different level of Ni/Mn anti-site disorders (ASDs). The presence of ASDs
immensely influence the characteristic magnetic and anisotropy behaviors in SNMO system by introducing
short scale antiferromagnetic interactions in predominant long range FM ordered host matrix.
Charge disproportion between cation sites in form of $ Ni^{2+}+Mn^{4+} \longrightarrow Ni^{3+}+Mn^{3+}
$, causes mixed valency in both Ni and Mn species, which is found insensitive to ASD concentrations.
Temperature dependent photo emission, photo absorption measurements duly combined with cluster
model configuration interaction simulations, suggest that the eigenstates of Ni and Mn cations
can be satisfactorily described as a linear combination of the unscreened $ d^{n} $ and screened
$ d^{n+1} \underline{L} $ ($ \underline{L} $: O 2\textit{p} hole) states. The electronic structure
across the Fermi level (E$ _{F} $) exhibits closely spaced Ni $ 3d $, Mn $ 3d $ and O $ 2p $ states. From
occupied and unoccupied bands, estimated values of the Coulomb repulsion energy ($ U $) and ligand
to metal charge transfer energy ($ \Delta $), indicate charge transfer insulating nature, where
remarkable modification in Ni/Mn $ 3d $ - O $ 2p $ hybridization takes place across the FM transition
temperature. Existence of ASD broadens the Ni, Mn $ 3d $ spectral features, whereas spectral positions
are found to be unaltered. Hereby, present work demonstrates SNMO thin film as a FM-I system, where
FM state can be tuned by manipulating ASD in the crystal structure, while I state remains intact.

Fracture of materials with rate-dependent mechanical behaviour, e.g. polymers, is a highly complex
process. For an adequate modelling, the coupling between rate-dependent stiffness, dissipative
mechanisms present in the bulk material and crack driving force has to be accounted for in an appropriate
manner. In addition, the fracture toughness, i.e. the resistance against crack propagation, can
depend on rate of deformation. In this contribution, an energetic phase-field model of rate-dependent
fracture at finite deformation is presented. For the deformation of the bulk material, a formulation
of finite viscoelasticity is adopted with strain energy densities of Ogden type assumed. The unified
formulation allows to study different expressions for the fracture driving force. Furthermore,
a possibly rate-dependent toughness is incorporated. The model is calibrated using experimental
results from the literature for an elastomer and predictions are qualitatively and quantitatively
validated against experimental data. Predictive capabilities of the model are studied for monotonic
loads as well as creep fracture. Symmetrical and asymmetrical crack patterns are discussed and
the influence of a dissipative fracture driving force contribution is analysed. It is shown that,
different from ductile fracture of metals, such a driving force is not required for an adequate simulation
of experimentally observable crack paths and is not favourable for the description of failure in
viscoelastic rubbery polymers. Furthermore, the influence of a rate-dependent toughness is discussed
by means of a numerical study. From a phenomenological point of view, it is demonstrated that rate-dependency
of resistance against crack propagation can be an essential ingredient for the model when specific
effects such as rate-dependent brittle-to-ductile transitions shall be described.

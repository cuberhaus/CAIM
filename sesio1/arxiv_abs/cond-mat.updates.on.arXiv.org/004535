The distribution of shortest path lengths (DSPL) of random networks provides useful information
on their large scale structure. In the special case of random regular graphs (RRGs), which consist
of $N$ nodes of degree $c \ge 3$, the DSPL, denoted by $P(L=\ell)$, follows a discrete Gompertz distribution.
Using the discrete Laplace transform and the Euler-Maclaurin formula we derive a closed-form expression
for the moment generating function of the DSPL of RRGs. From the moment generating function we obtain
closed-form expressions for the mean and variance of the DSPL. More specifically, we find that the
mean distance between pairs of distinct nodes is given by $\langle L \rangle = \frac{\ln N}{\ln (c-1)}
+ \frac{1}{2} - \frac{ \ln c - \ln (c-2) +\gamma}{\ln (c-1)} + \mathcal{O} \left( \frac{\ln N}{N}
\right)$, where $\gamma$ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. While the leading term is known, this
result includes a novel correction term, which yields very good agreement with the results obtained
from direct numerical evaluation of $\langle L \rangle$ via the tail-sum formula and with the results
obtained from computer simulations. However, it does not account for an oscillatory behavior of
$\langle L \rangle$ as a function of $c$, which is negligible in the sparse-network limit but detectable
in the dense-network limit. We also derive a closed-form expression for the variance ${\rm Var}(L)$
of the DSPL. This expression captures the overall dependence of the variance on the degree $c$ but
does not account for the oscillations. The oscillations of the mean and variance are analyzed and
discussed. The results for the mean and variance of the DSPL are compared to the corresponding results
obtained in other types of random networks. The relation to the diameter is also discussed.

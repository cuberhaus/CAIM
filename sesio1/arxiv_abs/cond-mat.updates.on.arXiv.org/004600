The vortex core of a type-II superconductor hosts discrete energy levels that carry critical information
about the parent normal state. For example, the levels are equally spaced with a zero-point energy
equal to half the level spacing if the parent state is an ordinary metal. If the parent state is a massless
Dirac fermion instead, the zero-point energy vanishes and an exotic Majorana fermion emerges.
Weyl semimetals, three-dimensional topological materials defined by accidental bulk band intersections
or Weyl nodes, host a peculiar metal on their surface composed of open Fermi arcs whose end points
merge with the bulk Weyl nodes, rather than closed Fermi surfaces. This bizarre structure places
Fermi arcs beyond a conventional Hamiltonian description; at the same time, it inspires the fundamental
question, "what is the vortex spectrum of a superconductor that descends from a Fermi arc metal?"
Here, we answer this question using a powerful semiclassical approach substantiated by lattice
numerics. We show that the vortex states form cyclotron-like closed orbits consisting of Fermi
arcs on opposite surfaces connected by one-way bulk conduits. The resulting spectrum is governed
by the total Berry phase acquired by a wavepacket along this orbit and has characteristic dependences
on the Berry phases and penetration depth of the Fermi arcs, bulk Weyl node locations, vortex orientation
and sample thickness. Remarkably, eliminating the zero-point energy by manipulating these parameters
yields a pair of non-local Majorana fermions, while the thickness dependence disappears at a certain
vortex orientation that we dub the "magic angle". Interestingly, under mild conditions pertinent
to many lattice models and materials, non-local Majorana fermions exist precisely at the magic
angle.

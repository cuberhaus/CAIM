The superfluid properties of attractive Hubbard model in dice lattice are investigated. It is found
that three superfluid order parameters increase as the interaction increases. When the filling
factor falls into the flat band, due to the infinite large density of states, the resultant superfluid
order parameters are proportional to interaction strength, which is in striking contrast with
the exponentially small counterparts in usual superfluid (or superconductor). When the interaction
is weak, and the filling factor is near the bottom of the lowest band (or the top of highest band), the
superfluid density is determined by the effective mass of the lowest (or highest) single-particle
band. When the interaction is strong and filling factor is small, the superfluid density is inversely
proportional to interaction strength, which is related to effective mass of tightly bound pairs.
In the strong interaction limit and finite filling, the asymptotic behaviors of superfluid density
can be captured by a parabolic function of filling factor. Furthermore, when the filling is in flat
band, the superfluid density shows a logarithmic singularity as the interaction approaches zero.
In addition, there exist three undamped collective modes for strong interactions. The lowest excitation
is gapless phonon, which is characterized by the total density oscillations. The two others are
gapped Leggett modes, which correspond relative density fluctuations between sublattices. The
collective modes are also reflected in the two-particle spectral functions by sharp peaks. Furthermore,
it is found that the two-particle spectral functions satisfy an exact sum-rule, which is directly
related to the filling factor (or density of particle). The sum-rule of the spectral functions may
be useful to distinguish between the hole-doped and particle-doped superfluid (superconductor)
in experiments.

The quantum Hall effect in three-dimensional Weyl semimetal (WSM) receives significant attention
for the emergence of the Fermi loop where the underlying two-dimensional Hall conductivity, namely,
sheet Hall conductivity, shows quantized plateaus. Considering the tilted lattice models for
multi Weyl semimetals (mWSMs), we systematically study the Landau levels (LLs) and magneto-Hall
conductivity in the presence of parallel and perpendicular (with respect to the Weyl node's separation)
magnetic field, i.e., $\mathbf{ B}\parallel z$ and $\mathbf{B}\parallel x$, to explore the impact
of tilting and non-linearity in the dispersion. We make use of two (single) node low-energy models
to qualitatively explain the emergence of mid-gap chiral (linear crossing of chiral) LLs on the
lattice for $\mathbf{ B}\parallel z$ ($\mathbf{ B}\parallel x$). Remarkably, we find that the
sheet Hall conductivity becomes quantized for $\mathbf{ B}\parallel z$ even when two Weyl nodes
project onto a single Fermi point in two opposite surfaces, forming a Fermi loop with $k_z$ as the
good quantum number. On the other hand, the Fermi loop, connecting two distinct Fermi points in two
opposite surfaces, with $k_x$ being the good quantum number, causes the quantization in sheet Hall
conductivity for $\mathbf{ B}\parallel x$. The quantization is almost lost (perfectly remained)
in the type-II phase for $\mathbf{ B}\parallel x$ ($\mathbf{ B}\parallel z$). Interestingly,
the jump profiles between the adjacent quantized plateaus change with the topological charge for
both of the above cases. The momentum-integrated three-dimensional Hall conductivity is not quantized;
however, it bears the signature of chiral LLs as resulting in the linear dependence on $\mu$ for small
$\mu$. The linear zone (its slope) reduces (increases) as the tilt (topological charge) of the underlying
WSM increases.

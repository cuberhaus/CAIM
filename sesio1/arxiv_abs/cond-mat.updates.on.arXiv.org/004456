In-plane thermal conductivities of small-scale samples are hard to measure, especially for the
lowly conductive ones and those lacking in-plane symmetry (i.e., transversely anisotropic materials).
State-of-the-art pump-probe techniques including both the time-domain and the frequency-domain
thermoreflectance (TDTR and FDTR) are advantageous in measuring the thermal conductivity of small-scale
samples, and various advanced TDTR and FDTR techniques have been developed to measure transversely
anisotropic materials. However, the measurable in-plane thermal conductivity (k_in) is usually
limited to be >10 W/(m K). In this work, a new spatial-scan thermoreflectance (SSTR) method has been
developed to measure a broad range of k_in of millimeter-scale small samples, including those lacking
in-plane symmetry, extending the current limit of the measurable k_in to as low as 1 W/(m K). This
SSTR method establishes a new scheme of measurements using the optimized laser spot size and modulation
frequency and a new scheme of data processing, enabling measurements of in-plane thermal conductivity
tensors of a broad range of k_in values with both high accuracy and ease of operation. Some details
such as the requirement on the sample geometry, the effect of the transducer layer, and the effect
of heat loss are also discussed. As a verification, the k_in of some transversely isotropic reference
samples with a wide range of k_in values including fused silica, sapphire, silicon, and highly ordered
pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) have been measured using this new SSTR method. The measured k_in agree
perfectly well with the literature values with a typical uncertainty of 5%. As a demonstration of
the unique capability of this method, the in-plane thermal conductivity tensor of x-cut quartz,
an in-plane anisotropic material, has also been measured.

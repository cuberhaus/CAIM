The magnetic properties of volborthite, Cu3V2O7(OH)2*2H2O, possessing kagom\'e layers of Cu2+
(d9, S=1/2) ions, were examined by measuring the magnetic susceptibilities and the specific heats
of Cu3V2O7(OH)2*2H2O and Cu3V2O7(OD)2*2D2O under magnetic fields B = 0 to 9 T and also by evaluating
the spin exchanges for the I2/a and P21/a structures of volborthite using DFT calculations. We demonstrate
that the low-temperature magnetic properties of volborthite are very well described by a S=1/2
antiferromagnetic uniform Heisenberg (AUH) chain model in stark contrast to earlier theoretical
reports that suggested a Heisenberg triangular lattice made up of S=1/2 pseudospin units. The spin
exchanges of volborthite determined from our work show that each kagom\'e layer consists of two-leg
spin ladders with rungs of S=1/2 pseudospin units, and these rungs couple to form a S=1/2 AUH chain
responsible for the observed low-temperature magnetic properties. The two specific heat anomalies
of volborthite below 1.5 K, representing the magnetic ordering within and between kagom\'e layers
of volborthite, are suppressed by a magnetic field of $\sim$4.2 T, but a new specific heat anomaly
occurs under magnetic field higher than $\sim$5.5 T. We find that possible spin arrangements of
antiferromagnetically-coupled spin ladders give rise to three sets of entropy spectra identical
in enthalpy due to the topologically-constrained interactions between adjacent two-leg spin
ladders in each kagom\'e layer, and that these three magnetic entropy spectra explain both the suppression
of the specific anomalies by magnetic field of $\sim$4.2 T and the emergence of a new specific anomaly
by magnetic field above $\sim$5.5 T. These observations strongly support that the specific heat
anomalies of volborthite below 1.5 K and their dependence on applied magnetic field are driven by
magnetic entropy.

Members of the CaK(Fe$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$)$_{4}$As$_{4}$ series have been synthesized in single
crystalline form and characterized by elemental analysis, thermodynamic and transport measurements.
These measurements show that the superconducting transition temperature decreases monotonically
and is finally suppressed below 1.8 K. For $x$-values greater than 0.016, signatures of a magnetic
transition can be detected in both thermodynamic and transport measurements in which kink-like
features allow for the determination of the transition temperature, $T^*$, that increases as Mn
substitution increases. A temperature-composition ($T$-$x$) phase diagram is constructed,
revealing a half-dome of superconductivity with the magnetic transition temperature, $T^*$,
appearing near 26 K for $x$ $\sim$ 0.017 and rising slowly up to 33 K for $x$ $\sim$ 0.036. Specific
heat data are used to track the jump in specific heat at $T_c$; The CaK(Fe$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$)$_4$As$_4$
data does not follow the scaling of $\Delta$$C_{p}$ with $T_{c}^3$ as many of the other Fe-based
superconducting systems do. Elastoresistivity coefficients, $2m_{66}$ and $m_{11}-m_{12}$,
as a function of temperature are also measured. $2m_{66}$ and $m_{11}-m_{12}$ are qualitatively
similar to CaK(Fe$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$)$_4$As$_4$. This may indicate that the magnetic order in Mn substituted
system may be still the same as CaK(Fe$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$)$_4$As$_4$. A clear change in $H^\prime_{c2}$($T$)/$T_c$,
where $H^\prime_{c2}$($T$) is d$H_{c2}$($T$)/d$T$, at $x$ $\sim$ 0.015 is observed and probably
is related to change of the Fermi surface due to magnetic order. Coherence lengths and the London
penetration depths are also calculated based on $H_{c1}$ and $H_{c2}$ data. Coherence lengths
as the function of $x$ also shows the changes near $x$ = 0.015.

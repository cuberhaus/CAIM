The incommensurate 30$^{\circ}$ twisted bilayer graphene (BG) possesses both relativistic Dirac
fermions and quasiperiodicity with 12-fold rotational symmetry arising from the interlayer interaction

Sci. \textbf{115}, 6928 (2018)}]. Understanding how the interlayer states interact with each
other is of vital importance for identifying and subsequently engineering the quasicrystalline
order in the layered structures. Herein, via symmetry and group representation theory we unravel
the interlayer hybridization selection rules governing the interlayer coupling in both untwisted
and twisted BG systems. Compared with the only allowed equivalent hybridization in $D_{6h}$ untwisted
BG, $D_6$ twisted BG permits equivalent and mixed hybridizations, and $D_{6d}$ graphene quasicrystal
allows both equivalent and non-equivalent hybridizations. The energy-dependent hybridization
strengths in graphene quasicrystal and $D_6$ twisted BG show two remarkable characteristics:
(i) near the Fermi level the weak hybridization owing to the relatively large energy difference
between Dirac bands from top and bottom layers, and (ii) in high-energy regions the electron-hole
asymmetry of hybridization strength with stronger interlayer coupling for holes, which arises
from the non-nearest-neighbor interlayer hoppings and the wave-function phase difference between
paring states. These hybridization-generated band structures and their hybridization strength
characteristics are verified by the calculated optical conductivity spectra. Our theoretical
study paves a way for revealing the interlayer hybridization in van der Waals layered systems.

Concepts from quantum topological states of matter have been extensively utilized in the past decade
in creating mechanical metamaterials with topologically protected features, such as one-way
edge states and topologically polarized elasticity. Maxwell lattices represent a class of topological
mechanical metamaterials that exhibit distinct robust mechanical properties at edges/interfaces
when they are topologically polarized. Realizing topological phase transitions in these materials
would enable on-and-off switching of these edge states, opening unprecedented opportunities
to program mechanical response and wave propagation. However, such transitions are extremely
challenging to experimentally control in Maxwell topological metamaterials due to mechanical
and geometric constraints. Here we create a Maxwell lattice with bistable units to implement synchronized
transitions between topological states and demonstrate dramatically different stiffnesses
as the lattice transforms between topological phases both theoretically and experimentally.
By combining multistability with topological phase transitions, for the first time, this metamaterial
not only exhibits topologically protected mechanical properties that swiftly and reversibly
change, but also offers a rich design space for innovating mechanical computing architectures
and reprogrammable neuromorphic metamaterials. Moreover, we design and fabricate a topological
Maxwell lattice using multi-material 3D printing and demonstrate the potential for miniaturization
via additive manufacturing. These design principles are applicable to transformable topological
metamaterials for a variety of tasks such as switchable energy absorption, impact mitigation,
wave tailoring, neuromorphic metamaterials, and controlled morphing systems.

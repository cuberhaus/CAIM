After a sudden quench from the disordered high-temperature $T_0\to\infty$ phase to a final temperature
below the critical point $T_F < T_c$, the non-conserved kinetics of the two-dimensional ferromagnetic
Ising model (2dIM) initially approaches the critical percolation state before entering the coarsening
regime. This approach involves two timescales associated with the first appearance (at time $t_{{\rm
p}_1}$) and stabilization (at time $t_{\rm p}$) of a giant percolation cluster, as previously reported,
but nonetheless, the microscopic mechanisms that control such timescales are not yet fully understood.
In this paper we study the role of the different microscopic mechanisms on each time regime after
the quench ($T_F=0$) by distinguishing between spin updates that decrease the total energy of the
system from those that keep it constant, the latter being parametrized by the probability $p$. We
show that the cluster size heterogeneity $H(t,p)$ and the typical domain size $\ell (t,p)$ have
no dependence on $p$ in the first regime up to $t_{{\rm p}_1}$, thus indicating that the emergence
of the first percolating cluster is completely driven by energy decreasing updates. On the other
hand, the time for stabilizing a percolating cluster is controlled by the acceptance rate of constant-energy
updates: $t_{\rm p}(p)\sim p^{-1}$ for $p\ll 1$ (at $p=0$, the dynamics gets stuck in a metastable
state). These updates are also the relevant ones in the later coarsening regime where dynamical
scaling takes place. Because the phenomenology on the approach to percolation point is universally
shared by 2d systems with a non-conserved kinetics and certain cases of conserved kinetics as well,
our results may suggest a simple and effective way to set, through the dynamics itself, $t_{\scriptstyle{\rm
p}_1}$ and $t_{\scriptstyle \rm p}$ in such classes of systems.

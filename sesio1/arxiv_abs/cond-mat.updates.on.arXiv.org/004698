Two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials offer unprecedented opportunities both in terms of fundamental
concepts and applied devices with special relevance in the fields of spintronics and magnonics.
Beyond the pioneering studies on CrI3 and Cr2Ge2Te6, the family of 2D magnets has expanded to layered
antiferromagnets with different spin anisotropies and spin textures. However, all these compounds
are highly insulating, thus limiting their possibilities for being integrated into devices. Of
particular interest is the case of the layered metamagnet CrSBr, a 2D semiconductor formed by ferromagnetic
layers (Tc ~ 150 K) coupled antiferromagnetically between them. This material exhibits a rich physical
scenario, including thermal spin dimensionality crossovers and low-temperature hidden order
(T* ~ 40 K). Here, we inspect the magneto-transport properties of monolayer, bilayer and trilayer
CrSBr integrated into vertical van der Waals heterostructures. Our results in the monolayer limit
demonstrate (1) the marked low dimensional character of the ferromagnetic layer, with short-range
correlations extending at temperatures well above Tc, (2) a spin anisotropy, with the spins spontaneously
aligned along the easy axis (b) of the plane, (3) a reorientation of these spins along a and c upon applying
a moderate magnetic field in these directions, and (4) the appearance of field-induced phases in
these two directions below ca. 30-40 K due to a cooperative freezing of the spins. In the multilayer
case, a spin valve-like behavior is also observed characterized by a negative MR strongly enhanced
below T*. Overall, the present results, supported by first-principles calculations, show that
the monolayer and bilayer of CrSBr capture most of the physics present in the bulk, offering new insights
into the physics of 2D magnets and the integration of these layers into vertical spintronic devices.

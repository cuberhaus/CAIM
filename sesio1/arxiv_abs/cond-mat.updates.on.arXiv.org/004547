Describing the (a) electronic and magnetic properties (EMP) of antiferromagnetic or paramagnetic
phases of compounds generally requires the knowledge of (b) the spin configurations and lattice
structure (SCLS) of such phases at a given temperature. Indeed, studying the coupling between (a)
and (b) has been an outstanding challenge in the theory of magnetism. The traditional approach to
electronic phases of matter has generally focused on solving the problem of EMP regarding the SCLS
as a spectator degree of freedom (DOF). Yet, it has been recognized that EMP of a compound generally
respond self-consistently to changes in SCLS and vice versa. We construct here a practical, density
functional theory (DFT)-based approach that provides the SCLS as a function of temperature, involving
the description of spin, lattice, and spin-lattice dynamics of different magnetic phases. We distinguish
three Levels of dynamics: (I) dynamics of the spin DOF treated via noncollinear Heisenberg Monte-Carlo
with exchange energies from DFT, (II) dynamics of the lattice DOF treated by ab initio molecular
dynamics (AIMD) employing a fixed spin configuration from Level I at the simulated temperature,
and (III) coupling of spin and lattice dynamics via Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert spin dynamics combined
with AIMD. Such SCLS at each of the three levels are used as inputs to DFT supercell calculations,
providing the EMP at each temperature. The results of this sequence include electronic band structures,
band gaps, density of states, as well as the statistical distribution of local moments and the short-range
order parameters, each as a function of temperature. Using NiO as a test case, we address the separability
of the DOF in magnetic insulators for a minimal description of electronic and magnetic properties,
demonstrating that inclusion of spin dynamics and, to some level, lattice dynamics is enough to
explain the EMP.

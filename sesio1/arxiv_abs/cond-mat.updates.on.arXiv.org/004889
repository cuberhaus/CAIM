Mn enrichment at dislocations in Fe-Mn alloys due to segregation and spinodal decomposition along
the dislocation line is studied via modeling and experimental characterization. To model these
phenomena, both finite-deformation microscopic phase-field chemomechanics (MPFCM) and Monte
Carlo molecular dynamics (MCMD) are employed. MPFCM calibration is carried out with the same Fe-Mn
MEAM-based potential used in MCMD, as well as CALPHAD data. Simulation results for Mn segregation
to, and spinodal decomposition along, straight screw and edge dislocations as well as dislocation
loops, are compared with characterization results from atom probe tomography (APT) for two Fe-Mn
alloy compositions. In contrast to classical Volterra dislocation theory, both MPFCM and MCMD
predict a non-zero hydrostatic stress field in screw cores. Being of much smaller magnitude than
the hydrostatic stress in straight edge cores, much less solute segregates to screw than to edge
cores. In addition, the segregated amount in screw cores is below the critical concentration of
0.157 for the onset of spinodal decomposition along the line. Results from MPFCM-based modeling
imply that the concentration dependence of the solute misfit distortion and resulting dependence
of the elastic energy density on concentration have the strongest effect. The maximum amount of
Mn segregating to straight edge dislocations predicted by MPFCM agrees well with APT results. The
MPFCM model for Fe-Mn predicts little or no variation in Mn concentration along a straight dislocation
line, in contrast to the APT results. As shown by the example of a dislocation loop in the current work,
a change in the hydrostatic stress along the line due to changing character of dislocation does lead
to a corresponding variation in Mn concentration. Such a variation in Mn concentration can also
then be expected along a dislocation line with kinks or jogs.

Nonlinear spectroscopy is widely used for studying physical systems. Conventional nonlinear
optical spectroscopy and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, which use classical probes such as
electromagnetic waves, can only access certain types of correlations in a quantum system. The idea
of quantum nonlinear spectroscopy was recently proposed to use quantum probes such as entangled
photons to achieve sensitivities and resolutions beyond the classical limits. It is shown that
quantum sensing can extract arbitrary types and orders of correlations in a quantum system by first
quantum-entangling a sensor and the object and then measuring the sensor. Quantum sensing has been
applied to achieve nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of single atoms and the second-order correlation
spectroscopy has been adopted to enhance the spectral resolution. However, quantum nonlinear
spectroscopy (i.e., the measurement of higher-order correlations) of single nuclear spins is
still elusive. Here we demonstrate the extraction of fourth-order correlations of single nuclear
spins that cannot be measured in conventional nonlinear spectroscopy, using sequential weak measurement
via an atomic quantum sensor, namely, a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. We show that the quantum
nonlinear spectroscopy provides fingerprint features to identify different types of objects,
such as Gaussian noises, random-phased AC fields, and quantum spins, which would be indistinguishable
in second-order correlations. The measured fourth-order correlation unambiguously differentiates
a single nuclear spin and a random-phased AC field. This work constitutes an initial step toward
the application of higher-order correlations to quantum sensing, to examining the quantum foundation
(by, e.g., higher-order Leggett-Garg inequality), and to studying quantum many-body physics.

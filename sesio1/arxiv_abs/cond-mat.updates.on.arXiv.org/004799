NaTiSi2O6 is an exemplary compound, showing an orbital assisted spin-Peierls phase transition
at Tc = 210 K. We present the results of 29Si and 23Na NMR measurements of NaTiSi2O6. The use of magic
angle spinning techniques unambiguously shows that only one dynamically averaged silicon site
can be seen at T > Tc. At cooling, the 29Si MAS NMR spectrum shows interesting changes. Immediately
below Tc the spectrum gets very broad. Cooling further, it shows two broad lines of unequal intensities
which become narrower as the temperature decreases. Below 70 K two narrow lines have chemical shifts
that are typical for diamagnetic silicates. The hyperfine field values for the two sites are 7.4
kOe/kB and 4.9 kOe/kB. In the paramagnetic state at high temperature, the spin-lattice relaxation
of 29Si was found to be weakly temperature dependent. Below Tc the Arrhenius type temperature dependence
of the relaxation rate indicates an energy gap D/kB = 1000(50) K. In the temperature region from 120
to 300 K the relaxation rate was strongly frequency dependent. At room temperature we found a power
law dependence on Larmor frequency of -0.65(5). For 70 < T < 120 K the relaxation appeared to be non-exponential
which we assigned to a relaxation due to fixed paramagnetic centers. Simulation of the magnetization
recovery curve showed a temperature dependence of the concentration of these centers proportional
to the magnetic susceptibility. The NMR spectrum of 23Na shows the line with typical shape for the
central transition of a quadrupolar nucleus. A small frequency shift of 23Na resonance corresponds
to a very small hyperfine field of 0.32 kOe/kB . In addition, at T > Tc the 23Na spectrum shows another
Lorentzian shaped resonance which we attribute to the Na sites where the quadrupolar coupling is
partly averaged out by ionic motion.

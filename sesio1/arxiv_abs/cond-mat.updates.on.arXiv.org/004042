Semi-local DFT methods exhibit significant errors for the phase diagrams of transition-metal
oxides that are caused by an incorrect description of molecular oxygen and the large self-interaction
error in materials with strongly localized electronic orbitals. Empirical and semiempirical
corrections based on the DFT+U method can reduce these errors, but the parameterization and validation
of the correction terms remains an on-going challenge. We develop a systematic methodology to determine
the parameters and to statistically assess the results by considering thermochemical data across
a set of transition metal compounds. We consider three interconnected levels of correction terms:
(1) a constant oxygen binding correction, (2) Hubbard-U correction, and (3) DFT/DFT+U compatibility
correction. The parameterization is expressed as a unified optimization problem. We demonstrate
this approach for 3d transition metal oxides, considering a target set of binary and ternary oxides.
With a total of 37 measured formation enthalpies taken from the literature, the dataset is augmented
by the reaction energies of 1,710 unique reactions that were derived from the formation energies
by systematic enumeration. To ensure a balanced dataset across the available data, the reactions
were grouped by their similarity using clustering and suitably weighted. The parameterization
is validated using leave-one-out cross-validation (CV), a standard technique for the validation
of statistical models. We apply the methodology to the SCAN density functional. Based on the CV score,
the error of binary (ternary) oxide formation energies is reduced by 40% (75%) to 0.10 (0.03) eV/atom.
The method and tools demonstrated here can be applied to other classes of materials or to parameterize
the corrections to optimize DFT+U performance for other target physical properties.

We examine models for the magneto-conductivity correction in 2DEGs with both Rashba and Dresselhaus
spin-orbit coupling (SOC) for their applicability to experimental data fitting. In particular,
we compare the Landau-quantized Cooperon approach, which is mostly only numerically treatable,
and the quasi-classical approximation that was recently employed to obtain an explicit solution
for arbitrary Rashba and Dresselhaus SOC [PRL 112, 156601 (2019)]. It is found that the quasi-classical
approximation yields significantly different results even to lowest order in the magnetic field
and appears unsuitable for reliable parameter fitting. The discrepancy emerges when a sum over
Landau levels is replaced by an integral over wave vectors. Substantial improvement is achieved
by supplementing the quasi-classical model with the first two corrections given by the Euler-MacLaurin
formula. Corresponding modifications are, however, only feasible in special SOC parameter configurations
where the mixing of Landau bands is negligible and a closed-form solution that accounts for Landau
quantization is also available. Such a scenario appears in a parameter regime where a persistent
spin helix emerges and a transition between weak anti- and weak localization takes place. Combining
recent findings, we derive a generalized closed-form expression for the magneto-conductivity
correction applicable to generic 2DEGs that are grown along a crystal direction with at least two
growth-direction Miller indices equal in modulus. The result is a function of spin lifetimes of
the long-lived spin textures and is valid close to the persistent-spin-helix regime. The accuracy
of the derived formula is validated by comparing with results from numerical diagonalization of
the multiband Cooperon as well as a recently established Monte-Carlo-based real-space simulation
in exemplary (001)-, (113)-, and (110)-2DEGs.

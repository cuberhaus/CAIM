In the context of Evolutionary Game Theory, one of the most noteworthy mechanisms to support cooperation
is spatial reciprocity, usually accomplished by distributing players in a spatial structure allowing
cooperators to cluster together and avoid exploitation. This raises an important question: how
is the survival of cooperation affected by different topologies? Here, to address this question,
we explore the Focal Public Goods (FPGG) and classic Public Goods Games (PGG), and the Prisoner's
Dilemma (PD) on several regular lattices: honeycomb, square (with von Neumann and Moore neighborhoods),
kagome, triangular, cubic, and 4D hypercubic lattices using both analytical methods and agent-based
Monte Carlo simulations. We found that for both Public Goods Games, a consistent trend appears on
all two-dimensional lattices: as the number of first neighbors increases, cooperation is enhanced.
However, this is only visible by analysing the results in terms of the payoff's synergistic factor
normalized by the number of connections. Besides this, clustered topologies, i.e., those that
allow two connected players to share neighbors, are the most beneficial to cooperation for the FPGG.
The same is not always true for the classic PGG, where having shared neighbors between connected
players may or may not benefit cooperation. We also provide a reinterpretation of the classic PGG
as a focal game by representing the lattice structure of this category of games as a single interaction
game with longer-ranged, weighted neighborhoods, an approach valid for any regular lattice topology.
Finally, we show that depending on the payoff parametrization of the PD, there can be an equivalency
between the PD and the FPGG; when the mapping between the two games is imperfect, the definition of
an effective synergy parameter can still be useful to show their similarities.

The neural dynamics generating sensory, motor, and cognitive functions are commonly understood
through field theories for neural population activity. Classic neural field theories are derived
from highly simplified, discrete state models of individual neurons. This calls into question
their ability to describe the population dynamics of biophysical neural models. Here, we develop
a general framework for studying mean field dynamics and fluctuation effects in integrate-and-fire
networks. We construct the joint density functional for membrane potentials and spike trains in
networks of integrate-and-fire neurons with stochastic spike emission. This reveals exact and
approximate mean field theories for the activity in these networks. These mean field theories are
simple neural activity equations with a new nonlinearity: a rate-dependent leak, which approximates
the spike-driven resets of neurons' membrane potentials. We study the impact of spike resets on
population dynamics, finding bistability between quiescent and active states in homogenous and
excitatory-inhibitory pulse-coupled networks. In both cases, we compute the phase diagram for
quiescent, active and bistable regimes in the coupling strengths and external input strength.
We also find that fluctuations suppress activity in the active states. We then examine the relative
roles of spike resets and recurrent inhibition in stabilizing network activity. A paradoxical
reduction of inhibitory firing rates after stimulation is commonly understood to be a signature
of an inhibitory-stabilized regime. Such paradoxical responses occur in wide regions of parameter
space. Spike resets dynamically stabilize even excitatory-only networks, however, so that recurrent
inhibition is not necessary to stabilize activity. Finally, we discuss perturbative and exact
methods for examining fluctuations in these networks.

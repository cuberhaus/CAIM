Ternary alloys of Ge-Sb-Te (GST) have been extensively studied due to their unique ability display
a reversible change in their phase upon stimulation by optical pulses i.e., amorphous (a-GST) to
crystalline (c-GST) and vice-versa. The two phases exhibit remarkably different electrical and
optical properties like conductivity, reflectivity, refractive index and optical loss, this
coupled with their high phase switching speeds, low power phase switching, large measurable optical
and electrical contrast, and phase stability makes GST alloys stand out from other phase change
materials (PCM). GST alloys have already found extensive use in optical disks and electronic memories
due to their non-volatility and zero static power consumption, but the precise mechanism of the
phase change is not clearly understood. The phase change mechanism has usually been attributed
to the optical pulse, usually a high power short pulse laser, heating up the c-GST alloy to above its
melting temperature (Tm) after which, if it is cooled rapidly enough to below the glass transition
temperature (Tg), the atoms are fixed in place due to the drastic reduction in their mobility, resulting
in a phase which exhibits structure similar to a frozen liquid and lacks long range order i.e. amorphous.
When heated above Tg with an intermediate power laser pulse for a significant amount of time, then
this favors the shift back to the energetically favorable crystalline phase. With the growing interest
in next generation data storage technology for photonic and neuromorphic computing, the research
into understanding and improving the properties of GST alloys has also been rekindled. In this term
paper we hope to investigate and gain a deeper understanding and appreciation of the kinetics and
underlying atomistic mechanism of this phase transition from c-GST to a-GST and vice-versa which
is only now becoming clearer.

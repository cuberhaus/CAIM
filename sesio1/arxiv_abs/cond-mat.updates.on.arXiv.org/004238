We study the surface behavior of the two-dimensional columnar dimerized quantum antiferromagnetic
XXZ model with easy-plane anisotropy, putting special attention on the surface critical behaviors
of the (2+1)-dimensional quantum critical points of the model, belonging to the classical three-dimensional
O(2) universality class, for both $S=1/2$ and $S=1$ spins using quantum Monte Carlo simulations.
We found utterly different surface behaviors at two different surfaces of geometrical settings:
one surface is the dangling-ladder surface, which is exposed by cutting a row of weak bonds, and the
other is the dangling-chain surface, which is formed by cutting a row of strong bonds along the direction
perpendicular to the strong bonds of a periodic system. We find an ordinary transition on the dangling-ladder
surface for both $S=1$ and $S=1/2$ spin systems, similar to what found in the Heisenberg limit. However,
the dangling-chain surface shows much richer surface behaviors than in the Heisenberg limit. For
the $S=1/2$ easy-plane model, we find the surface undergoes an unexpected phase transition from
a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid to an unknown critical state in the gapped bulk state as the dimerization
strength is weaken. We denote this state as a bulk induced surface critical state (BISC). At the bulk
critical point, we show evidences supporting an extraordinary surface transition with a long-range
order established by effective long-range interactions due to bulk critical fluctuations. The
possibility that the state is an extra-ordinary-log state seems unlikely. For the $S=1$ system,
we find surface behaviors similar to that of the three-dimensional classical XY model with surface
coupling enhanced strong enough, suggesting an extra-ordinary-log state at the bulk critical
point.

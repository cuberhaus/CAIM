It is often taken for granted that in pump-probe experiments on the topological insulator (TI) Bi2Se3
using IR pumping with a commercial Ti:Sapphire laser [~800 nm (1.55 eV photon energy)], carriers
are excited in the one-photon absorption regime, even when pumped with absorbed fluences in the
miliJ cm-2 range. Here, using UV-Vis transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy, we show that even
at low-power IR pumping with absorbed fluences in the microJ cm-2 range, TA spectra of the 2D and 3D
TI Bi2Se3 extend across a part of the UV the entire visible region. This observation unambiguously
indicates that the two-photon pumping regime accompanies the common one-photon pumping regime
even at low laser powers applied. We attribute the high efficiency of two-photon pumping to the giant
nonlinearity of Dirac fermions in Dirac surface states (SS). On the contrary, one-photon pumping
is associated with the excitation of bound valence electrons in the bulk into the conduction band.
We also identified two mechanisms of absorption bleaching, which manifest themselves in different
spectral regions of probing and are associated with direct Pauli blocking in the Dirac SS and an integrated
filling of the phase-space in bulk states. The effect of the film thickness and pumping power on the
mass gain/loss dynamics of Dirac fermions upon relaxation and their vertical transport, as well
as on the launching of coherent longitudinal optical (LO) phonon oscillations in the bulk states
and Dirac SS is demonstrated. We have shown that the launching of coherent LO-phonon oscillations
in the bulk is governed by the vertical electron transport, while the coherence of LO-phonon oscillations
in Dirac SS is provided by an in-phase sequential scattering of Dirac fermions from the uppermost
atomic layer of the surface.

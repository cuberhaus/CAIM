The atomization energies of molecules from first-principles density functional approximations
improve from the local spin-density approximation (LSDA) to the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE)
generalized gradient approximation (GGA) to the strongly constrained and appropriately normed
(SCAN) meta-GGA, and their sensitivities to non-spherical components of the density increase
in the same order. Thus, these functional advances increase density sensitivity and imitate the
exact constrained search over correlated wavefunctions better than that over ensembles. The diatomic
molecules studied here, singlet C2 and F2 plus triplet B2 and O2, have cylindrically symmetric densities.
Because the densities of the corresponding atoms are non-spherical, the approximate Kohn-Sham
potentials for the atoms have a lower symmetry than that of the external (nuclear) potential, so
that the non-interacting wavefunctions are not eigenstates of the square of total orbital angular
momentum, breaking a symmetry needed to yield the exact ground-state density. That spatial symmetry
can be preserved by a non-self-consistent approach in which a self-consistent equi-ensemble calculation
is followed by integer re-occupation of the Kohn-Sham orbitals. Spatial symmetry breaking in atoms
is shown to have a small effect on the atomization energies of molecules, quantifying earlier observations
by Fertig and Kohn. Spin symmetry breaking is also found to be energetically small. Thus, the standard
Kohn-Sham way of calculating atomization energies, with self-consistent symmetry breaking to
minimize the energy, is justified, at least for the common cases where the molecules cannot break
symmetry. The symmetry-preserving approach is different from standard symmetry restoration
based upon projection. SCAN, usually accurate for atomization energies, is found here to underestimate
that of strongly-correlated singlet C2 by about 1 eV.

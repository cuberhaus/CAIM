Dibismuth dioxychalcogenides, Bi$_2$O$_2$Ch (Ch = S,Se,Te) are emerging class of materials for
the next generation electronics and thermoelectrics with an ultrahigh carrier mobility and excellent
air stability. These are layered materials with weak electrostatic interlayer interactions which
makes them unique compared to layered materials with weak interlayer van der Waals bonding. In particular,
Bi$_2$O$_2$S is fascinating because of stereo-chemically active 6$s^2$ lone-pair of Bi$^{3+}$
cation, heterogeneous bonding and high mass contrast.Understanding the effect of hydrostatic
pressure on lone-pair and its implications on phonon transport have attracted enormous research
interest recently. In the present work, we systematically investigated the high pressure behavior
of Bi$_2$O$_2$S, it undergoes a structural phase transition from low symmetry ($Pnmn$) to a high
symmetry($I4/mmm$)structure around 4 GPa. Pressure dependent static enthalpy, lattice, bond
parameters and elastic constants strongly suggest that the phase transition is continuous.Enhanced
Born effective charges (BECs) are predicted for both the phases due to significant cross-band-gap
hybridization from their electronic structure. This brings the lattice in the vicinity of ferroelectric
instability, which is favorable to achieve low $\kappa_l$ in Bi$_2$O$_2$S.The obtained low $\kappa_l$
value 1.47 W-m/K for $Pnmn$ phase is more than double 3.63 W-m/K for $I4/mmm$ phase,which is due to
suppression of lone-pair at Bi$^{3+}$ cation, consequently, anharmonicity diminishes with pressure
as shown from electron localization function, potential energy surfaces and mean square atomic
displacements. Overall, the current study provides an in depth understanding on how hydrostatic
pressure effects the phonon transport in stereo-chemically active 6$s^2$ lone-pair containing
Bi$_2$O$_2$S through a continuous structural phase transition.

In this work, a temperature-induced valence-state transition is studied in a narrow composition
range of Ba$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$TbIrO$_6$. The valence-state transition involves an electron transfer
between Tb and Ir leading to the valence-state change between Tb$^{3+}$/Ir$^{5+}$ and Tb$^{4+}$/Ir$^{4+}$
phases. This first-order transition has a dramatic effect on the lattice, transport properties,
and the long-range magnetic order at low temperatures for both Tb and Ir ions. Ir$^{5+}$ ion has an
electronic configuration of 5$d^4$ ($J\rm_{eff}$ = 0) which is expected to be nonmagnetic. In contrast,
Ir$^{4+}$ ion with a configuration of 5$d^5$($J\rm_{eff}$ = 1/2) favors a long-range magnetic
order. For $x$ = 0.1 with Tb$^{3+}$/Ir$^{5+}$ configuration to the lowest temperature (2 K) investigated
in this work, a spin-glass behavior is observed around 5 K indicating Ir$^{5+}$ ($J\rm_{eff}$ =
0) ions act as a spacer reducing the magnetic interactions between Tb$^{3+}$ ions. For $x$ = 0.5 with
Tb$^{4+}$/Ir$^{4+}$ configuration below the highest temperature 400 K of this work, a long-range
antiferromagnetic order at $T\rm_N$ = 40 K is observed highlighting the importance of Ir$^{4+}$
($J\rm_{eff}$ = 1/2) ions in promoting the long-range magnetic order of both Tb and Ir ions. For 0.2
$\leqslant x \leqslant$ 0.375, a temperature-induced valence-state transition from high-temperature
Tb$^{3+}$/Ir$^{5+}$ phase to low-temperature Tb$^{4+}$/Ir$^{4+}$ phase occurs in the temperature
range 180 K $\leqslant T \leqslant$ 325 K and the transition temperature increases with $x$. The
compositional dependence demonstrates the ability to tune the the valence state for a critical
region of $x$ that leads to a concurrent change in magnetism and structure. This tuning ability could
be employed with suitable strain in thin films to act as a switch as the magnetism is manipulated.

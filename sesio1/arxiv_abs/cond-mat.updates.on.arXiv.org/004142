Neuromorphic computing mimics the organizational principles of the brain in its quest to replicate
the brain's intellectual abilities. An impressive ability of the brain is its adaptive intelligence,
which allows the brain to regulate its functions "on the fly" to cope with myriad and ever-changing
situations. In particular, the brain displays three adaptive and advanced intelligence abilities
of context-awareness, cross frequency coupling and feature binding. To mimic these adaptive cognitive
abilities, we design and simulate a novel, hardware-based adaptive oscillatory neuron using a
lattice of magnetic skyrmions. Charge current fed to the neuron reconfigures the skyrmion lattice,
thereby modulating the neuron's state, its dynamics and its transfer function "on the fly". This
adaptive neuron is used to demonstrate the three cognitive abilities, of which context-awareness
and cross-frequency coupling have not been previously realized in hardware neurons. Additionally,
the neuron is used to construct an adaptive artificial neural network (ANN) and perform context-aware
diagnosis of breast cancer. Simulations show that the adaptive ANN diagnoses cancer with higher
accuracy while learning faster from smaller amounts of data and using a more compact and energy-efficient
network than the state-of-the-art non-adaptive ANNs used for cancer diagnosis. The work further
describes how hardware-based adaptive neurons can mitigate several critical challenges facing
contemporary ANNs. Modern ANNs require large amounts of training data, energy and chip area and
are highly task-specific; conversely, hardware-based ANNs built with adaptive neurons show faster
learning from smaller datasets, compact architectures, energy-efficiency, fault-tolerance
and can lead to the realization of general artificial intelligence.

Metallic hydrogen is capable of room temperature superconductivity, but its experimental synthesis
conditions are extremely hard. Therefore, it is a good choice to reduce the synthesis pressure of
metallic hydrogen by adding other chemical elements. However, for most hydrides, the metallization
of hydrogen by "chemical precompression" to achieve high-temperature superconductivity still
requires relative high pressure, which makes experimental synthesis difficult. How to achieve
high-temperature superconductivity in the low-pressure range (0-50 GPa) is a key issue for realizing
practical applications of superconducting materials. Toward this end, this work proposes a strategy
for the insertion of ammonium ions in the fcc crystal. High-throughput calculations of the periodic
table reveal 12 elements that are kinetically stable and superconducting at low pressures, where
the highest superconducting transition temperatures of AlN2H8, MgN2H8 and GaN2H8 can reach up
to 118.40, 105.09 and 104.39 K. Pressure-induced bond length changes and charge transfer reveal
the physical mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity, where the H atom continuously
gains electrons leading to the transition of H+ ions to atomic H, which achieves metallic hydrogen
under mild pressure. Our results also reveal two strong linear scalar relationships, one is the
H-atom charge versus superconducting transition temperature and the other is the first ionization
energy versus the highest superconducting transition temperature. Besides, ZnN2H8, CdN2H8 and
HgN2H8 were found to be superconductors at ambient pressure and the presence of interstitial electrons
suggests that they are also electrides, relative low work functions (3.03, 2.78 and 3.05 eV) implying
that they can be used as catalysts for nitrogen reduction reactions as well.

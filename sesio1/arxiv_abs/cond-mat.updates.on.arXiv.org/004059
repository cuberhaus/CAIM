In recent years, dynamical phase transitions and out-of-equilibrium criticality have been at
the forefront of ultracold gases and condensed matter research. Whereas universality and scaling
are established topics in equilibrium quantum many-body physics, out-of-equilibrium extensions
of such concepts still leave much to be desired. Using exact diagonalization and the time-dependent
variational principle in uniform martrix product states, we calculate the time evolution of the
local order parameter and Loschmidt return rate in transverse-field Ising chains with antiferromagnetic
power law-decaying interactions, and map out the corresponding rich dynamical phase diagram.
\textit{Anomalous} cusps in the return rate, which are ubiquitous at small quenches within the
ordered phase in the case of ferromagnetic long-range interactions, are absent within the accessible
timescales of our simulations in the antiferromagnetic case, showing that long-range interactions
are not a sufficient condition for their appearance. We attribute this to much weaker domain-wall
binding in the antiferromagnetic case. For quenches across the quantum critical point, \textit{regular}
cusps appear in the return rate and connect to the local order parameter changing sign, indicating
the concurrence of two major concepts of dynamical phase transitions. Our results consolidate
conclusions of previous works that a necessary condition for the appearance of anomalous cusps
in the return rate after quenches within the ordered phase is for topologically trivial local spin
flips to be the energetically dominant excitations in the spectrum of the quench Hamiltonian. Our
findings are readily accessible in modern trapped-ion setups, and we outline the associated experimental
considerations.

Magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene (MATTG) has emerged as a novel moir\'e material that exhibits
both strong electronic correlations and unconventional superconductivity. However, spectroscopic
studies of its electronic properties are lacking, and the nature of superconductivity and the corresponding
order parameter in this system remain elusive. Here we perform high-resolution scanning tunneling
microscopy and spectroscopy of MATTG and reveal extensive regions of atomic reconstruction that
favor mirror-symmetric stacking. In these regions, we observe a cascade of symmetry-breaking
electronic transitions and doping-dependent band structure deformations similar to those realized
in magic-angle bilayers, as expected theoretically given the commonality of flat bands. More strikingly,
in a density window spanning two to three holes per moire unit cell, spectroscopic signatures of
superconductivity are manifest as pronounced dips in the tunneling conductance at the Fermi level
accompanied by coherence peaks that become gradually suppressed at elevated temperatures and
magnetic fields. The observed evolution of the conductance with doping is consistent with a gate-tunable
transition from a gapped to a nodal superconductor, which we show theoretically is compatible with
a sharp transition from a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) to a Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC)
superconductor with a nodal order parameter. Within this doping window, we also detect peak-dip-hump
structures suggesting that superconductivity is driven by strong coupling to bosonic modes of
MATTG. Our results pave the way for further understanding of superconductivity and correlated
states in graphene-based moir\'e structures beyond twisted bilayers, where unconventional superconductivity
and nodal pairing were reported.

Ge$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$ alloys are a promising candidate material to realise direct-gap group-IV
semiconductors for applications in Si-compatible electronic and photonic devices. Here, we present
a combined theoretical and experimental analysis of Raman spectroscopy in Ge$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$
alloys. We describe liquid-vapour-solid growth and structural characterisation of Ge$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$
($x \leq 8$%) nanowires displaying high crystalline quality, and investigate the structural and
vibrational properties of the nanowires using Raman spectroscopy. Our theoretical analysis is
based on a fully analytic anharmonic valence force field (VFF) potential, which describes exactly
- i.e. without recourse to numerical fitting - the second-order elastic constants, third-order
bulk modulus, selected second- and third-order inner elastic constants and, as a consequence,
the zone-centre transverse optical phonon mode frequency and its hydrostatic and axial strain
dependence. We compute bulk elastic properties via density functional theory to parametrise the
VFF potential for Ge$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$ alloys, and apply the VFF potential to explicitly compute
the Raman spectra of realistic, disordered Ge$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$ alloy supercells. Our atomistic
theoretical calculations quantitatively capture: (i) the evolution of the measured Raman spectra
with Sn composition $x$, (ii) demonstrate explicitly that the presence of short-range alloy disorder
can significantly impact the shift coefficients $a$ and $b$ that respectively describe the dependence
of the Raman shift on Sn composition and pseudomorphic strain, (iii) elucidate the origin of the
so-called "disorder activated" mode identified in previous experimental investigations, and
(iv) allow for detailed atomic-scale interpretation of measured Raman spectra. Overall, our analysis
provides insight relevant to the characterisation of this emerging material system.

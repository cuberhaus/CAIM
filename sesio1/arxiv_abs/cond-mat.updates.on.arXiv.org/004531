Heterogeneity in characteristics from one region (sub-population) to another, commonly observed
in complex systems, such as glasses and a collection of cells, is hard to describe theoretically.
In the context of cancer, intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH), characterized by cells with genetic
and phenotypic variability that co-exist within a single tumor, is often the cause of ineffective
therapy and recurrence of cancer. Multi-region sequencing (M-Seq), obtained by sampling multiple
regions of a single tumor, has vividly demonstrated the pervasive nature of ITH, raising the need
for a theory that accounts for evolution of tumor heterogeneity. Here, we develop a statistical
mechanical theory to quantify ITH, using the Hamming distance, between genetic mutations in distinct
regions within a single tumor. An analytic expression for ITH, expressed in terms of cell division
probability ($\alpha$) and mutation probability ($p$), is validated using cellular-automaton
type simulations. Application of the theory successfully captures ITH extracted from M-seq data
in patients with exogenous cancers (melanoma and lung). The theory, based on punctuated evolution
at the early stages of the tumor followed by neutral evolution, is accurate provided the spatial
variation in the tumor mutation burden is not large. We show that there are substantial variations
in ITH in distinct regions of a single solid tumor, which supports the notion that distinct subclones
could co-exist. The simulations show that there are substantial variations in the sub-populations,
with the ITH increasing as the distance between the regions increases. The analytical and simulation
framework developed here could be used in the quantitative analyses of the experimental (M-Seq)
data. More broadly, our theory is likely to be useful in analyzing dynamic heterogeneity in complex
systems such as super-cooled liquids.

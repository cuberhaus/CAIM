A general nonlinear theory for the elasticity of pre-stressed single crystals is presented. Various
types of elastic moduli are defined, their importance is determined, and relationships between
them are presented. In particular, B moduli are present in the relationship between the Jaumann
objective time derivative of the Cauchy stress and deformation rate and are broadly used in computational
algorithms in various finite-element codes. Possible applications to simplified linear solutions
for complex nonlinear elasticity problems are outlined and illustrated for a superdislocation.
The effect of finite rotations is fully taken into account and analyzed. Different types of the bulk
and shear moduli under different constraints are defined and connected to the effective properties
of polycrystalline aggregates. Expressions for elastic energy and stress-strain relationships
for small distortions with respect to a pre-stressed configuration are derived in detail. Under
initial hydrostatic load, general consistency conditions for elastic moduli and compliances
are derived that follow from the existence of the generalized tensorial equation of state under
hydrostatic loading obtained from single crystal or polycrystal. It is shown that B moduli can be
found from the expression for the Gibbs energy. However, higher-order elastic moduli defined from
the Gibbs energy do not have any meaning since they do not directly participate in any known equations,
like stress-strain relationships and wave propagation equation. The deviatoric projection of
B can also be found from the expression for the elastic energy for isochoric small strain increments,
and the missing components of B can be found from the consistency conditions. Numerous inconsistencies
and errors in the known works are analyzed.

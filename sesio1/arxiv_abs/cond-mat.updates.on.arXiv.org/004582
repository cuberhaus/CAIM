Bismuth compounds are of growing interest with regard to potential applications in catalysis,
medicine and electronics, for which their environmentally benign nature is one of the key factors.
The most common starting material is bismuth nitrate, which easily hydrolyses to give a large number
of condensation products. The so-called bismuth subnitrates are composed of bismuth oxido clusters
of varying composition and nuclearity. One reason that hampers the further development of bismuth
oxido-based materials, however is the low solubility of the subnitrates, which makes targeted
immobilisation on substrates challenging. We present an approach towards solubilisation of bismuth
oxido clusters by introducing an amino carboxylate as functional group and a study of the growth
mode of these atom-precise nanoclusters on gold surfaces. For this purpose the bismuth oxido cluster
[Bi38O45(NO3)20(dmso)28](NO3)4*4dmso (dmso=dimethyl sulfoxide) was reacted with the sodium
salt of tert-butyloxycabonyl(Boc)-protected phenylalanine (Phe) to give the soluble and chiral
nanocluster [Bi38O45(Boc-Phe)24(dmso)9]. The hydrodynamic diameter of the cluster was estimated
with (1.4-1.6) nm (in CH3CN) and (2.2 nm-2.9) nm (in Ethanol) based on dynamic light scattering (DLS).
The full exchange of the nitrates by the amino carboxylates was proven by NMR and FTIR as well as elemental
analysis (EA) and XPS. The solubility of the bismuth oxido cluster in a protic as well as an aprotic
polar organic solvent and the growth mode of the clusters on Au upon spin-, dip-, and drop-coating
on gold surfaces were studied. Successful deposition of bismuth oxido cluster was proven by powder
XRD, FTIR, and XPS while the microstructure of the resulting films was investigated as a function
of the deposition method and the solvent used by SEM, AFM, and optical microscopy.

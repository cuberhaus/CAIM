Composite fermions provide a simple and unified picture to understand a vast amount of phenomenology
in the quantum Hall regime. However it has remained challenging to formulate this concept properly
within a single Landau level. Recently a low-energy noncommutative field theory for bosons at Landau-level
filling factor $\nu=1$ has been formulated by Dong and Senthil. In the limit of long-wavelength
and small-amplitude gauge fluctuation, they found it reduces to the celebrated Halperin-Lee-Read
theory of composite fermion liquid. In this work we consider a Bose-Fermi mixture at total filling
factor $\nu=1$. Different from previous work, the number density of composite fermions in the mixture
and corresponding Fermi momentum can be tuned by changing the filling factor of bosons, $\nu_b =
1 -\nu_f$. This tunability enables us to study the dilute limit $\nu_b\ll 1$, which allows for a controlled
and asymptotically exact calculation of the energy dispersion and effective mass of composite
fermions. Furthermore, the approximation of the low-energy description by a commutative field
theory is manifestly justified. Most importantly, we demonstrate gauge fluctuations acquire
a Higgs mass due to the presence of a composite boson condensate, as a result of which the system behaves
like a genuine Landau Fermi liquid. Combined with the irrelevance of four-fermion interaction
in the dilute limit, we are able to obtain asymptotically exact properties of this composite fermion
Fermi liquid. In the opposite limit of $\nu_f\ll 1$, the Higgs mass goes to zero and we find crossover
between Fermi liquid and non-Fermi liquid as temperature increases. Observing these properties
either experimentally or numerically provides unambiguous evidence of not only the composite
fermions and the Fermi surface they form, but also the presence of emergent gauge fields and their
fluctuations due to strong correlation.

Metallic hydrogen is capable of showing room temperature superconductivity, but its experimental
syntheses are extremely hard. Therefore, it is desirable to reduce the synthesis pressure of metallic
hydrogen by adding other chemical elements. However, for most hydrides, the metallization of hydrogen
by "chemical precompression" to achieve high-temperature superconductivity still requires
relatively high pressure, making experimental synthesis difficult. How to achieve high-temperature
superconductivity in the low-pressure range (0-50 GPa) is a key issue for realizing practical applications
of superconducting materials. Toward this end, this work proposes a strategy for inserting ammonium
ions in the fcc crystal of metals. High-throughput calculations of the periodic table reveal 12
elements which can form kinetically stable and superconducting hydrides at low pressures, where
the highest superconducting transition temperatures of AlN2H8, MgN2H8 and GaN2H8 can reach up
to 118.40, 105.09 and 104.39 K. Pressure-induced bond length changes and charge transfer reveal
the physical mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity, where the H atom continuously
gains electrons leading to the transition of H+ ions to atomic H, facilitating metallization of
hydrogen under mild pressure. Our results also reveal two strong linear scalar relationships,
one is the H-atom charge versus superconducting transition temperature and the other is the first
ionization energy versus the highest superconducting transition temperature. Besides, ZnN2H8,
CdN2H8, and HgN2H8 were found to be superconductors at ambient pressure, and the presence of interstitial
electrons suggests that they are also electrides, whose relatively low work functions (3.03, 2.78,
and 3.05 eV) imply that they can be used as catalysts for nitrogen reduction reactions as well.

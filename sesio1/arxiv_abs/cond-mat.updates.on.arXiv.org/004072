A Weyl semimetal (WSM)\ is a three-dimensional topological phase of matter where pairs of nondegenerate
bands cross at isolated points in the Brillouin zone called Weyl nodes. Near these points, the electronic
dispersion is gapless and linear. A magnetic field $B$ changes this dispersion into a set of Landau
levels which are dispersive along the direction of the magnetic field only. The $n=0$ Landau level
is special since its dispersion$\ $is linear and unidirectional. The presence of this chiral level
distinguishes Weyl from Schr\"{o}dinger fermions. In this paper, we study the quantum oscillations
of the orbital magnetization and magnetic susceptibility in Weyl semimetals. We generalise earlier
works% \cite{Mikitik2019} on these De Haas-Van Alphen oscillations by considering the effect
of a tilt of the Weyl nodes. We study how the fundamental period of the oscillations in the small $B$
limit and the strength of the magnetic field $B_{1}$ required to reach the quantum limit are modified
by the magnitude and orientation of the tilt vector $\mathbf{t}$. We show that the magnetization
from a single node is finite in the $B\rightarrow 0$ limit. Its sign depends on the product of the chirality
and sign of the tilt component along the magnetic field direction. We also study the magnetic oscillations
from a pair of Weyl nodes with opposite chirality and with opposite or identical tilt. Our calculation
shows that these two cases lead to a very different behavior of the magnetization in the small and
large $B$ limits. We finally consider the effect of an energy shift $\pm \Delta _{0}$ of a pair of Weyl
nodes on the magnetic oscillations. We assume a constant density of carriers so that both nodes share
a common Fermi level. Our calculation can easily be extended to a WSM with an arbitrary number of pairs
of Weyl nodes.

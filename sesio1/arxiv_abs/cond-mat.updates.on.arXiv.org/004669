We study the energetic stability and the local electronic structure of the general twisted trilayer
graphene (TTG) with the top and bottom layers rotated with respect to the middle layer respectively
by $\theta$ and $\theta'$. Approximate supercells of the moir\'{e}-of-moir\'{e} superlattices
with $\theta$ and $\theta^{\prime}$ within $1^{\circ}\sim 2^{\circ}$ are established to describe
the structural and electronic properties of relaxed TTG with the periodic boundary condition.
Full relaxation demonstrates that the commensurate TTG with $\theta=\theta^{\prime}$ has the
local minimum total energy ($E_{tol}$) at a fixed $\theta$, while $E_{tol}$ first reaches a local
maximum and begins to drop with decreasing $\theta^{\prime}$ for $\theta^{\prime} < \theta$.
Some regions exhibit enhanced in-plane relaxation in the top and bottom layers but suppressed relaxation
in the middle layer and form a hexagonal network with the moir\'{e}-of-moir\'{e} length scale.
The stacking configurations with the atoms in the three layers vertically aligned at the origin
of the relaxed TTG supercells at $\theta$ around $1.6^{\circ}$ and $\theta^{\prime}$ around $1.4^{\circ}$
have a high density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level ($E_F$), which can reach that of the mirror
symmetric TTG with equal twist angles of about $1.7^{\circ}$. In contrast, some other stackings
can have rather low DOS around $E_F$. The significant stacking dependence of DOS for some TTG supercells
demonstrates that the local electronic structure of TTG can exhibit strong spatial inhomogeneity
when the twist angles are slightly away from those of the small supercells with large variations
of DOS among different stackings. Moreover, the structural relaxation of TTG plays a crucial role
in the high DOS and its strong stacking dependence.

We consider the implementation of two-qubit gates when the physical systems used to realize the
qubits possess additional quantum states in the accessible energy range. We use optimal control
theory to determine the maximum achievable gate speed for two-qubit gates in the qubit subspace
of the many-level Hilbert space, and we analyze the effect of the additional quantum states on the
gate speed. We identify two competing mechanisms. On one hand, higher energy levels are generally
more strongly coupled to each other. Under suitable conditions, this stronger coupling can be utilized
to make two-qubit gates significantly faster than the reference value based on simple qubits. On
the other hand, a weak anharmonicity constrains the speed at which the system can be adequately controlled:
according to the intuitive picture, faster operations require stronger control fields, which
are more likely to excite higher levels in a weakly anharmonic system, which in turn leads to faster
decoherence and uncontrolled leakage outside the qubit space. In order to account for this constraint,
we modify the pulse optimization algorithm to avoid pulses that lead to appreciable population
of the higher levels. In this case we find that the presence of the higher levels can lead to a significant
reduction in the maximum achievable gate speed. We also compare the optimal-control gate speeds
with those obtained using the cross-resonance/selective-darkening gate protocol. We find that
the latter, with some parameter optimization, can be used to achieve a relatively fast implementation
of the CNOT gate. These results can help the search for optimized gate implementations in realistic
quantum computing architectures, such as those based on superconducting circuits. They also provide
guidelines for desirable conditions on anharmonicity that allow optimal utilization of the higher
levels to achieve fast quantum gates.

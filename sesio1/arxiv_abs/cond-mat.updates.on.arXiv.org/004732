We study active agents embedded in bulk or in confinement explicitly considering hydrodynamics
and simulating the swimmers via an implementation inspired by the squirmer model. We develop a Dissipative
Particle Dynamics scheme for the solvent. This approach allows us to properly deal not only with
hydrodynamics but also with thermal fluctuations. On the other side, this approach enables us to
study active agents with complex shapes, ranging from spherical colloids to polymers. To start
with, we study a simple spherical colloid. We analyze the features of the velocity fields of the surrounding
solvent, when the colloid is a pusher, a puller or a neutral swimmer either in bulk or confined in a
cylindrical channel. Next, we characterise its dynamical behaviour by computing the mean square
displacement and the long time diffusion when the active colloid is in bulk or in a channel (varying
its radius) and analyze the orientation autocorrelation function in the latter case. While the
three studied squirmer types are characterised by the same bulk diffusion, the cylindrical confinement
considerably modulates the diffusion and the orientation autocorrelation function. Finally,
we focus our attention on a more complex shape: an active polymer. We first characterise the structural
features computing its radius of gyration when in bulk or in cylindrical confinement, and compare
to known results obtained without hydrodynamics. Next, we characterise the dynamical behaviour
of the active polymer by computing its mean square displacement and the long time diffusion. On the
one hand, both diffusion and radius of gyration decrease due to the hydrodynamic interaction when
the system is in bulk. On the other hand, the effect of confinement is to decrease the radius of gyration,
disturbing the motion of the polymer and thus reducing its diffusion.

Accurate prediction of vacancy migration energy barriers, $\Delta E_a$, in multi-component alloys
is extremely challenging yet critical for the development of diffusional transformation kinetics
needed to model alloy behavior in many technological applications. Here, results from $\Delta
E_a$ and the energy driving force $\Delta E$ of many (>1000) vacancy migration events calculated
using density functional theory and nudged elastic band method show large changes (~1eV) of $\Delta
E_a$ in different local chemical environments of the model face-centered cubic Al-Mg-Zn alloys.
Due to local lattice distortion effects induced by solute atoms (such as Mg) with different sizes
than the matrix element (Al), the changes of $\Delta E_a$ for one type of migrating atoms originate
primarily from fluctuations of $\Delta e_a\equiv \Delta E_a - \frac{1}{2}\Delta E$. To understand
the fluctuations, a quartic function is shown to accurately describe the energy landscape of the
minimum energy path (MEP) for each vacancy migration event. Analyses of the quartic function show
that $\Delta e_a$ can be approximated with $\Delta e_a \approx \alpha k_fD^2$, where $\alpha\sim
0.022$ is a constant of all types of migrating atoms. Here $D$ is the distance of a migrating atom between
two adjacent equilibrium positions and $k_f$ is the average vibration spring constant of this atom
at these two equilibrium positions. $k_f$ and $D$ quantitatively describe the lattice distortion
effects on the curvatures and locations of the MEP at its initial and final states in different local
chemical environments. We also used the local lattice occupations as inputs to train surrogate
models to predict coefficients of the quartic function, which accurately and efficiently output
both $\Delta E_a$ and $\Delta E$ as the necessary inputs for the mesoscale studies of diffusional
transformation in Al-Mg-Zn alloys.

Triply-periodic networks are among the most complex and functionally valuable self-assembled
morphologies, yet they form in nearly every class of biological and synthetic soft matter building
blocks. In contrast to simpler assembly motifs -- spheres, cylinders, layers -- TPN assemblies
require molecules to occupy variable local domain shapes, confounding attempts to understand
their formation. Here, we examine the double-gyroid (DG) network phase of block copolymer (BCP)
melts, a prototypical soft self-assembly system, by using a geometric formulation of the strong
stretching theory (SST) of BCP melts. The theory establishes the direct link between molecular
BCP packing, thermodynamics of melt assembly and the {\it medial map}, a generic geometric measure
of the center of complex shapes. We show that "medial packing" is essential for thermodynamic stability
of DG in strongly-segregated melts, reconciling a long-standing contradiction between infinite-
and finite-segregation theories, corroborating our SST predictions at finite-segregation via
self-consistent field calculations. Additionally, we find a previously unrecognized non-monotonic
dependence of DG stability on the elastic asymmetry, the comparative entropic stiffness of matrix-forming
to tubular-network forming blocks. The composition window of stable DG -- intermediate to competitor
lamellar and columnar phases -- widens both for large and small elastic asymmetry, seemingly overturning
the heuristic view that packing frustration is localized to the tubular domains. This study demonstrates
utility of geometric optimization of {\it medial tesselations} for understanding in soft-molecular
assembly. As such, the particular medial-based approach deployed here is readily generalizable
to study packing frustration far beyond the case of DG morphologies in neat BCP assemblies.

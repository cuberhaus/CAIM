We study discrete KPZ growth models deposited on square lattice substrates, whose (average) lateral
size enlarges as $L= L_0 + \omega t^{\gamma}$. Our numerical simulations reveal that the competition
between the substrate expansion and the increase of the correlation length parallel to the substrate,
$\xi \simeq c t^{1/z}$, gives rise to a number of interesting results. For instance, when $\gamma
< 1/z$ the interface becomes fully correlated, but its squared roughness, $W_2$, keeps increasing
as $W_2 \sim t^{2\alpha \gamma}$, as previously observed for 1D systems. A careful analysis of this
scaling, accounting for an intrinsic width on it, allows us to estimate the roughness exponent of
the 2D KPZ class as $\alpha = 0.387(1)$, which is very accurate and robust, once it was obtained averaging
the exponents for different models and growth conditions (i.e., for various $\gamma$'s and $\omega$'s).
In this correlated regime, the height distributions (HDs) and spatial covariances are consistent
with those expected for the steady-state regime of the 2D KPZ class for flat geometry. For $\gamma
\approx 1/z$, we find a family of distributions and covariances continuously interpolating between
those for the steady-state and the growth regime of radial KPZ interfaces, as the ratio $\omega/c$
augments. When $\gamma>1/z$ the system stays forever in the growth regime and the HDs always converge
to the same asymptotic distribution, which is the one for the radial case. The spatial covariances,
on the other hand, are $(\gamma,\omega)$-dependent, showing a trend towards the covariance of
a random deposition in enlarging substrates as the expansion rate increases. These results considerably
generalize our understanding of the height fluctuations in 2D KPZ systems, revealing a scenario
very similar to the one previously found in the 1D case.

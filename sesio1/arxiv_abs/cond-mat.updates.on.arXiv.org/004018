This doctorate thesis focuses on the effects of the electromagnetic environment on applied electromagnetic
fields in single small junctions as well as arrays. We apply radio-frequency (RF) microwaves in
the sub-gigahertz frequency range on a one-dimensional array of small Josephson junctions exhibiting
distinct Coulomb blockade characteristics. We observed a gradual lifting of Coulomb blockade
with increase in the microwave power which we interpret is due to photon-assisted tunneling of Cooper
pairs in the classical (multi-photon absorption) regime. We observe that, due to its high sensitivity
to microwave power, the array is well-suited for in situ microwave detection applications in low
temperature environments. A detailed analysis of the characteristics in the classical (multi-photon
absorption) limit reveals that the microwave amplitude is rescaled (renormalized), which we attribute
to the difference in dc and ac voltage response of the array. We proceed to rigorously consider the
origin of the aforementioned renormalization effect by considering the effect of the electromagnetic
environment of the Josephson junction on applied oscillating voltages. We theoretically demonstrate
that its effect is simply to renormalize the amplitude of oscillation in a predictable manner traced
to the physics of wave function renormalization (Lehmann weights) consistent with circuit-QED.
We also introduce Einstein's A and B coefficients for small Josephson junctions, in a bid to relate
the renormalization effect to the modification of photon absorption and emission amplitudes.
Such renormalization implies that the sensitivity of the single junction and the array to oscillating
electromagnetic fields (e.g. microwaves) is modulated and depends on the environmental impedance.
The renormalization effect can be exploited to configure `opaque', `translucent' or `transparent'
quantum circuits to microwaves.

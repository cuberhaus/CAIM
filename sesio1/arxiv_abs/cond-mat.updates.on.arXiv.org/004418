Recent studies have shown the fluid of hard right triangles to possess fourfold and quasi-eightfold
(octatic) orientational symmetries. However, the standard density-functional theory for two-dimensional
anisotropic fluids, based on two-body correlations, and an extension to incorporate three-body
correlations, fail to describe these symmetries. To explain the origin of octatic symmetry we postulate
strong particle clustering as a crucial ingredient. We use Scaled Particle Theory to analyze four
binary mixtures of hard right triangles and squares, three of them being extreme models for a one-component
fluid, where right triangles can exist as monomeric entities together with triangular dimers,
square dimers or square tetramers. Phase diagrams exhibit a rich phenomenology, with demixing
and three-phase coexistences. More important, under some circumstances the orientational distribution
function of triangles has equally high peaks at relative particle angles 0, $\pi/2,$ and $\pi$,
signalling fourfold, tetratic order, but also secondary peaks located at $\pi/4$ and $3\pi/4$,
a feature of eightfold, octatic order. Also, we extend the binary mixture model to a quaternary mixture
consisting of four types of clusters: monomers, triangular and square dimers, and square tetramers.
This mixture is analyzed using Scaled Particle Theory under the restriction of fixed cluster fractions.
Apart from the obvious tetratic phase promoted by tetramers, we found that, for certain cluster
compositions, the total orientational distribution function of monomers can exhibit quasi-eightfold
(octatic) symmetry. The study gives evidence on the importance of clustering to explain the peculiar
orientational properties of liquid-crystal phases in some two dimensional fluids.

We benchmark a set of quantum-chemistry methods, including multitrajectory Ehrenfest, fewest-switches
surface-hopping, and multiconfigurational-Ehrenfest dynamics, against exact quantum-many-body
techniques by studying real-time dynamics in the Holstein model. This is a paradigmatic model in
condensed matter theory incorporating a local coupling of electrons to Einstein phonons. For the
two-site and three-site Holstein model, we discuss the exact and quantum-chemistry methods in
terms of the Born-Huang formalism, covering different initial states, which either start on a single
Born-Oppenheimer surface, or with the electron localized to a single site. For extended systems
with up to 51 sites, we address both the physics of single Holstein polarons and the dynamics of charge-density
waves at finite electron densities. For these extended systems, we compare the quantum-chemistry
methods to exact dynamics obtained from time-dependent density matrix renormalization group
calculations with local basis optimization (DMRG-LBO). We observe that the multitrajectory Ehrenfest
method, in general, only captures the ultrashort time dynamics accurately. In contrast, the surface-hopping
method with suitable corrections provides a much better description of the long-time behavior
but struggles with the short-time description of coherences between different Born-Oppenheimer
states. We show that the multiconfigurational Ehrenfest method yields a significant improvement
over the multitrajectory Ehrenfest method and can be converged to the exact results in small systems
with moderate computational efforts. We further observe that for extended systems, this convergence
is slower with respect to the number of configurations. Our benchmark study demonstrates that DMRG-LBO
is a useful tool for assessing the quality of the quantum-chemistry methods.

The magnetoresistance (MR) and the magnetization isotherms were studied up to high magnetic fields
at T = 3 K and 300 K for a microcrystalline ($\mu$c) Ni foil corresponding to bulk Ni and for a nanocrystalline
(nc) Ni foil. At T = 3 K, for the $\mu$c-Ni sample with a residual resistivity ratio (RRR) of 331, the
field dependence of the resistivity was similar to what was reported previously for high-purity
ferromagnets whereas the MR(H) behavior for the nc-Ni sample with RRR = 9 resembled that what was
observed at low temperatures for Ni-based alloys with low impurity concentration. In the magnetically
saturated state, the resistivity increased with magnetic field for both samples at T = 3 K and the
field dependence was dominated by the ordinary MR due to the Lorentz force acting on the electron
trajectories. However, the MR(H) curves were found to be saturating for $\mu$c-Ni and non-saturating
for nc-Ni, the difference arising from their very different electron mean free paths. At T = 300 K,
the MR(H) curves of both Ni samples were very similar to those known for bulk Ni. After magnetic saturation,
the resistivity decreased nearly linearly with magnetic field which behavior is due to the suppression
of thermally-induced magnetic disorder with increasing magnetic field. The MR(H) data were analyzed
at both temperatures with the help of Kohler plots from which the resistivity anisotropy splitting
($\Delta\rho_{AMR}$) and the anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) ratio were derived. It was
demonstrated that at T = 300 K, $\rho(H\rightarrow 0)=\rho(B\rightarrow 0)$ due to the negligible
contribution of the ordinary MR. The data for the two Ni samples at 3 K and 300 K were found to indicate
an approximately linear scaling of $\Delta\rho_{AMR}$ with the zero-field resistivity. This
implies that the AMR ratio does not vary significantly with temperature in either microstructural
state of Ni.

We solve the binary decision model of Brock and Durlauf in time using a method reliant on the resolvent
of the master operator of the stochastic process. Our solution is valid when not at equilibrium and
can be used to exemplify path-dependent behaviours of the binary decision model. The solution is
computationally fast and is indistinguishable from Monte Carlo simulation. Well-known metastable
effects are observed in regions of the model's parameter space where agent rationality is above
a critical value, and we calculate the time scale at which equilibrium is reached from first passage
time theory to a much greater approximation than has been previously conducted. In addition to considering
selfish agents, who only care to maximise their own utility, we consider altruistic agents who make
decisions on the basis of maximising global utility. Curiously, we find that although altruistic
agents coalesce more strongly on a particular decision, thereby increasing their utility in the
short-term, they are also more prone to being subject to non-optimal metastable regimes as compared
to selfish agents. The method used for this solution can be easily extended to other binary decision
models, including Kirman's ant model, and under reinterpretation also provides a time-dependent
solution to the mean-field Ising model. Finally, we use our time-dependent solution to construct
a likelihood function that can be used on non-equilibrium data for model calibration. This is a rare
finding, since often calibration in economic agent based models must be done without an explicit
likelihood function. From simulated data, we show that even with a well-defined likelihood function,
model calibration is difficult unless one has access to data representative of the underlying model.

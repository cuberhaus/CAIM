Designing new heterostructure electrodes has many challenges associated with interface engineering.
Demanding simulation resources and lack of heterostructure databases continue to be a barrier
in understanding the chemistry and mechanics of complex interfaces using simulations. Mixed-dimensional
heterostructures composed of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) materials are
undisputed next-generation materials for engineered devices due to their changeable properties.
The present work computationally investigates the interface between 2D graphene and 3D tin (Sn)
systems with density functional theory (DFT) method and uses the computationally demanding simulation
data to develop machine learning (ML) based potential energy surface (PES). Developed PES can be
used to model graphene-tin interface systems from ML with close to DFT accuracies. To develop PES,
high dimensional neural networks (HDNN) that rely on atom-centered symmetry function to represent
structural information have been used. HDNN are modified to train on the total energies of the interface
system rather than atomic energies. The performance of modified HDNN trained on 5789 interface
structures of graphene|Sn is tested on unfamiliar interfaces of the same material pair with varying
levels of structural deviations from the training dataset, including new Sn bulk phase, defects,
and interfacial atomic diffusion. The highest RMSE obtained for the prediction on test interfaces
is 0.458 eV/atom. The modified HDNN approach is shown to be more accurate in predicting energies
of complex polymorphing interfaces such as graphene and tin. Improved accuracy in ML-based modeling
approach promises cost-effective means of designing interfaces in heterostructure energy storage
systems with higher cycle life and stability.

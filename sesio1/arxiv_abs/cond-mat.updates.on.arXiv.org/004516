Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) have attracted strong research interest within the last decades
due to their potential use as non-volatile memory such as MRAM as well as for magnetic logic applications.
Half-metallic magnets (HMMs) have been suggested as ideal electrode materials for MTJs to achieve
an extremely large tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) effect. Despite their high TMR ratios, MTJs
based on HMMs do not exhibit current rectification, i.e., a diode effect, which was achieved in a
novel MTJ concept based on HMMs and type-II spin-gapless semiconductors (SGSs). The proposed concept
has been recently experimentally demonstrated using Heusler compounds. In the present work, we
investigate from first-principles MTJs based on type-II SGS and HMM quaternary Heusler compounds
FeVTaAl, FeVTiSi, MnVTiAl, and CoVTiSb. Our $ab$ $initio$ quantum transport calculations based
on a non-equilibrium Green's function method have demonstrated that the MTJs exhibit current rectification
with relatively high on/off ratios. We show that, in contrast to conventional semiconductor diodes,
the rectification bias voltage window (or breakdown voltage) of the MTJs is limited by the spin gap
of the HMM and SGS Heusler compounds, which can be tuned by doping the electrode materials. A unique
feature of the present MTJs is that the diode effect can be configured dynamically, i.e., depending
on the relative orientation of the magnetization of the electrodes, the MTJ allows the electrical
current to pass either in one or the other direction, which leads to an inverse TMR effect. The combination
of nonvolatility, reconfigurable diode functionality, tunable rectification voltage window,
and high Curie temperature of the electrode materials make the proposed MTJs very promising for
room temperature spintronic applications and opens new ways to magnetic memory and logic concepts
as well as logic-in-memory computing.

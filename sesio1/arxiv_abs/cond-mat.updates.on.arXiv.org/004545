Basal plane dislocations (BPDs) pose great challenge to the reliabilities of 4H silicon carbide
(4H-SiC) based bipolar power devices. It is well established that heavy nitrogen (N) doping promotes
the conversion of BPDs to threading edge dislocations (TEDs) and improves the reliability of 4H-SiC
based bipolar devices. However, the interaction between N and BPDs, as well as its effect on the electronic
properties is still ambiguous, which significantly hinder the understanding on the electron-transport
mechanism of 4H-SiC based power devices. By combining molten-alkali etching and the Kelvin probe
force microscopy (KPFM) analysis, we demonstrate that BPDs create acceptor-like states in undoped
4H-SiC, while act as donors in N-doped 4H-SiC. First-principles calculations verify that BPDs
create occupied defect states above the valance band maximum (VBM) and unoccupied defect states
under the conduction band minimum (CBM) of undoped 4H-SiC. The electron transfer from the defect
states of intrinsic defects/native impurities to the unoccupied defect states of BPDs gives rise
to the acceptor-like behavior of BPDs in undoped 4H-SiC. Defect formation energies demonstrate
that N atoms can spontaneously decorate BPDs during the N doping of 4H-SiC. The binding between N
and the BPD is strong against decomposition. The accumulation of N dopants at the core of BPDs results
in the accumulation of donor-like states at the core of BPDs in N-doped 4H-SiC. Furthermore, the
N decoration of BPDs gives rise to two distinct defect levels under the CBM of 4H-SiC, which may serve
as electron transfer channels in the Poole-Frenkel (PF) emission of N-doped 4H-SiC, and increase
the reverse leakage current. Our work not only enriches the understanding on the electronic behavior
of BPDs in N-doped 4H-SiC, but also paves the way for understanding the electron transport mechanism
in 4H-SiC based power devices.

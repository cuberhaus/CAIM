't Hooft anomalies of quantum field theories (QFTs) with an invertible global symmetry G (including
spacetime and internal symmetries) in a $d$d spacetime are known to be classified by a $d+1$d cobordism
group TP$_{d+1}$(G), whose group generator is a $d+1$d cobordism invariant written as an invertible
topological field theory (iTFT) Z$_{d+1}$. Deformation class of QFT is recently proposed to be
specified by its symmetry G and an iTFT Z$_{d+1}$. Seemly different QFTs of the same deformation
class can be deformed to each other via quantum phase transitions. In this work, we ask which deformation
class controls the 4d ungauged or gauged (SU(3)$\times$SU(2)$\times$U(1))/$\mathbb{Z}_q$
Standard Model (SM) for $q=1,2,3,6$ with a continuous or discrete $(\bf{B}-\bf{L})$ symmetry.
We show that the answer contains some combination of 5d iTFTs: two $\mathbb{Z}$ classes associated
with $(\bf{B}-\bf{L})^3$ and $(\bf{B}-\bf{L})$-(gravity)$^2$ 4d perturbative local anomalies,
a mod 16 class Atiyah-Patodi-Singer $\eta$ invariant and a mod 2 class Stiefel-Whitney $w_2w_3$
invariant associated with 4d nonperturbative global anomalies, and additional $\mathbb{Z}_3\times\mathbb{Z}_2$
classes involving higher symmetries whose charged objects are Wilson electric or 't Hooft magnetic
line operators. Out of $\mathbb{Z}$ classes of local anomalies and 24576 classes of global anomalies,
we pin down a deformation class of SM labeled by $(n_{\nu_{R}}, N_f,$ p$',q)$, the "right-handed
sterile" neutrino and family numbers, magnetic monopole datum, and mod $q$ relation. Grand Unifications
and Ultra Unification that replaces sterile neutrinos with new exotic gapped/gapless sectors
(e.g., topological or conformal field theory) or gravitational sectors with topological or cobordism
constraints, all reside in an SM deformation class. Neighbor phases/transitions/critical regions
near SM exhibit beyond SM phenomena.

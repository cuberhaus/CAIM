We consider a one-dimensional system of interacting particles, in which particles are subjected
to a bistable potential the double-well shape of which is tunable via a shape deformability parameter.
Our objective is to examine the impact of shape deformability on the order of transition in quantum
tunneling in the bistable system, and on the possible existence of exact solutions to the transfer-integral
operator associated with the partition function of the system. The bistable potential is represented
by a class composed of three families of parametrized double-well potentials, whose minima and
barrier height can be tuned distinctly. It is found that the extra degree of freedom, introduced
by the shape deformability parameter, favors a first-order transition in quantum tunneling, in
addition to the second-order transition predicted with the $\phi^4$ model. This first-order transition
in quantum tunneling, which is consistent with Chudnovsky's conjecture of the influence of the
shape of the potential barrier on the order of thermally-assisted transitions in bistable systems,
is shown to occur at a critical value of the shape-deformability parameter which is the same for the
three families of parametrized double-well potentials. Concerning the statistical mechanics
of the system, the associate partition function is mapped onto a spectral problem by means of the
transfer-integral formalism. The condition that the partition function can be exactly integrable,
is determined by a criterion enabling exact eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for the transfer-integral
operator. Analytical expressions of some of these exact eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are given,
and the corresponding ground-state wavefunctions are used to compute the probability density
which is relevant for calculations of thermodynamic quantities such as the correlation functions
and the correlation lengths.

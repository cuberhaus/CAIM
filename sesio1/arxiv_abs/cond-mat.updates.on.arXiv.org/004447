In the ideal disorder-free situation, a two-dimensional band gap insulator has an activation energy
for conductivity equal to half the band gap, $\Delta$. But transport experiments usually exhibit
a much smaller activation energy at low temperature, and the relation between this activation energy
and $\Delta$ is unclear. Here we consider the temperature-dependent conductivity of a two-dimensional
narrow gap semiconductor on a substrate containing Coulomb impurities, mostly focusing on the
case when amplitude of the random potential $\Gamma \gg \Delta$. We show that the conductivity generically
exhibits three regimes of conductivity, and only the highest temperature regime exhibits an activation
energy that reflects the band gap. At lower temperatures, the conduction proceeds through nearest-neighbor
or variable-range hopping between electron and hole puddles created by the disorder. We show that
the activation energy and characteristic temperature associated with these processes steeply
collapse near a critical impurity concentration. Larger concentrations lead to an exponentially
small activation energy and exponentially long localization length, which in mesoscopic samples
can appear as a disorder-induced insulator-to-metal transition. We arrive at a similar disorder
driven steep insulator-metal transition in thin films of three-dimensional topological insulators
with very large dielectric constant, where due to confinement of electric field internal Coulomb
impurities create larger disorder potential. Away from neutrality point this unconventional
insulator-to-metal transition is augmented by conventional metal insulator transition at small
impurity concentrations. In this case we arrive at disorder-driven re-entrant metal-insulator-metal
transition. We also apply this theory to three-dimensional narrow gap Dirac materials.

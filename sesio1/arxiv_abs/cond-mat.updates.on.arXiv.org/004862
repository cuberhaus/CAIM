Simulation of materials is one of the most promising applications of quantum computers. On near-term
hardware the crucial constraint on these simulations is circuit depth. Many quantum simulation
algorithms rely on a layer of unitary evolutions generated by each term in a Hamiltonian. This appears
in time-dynamics as a single Trotter step, and in variational quantum eigensolvers under the Hamiltonian
variational ansatz as a single ansatz layer. We present a new quantum algorithm design for materials
modelling where the depth of a layer is independent of the system size. This design takes advantage
of the locality of materials in the Wannier basis and employs a tailored fermionic encoding that
preserves locality. We analyse the circuit costs of this approach and present a compiler that transforms
density functional theory data into quantum circuit instructions -- connecting the physics of
the material to the simulation circuit. The compiler automatically optimises circuits at multiple
levels, from the base gate level to optimisations derived from the physics of the specific target
material. We present numerical results for materials spanning a wide structural and technological
range. Our results demonstrate a reduction of many orders of magnitude in circuit depth over standard
prior methods that do not consider the structure of the Hamiltonian. For example our results improve
resource requirements for Strontium Vanadate (SrVO$_3$) from 864 to 180 qubits for a $3\times3\times3$
lattice, and the circuit depth of a single Trotter or variational layer from $7.5\times 10^8$ to
depth $730$. Although this is still beyond current hardware, our results show that materials simulation
may be feasible on quantum computers without necessarily requiring scalable, fault-tolerant
quantum computers, provided quantum algorithm design incorporates understanding of the materials
and applications.

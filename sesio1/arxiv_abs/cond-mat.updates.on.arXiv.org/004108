Ergodicity is a fundamental principle of statistical mechanics underlying the behavior of generic
quantum many-body systems. However, how this universal many-body quantum chaotic regime emerges
due to interactions remains largely a puzzle. This paper demonstrates using both heuristic arguments
and a microscopic calculation that a dephasing mechanism, similar to Altshuler-Aronov-Khmelnitskii
dephasing in the theory of localization, underlies this transition to chaos. We focus on the behavior
of the spectral form factor (SFF) as a function of "time", t, which characterizes level correlations
in the many-body spectrum. The SFF can be expressed as a sum over periodic classical orbits and its
behavior hinges on the interference of trajectories related to each other by a time-translation.
In the absence of interactions, time-translation symmetry is present for each individual particle,
which leads to a fast exponential growth of the SFF and correspondingly loss of correlations between
many-body levels. Interactions lead to dephasing, which disrupts interference, and breaks the
massive time-translation symmetry down to a global time-translation/energy conservation. This
in turn gives rise to the hallmark linear-in-$t$ ramp in the SFF reflecting Wigner-Dyson level repulsion.
This general picture is supported by a microscopic analysis of an interacting many-body model.
Specifically, we study the $\mbox{SYK}_2+\mbox{SYK}_2^2$ model, which allows to tune between
an integrable and chaotic regime. It is shown that the dephasing mass vanishes in the former case,
which maps to the non-interacting $\mbox{SYK}_2$ model via a time reparameterization. In contrast,
the chaotic regime gives rise to dephasing, which suppresses the exponential ramp of the non-interacting
theory and induces correlations between many-body levels.

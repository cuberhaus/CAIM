Tiny-shaped particles are the building blocks for bigger-shaped particle. In solution-based
process or method, atoms, on dissociation from the precursor, amalgamate at an electronically
flat solution surface. Under their re-crystallized state, the amalgamated atoms at the solution
surface form the monolayer assembly. Under the supply of nanoenergy packets, monolayer assembly
converts into the triangular shape tiny particles. Due to the formation of concave meniscus, such
tiny particles when just enter the electronically decreasing level solution surface, atoms of
arrays convert into the structures of smooth elements. Triangular shape tiny particles assemble
to nucleate a mono layer shape. Monolayer and mono layer give different meanings here. To extend
the mono layer shape, structures of smooth elements in later coalesced tiny-shaped particles adhere
adjacently. At an electronically flat solution surface, atoms bind in the shapes of supplied nanoenergy
packets. A block of connected triangular shape tiny particles gets developed under the bipolar
mode of the pulse. On leaving electronically flat solution surface, the block of connected triangular
shape tiny particles dismantles into two equal tiny-shaped particles. At an electronically decreasing
level solution surface, forces of immersing format elongate the atoms. In the elongation, array
of atoms converts into the structure of smooth element. Travelling photons along the air-solution
interface further flatten structures of smooth elements. On assembling the tiny-shaped particles
and adjacently adhering structures of smooth elements develop a mono layer shape. In upper shaped
mono layer, a force of gravity becomes greater than the force of levity. Opposite is the case in lower
shaped mono layer. The process of adhering two mono layers completes in a few microseconds. Processing

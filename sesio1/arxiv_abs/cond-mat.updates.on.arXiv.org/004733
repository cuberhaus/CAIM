In the early stages of a novel technology development, it is difficult to provide a comprehensive
assessment of its potential capabilities and impact. Nevertheless, some preliminary estimates
can be drawn and are certainly of great interest and in this paper we follow this line of reasoning
within the framework of the Spin Wave (SW) computing paradigm. In particular, we are interested
in assessing the technological development horizon that needs to be reached in order to unleash
the full SW paradigm potential such that SW circuits can outperform CMOS counterparts in terms of
energy consumption. In view of the zero power SWs propagation through ferromagnetic waveguides,
the overall SW circuit power consumption is determined by the one associated to SWs generation and
sensing by means of transducers. While current antenna based transducers are clearly power hungry
recent developments indicate that magneto-electric (ME) cells have a great potential for ultra-low
power SW generation and sensing. Given that MEs have been only proposed at the conceptual level and
no actual experimental demonstration has been reported we cannot evaluate the impact of their utilization
on the SW circuit energy consumption. However, we can perform a reverse engineering alike analysis
to determine ME delay and power consumption upper bounds that can place SW circuits in the leading
position. To this end, we utilize a 32-bit Brent-Kung Adder (BKA) as discussion vehicle and compute
the maximum ME delay and power consumption that could potentially enable a SW implementation able
to outperform its 7nm CMOS counterpart. We evaluate different BKA SW implementations that rely
on conversion or normalization gate cascading and consider continuous or pulsed SW generation
scenarios. 31nW is the maximum transducer power consumption for which a 32-bit BKA SW implementation
can outperform its 7nm CMOS counterpart.

The semiclassical equations of motion are widely used to describe carrier transport in conducting
materials. Nevertheless, the substantial challenge of incorporating disorder systematically
into the semiclassical model persists, leading to quantitative inaccuracies and occasionally
erroneous predictions for the expectation values of physical observables. In the present work
we provide a general prescription for reformulating the semiclassical equations of motion for
carriers in disordered conductors by taking the quantum mechanical density matrix as the starting
point. We focus on external electric fields, without magnetic fields, and spin-independent disorder.
The density matrix approach allows averaging over impurity configurations, and the trace of the
velocity operator with the disorder-averaged density matrix can be reinterpreted as the semiclassical
velocity weighted by the Boltzmann distribution function. Through this rationale the well-known
intrinsic group and anomalous velocities are trivially recovered, while we demonstrate the existence
of an extrinsic interband velocity, namely a disorder correction to the semiclassical velocity
of Bloch electrons, mediated by the interband matrix elements of the Berry connection. A similar
correction is present in the non-equilibrium expectation value of the spin operator, contributing
to spin-orbit torques. To obtain agreement with diagrammatic approaches the scattering term in
the Boltzmann equation is corrected to first order in the electric field, and the Boltzmann equation
is solved up to sub-leading order in the disorder potential. Our prescription ensures all vertex
corrections present in diagrammatic treatments are taken into account, and to illustrate this
we discuss model cases in topological insulators, including the anomalous Hall effect as well as
spin-orbit torques.

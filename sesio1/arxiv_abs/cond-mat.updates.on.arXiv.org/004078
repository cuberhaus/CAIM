This work demonstrates the development of a strong and ductile medium entropy alloy by employing
conventional alloying and thermomechanical processing to induce partial recrystallization
(PR) and precipitation strengthening in the microstructure. The combined usage of electron microscopy
and atom probe tomography reveals the sequence of microstructural evolution during the process.
First, the cold working of homogenized alloy resulted in a highly deformed microstructure. On annealing
at 700{\deg}C, B2 ordered precipitates heterogeneously nucleate on the highly misoriented sites.
These B2 promotes particle stimulated nucleation (PSN) of new recrystallized strain-free grains.
The migration of recrystallized grain boundaries leads to discontinuous precipitation of L12
ordered regions in highly dense lamellae structures. Atomic-scale compositional analysis reveals
a significant amount of Ni confined to the GB regions between B2 and L12 precipitates, indicating
Ni as a rate-controlling element for coarsening the microstructure. On 20 hours of annealing, the
alloy comprises a composite microstructure of soft recrystallized and hard non-recrystallized
zones, B2 particles at the grain boundaries (GBs), and coherent L12 precipitates inside the grains.
The B2 pins the GB movement during recrystallization while the latter provides high strength. The
microstructure results in a 0.2% yield stress (YS) value of 1030 MPa with 32% elongation at ambient
temperature and retains up to 910 MPa at 670{\deg}C. Also, it shows exceptional microstructural
stability at 700 {\deg}C and resistance to deformation at high temperatures up to 770{\deg}C. Examination
of deformed microstructure reveals excessive twinning, formation of stacking faults, shearing
of L12 precipitates, and accumulation of dislocations at around the B2 precipitates and GBs attributed
to high strain hardening of the alloy.

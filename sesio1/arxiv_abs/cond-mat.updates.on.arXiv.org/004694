In this paper, we investigate the effects of stochastic resetting on diffusion in $\R^d\backslash
\calU$, where $\calU$ is a bounded obstacle with a partially absorbing surface $\partial \calU$.
We begin by considering a Robin boundary condition with a constant reactivity $\kappa_0$, and show
how previous results are recovered in the limits $\kappa_0\rightarrow 0,\infty$. We then generalize
the Robin boundary condition to a more general probabilistic model of diffusion-mediated surface
reactions using an encounter-based approach. The latter considers the joint probability density
or propagator $P(\x,\ell,t|\x_0)$ for the pair $(\X_t,\ell_t)$ in the case of a perfectly reflecting
surface, where $\X_t$ and $\ell_t$ denote the particle position and local time, respectively.
The local time determines the amount of time that a Brownian particle spends in a neighborhood of
the boundary. The effects of surface reactions are then incorporated via an appropriate stopping
condition for the boundary local time. We construct the boundary value problem (BVP) satisfied
by the propagator in the presence of resetting, and use this to derive implicit equations for the
marginal density of particle position and the survival probability. We highlight the fact that
these equations are difficult to solve in the case of non-constant reactivities, since resetting
is not governed by a renewal process. We then consider a simpler problem in which both the position
and local time are reset. In this case, the survival probability with resetting can be expressed
in terms of the survival probability without resetting, which allows us to explore the dependence
of the MFPT on the resetting rate $r$ and the type of surface reactions. The theory is illustrated
using the example of a spherically symmetric surface.

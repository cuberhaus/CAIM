Industrial and agricultural waste streams, which contain high concentrations of NH4+, PO43- and
transition metals are environmentally harmful and toxic pollutants. At the same time phosphorous
and transition metals constitute highly valuable resources. Typically, separate pathways have
been considered to extract hazardous transition metals or phosphate, independently from each
other. Investigations on the simultaneous removal of multiple components have been studied only
to a limited extent. Here, we report the synthesis routes for Co- and Ni-struvites (NH4MPO4.6H2O,
M = Ni2+, Co2+ ), which allow for P, ammonia and metal co precipitation. By evaluating different reaction
parameters, the phase and stability of transition metal struvites, as well as their crystal morphologies,
and sizes could be optimized. Ni-struvite is stable in a wide reactant concentration range and at
different metal/phosphorus (M/P) ratios, whereas Co-struvite only forms at low M/P ratios. Detailed
investigations of the precipitation process using ex situ and in situ techniques provided insights
into the crystallization mechanisms/crystal engineering of these materials. M-struvites crystallize
via intermediate colloidal nanophases, which subsequently aggregate and condense to final crystals
after extended reaction times. However, the exact reaction kinetics of the formation of a final
crystalline product varies significantly depending on the metal cation involved in the precipitation
process: severaleconds (Mg) to minutes (Ni) to hours (Co). The achieved level of control over the
morphology and size, makes precipitation of metal struvites a promising method for direct metal
recovery and binding them in the form of valuable phosphate raw materials. Under this paradigm,
the crystals can be potentially upcycled as precursor powders for electrochemical applications,
which require transition metal phosphates (TMPs).

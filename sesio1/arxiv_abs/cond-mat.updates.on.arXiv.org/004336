In this work we study the spectral properties of the adjacency matrix of critical Erd\"os-R\'enyi
(ER) graphs, i.e. when the average degree is of order \log N. In a series of recent inspiring papers
Alt, Ducatez, and Knowles have rigorously shown that these systems exhibit a "semilocalized" phase
in the tails of the spectrum where the eigenvectors are exponentially localized on a sub-extensive
set of nodes with anomalously large degree. We propose two approximate analytical strategies to
analyze this regime based respectively on the simple "rules of thumb" for localization and ergodicity
and on an approximate treatment of the self-consistent cavity equation for the resolvent. Both
approaches suggest the existence of two different regimes: a fully Anderson localized phase at
the spectral edges, in which the eigenvectors are localized around a unique center, and an intermediate
partially delocalized but non-ergodic phase, where the eigenvectors spread over many resonant
localization centers. In this phase the exponential decay of the effective tunneling amplitudes
between the localization centers is counterbalanced by the large number of nodes towards which
tunneling can occur, and the system exhibits mini-bands in the local spectrum over which the Wigner-Dyson
statistics establishes. We complement these results by a detailed numerical study of the finite-size
scaling behavior of several observables that supports the theoretical predictions and allows
us to determine the critical properties of the two transitions. Critical ER graphs provide a pictorial
representation of the Hilbert space of a generic many-body Hamiltonian with short range interactions.
In particular we argue that their phase diagram can be mapped onto the out-of-equilibrium phase
diagram of the quantum random energy model.

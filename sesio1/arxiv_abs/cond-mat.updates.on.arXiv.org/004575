The study of nanoscale chiral magnetic order in polycrystalline materials with a strong Dzyaloshinkii-Moriya
interaction (DMI) is interesting for the observation of magnetic phenomena at grain boundaries
and interfaces. One such material is sputter-deposited B20 FeGe on Si, which has been actively investigated
as the basis for low-power, high-density magnetic memory technology in a scalable material platform.
Although conventional Lorentz electron microscopy provides the requisite spatial resolution
to probe chiral magnetic textures in single-crystal FeGe, probing the magnetism of sputtered B20
FeGe is more challenging because the sub-micron crystal grains add confounding contrast. We address
the challenge of disentangling magnetic and grain contrast by applying 4-dimensional Lorentz
scanning transmission electron microscopy using an electron microscope pixel array detector.
Supported by analytical and numerical models, we find that the most important parameter for imaging
magnetic materials with polycrystalline grains is the ability for the detector to sustain large
electron doses, where having a high-dynamic range detector becomes extremely important. Despite
the small grain size in sputtered B20 FeGe on Si, using this approach we are still able to observe helicity
switching of skyrmions and magnetic helices across two adjacent grains as they thread through neighboring
grains. We reproduce this effect using micromagnetic simulations by assuming that the grains have
distinct orientation and magnetic chirality and find that magnetic helicity couples to crystal
chirality. Our methodology for imaging magnetic textures is applicable to other thin-film magnets
used for spintronics and memory applications, where an understanding of how magnetic order is accommodated
in polycrystalline materials is important.

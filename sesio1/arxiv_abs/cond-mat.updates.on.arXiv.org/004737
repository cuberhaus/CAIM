In this paper we explore possible phases arising from doping neutral excitons into a Mott insulator
in the context of moir\'e bilayers. We consider two moir\'e layers coupled together only through
inter-layer repulsion and there is a U(2)$\times$ U(2) symmetry. The densities of the two layers
can be tuned to be $n_t=x,n_b=1-x$ with $n_t+n_b=1$. $x=0$ limit is a layer polarized Mott insulator
and small $x$ regime can be reached by doping inter-layer excitons at density $x$. Charge gap can
remain finite at small $x$, as is demonstrated experimentally in the WSe$_2$-hBN-WSe$_2$/WS$_2$
system. To capture the intertwinement of the spin and exciton degree of freedom, we propose a four-flavor
spin model. In addition to the obvious possibility of single exciton condensation phase, we also
identified more exotic physics with fractionalization: (I) We define spin gap $\Delta_t, \Delta_b$
for the two layers respectively. As long as the spin gap at either layer is finite, single exciton
condensation is impossible and we can only have paired exciton condensation. If both spin gaps are
finite, it can be a fractional exciton superfluid with paired exciton condensation coexisting
with $Z_2$ spin liquid. Numerical evidences for such a phase will be provided. (II) If the layer polarized
Mott insulator at $x=0$ is in a U(1) spin liquid with spinon Fermi surface, the natural phase at $x>0$
hosts neutral Fermi surface formed by fermionic excitons. There are metallic counter-flow transport
and also Friedel oscillations in layer polarization in this exotic phase. Our numerical simulation
in one dimension observes an analog of this neutral Fermi surface phase. (III) There could be a metal-insulator
transition (MIT) by tuning $x$ in the universality class of a bandwidth tuned MIT. We provide one
theory for such a continuous Mott transition and predicted a universal drag resistivity.

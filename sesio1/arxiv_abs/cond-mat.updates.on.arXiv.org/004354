Antiferromagnetic L1$_{0}$-type MnPt is a material with relatively simple crystal and magnetic
structure, recently attracting interest due to its high N{\'{e}}el temperature and wide usage
as a pinning layer in magnetic devices. While it is experimentally well characterized, the theoretical
understanding is much less developed, in part due to the challenging accuracy requirements dictated
by the small underlying energy scales that govern magnetic ordering in antiferromagnetic metals.
In this work, we use density functional theory, the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker formalism, and a Heisenberg
model to establish a comprehensive theoretical description of antiferromagnetic L1$_{0}$-type
MnPt, along with accuracy limits, by thoroughly comparing to available literature data. Our simulations
show that the contribution of the magnetic dipole interaction to the magnetocrystalline anisotropy
energy of $K_{1}$=1.07$\times 10^{6}$\,J/m$^3$ is comparable in magnitude to the spin-orbit
contribution. Using our result for the magnetic susceptibility of $5.25\times10^{-4}$, a lowest
magnon frequency of about 2.02\,THz is predicted, confirming THz spin dynamics in this material.
From our data for electron, phonon, and magnon dispersion we compute the individual contributions
to the total heat capacity and show that the dominant term at or above 2\,K arises from phonons. From
the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, we compute a N\'{e}el temperature of 990--1070 K. Finally,
we quantify the magnitude of the magneto-optical Kerr effect generated by applying an external
magnetic field. Our results provide insight into the underlying physics, which is critical for
a deep understanding of fundamental limits of the time scale of spin dynamics, stability of the magnetic
ordering, and the possibility of magneto-optical detection of collective spin motion.

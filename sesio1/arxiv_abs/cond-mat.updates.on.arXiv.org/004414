Magnetic nanoparticles offer unique potential for various technological, biomedical, or environmental
applications thanks to the size-, shape- and material-dependent tunability of their magnetic
properties. To optimize particles for a specific application, it is crucial to interrelate their
performance with their structural and magnetic properties. This review presents the advantages
of small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering techniques for achieving a detailed multiscale characterization
of magnetic nanoparticles and their ensembles in a mesoscopic size range from 1 to a few hundred nanometers
with nanometer resolution. Both X-rays and neutrons allow the ensemble-averaged determination
of structural properties, such as particle morphology or particle arrangement in multilayers
and 3D assemblies. Additionally, the magnetic scattering contributions enable retrieving the
internal magnetization profile of the nanoparticles as well as the inter-particle moment correlations
caused by interactions within dense assemblies. Most measurements are used to determine the time-averaged
ensemble properties, in addition advanced small-angle scattering techniques exist that allow
accessing particle and spin dynamics on various timescales. In this review, we focus on conventional
small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering (SAXS and SANS), X-ray and neutron reflectometry, gracing-incidence
SAXS and SANS, X-ray resonant magnetic scattering, and neutron spin-echo spectroscopy techniques.
For each technique, we provide a general overview, present the latest scientific results, and discuss
its strengths as well as sample requirements. Finally, we give our perspectives on how future small-angle
scattering experiments, especially in combination with micromagnetic simulations, could help
to optimize the performance of magnetic nanoparticles for specific applications.

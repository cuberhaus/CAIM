The quantum dynamics of fermionic or bosonic many-body systems following external excitation
can be successfully studied using two-time nonequilibrium Green's functions (NEGF) or single-time
reduced density matrix methods. Approximations are introduced via a proper choice of the many-particle
self-energy or decoupling of the BBGKY hierarchy. These approximations are based on Feynman's
diagram approaches or on cluster expansions into single-particle and correlation operators.
Here, we develop a different approach where, instead of equations of motion for the many-particle
NEGF (or density operators), single-time equations for the correlation functions of fluctuations
are analyzed. We present a derivation of the first two equations of the alternative hierarchy of
fluctuations and discuss possible decoupling approximations. In particular, we derive the polarization
approximation (PA) which is shown to be equivalent to the single-time version [following by applying
the generalized Kadanoff-Baym ansatz (GKBA)] of the nonequilibrium $GW$ approximation with exchange
effects of NEGF theory, for weak coupling. The main advantage of the quantum fluctuations approach
is that the standard ensemble average can be replaced by a semiclassical average over different
initial realizations, as was demonstrated before by Lacroix and co-workers [see e.g. D. Lacroix
et al., Phys. Rev. B, 2014, 90, 125112]. Here, we introduce the stochastic $GW$ (SGW) approximation
and the stochastic polarization approximation (SPA) which are demonstrated to be equivalent to
the single-time $GW$ approximation without and with exchange, respectively, in the weak coupling
limit. Our numerical tests confirm that our approach has the same favorable linear scaling with
the computation time as the recently developed G1-G2 scheme [Schluenzen et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.,
2020, 124, 076601].

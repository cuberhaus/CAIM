We study the impact of applying stochastic forcing to the Ghil-Sellers energy balance climate model
in the form of a fluctuating solar irradiance. Through numerical simulations, we explore the noise-induced
transitions between the competing warm and snowball climate states. We consider multiplicative
stochastic forcing driven by Gaussian and $\alpha$-stable L\'evy - $\alpha\in(0,2)$ - noise laws,
and examine the statistics of transition times and most probable transition paths. While the Gaussian
noise case - used here as a reference - has been extensively studied in a plethora of studies on metastable
systems, much less is known about the L\'evy case, both in terms of mathematical theory and heuristics,
especially in the case of high- and infinite-dimensional systems. In the weak noise limit, the expected
residence time in each metastable state scales in a fundamentally different way in the Gaussian
vs. L\'evy noise case with respect to the intensity of the noise. In the former case, the classical
Kramers-like exponential law is recovered. In the latter case, power laws are found, with the exponent
equal to $-\alpha$, in apparent agreement with rigorous results obtained for additive noise in
a related - yet different - reaction-diffusion equation as well as in simpler models. The transition
paths are studied in a projection of the state space and remarkable differences are observed between
the two different types of noise. The snowball-to-warm and the warm-to-snowball most probable
transition path cross at the single unstable edge state on the basin boundary. In the case of L\'evy
noise, the most probable transition paths in the two directions are wholly separated, as transitions
apparently take place via the closest basin boundary region to the outgoing attractor.

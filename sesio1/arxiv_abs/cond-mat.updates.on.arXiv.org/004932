In many situations bacteria move in complex environments, as for example in soils, oceans or the
human gut-track microbiome. In these natural environments, carrier fluids such as mucus or reproductive
fluids show complex structure associated with non-Newtonian rheology. Many fundamental questions
concerning the the ability to navigate in such environments remain unsolved due to the inherent
complexity of the natural surroundings. Recently, the interaction of swimming bacteria with nematic
liquid crystals has attracted lot of attention. In these structured fluids, the kinetics of bacterial
motion is constrained by the orientational molecular order of the liquid crystal (or director field)
and novel spatio-temporal patterns arise from this orientational constraint, as well as from the
interactions with topological defects. A question unaddressed so far is how bacteria are able to
change swimming direction in such an environment. In this work, we study the swimming mechanism
of a single bacterium, E. coli, constrained to move along the director field of a lyotropic chromonic
liquid crystal (LCLC) that is confined to a planar cell. In such an environment, the spontaneous
run and tumble motion of the bacterium gets frustrated: the elasticity of the liquid crystal prevents
flagella from unbundling. Interestingly, in order to change direction, bacteria execute a reversal
motion along the director field, driven by the relocation of a single flagellum to the other side
of the bacterial body, coined as a frustrated tumble. We present a detailed experimental characterization
of this phenomenon, exploiting exceptional spatial and temporal resolution of bacteria and flagella
dynamics during swimming, obtained using a two color Lagrangian tracking technique. We suggest
a possible mechanism behind the frustrated run and tumble motion, accounting for these observations.

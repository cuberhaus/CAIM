Most research aimed at measuring biomarkers on the skin is only concerned with sensing chemicals
in sweat using electrical signals, but these methods are not truly non-invasive nor non-intrusive
because they require substantial amounts of sweat to get a reading. This project aims to create a
truly non-invasive wearable sensor that continuously detects the gaseous acetone (a biomarker
related to metabolic disorders) that ambiently comes out of the skin. Composite films of polyaniline
and cellulose acetate, exhibiting chemo-mechanical actuation upon exposure to gaseous acetone,
were tested in the headspaces above multiple solutions containing acetone, ethanol, and water
to gauge response sensitivity, selectivity, and repeatability. The bending of the films in response
to exposures to these environments was tracked by an automatic video processing code, which was
found to out-perform an off-the-shelf deep neural network-based tracker. Using principal component
analysis, we showed that the film bending is low dimensional with over 90% of the shape changes being
captured with just two parameters. We constructed forward models to predict shape changes from
the known exposure history and found that a linear model can explain 40% of the observed variance
in film tip angle changes. We constructed inverse models, going from third order fits of shape changes
to acetone concentrations where about 45% of the acetone variation and about 30% of ethanol variation
are captured by linear models, and non-linear models did not perform substantially better. This
suggests there is sufficient sensitivity and inherent selectivity of the films. These models,
however, provide evidence for substantial hysteretic or long-time-scale responses of the PANI
films, seemingly due to the presence of water. Further experiments will allow more accurate discrimination
of unknown exposure environments.

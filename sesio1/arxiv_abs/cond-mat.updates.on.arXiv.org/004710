We investigate the ground state configurations of $p$-atic liquid crystals on fixed curved surfaces.
We focus on the intrinsic geometry and show that isothermal coordinates are particularly convenient
as they explicitly encode a geometric contribution to the elastic potential. In the special case
of a cone with half-angle $\beta$, the apex develops an effective topological charge of $-\chi$,
where $2\pi\chi = 2\pi(1-\sin\beta)$ is the deficit angle of the cone, and a topological defect
of charge $\sigma$ behaves as if it had an effective topological charge $Q_\mathrm{eff} = (\sigma
- \sigma^2/2)$ when interacting with the apex. The effective charge of the apex leads to defect absorption
and emission at the cone apex as the deficit angle of the cone is varied. For total topological defect
charge 1, e.g. imposed by tangential boundary conditions at the edge, we find that for a disk the ground
state configuration consists of $p$ defects each of charge $+1/p$ lying equally spaced on a concentric
ring of radius $d = (\frac{p-1}{3p-1})^{\frac{1}{2p}} R$, where $R$ is the radius of the disk. In
the case of a cone with tangential boundary conditions at the base, we find three types of ground state
configurations as a function of cone angle: (1) for sharp cones, all of the $+1/p$ defects are absorbed
by the apex; (2) at intermediate cone angles, some of the $+1/p$ defects are absorbed by the apex and
the rest lie equally spaced along a concentric ring on the flank; and (3) for nearly flat cones, all
of the $+1/p$ defects lie equally spaced along a concentric ring on the flank. Here the defect positions
and the absorption transitions depend intricately on $p$ and the deficit angle which we analytically
compute. We check these results with numerical simulations for a set of commensurate cone angles
and find excellent agreement.

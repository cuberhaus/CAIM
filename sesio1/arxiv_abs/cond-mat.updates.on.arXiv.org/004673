EuMnSb$_2$ is a candidate topological material which can be tuned towards a Weyl semimetal, but
there are differing reports for its antiferromagnetic (AFM) phases. The coupling of bands dominated
by pure Sb layers hosting topological fermions to Mn and Eu magnetic states provides a potential
path to tune the topological properties. We present a detailed analysis of the magnetic structure
on three AFM phases based on single-crystal neutron diffraction, magnetization, and heat capacity
data as well as polycrystalline $^{151}$Eu M\"ossbauer data. The Mn magnetic sublattice orders
into a C-type AFM structure below $323(1)$~K with the ordered Mn magnetic moment $\mu_{\text{Mn}}$
lying perpendicular to the layers. AFM ordering of the Eu sublattice occurs below $23(1)$~K with
the ordered Eu magnetic moment $\mu_{\text{Eu}}$ canted away from the layer normal and $\mu_{\text{Mn}}$
retaining its higher-temperature order. $\mu_{\text{Eu}}$ is ferromagnetically aligned within
each Eu layer but exhibits a complicated AFM layer stacking. Both of these higher-temperature phases
are described by magnetic space group (MSG) $Pn^{\prime}m^{\prime}a^{\prime}$ with the chemical
and magnetic unit cells having the same dimensions. Cooling below $=9(1)$~K reveals a third AFM
phase where $\mu_{\text{Mn}}$ remains unchanged but $\mu_{\text{Eu}}$ develops an additional
in-plane canting. This phase has MSG $P11\frac{2_1}{a^{\prime}}$. We additionally find evidence
of short-range magnetic correlations associated with the Eu between $12~\text{K} \lesssim T \lesssim
30~\text{K}$. Using the determined magnetic structures, we postulate the signs of nearest-neighbor
intralayer and interlayer exchange constants and the magnetic anisotropy within a general Heisenberg-model.
We then discuss implications of the various AFM states in EuMnSb$_2$ and its topological properties.

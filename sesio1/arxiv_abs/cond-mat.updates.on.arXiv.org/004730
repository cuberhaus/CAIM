We discuss results on the dynamics of thermalization for a model with Gaussian interactions between
two classical many-body systems trapped in external harmonic potentials. Previous work showed
an approximate, power-law scaling of the interaction energy with the number of particles, with
particular focus on the dependence of the anomalous exponent on the interaction strength. Here
we explore the role of the interaction range in determining anomalous exponents, showing that it
is a more relevant parameter to differentiate distinct regimes of responses of the system. More
specifically, on varying the interaction range from its largest values while keeping the interaction
strength constant, we observe a crossover from an integrable system, approximating the Caldeira-Leggett
interaction term in the long range limit, to an intermediate interaction range in which the system
manifests anomalous scaling, and finally to a regime of local interactions in which anomalous scaling
disappears. A Fourier analysis of the interaction energy shows that nonlinearities give rise to
an effective bath with a broad band of frequencies, even when starting with only two distinct trapping
frequencies, yielding efficient thermalization in the intermediate regime of interaction range.
We provide qualitative arguments, based on an analogous Fourier analysis of the standard map, supporting
the view that anomalous scaling and features of the Fourier spectrum may be used as proxies to identify
the role of chaotic dynamics. Our work, that encompasses models developed in different contexts
and unifies them in a common framework, may be relevant to the general understanding of the role of
nonlinearities in a variety of many-body classical systems, ranging from plasmas to trapped atoms
and ions.

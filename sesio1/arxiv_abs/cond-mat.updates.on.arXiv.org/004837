An outstanding challenge involves understanding the many-particle entanglement of liquid states
of quantum matter that arise in systems of interacting electrons. The Fermi liquid (FL) in $D$ spatial
dimensions shows a violation of the area-law in real-space entanglement entropy of a subsystem
(of length $L$), $S_{EE} \sim L^{D-1}\ln L$, widely believed to be a hallmark signature of the ground
state of a gapless quantum critical system of interacting fermions. In this work, we apply a $T=0$
renormalisation group approach to a prototype of the FL in momentum (or, $k$)-space, unveiling
thereby the RG relevant quantum fluctuations (due to forward and tangential scattering) from which
long-range entanglement arises. A similar analysis of non-Fermi liquids such as the 2D marginal
Fermi liquid (MFL) and the 1D Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) reveals a universal logarithmic
violation of the area-law in gapless electronic liquids for a subsystem defined within a $k$-space
window (of size $\Lambda$) proximate to the Fermi surface, with a proportionality constant that
depends on the nature of the underlying Fermi surface. We extend this analysis to the gapped quantum
liquids emergent from the destabilisation of the Fermi surface by quantum fluctuations arising
from backscattering processes. Indeed, we find that the $k$-space entanglement signatures of
gapped quantum liquids appear to be governed by the nature of the Fermi surface (e.g., nested or not)
from which they emerge, as well as the nature of their parent gapless metallic liquid (e.g., FL, MFL
etc.). This is confirmed by our finding an enhanced entanglement entropy for the nodal MFL present
at the quantum critical point recently discovered in the 2D Hubbard model at optimal hole-doping.
Our work thus paves the way for an entanglement based classification of quantum liquids emergent
from the criticality of interacting fermionic matter.

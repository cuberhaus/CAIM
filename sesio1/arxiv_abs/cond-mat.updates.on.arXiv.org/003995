The article formulates the basic principles of microscopic physics of a macroscopic ensemble of
interacting helium-4 atoms. The concept of a vortex field is introduced, which is caused by the motion
of the particles of the electron and nuclear subsystems of atoms of the macrosystem relative to each
other. It is assumed that helium-4 atoms "immersed" in the internal vortex field acquire the properties
of fermionic particles due to the atomic pseudospins s=1/2 generated by the vortex. On this basis,
a heuristic evolutionary model of helium-4 as an ensemble of atom-like quasiparticles with fermionic
properties is constructed. As the temperature decreases, bonds are formed between pseudofermionic
quasiparticles by pairing their pseudospins. The formation of a hierarchy of composite quasiparticles
on this basis leads to the transition of helium-4 atoms from the gas phase to the liquid state, then
to the state of incoherent Bose condensate, and finally to the state with a long-range order of atom-like
quasiparticles. The structural forms of composite quasiparticles in different phases, the mechanisms
of their formation, and the temperatures of these phase transitions ($T_{cr}=5.22K$, $T_0=4.14K$
and $T_\lambda=2.175K$, respectively) are determined. The ideas and calculations presented
in this paper form the basis for solving the problem of the temperature dependence of the heat capacity
of liquid helium-4 in both the helium-I and helium-II phases. The obtained solution has a logarithmic
dependence of the heat capacity on the reduced temperature (${|1-{T/T_\lambda}|}$) in the region
of the $\lambda$-point of the phase transition of helium-4 from a disordered to an ordered state.
The numerical calculations of the heat capacity in the vicinity of the temperature $T_\lambda$
are in very good agreement with the experimental data.

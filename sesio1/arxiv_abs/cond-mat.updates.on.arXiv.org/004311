The discovery of new topological electronic materials brings a chance to uncover novel physics
and plays a key role in observing and controlling various intriguing phenomena. Up to now, many materials
have been theoretically proposed and experimentally proved to host different kinds of topological
states. Unfortunately, there is little convincing experimental evidence for the existence of
topological oxides. The reason is that oxidation of oxygen leads to ionic crystal in general and
makes band inversion unlikely. In addition, the realization of different topological states in
a single material is quite difficult, but strongly needed for exploring topological phase transitions.
In this work, using first-principles calculations and symmetry analysis, we propose that the experimentally
tunable continuous solid solution of oxygen in pyrochlore Tl$_2$Nb$_2$O$_{6+x}$ ($ 0\leq x \leq
1.0$) leads to various topological states. Topological insulator, Dirac semimetal and triply
degenerate nodal point semimetal can be realized in it via changing the oxygen content and/or tuning
the crystalline symmetries. When $x = 1$, it is a semimetal with quadratic band touching point at
Fermi level. It transits into a Dirac semimetal or a topological insulator depending on the in-plane
strain. When $x = 0.5$, the inversion symmetry is spontaneously broken in Tl$_2$Nb$_2$O$_{6.5}$,
leading to triply degenerate nodal points. When $x = 0$, Tl$_2$Nb$_2$O$_6$ becomes a trivial insulator
with a narrow band gap. These topological phase transitions driven by solid solution of oxygen are
unique and physically plausible due to the variation of valence state of $Tl^{1+}$ and $Tl^{3+}$.
This topological oxide will be promising for studying correlation induced topological states
and potential applications.

We propose quantum algorithms for projective ground-state preparation and calculations of the
many-body Green's functions directly in frequency domain. The algorithms are based on the linear
combination of unitary (LCU) operations and essentially only use quantum resources. To prepare
the ground state, we construct the operator ${\exp}(-\tau \hat{H}^2)$ using Hubbard-Stratonovich
transformation by LCU and apply it on an easy-to-prepare initial state. Our projective state preparation
procedure saturates the near-optimal scaling, $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\gamma\Delta} \log \frac{1}{\gamma\eta})$,
of other currently known algorithms, in terms of the spectral-gap lower bound $\Delta$, the additive
error $\eta$ in the state vector, and the overlap lower bound $\gamma$ between the initial state
and the exact ground state. It is straightforward to combine our algorithm with spectral-gap amplification
technique to achieve quadratically improved scaling $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{\Delta})$ for ground-state
preparation of frustration-free Hamiltonians, which we demonstrate with numerical results of
the $q$-deformed XXZ chain. To compute the Green's functions, including the single-particle and
other response functions, we act on the prepared ground state with the retarded resolvent operator
$R(\omega + i\Gamma; \hat{H})$ in the LCU form derived from the Fourier-Laplace integral transform
(FIT). Our resolvent algorithm has $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\Gamma^2} \log\frac{1}{\Gamma\epsilon})$
complexity scaling for the frequency resolution $\Gamma$ of the response functions and the targeted
error $\epsilon$, while classical algorithms for FIT usually have polynomial scaling over the
error $\epsilon$. To illustrate the complexity scaling of our algorithms, we provide numerical
results for their application to the paradigmatic Fermi-Hubbard model on a one-dimensional lattice
with different numbers of sites.

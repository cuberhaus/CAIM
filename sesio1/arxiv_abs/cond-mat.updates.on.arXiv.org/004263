The BTW sandpile model of cascading dynamics forms a cornerstone for our understanding of failures
in systems ranging from avalanches and forest fires to power grids and brain networks. The latter
two are examples of oscillator networks, yet the BTW model does not account for this. Here we establish
that the interplay between the oscillatory and sandpile dynamics can lead to emergent new behaviors
by considering the BTW sandpile model on a network of Kuramoto oscillators. Inspired by high-level
objectives in the power grids, we aim to leverage this interaction to maximize synchronization,
maximize load, and minimize large cascades. We assume that the more out-of-sync a node is with its
neighbors, the more vulnerable it is to failure so that a node's capacity is a function of its local
level of synchronization. And when a node topples, its phase is reset at random. This leads to a novel
long-time oscillatory behavior at an emergent timescale. The bulk of an oscillatory cycle is spent
in a build-up phase where oscillators are fully synchronized, and cascades are largely avoided
while the overall load in the system increases. Then the system reaches a tipping point where, in
contrast to the BTW model, a large cascade triggers an even larger cascade, leading to a "cascade
of cascades," which can be classified as a Dragon King event, after which the system has a short transient
dynamic that restores full synchrony. This coupling between capacity and synchronization gives
rise to endogenous cascade seeds in addition to exogenous ones, and we show their respective roles
in the Dragon King events. We establish the phenomena from numerical studies and develop the accompanying
mean-field theory to locate the tipping point, calculate the amount of load in the system, determine
the frequency of the emergent long-time oscillations and find the distribution of cascade sizes
during the build-up phase.

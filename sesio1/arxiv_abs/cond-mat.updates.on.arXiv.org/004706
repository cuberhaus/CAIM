The bottleneck in state-of-the-art thermoelectric power generation and cooling is the low performance
of thermoelectric materials. While the adverse effects of lattice phonons on performance can be
mitigated, the main difficulty remains to obtain a large thermoelectric power factor as the Seebeck
coefficient and the electrical conductivity cannot be increased independently. Here, relating
the thermoelastic properties of the electron gas that performs the thermoelectric energy conversion,
to its transport properties, we analyze theoretically whether an electronic phase transition
can enhance thermoelectric conversion and at what cost. More precisely, we consider the metal-to-superconductor
phase transition in a model two-dimensional system, and we seek to quantify the contribution of
the 2D fluctuating Cooper pairs to the power factor in the close vicinity of the critical temperature
$T_{\rm c}$. In addition, we provide experimental evidence of the rapid increase of the Seebeck
coefficient without decreasing the electrical conductivity near $T_{\rm c}$ in a 100-nm Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$As$_2$
thin film with high structural quality resulting in a power factor enhancement of approximately
300. This level of performance cannot be achieved in a system with low structural quality as shown
experimentally with our sample degraded by ion bombardment as defects preclude the strong enhancement
of the Seebeck coefficient near the phase transition. Finally, we theoretically discuss the ideal
thermoelectric conversion efficiency (i.e. disregarding adverse phonon effects) and show that
driving the electronic system to the vicinity of a phase transition may be an innovative path towards
a strong performance increase but at the cost of a narrow temperature range of use of such materials.

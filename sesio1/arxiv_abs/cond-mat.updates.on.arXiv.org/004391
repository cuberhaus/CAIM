A heterostructure consisting of a topological insulator (TI) nanowire brought into proximity
with a superconducting layer provides a promising route to achieve topological superconductivity
and associated Majorana bound states (MBSs). Here, we study effects caused by such a coupling between
a thin layer of an $s$-wave superconductor and a TI nanowire. We show that there is a distinct phenomenology
arising from the metallization of states in the TI nanowire by the superconductor. In the strong
coupling limit, required to induce a large superconducting pairing potential, we find that metallization
results in a shift of the TI nanowire subbands ($\sim 20$ meV) as well as it leads to a small reduction
in the size of the subband gap opened by a magnetic field applied parallel to the nanowire axis. Surprisingly,
we find that metallization effects in TI nanowires can also be beneficial. Most notably, coupling
to the superconductor induces a potential in the portion of the TI nanowire close to the interface
with the superconductor, this breaks inversion symmetry and at finite momentum lifts the spin degeneracy
of states within a subband. As such coupling to a superconductor can create or enhance the subband
splitting that is key to achieving topological superconductivity. This is in stark contrast to
semiconductors, where it has been shown that metallization effects always reduce the equivalent
subband-splitting caused by spin-orbit coupling. We also find that in certain geometries metallization
effects can reduce the critical magnetic required to enter the topological phase. We conclude that,
unlike in semiconductors, the metallization effects that occur in TI nanowires can be relatively
easily mitigated, for instance by modifying the geometry of the attached superconductor or by compensation
of the TI material.

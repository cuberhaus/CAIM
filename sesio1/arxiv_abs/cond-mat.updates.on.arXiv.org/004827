Plastic nanoparticles present technological opportunities and environmental concerns, but
measurement challenges impede product development and hazard assessment. To meet these challenges,
we advance a lateral nanoflow assay that integrates complex nanofluidic replicas, optical localization
microscopy, and novel statistical analyses. We apply our sample-in-answer-out system to measure
polystyrene nanoparticles that sorb and carry hydrophobic fluorophores. An elegant scaling of
surface forces automates advection and dominates diffusion to drive the analytical separation
of colloidal nanoparticles by their steric diameters. Reference nanoparticles, with a mean of
99 nm and a standard deviation of 8.4 nm, test the unknown limits of silicone replicas to function
as separation matrices. New calibrations correct aberrations from microscope and device, improving
the accuracy of reducing single micrographs to joint histograms of steric diameter and fluorescence
intensity. A dimensional model approaches the information limit of the system to discriminate
size exclusion from surface adsorption, yielding errors of the mean ranging from 0.2 nm to 2.3 nm
and errors of the standard deviation ranging from 2.2 nm to 4.2 nm. A hierarchical model accounts
for metrological, optical, and dimensional variability to reveal a fundamental structure-property
relationship. Intensity scales with diameter to the power of 3.6 +/- 0.5 at 95 % coverage, confounding
basic concepts of surface adsorption or volume absorption. Distributions of fluorescivity - the
product of the number density, absorption cross section, and quantum yield of an ensemble of fluorophores
- are ultrabroad and asymmetric, limiting any inference from fluorescence intensity. This surprising
characterization of common nanoplastics resets expectations for optimizing products, applying
standards, and understanding byproducts.

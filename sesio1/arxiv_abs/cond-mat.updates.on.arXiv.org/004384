In this paper we analyze the relaxation to steady-state of intracellular diffusion in a pair of cells
with gap-junction coupling. Gap junctions are prevalent in most animal organs and tissues, providing
a direct diffusion pathway for both electrical and chemical communication between cells. Most
analytical models of gap junctions focus on the steady-state diffusive flux and the associated
effective diffusivity. Here we investigate the relaxation to steady state in terms of the so-called
local accumulation time. The latter is commonly used to estimate the time to form a protein concentration
gradient during morphogenesis. The basic idea is to treat the fractional deviation from the steady-state
concentration as a cumulative distribution for the local accumulation time. One of the useful features
of the local accumulation time is that it takes into account the fact that different spatial regions
can relax at different rates. We consider both static and dynamic gap junction models. The former
treats the gap junction as a resistive channel with effective permeability $\mu$, whereas the latter
represents the gap junction as a stochastic gate that randomly switches between an open and closed
state. The local accumulation time is calculated by solving the diffusion equation in Laplace space
and then taking the small-$s$ limit. We show that the accumulation time is a monotonically increasing
function of spatial position, with a jump discontinuity at the gap junction. This discontinuity
vanishes in the limit $\mu \rightarrow \infty$ for a static junction and $\beta \rightarrow 0$ for
a stochastically-gated junction, where $\beta$ is the rate at which the gate closes. Finally, our
results are generalized to the case of a linear array of cells with nearest neighbor gap junction
coupling.

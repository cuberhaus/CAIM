Pyrite, also known as fool's gold is the thermodynamic stable polymorph of FeS$_2$. It is widely
considered as a promising d-band semiconductor for various applications due to its intriguing
physical properties. Marcasite is the other naturally occurring polymorph of FeS$_2$. Measurements
on natural crystals have shown that it has similarly promising electronic, mechanical, and optical
properties as pyrite. However, it has been only scarcely investigated so far, because the laboratory-based
synthesis of phase-pure samples or high-quality marcasite single crystal has been a challenge
until now. Here, we report the targeted phase formation via hydrothermal synthesis of marcasite
and pyrite. The formation condition and phase purity of the FeS$_2$ polymorphs are systematically
studied in the form of a comprehensive synthesis map. We, furthermore, report on a detailed analysis
of marcasite single crystal growth by a space-separated hydrothermal synthesis. We observe that
single phase product of marcasite forms only on the surface under the involvement of H$_2$S and sulphur
vapor. The availability of high-quality crystals of marcasite allows us to measure the fundamental
physical properties, including an allowed direct optical bandgap of 0.76 eV, temperature independent
diamagnetism, an electronic transport gap of 0.11 eV, and a room-temperature carrier concentration
of 4.14 $\times$ 10$^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$. X-ray absorption/emission spectroscopy are employed to
measure the band gap of the two FeS$_2$ phases. We find marcasite has a band gap of 0.73 eV, while pyrite
has a band gap of 0.87 eV. Our results indicate that marcasite -- that is now synthetically available
in a straightforward fashion -- is as equally promising as pyrite as candidate for various semiconductor
applications based on earth abundant elements.

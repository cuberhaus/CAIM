Void swelling can develop in materials under persistent irradiation when non-equilibrium vacancy
and self-interstitial populations migrate under sufficiently asymmetric interaction biases.
In conventional metals, the propensity is determined to first approximation by comparing point-defect
relaxation strains. We thus present DFT-based calculations of structures and formation energies
and volumes of point defects in the $\alpha$ and the $\delta$-phases of plutonium. Our results show
that lattice defects in $\delta$-Pu, in contrast to most fcc metals, have surprisingly small formation
volumes. Equally unexpected are the large defect formation volumes found in the low-symmetry $\alpha$-Pu
phase. Both these unusual properties can be satisfactorily explained from defect-induced spin/orbital
moment formation and destruction in the Pu phases. When we use the calculated defect properties
to estimate the classic void swelling bias in each of the phases, we find it to be unusually small in
$\delta$-Pu, but likely much larger in $\alpha$-Pu. Hence, swelling rates and mechanisms can diverge
dramatically between the different phases of Pu. Especially in the transient regime before formation
of large defect clusters, the swelling rate of $\alpha$-Pu can reliably be expected to be much larger
than $\delta$-Pu. However, accurate forecasts over longer times will require the conventional
void-swelling theory to be modified to handle the complexities presented by the different Pu phases.
As a case in point, we show possible anomalous temperature dependence of vacancy properties in $\delta$-Pu,
caused by entropic contributions from defect-induced spin-lattice fluctuations. Such complications
may affect defect-defect interactions and thus alter the void swelling bias.

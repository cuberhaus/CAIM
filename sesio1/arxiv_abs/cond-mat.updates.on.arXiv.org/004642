Semi-transparent Solar Cells (ST-SCs) has emerged as one of the most prominent energy harvesting
technology that combines the benefits of light transparency and light-to-electricity conversion.
The biggest opportunities for such technologies lie in their integration as windows and skylights
within energy-sustainable buildings or combining them with other solar cell technologies in tandem
configuration. The performance of ST-SCs is mainly determined by the trade-off between the competing
parameters of the capability to convert the incident light into electricity while allowing some
parts to transmit providing transparency through the device. Depending on the target application,
the selection of ST-SCs is a tricky affair as some devices might offer high efficiency but compromises
transparency and vice-versa. On the other way around, this is again not helped by the fact that due
to advancements in materials engineering, processing, and characterization, a vastly different
combination of efficiency and transparency has been reported by research groups. So, in order to
quantify the performance of ST-SCs, we proposed, a figure-of-merit (FoM) which can be used as a tool
that can help in analysing and comparing the performance among various ST-SCs. The defined FoM focuses
on the power conversion efficiency of the device, bifaciality factor, transmittance in the desired
region, and that corresponding to 550 nm wavelength. Additionally, in this work, we have been shown
how the proposed FoM can be correlated for tandem and building-integrated photovoltaics applications.
Based on these resultant parameters, FoM is calculated and compared for different device architectures
available in the literature. The proposed FoM shall serve as a meaningful guiding path to the researchers
for the development of advanced ST-SCs.

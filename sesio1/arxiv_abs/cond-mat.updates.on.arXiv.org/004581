The functional characteristics of double perovskites with unique ferromagnetic-insulator ground
state have been controversial due to the unavoidable presence of anti-site disorders (ASDs). Here,
we aim to investigate the origin of magnetic ordering on local and global scales in Sm$_{2}$NiMnO$_{6}$
(SNMO) double perovskite system. Different calcination routes are exploited to generate different
cation arrangements in SNMO and the corresponding magnetic configurations are examined using
the high energy (E $ \sim $0.3 eV) `hot neutrons', which has helped to overcome Sm absorption as well
as to record total (Bragg's+diffuse) scattering profiles with high momentum transfer (Q$ _{max}
\sim $24 angstrom$ ^{-1} $). We have observed that the Ni-Mn sublattice adopts long range collinear
ferromagnetic $ F_{x}F_{z} $ structure with commensurate $k$=(0, 0, 0) propagation vector, below
ordering temperature T $ \lesssim $ 160 K, irrespective of variable ASD concentrations. In addition,
the signatures indicating the antiparallel polarization of Sm paramagnetic moments with respect
to Ni-Mn network, are noticed in the vicinity of anomalous magnetic transitions at T $ \lesssim $
35 K. The real space pair distribution function calculations have provided a direct visualization
of ASDs by means of broadening in Ni/Mn-Mn/Ni linkage. Employing the Reverse Monte Carlo approach
on diffuse magnetic scattering profiles, we have observed the negative spin-spin correlation
function which suggests the Ni-Ni antiferromagnetic exchange interactions ranging up to first
nearest neighbor distance. These results confirm that the existence of ASDs in cation ordered host
matrix leads to competing ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic phases in a broad temperature range,
which quantitatively governs the temperature dependent bulk magnetic observables of SNMO system.

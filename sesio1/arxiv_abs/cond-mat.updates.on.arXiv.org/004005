We study the kinetics of crystallization in deeply supercooled liquid silicon employing computer
simulations and the Stillinger-Weber three body potential. The free energy barriers to crystallisation
are computed using umbrella sampling Monte Carlo simulations, and for selected low temperature
and zero pressure state points, using unconstrained molecular dynamics simulations to reconstruct
the free energy from a mean first passage time formulation. We focus on state points that have been
described in earlier work [Sastry and Angell, Nature Mater., 2, 739, 2003] as straddling a first
order liquid-liquid phase transition (LLPT) between two metastable liquid states. It was argued
subsequently [Ricci et al., Mol. Phys., 117, 3254, 2019] that the apparent phase transition is in
fact due the loss of metastability of the liquid state with respect to the globally stable crystalline
state. The presence or absence of a barrier to crystallization for these state points is therefore
of importance to ascertain, with due attention to ambiguities that may arise from the choice of order
parameters. We discuss our choice of order parameters and also our choice of methods to calculate
the free energy at deep supercooling. We find a well-defined free energy barrier to crystallisation
and demonstrate that both umbrella sampling and mean first passage time methods yield results that
agree quantitatively. Our results thus provide strong evidence against the possibility that the
liquids at state points close to the reported LLPT exhibit slow, spontaneous crystallisation,
but they do not address the existence of a LLPT (or lack thereof). We also compute the free energy barriers
to crystallisation at other state points over a broad range of temperatures and pressures, and discuss
the effect of changes in the microscopic structure of the metastable liquid on the free energy barrier
heights.

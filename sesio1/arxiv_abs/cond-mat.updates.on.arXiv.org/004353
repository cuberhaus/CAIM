We study the magnetic field induced Hofstadter butterfly in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) in various
kinds of situations. First, we study the equilibrium case and identify the interlayer hopping processes
that are most crucial for the appearance of a Hofstadter butterfly. Surprisingly, the hopping processes
that are important for the appearance of the Hofstadter butterfly can be categorized as AA stacking
type - that is interlayer hoppings between equivalent sublattices. This is in contrast to AB/BA-type
hoppings that are important for the appearance of flat bands in magic angle TBG and were discussed
in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 122, 106405 (2019)]. We also find that if AB-type interlayer-hopping processes
are turned off the resulting model is chiral but differs from the model discussed in \cite{Tarnopolsky}.
Therefore, TBG has two separate chiral limits - one of them is important to understand the formation
of flat bands and the other for the Hofstadter butterfly. Taking this as motivation we discuss how
the role of AA-type hoppings in combination with lattice relaxation effects can make individual
Landau levels slightly harder to resolve in an experimental setting than one would expect from a
non-relaxed lattice setting. Finally, we consider the impact of different forms of light on the
fractal structure of the butterfly. Particularly, we study the impact of circularly polarized
light and longitudinal light originating from a waveguide. As the system is exposed to circularly
polarized light we find butterflies with increasingly pronounced asymmetry with respect to energy
$E=0$. This is due to the introduction of a gap term that breaks the chiral symmetries for both of the
two chiral limits mentioned above. Lastly, we study the effect of longitudinal light that can be
produced at the exit of a waveguide. Here, we find that no additional terms that break chiral symmetry
are introduced ...

The effects of post-synthesis annealing temperature on arc-melted samples of Fe$_{3}$Ga$_{4}$
has been studied to investigate changes in crystallographic and magnetic properties induced by
annealing. Results show a significant trend in the evolution of the (incommensurate spin density
wave) ISDW-FM (ferromagnetic) transition temperature as a function of the refined unit cell volume
in annealed samples. Strikingly, this trend allowed for the tuning of the transition temperature
down to room-temperature (300 K) whilst maintaining a sharp transition in temperature, opening
the door to the use of Fe$_{3}$Ga$_{4}$ in functional devices. Crystallographic analysis through
Rietveld refinement of high-resolution x-ray diffraction data has showed that arc-melted stoichiometric
Fe$_{3}$Ga$_{4}$ is multi-phase regardless of annealing temperature with a minor phase of FeGa$_{3}$
decreasing in phase fraction at higher annealing temperature. In order to validate the trend in
ISDW-FM transition temperature with regard to unit cell volume, high pressure magnetometry was
performed. This showed that the FM-ISDW ($\sim$ 68 K) and ISDW-FM ($\sim$ 360 K) transition temperatures
could be tuned, increased and decreased respectively, linearly with external pressure. Thus,
external pressure and the ensuing crystallographic changes minimize the temperature range of
the stability of the ISDW pointing toward the importance of structural properties on the mechanism
for the formation of the intermediate ISDW phase. These results show how this model system can be
tuned as well as highlighting the need for future high-pressure crystallography and related single
crystal measurements to understand the mechanism and nature of the intermediate ISDW phase to be
exploited in future devices.

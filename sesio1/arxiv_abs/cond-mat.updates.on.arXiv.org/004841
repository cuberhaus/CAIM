Battery interfaces help govern rate capability, safety/stability, cycle life, and self-discharge,
but significant gaps remain in our understanding at atomic length scales that can be exploited to
improve interfacial properties. In particular, Li partially plated on copper current collectors,
relevant to the anodeless, lithium metal cell which is a holy grail of high density energy battery
research, has recently been reported to undergo galvanic corrosion and exhibit short shelf lives.
We apply large scale Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
to examine the reaction between the electrolyte and Li|Cu junctions coated with thin, uniform electrolyte
interphase (SEI) passivating films at two applied voltages. These novel DFT galvanic corrosion
simulations show that electrolyte degradation preferentially occurs on Li-plated regions and
should lead to thicker SEI films. Our simulations reveal similarities but also fundamental differences
between traditional metal localized pitting and Li-corrosion mechanisms. Furthermore, using
the recently proposed, highly reactive lithium hydride (LiH) component SEI as example, we distinguish
between electrochemical and chemical degradation pathways which are partially responsible for
self-discharge, with the chemical pathway found to exhibit slow kinetics. We also predict that
electric fields should in general exist across natural SEI components like LiH, and across artificial
SEI films like LiI and LiAlO(2) often applied to improve battery cycling. Underlying and unifying
these predictions is a framework of DFT voltage/overpotential definitions which we have derived
from electrochemistry disciplines like structural metal corrosion studies; our analysis can
only be made using the correct electronic voltage definitions.

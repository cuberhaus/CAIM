In this present study, the pseudopotential plane-wave (PP-PW) pathway in the scheme of density
functional theory (DFT) is utilized to investigate the various physical properties on (Ba0.82K0.18)(Bi0.53Pb0.47)O3
(BKBPO) single perovskite superconductor. We have analyzed elastic constants and moduli at zero
and elevated pressures (up to 25 GPa) as well. We also have investigated the anisotropic nature incorporating
both the theoretical indices and graphical representations in 2D and 3D dimensions, which reveals
a high level of anisotropy. The flatness of the energy bands near EF is a sign of Van-Hf singularity
that might increase the electron pairing and origination of high-TC superconductivity. The computed
band structure exhibits its metallic characteristics is confirmed by band overlapping. A band
of DOS is formed for the strong hybridization of the constituent elements. The orbital electrons
of O-2p contribute most dominantly at EF in contrast to all orbital electrons. The orbital electrons
at the EF are higher from both the partial density of states and charge density mapping investigation.
The coexistence of the electron and hole-like Fermi sheets exhibits the multi-band nature of BKBPO.
On the other hand, Fermi surfaces with flat faces promote transport features and Fermi surface nesting
as well. The calculated value of the electron-phonon coupling constant ({\lambda} = 1.46) is slightly
lower than the isostructural superconductor, which indicates that the studied BKBPO can be treated
as a strongly coupled superconductor similar to the reported isostructural perovskite superconductors.
Furthermore, the thermodynamic properties have been evaluated and analyzed at elevated temperature
and pressure by using harmonic Debye approximation (QHDA).

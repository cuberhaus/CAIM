Being able to combine different materials allows taking advantage of different properties and
device engineering that cannot be found or exploited within a single material system. In quantum
nano-photonics, one might want to increase the device functionalities by, for instance, combining
efficient classical and quantum light emission available in III-V semiconductors, low-loss light
propagation accessible in silicon-based materials, fast electro-optical properties of lithium
niobate and broadband reflectors and/or buried metallic contacts for local electric field application
or electrical injection of emitters. We propose a transfer printing technique based on the removal
of arrays of free-standing membranes and their deposition onto a host material using a thermal release
adhesive tape-assisted process. This approach is versatile, in that it poses limited restrictions
on the transferred and host materials. In particular, we transfer 190 nm-thick GaAs membranes,
with dimensions up to about 260$\mu$m x 80$\mu$m, containing InAs quantum dots, onto a gold substrate.
We show that the presence of a back reflector combined with the etching of micro-pillars significantly
increases the extraction efficiency of quantum light, reaching photon fluxes, from a single quantum
dot line, exceeding 8 x 10$^5$ photons per second, which is four times higher than the highest count
rates measured, on the same chip, from emitters outside the pillars. Given the versatility and the
ease of the process, this technique opens the path to the realisation of hybrid quantum and nano-photonic
devices that can combine virtually any material that can be undercut to realise free-standing membranes
that are then transferred onto any host substrate, without specific compatibility issues and/or
requirements.

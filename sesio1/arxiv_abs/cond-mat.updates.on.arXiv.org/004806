The Anderson model for a magnetic impurity in a one-dimensional quasicrystal is studied using the
numerical renormalization group (NRG). The main focus is elucidating the physics at the critical
point of the Aubry-Andre (AA) Hamiltonian, which exhibits a fractal spectrum with multifractal
wave functions, leading to an AA Anderson (AAA) impurity model with an energy-dependent hybridization
function defined through the multifractal local density of states at the impurity site. We first
study a class of Anderson impurity models with uniform fractal hybridization functions that the
NRG can solve to arbitrarily low temperatures. Below a Kondo scale $T_K$, these models approach
a fractal strong-coupling fixed point where impurity thermodynamic properties oscillate with
$\log_b T$ about negative average values determined by the fractal dimension of the spectrum. The
fractal dimension also enters into a power-law dependence of $T_K$ on the Kondo exchange coupling
$J_K$. To treat the AAA model, we combine the NRG with the kernel polynomial method (KPM) to form an
efficient approach that can treat hosts without translational symmetry down to a temperature scale
set by the KPM expansion order. The aforementioned fractal strong-coupling fixed point is reached
by the critical AAA model in a simplified treatment that neglects the wave-function contribution
to the hybridization. The temperature-averaged properties are those expected for the numerically
determined fractal dimension of $0.5$. At the AA critical point, impurity thermodynamic properties
become negative and oscillatory. Under sample-averaging, the mean and median Kondo temperatures
exhibit power-law dependences on $J_K$ with exponents characteristic of different fractal dimensions.
We attribute these signatures to the impurity probing a distribution of fractal strong-coupling
fixed points with decreasing temperature.

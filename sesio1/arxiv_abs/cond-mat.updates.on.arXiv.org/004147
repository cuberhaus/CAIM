GaN based high electron mobility transistors show promise in numerous device applications which
elicits the need for accurate models of bulk, surface, and interface electronic properties. We
detail here a hybrid density functional theory study of zinc blende (zb) GaN and diamond bulk and
surface properties, and zb GaN on diamond interfaces using slab supercell models. Details are provided
on the dependence of electronic properties with respect to supercell size, the use of pseudo-hydrogen
to passivate the bottom GaN layer, and dipole corrections. The large bulk modulus of diamond provides
a templating structure for GaN to grow upon, where a large lattice mismatch is accounted for through
the inclusion of a cationic Ga adlayer. Looking at both type I and II surfaces and interfaces of GaN
shows the instability of zb GaN without an adlayer (type II), where increased size, pseudo-hydrogen
passivation and dipole corrections do not remove the spurious interaction between the top and bottom
layers in type II GaN. Layer dependent density of states, local potential differences, and charge
density differences show that the type I interface (with a Ga adlayer) is stable with an adhesion
energy of 0.704 eV/{\AA}2 (4.346 J/m2); interestingly, the diamond charge density intercalates
into the first layer of GaN, which was seen experimentally for wurtzite GaN grown over diamond. The
type II interface is shown to be unstable which implies that, to form a stable, thin-film zb interface
between GaN and diamond, the partial pressure of trimethylgallium must be controlled to ensure
a Ga layer exists both on the top and bottom layer of the GaN thin film atop the diamond. We believe our
results can shed light towards a better understanding of the GaN/diamond multifaceted interface
present in the GaN overgrowth on diamond samples.

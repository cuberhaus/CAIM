Symmetry fractionalization (SF) on topological excitations is one of the most remarkable quantum
phenomena in topological orders with symmetry, i.e., symmetry-enriched topological phases.
While much progress has been theoretically and experimentally made in two dimensions (2D), the
understanding on symmetry fractionalization in 3D is far from complete. A long-standing challenge
is to understand SF on looplike topological excitations which are spatially extended objects.
In this work, we construct a powerful topological-field-theoretical framework approach for 3D
topological orders, which leads to a systematic characterization and classification of SF. For
systems with Abelian gauge groups and Abelian symmetry groups, we successfully establish equivalence
classes that lead to a finite number of patterns of SF, although there are notoriously infinite number
of Lagrangian-descriptions of the system. Based on this, we compute topologically distinct types
of fractional symmetry charges carried by particles. Then, for each type, we compute topologically
distinct statistical phases of braiding processes among loop excitations and external symmetry
fluxes. As a result, we are able to unambiguously list all physical observables for each SF pattern.
Many examples are concretely calculated. As an example, we find that the symmetry fractionalization
in an untwisted $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry
is classified by $ (\mathbb{Z}_2)^6\oplus (\mathbb{Z}_2)^2\oplus (\mathbb{Z}_2)^2\oplus
(\mathbb{Z}_2)^2$. If the topological order is twisted, the classification reduces to $(\mathbb{Z}_2)^6$
in which particle excitations always carry integer charge. Inspired by the present field-theoretical
framework, we also present some preliminary observations on pure algebraic theory of 3D SF.

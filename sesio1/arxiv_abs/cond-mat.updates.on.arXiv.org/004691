Orthoferrites ($RE$FeO$_{3}$) containing rare-earth ($RE$) elements are 3D antiferromagnets
(AFM) that exhibit characteristic weak ferromagnetism originating due to slight canting of the
spin moments and display a rich variety of spin reorientation transitions in the magnetic field
($H$)-temperature ($T$) parameter space. We present spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) studies
on a $b$-plate ($ac$-plane) of crystalline Ho$_{0.5}$Dy$_{0.5}$FeO$_{3}|$Pt (HDFO$|$Pt) hybrid
at various $T$ in the range, 11 to 300 K. In the room temperature $\Gamma_4(G_x, A_y, F_z)$ phase,
the switching between two degenerate domains, $\Gamma_4(+G_x, +F_z)$ and $\Gamma_4(-G_x, -F_z)$
occurs at fields above a critical value, $H_{\text{c}} \approx 713$ Oe. Under $H > H_{\text{c}}$,
the angular dependence of SMR ($\alpha$-scan) in the $\Gamma_4(G_x, A_y, F_z)$ phase yielded a
highly skewed curve with a sharp change (sign-reversal) along with a rotational hysteresis around
$a$-axis. This hysteresis decreases with an increase in $H$. Notably, at $H < H_{\text{c}} $, the
$\alpha$-scan measurements on the single domain, $\Gamma_4(\pm G_x, \pm F_z)$ exhibited an anomalous
sinusoidal signal of periodicity 360 deg. Low-$T$ SMR curves ($H$ = 2.4 kOe), showed a systematic
narrowing of the hysteresis (down to 150 K) and a gradual reduction in the skewness (150 to 52 K), suggesting
weakening of the anisotropy possibly due to the $T$-evolution of Fe-$RE$ exchange coupling. Below
25 K, the SMR modulation showed an abrupt change around the $c$-axis, marking the presence of $\Gamma_2(F_x,C_y,G_z)$
phase. We have employed a simple Hamiltonian and computed SMR to examine the observed skewed SMR
modulation. In summary, SMR is found to be an effective tool to probe magnetic anisotropy as well
as a spin reorientation in HDFO. Our spin-transport study highlights the potential of HDFO for future
AFM spintronic devices.

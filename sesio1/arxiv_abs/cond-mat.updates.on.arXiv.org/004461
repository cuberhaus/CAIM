We study delta-T noise -- excess charge noise at zero voltage but finite temperature bias -- for weak
tunneling in 1D interacting systems. We show that the sign of the delta-T noise is generically determined
by the nature of the dominating tunneling process (more specifically, its scaling dimension).
We clarify the relation between the sign of delta-T noise and the quantum exchange statistics of
tunneling quasiparticles. We find that, for infinite systems hosting chiral channels with local
interactions (e.g., quantum Hall or quantum spin Hall edges), when the delta-T noise is negative,
the tunneling particles are boson-like, revealing their tendency towards bunching. However,
the opposite is not true: Boson-like particles do not necessarily produce negative delta-T noise.
Importantly, the bosonic nature of particles generating the negative delta-T is not necessarily
intrinsic, but can be induced by the interactions. This particularly implies that negative delta-T
noise for tunneling between the edge states cannot serve as a smoking gun for detecting "intrinsic
anyons". We also establish a connection between the delta-T noise and the temperature derivative
of the thermal noise in interacting systems, both governed by the same scaling dimensions. As a demonstration
of the above statements, we study tunneling between two interacting quantum spin Hall edges. With
bosonization and renormalization-group techniques, we find that many-body interactions can
generate negative delta-T noise for both direct tunneling through a point contact and in Kondo exchange
tunneling via a localized spin. In both setups, we show that the noise can become negative at sufficiently
low temperatures, when interactions renormalize the tunneling to favor boson-like pair-tunneling
of electrons. Our findings show that delta-T noise can probe the nature of collective excitations
in interacting 1D systems.

The predictability of any characteristic functional aspect in a double perovskite system has always
been compromised by its strong dependence over the inevitably present anti-site disorders (ASD).
Here, we aim to precisely map the quantitative and qualitative nature of ASD with the corresponding
modifications in observables describing the magnetic and electronic state in epitaxial Sm$ _{2}
$NiMnO$ _{6} $ (SNMO) double perovskite thin films. The concentration and distribution patterns
of ASD are effectively controlled by optimizing growth conditions and estimated on both local and
global scales utilizing extended X-ray absorption fine structure and bulk magnetometry. Depending
upon the defect densities, the nature of disorder distribution can vary from homogeneous to partially
segregated patches. Primarily, the effect of varying B-site cationic arrangement in SNMO is reflected
as the competition of long range ferromagnetic (FM) and short scale antiferromagnetic (AFM) interactions
originated from ordered Ni-O-Mn and disordered Ni-O-Ni or Mn-O-Mn bonds, respectively, which
leads to systematic shift in magnetic transition temperature and drastic drop in saturation magnetization.
In addition, we have observed that the gradual increment in density of ASD leads to significant deviation
from uniaxial anisotropy character, reduction in anisotropy energy and enhancement of moment
pinning efficiency. However, the observed signatures of $ Ni^{2+}+Mn^{4+} \longrightarrow Ni^{3+}+Mn^{3+}
$ charge disproportionation is found to be independent of cation disorder densities. This work
serves as a basic route-map to tune the characteristic magnetic anisotropy, magnetic phase transitions,
and magnetization reversal mechanism by controlling ASD in a general double perovskite system.

The article presents a comprehensive study of counterion dynamics around a generic linear polyelectrolyte
(PE) chain with the help of coarse-grained computer simulations. The ion-chain coupling is discussed
in the form of binding time, mean-square-displacement (MSD) relative to the chain, local ion transport
coefficient, and spatio-temporal correlations in the effective charge. We have shown that a counterion
exhibits sub-diffusive behavior $\langle \delta R^2 \rangle \sim t^\delta$, $\delta\approx0.9$
w.r.t. chain's centre of mass (COM). The MSD of ions perpendicularly outwards from the chain segment
exhibits a smaller sub-diffusive exponent compared to the one relative to the chain's COM. Further,
we confirm that the effective diffusion-coefficient of counterions is strongly coupled with the
chain. The effective diffusivity of ion is the lowest in chain's close proximity, extending up to
length-scale of the radius of gyration Rg. Beyond Rg at larger distances, they attain diffusivity
of free ion with a smooth cross-over from the adsorbed regime to the free ion regime. We have shown
that the effective diffusivity drastically decreases for the higher valent ions, while the crossover
length scale remains the same. Conversely, with increasing salt concentration the coupling-length
scale reduces, while the diffusivity remains unaltered. The effective diffusivity of adsorbed-ion
reveals an exponential reduction with electrostatic interaction strength. We further corroborate
this from the binding time of ions on the chain, which also grows exponentially with the coupling
strength of the ion-polymer duo. Moreover, the binding time of ions exhibits a weak dependence with
salt concentration for the monovalent salt, while for higher valent salts the binding time decreases
dramatically with concentration.

One of the outstanding problems in the holographic approach to many-body physics is the computation
of correlation functions of non-equilibrium states. Here we develop the method to compute real-time
correlation functions in a holographic theory in the limit in which the state hydrodynamizes, in
the context of the Bjorken flow. Firstly, we provide a new and simple proof that the horizon cap prescription
of Crossley-Glorioso-Liu for implementing the thermal Schwinger-Keldysh contour in the bulk
is consistent with the KMS periodicity and the ingoing boundary condition for the retarded propagator
at any arbitrary frequency and momentum. The generalization to the hydrodynamic Bjorken flow is
achieved by a Weyl rescaling in which the dual black hole's event horizon attains a constant surface
gravity and area at late time although the directions longitudinal and transverse to the flow expands
and contract respectively. The dual state's temperature and entropy density thus become constants
(instead of undergoing perfect fluid expansion) although no time-translation symmetry ever emerges.
Undoing the Weyl rescaling, the correlation functions can be computed systematically in a large
proper time expansion in inverse powers of the average of the two reparametrized proper time arguments.
The horizon cap has to be pinned to the non-equilibrium event horizon so that regularity and consistency
conditions are satisfied. This mirrors causality of Schwinger-Dyson equations. In the limit of
perfect fluid expansion, the Schwinger-Keldysh correlation functions with reparametrized spacetime
arguments are simply thermal at an appropriate temperature. A generalized bi-local thermal structure
holds to all orders. We argue that the Stokes data for the hydrodynamic correlation functions can
decode the quantum fluctuations behind the evolving event horizon, and thus the initial data.

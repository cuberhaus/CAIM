Effects of electron correlations on Anderson insulators have been one of the central themes for
recent two decades, suggesting that the Anderson insulating phase turns into a novel insulating
state referred to as many body localization (MBL). However, the role of spin degrees of freedom in
this dynamical phase transition still remains unclarified as a function of the interaction strength.
In this study, we perform real-space spin-resolved Hartree-Fock-Anderson simulations to investigate
metal-insulator transitions above a critical disorder strength in three spatial dimensions,
where all single-particle states are Anderson-localized without interactions. Here, relatively
weak correlations below the Mott regime are taken into account in the mean-field fashion but disorder
effects are introduced essentially exactly. We find two types of single-particle mobility edges,
where the multifractal spectrum of the interaction-driven low-energy mobility edge deviates
from that of the high-energy one smoothly connected with the multifractal spectrum of the metal-insulator
transition without interactions. We show that the weakly interacting insulating phase remains
to be a paramagnetic Anderson insulating state up to the temperature of the order of the band width.
On the other hand, we uncover that the relatively strongly interacting insulating phase still below
the Mott regime is ferromagnetic, which turns into a ferromagnetic metallic state at a critical
temperature much lower than the order of the bandwidth. Based on all these results, we propose a quantum
phase transition from a paramagnetic Anderson insulating state to a ferromagnetic MBL insulating
phase via an intermediate ferromagnetic metallic state, which intervenes between these two insulators
at the Fermi energy.

We investigate quench dynamics across many-body localization (MBL) transition in an interacting
one dimensional system of spinless fermions with aperiodic potential. We consider a large number
of initial states characterized by number of kinks $N_{kinks}$ in the density profile. On the delocalized
side of the MBL transition, the dynamics becomes faster with increase in the number of kinks $N_{kinks}$
in the initial state such that the exponent $\gamma$ in the density imbalance increases with increase
in $N_{kinks}$. Deep within the MBL phase, $I(t)$ does not show any power-law decay, but the saturation
value increases as the number of kinks decrease. We explain this dependence of dynamics on the number
of kinks in terms of the normalized participation ratio of the initial state in the eigenbasis of
the interacting Hamiltonian. We show that the exponent from the mean square displacement $\langle
x^2(t) \rangle \sim t^\beta$ in the long time limit satisfies $\beta \sim 2\gamma$ only for initial
states with large number of kinks but $\beta$ is much larger than the exponent $\gamma$ for 1-kink
initial state. As the disorder strength increases $\gamma_{N_{kink}} \rightarrow 0$ at some critical
$h_{N_{kink}}$ with $h_{N_{kink}}$ being a monotonically increasing function of $N_{kink}$
and saturating to the MBL transition point $h_c$. This shows that a 1-kink state always underestimates
the value of $h$ at which the MBL transition takes place but is consistent with the onset of a sub-diffusive
phase. This is consistent with the dynamics of interface broadening for the 1-kink state. We also
analyse the growth of sublattice entanglement entropy $S(t)$ for various kink initial states and
show that $S(t)$ shows a logarithmic growth $a \ln(Vt)$ not only in the MBL phase but also in the delocalised
phase and in both the phases the coefficient $a$ increases with $N_{kinks}$.

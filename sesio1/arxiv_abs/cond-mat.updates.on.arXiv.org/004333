Ionic liquids offer unique bulk and interfacial characteristics as battery electrolytes. Our
continuum approach naturally describes the electrolyte on a macroscale. An integral formulation
for the molecular repulsion,which can be quantitatively determined by both experimental and theoretical
methods, models the electrolyteon the nanoscale. In this article, we perform a systematic series
expansion of this integral formulation, derive a description of chemical potentials in terms of
higher-order concentration gradients, and rationalize the appearance of fourth-order derivative-operators
in modified Poisson equations, recently proposed in this context. In this way, we formulate a rigorous
multi-scale methodology from atomistic quantum chemistry calculations to phenomenologic continuum
models. We apply our generalized framework to ionic liquids near electrified interfaces and perform
analytic asymptotic analysis. Three energy scales describing electrostatic forces between ions,
molecular repulsion, and thermal motion determine the shape and width of the long-ranging charged
double layer. We classify the charge screening mechanisms dependent on the system parameters dielectricity,
ionsize, interaction strength, and temperature. We find that the charge density of electrochemical
double layers in ionic liquids either decays exponentially, for negligible molecular repulsion,
or oscillates continuously. Charge ordering across several ion-diameters occurs if the repulsion
between molecules is comparable with thermal energy and Coulomb interaction. Eventually, phase
separation of the bulk electrolyte into ionic layers emerges once the molecular repulsion becomes
dominant. Our framework predicts the exact phase boundaries between these three phases as function
of temperature, dielectricity and ion-sizes.

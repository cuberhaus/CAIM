Rich nematic/smectic orders in Fe-based superconductors are important unsolved problem in the
strongly correlated electron systems. A unified understanding for these rich orders has been investigated
for the last decade. In this article, we explain the $B_{1g}$ symmetry nematic transition in FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$,
the $B_{2g}$ symmetry nematicity in AFe$_2$As$_2$ (A=Cs, Rb), and the smectic state in BaFe$_2$As$_2$
based on the same framework. We investigate the quantum interference mechanism between spin fluctuations,
by developing the density wave equation with the self-energy correction. In this mechanism, the
observed rich variety of nematic/smectic orders are naturally understood, depending on the characteristic
shape and topology of FS of each compound. (i) In FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$, each FS is very small and the
dxy-orbital hole pocket is below the Fermi level. Then, small spin fluctuations on three dxz, dyz,
and dxy orbitals cooperatively lead to the $B_{1g}$ nematic order without magnetization. The experimental
Lifshitz transition below the nematic transition temperature $(T_S)$ is naturally reproduced.
(ii) In BaFe$_2$As$_2$, the dxy-orbital hole pocket emerges around M point, and each FS is relatively
large. Then, the strong spin fluctuations due to the dxy-orbital nesting give rise to the $B_{1g}$
nematic order and the smectic order, and the latter transition temperature ($T^*$) exceeds the
former one $T_S$. (iii) In heavily hole-doped AFe$_2$As$_2$, the large dxy-orbital hole pocket
and the four tiny Dirac pockets appear due to the hole-doping. Then, the $B_{2g}$ nematic bond order
emerges on the dxy-orbital hole pocket due to the same interference mechanism. The present spin-fluctuation
interference mechanism provides a unified explanation why the nematic/smectic orders in Fe-based
superconductors are so rich, based on the well established fermiology of Fe-based superconductors.

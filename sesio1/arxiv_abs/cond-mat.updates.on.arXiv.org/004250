Friction is a pervasive phenomenon that affects the mechanical response of natural and man-made
systems alike, from vascular catheterization to geological faults responsible for earthquakes.
While friction stems from the fundamental interactions between atoms at a contact interface, its
best descriptions at the macroscopic scale remain phenomenological. The so called ``rate-and-state''
models, which specify the friction response in terms of the relative sliding velocity and the ``age''
of the contact interface, fail to uncover the nano-scale mechanisms governing the macro-scale
response, while models of friction at the atomic scale often overlook how roughness can alter the
friction behavior. Here we bridge this gap between nano and macro descriptions for friction by correlating
the physical origin of macroscopic friction to the existence, due to nanometric roughness, of contact
junctions between adsorbed monolayers, whose dynamics, as we show, emerges from molecular motion.
Through coupled experimental and atomic simulations we were able to highlight that transient friction
overshoots after the system is allowed to rest with the friction force decaying to a steady-state
value over a characteristic distance $D_0$ = 3.5 nm, all despite a roughness of 0.6 nm. Our atomistic
simulations link this characteristic scale to the evolution of the number of cross-surface links
and paint contact junctions as a necessary component in the observation of the transient friction
overshoot. This is finally validated by a multi-scale -- in both time and space -- unified theoretical
approach which accurately predicts the transient friction response. Our results demonstrate
that a fundamental understanding of the contact junctions caused by nanometric roughness is instrumental
in lifting the phenomenological veil over macro-scale friction models.

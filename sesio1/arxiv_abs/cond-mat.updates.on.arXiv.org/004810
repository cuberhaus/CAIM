We present a detailed real-space spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy (SP-STM) study
of the magnetic domain structure of Gd(0001) films epitaxially grown on W(110). To find optimal
preparation conditions, the influence of the substrate temperature during deposition and of the
post-growth annealing temperature was investigated. Our results show that the lowest density
of surface defects, such as step edges as well as screw and edge dislocations, is obtained for room
temperature deposition and subsequent annealing at 900\,K. SP-STM data reveal small-sized magnetic
domains at lower annealing temperatures, evidently caused by pinning at grain boundaries and other
crystalline defects. The coverage-dependent magnetic domain structure of optimally prepared
Gd films was systematically investigated. For low coverage up to about 80 atomic layers (AL) we observe
$\mu$m-sized domains separated by domain walls which are oriented approximately along the $[1{\bar
1}0]$ direction of the underlying W substrate. Above a critical film thicknesses $\Theta_{\text{crit}}
\approx (100 \pm 20)$\,AL, we identify stripe domains, indicative for a spin reorientation transition
from in-plane to out-of-plane. In agreement with existing models, the periodicity of the stripe
domains increases the further the coverage exceeds $\Theta_{\text{crit}}$. While the orientation
of the stripe domains is homogeneous over large distances just above $\Theta_{\text{crit}}$,
we find a characteristic zig-zag pattern at $\Theta \gtrsim 200$\,AL and irregular stripe domains
beyond 500\,AL. Intermediate minima and maxima of the magnetic signal indicate the nucleation
of branching domains. The results are discussed in terms of various contributions to the total magnetic
energy, such as the magneto-crystalline, the magneto-static, and the magneto-elastic energy
density.

Particle transport across junctions between two superconductors is commonly described using
a simplifying approximation, which assumes that excitations are fixed at the Fermi momentum and
only Andreev reflections (and no normal reflections) occur at interfaces. While this approximation
is appropriate for superconductors with a large carrier density (the chemical potential vastly
exceeds the pairing gap), it breaks down for superconductors with low carrier density, such as topological
superconductors, doped semiconductors, or superfluid quantum gases. Here, we present a generic
$analytical$ framework for transport in superconducting junctions that does not rely on this limiting
approximation. We apply our framework to describe transport in $s$-wave superconducting junctions
along the BCS-BEC crossover, which interpolates between the conventional high-carrier-density
(BCS-)regime and moderate- as well as low- carrier-density regimes (unitary and BEC regimes),
for which the high-carrier-density approximation is not valid. As the system is tuned from the BCS
to the BEC regime, we find that the overall magnitude of a subgap current, which is attributed to multiple
Andreev reflections, decreases. However, nonlinearities in the current-voltage characteristic
become more pronounced near the intermediate unitary limit, giving rise to sharp peaks and dips
in the differential conductance with even $negative$ differential conductance at specific voltages.
Microscopically, the negative differential conductance is related to the van-Hove points in the
band structure, at which enhanced normal reflections occur and become accessible only when the
chemical potential is comparable to the pairing gap. The subgap current due to multiple Andreev
reflections vanishes at a critical interaction strength on the BEC side, which we identify as the
splitting point where the particle dispersion changes curvature.

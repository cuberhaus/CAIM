Distribution of quantum entanglement is investigated for an anisotropic quantum XY model with
variable range interactions and in the presence of a uniform transverse magnetic field. We report
the possibility of \emph{qualitative} growth in the entanglement between distant sites with an
increase in the range of interactions that vary either exponentially or polynomially as the distance
between the sites increases. Interestingly, we find that such entanglement enhancement is not
ubiquitous and is dependent on the factorization points, a specific set of system parameters where
the zero-temperature state of the system is fully separable. In particular, we observe that at zero-temperature,
when the system parameters are chosen beyond the pair of factorization points, the increments in
entanglement length due to variable range interactions are more pronounced compared to the situation
when the parameters lie in between the factorization points. By employing the sum of all the bipartite
entanglements with respect to a single site, we also show that the shareability of the bipartite
entanglements are constrained, thereby establishing their monogamous nature. Furthermore,
we note that the factorization points get reallocated depending on the laws of interaction fall-offs
and provide an ansatz for the same. We reveal that the temperature at which the canonical equilibrium
state becomes entangled from an unentangled one increases with the increase in the range of interactions,
thereby demonstrating enhanced robustness in entanglement against temperature in the presence
of long-range interactions and only when the system parameters are chosen between the pair of factorization
points. We apply an energy-based entanglement witness to provide a justification to the observed
robustness with temperature.

We analyze the single-channel Kondo model using the recently developed unitary renormalization
group (URG) method, and obtain a comprehensive understanding of the Kondo screening cloud. The
fixed-point low-energy Hamiltonian enables the computation of a plethora of thermodynamic quantities
(specific heat, susceptibility, Wilson ratio, etc.) as well as spectral functions, all of which
are found to be in excellent agreement with known results. By integrating out the impurity, we obtain
an effective Hamiltonian for the excitations of the electrons comprising the Kondo cloud. This
is found to contain both k-space number-diagonal (Fermi liquid) as well off-diagonal four-fermion
scattering terms. Our conclusions are reinforced by a URG study of the two-particle entanglement
and many-body correlations among members of the Kondo cloud and impurity. The entanglement between
the impurity and a cloud electron, as well as between any two cloud electrons, is found to increase
under flow towards the singlet ground state at the strong-coupling fixed point. Both the number-diagonal
and off-diagonal correlations within the conduction cloud are also found to increase as the impurity
is screened under the flow, and the latter are found to be responsible for the macroscopic entanglement
of the Kondo-singlet ground state. The unitary RG flow enables an analytic computation of the phase
shifts suffered by the conduction electrons at the strong-coupling fixed point. This reveals an
orthogonality catastrophe between the local moment and strong-coupling ground states, and is
related to a change in the Luttinger volume of the conduction bath. Our results offer fresh insight
on the nature of the emergent many-particle entanglement within the Kondo cloud, and pave the way
for further investigations in more exotic contexts such as the fixed point of the over-screened
multi-channel Kondo problem.

With the rapid development of additive manufacturing, microstructures are attracting both academic
and industrial interests. As an efficient way of analyzing the mechanical behaviors of microstructures,
the homogenization method has been well studied in the literature. However, the classic homogenization
method still faces challenges. Its computational cost is high for topological optimization that
requires highly repeated calculation. The computation is more expensive when the microstructure
is deformed from a regular cubic, causing changes for the virtual homogeneous material properties.
To conquer this problem, we introduce a fine-designed 3D convolutional neural network (CNN), named
DH-Net, to predict the homogenized properties of deformed microstructures. The novelty of DH-Net
is that it predicts the local displacement rather than the homogenized properties. The macroscopic
strains are considered as a constant in the loss function based on minimum potential energy. Thus
DH-Net is label-free and more computation efficient than existing deep learning methods with the
mean square loss function. We apply the shape-material transformation that a deformed microstructure
with isotropic material can be bi-transformed into a regular structure with a transformed base
material, such that the input with a CNN-friendly form feeds in DH-Net. DH-Net predicts homogenized
properties with hundreds of acceleration compared to the standard homogenization method and even
supports online computing. Moreover, it does not require a labeled dataset and thus can be much faster
than current deep learning methods in training processing. DH-Net can predict both homogenized
material properties and micro-mechanical properties, which is unavailable for existing DL methods.
The generalization of DH-Net for different base materials and different types of microstructures
is also taken into account.

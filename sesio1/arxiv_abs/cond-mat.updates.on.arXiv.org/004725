Interactions between atoms can be formally expanded into two-body, three-body, and higher-order
contributions. Unfortunately, this expansion is slowly converging for most systems of practical
interest making it inexpedient for molecular simulations. This is why effective descriptions
are needed for the accurate simulation of many-atom systems. This article reviews potentials designed
towards this end with a focus on empirical interatomic potentials not necessitating a-priori knowledge
of what pairs of atoms are bonded to each other, i.e., on potentials meant to describe defects and
chemical reactions from bond breaking and formation to redox reactions. The classes of discussed
potentials include popular two-body potentials, embedded-atom models for metals, bond-order
potentials for covalently bonded systems, polarizable potentials including charge-transfer
approaches for ionic systems and quantum-Drude oscillator models mimicking higher-order and
many-body dispersion. Particular emphasis is laid on the question what constraints on materials
properties ensue from the functional form of a potential, e.g., in what way Cauchy relations for
elastic tensor elements can be violated and what this entails for the ratio of defect and cohesive
energies. The review is meant to be pedagogical rather than encyclopedic. This is why we highlight
potentials with functional forms that are sufficiently simple to remain amenable to analytical
treatments, whereby qualitative questions can be answered, such as, why the ratio of boiling to
melting temperature tends to be large for potentials describing metals but small for pair potentials.
However, we abstain for the most part from discussing specific parametrizations. Our main aim is
to provide a stimulus for how existing approaches can be advanced or meaningfully combined to extent
the scope of simulations based on empirical potentials.

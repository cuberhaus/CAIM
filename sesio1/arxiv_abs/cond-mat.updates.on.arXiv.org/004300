Many-body quantum systems are notoriously hard to study theoretically due to the exponential growth
of their Hilbert space. It is also challenging to probe the quantum correlations in many-body states
in experiments due to their sensitivity to external noise. Using synthetic quantum matter to simulate
quantum systems has opened new ways of probing quantum many-body systems with unprecedented control,
and of engineering phases of matter which are otherwise hard to find in nature. Noisy quantum circuits
have become an important cornerstone of our understanding of quantum many-body dynamics. In particular,
random circuits act as minimally structured toy models for chaotic nonintegrable quantum systems,
faithfully reproducing some of their universal properties. Crucially, in contrast to the full
microscopic model, random circuits can be analytically tractable under a reasonable set of assumptions,
thereby providing invaluable insights into questions which might be out of reach even for state-of-the-art
numerical techniques. Here, we give an overview of two classes of dynamics studied using random-circuit
models, with a particular focus on the dynamics of quantum entanglement. We will especially pay
attention to potential near-term applications of random-circuit models on noisy-intermediate
scale quantum (NISQ) devices. In this context, we cover hybrid circuits consisting of unitary gates
interspersed with nonunitary projective measurements, hosting an entanglement phase transition
from a volume-law to an area-law phase of the steady-state entanglement. Moreover, we consider
random-circuit sampling experiments and discuss the usefulness of random quantum states for simulating
quantum many-body dynamics on NISQ devices by leveraging the concept of quantum typicality. We
highlight how emergent hydrodynamics can be studied by utilizing random quantum states generated
by chaotic circuits.

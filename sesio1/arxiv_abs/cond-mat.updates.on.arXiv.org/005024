All-perovskite tandem solar cells promise high photovoltaic performance at low cost. So far however,
their efficiencies cannot compete with traditional inorganic multi-junction solar cells and
they generally underperform in comparison to what is expected from the isolated single junction
devices. Understanding performance losses in all-perovskite tandem solar cells is a crucial aspect
that will accelerate advancement. Here, we perform extensive selective characterization of the
individual sub-cells to disentangle the different losses and limiting factors in these tandem
devices. We find that non-radiative losses in the high-gap subcell dominate the overall recombination
losses in our baseline system as well as in the majority of literature reports. We consecutively
improve the high-gap perovskite subcell through a multi-faceted approach, allowing us to enhance
the open-circuit voltage ($V_{OC}$) of the subcell by up to 120 mV. Due to the (quasi) lossless indium
oxide interconnect which we employ for the first time in all-perovskite tandems, the $V_{OC}$ improvements
achieved in the high-gap perovskites translate directly to improved all-perovskite tandem solar
cells with a champion $V_{OC}$ of 2.00 V and a stabilized efficiency of 23.7%. The efficiency potential
of our optimized all-perovskite tandems reaches 25.2% and 27.0% when determined from electro-
and photo-luminescence respectively, indicating significant transport losses as well as imperfect
energy-alignment between the perovskite and the transport layers in the experimental devices.
Further improvements to 28.4% are possible considering the bulk quality of both absorbers measured
using photo-luminescence on isolated perovskite layers. Our insights therefore not only show
an optimization example but a generalizable evidence-based strategy for optimization utilizing
optical sub-cell characterization.

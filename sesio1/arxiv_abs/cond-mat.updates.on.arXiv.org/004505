When the spins on the frustrated pyrochlore lattice obey the celebrated 2-$in$-2-$out$ ice rule,
they stay in a correlated disordered phase down to zero temperature. Similarly, if the atomic ions
on the pyrochlore lattice move in and outwards of the tetrahedra, they may obey a constraint resembling
the ice rule. We microscopically derive a model for such lattice-displacement degree of freedom
by taking account of a Jahn-Teller (JT) effect. The model aims to describe a family of molybdates
$A_2$Mo$_2$O$_7$ ($A =$Y, Dy, Tb), that forms a pyrochlore lattice based on Mo$^{4+}$ ions. The
JT effect occurs when lattice distortions reduce the symmetry of the local crystal field, resulting
in the orbital-energy-splitting that causes the local energy gain. Unlike the standard JT effect,
the JT energy is determined neither uniquely nor locally by a single Mo$^{4+}$ ion and the surrounding
oxygens but depends on the displacements of Mo$^{4+}$ ions in neighboring tetrahedra. This situation
is described in our model by the 2nd and 3rd neighbor interactions comparably as strong as the nearest
neighbor interactions of standard ice. As a result, the energy landscape of the degenerate ice state
is altered: a crystalline-like ground state coexists with a highly quasi-degenerate ice-like
liquid state. The latter is made up of a 2-$in$-2-$out$ ice network and persistent defects that spread
dynamically throughout the system. Our Monte Carlo simulations show that this liquid remains remarkably
stable down to low temperatures by avoiding the putative first order transition, which can be viewed
as a "supercooled JT ice". The relaxation in the supercooled JT Ice state exhibits glassy dynamics
with a plateau structure resembling the dynamics in glass-forming molecular liquids.

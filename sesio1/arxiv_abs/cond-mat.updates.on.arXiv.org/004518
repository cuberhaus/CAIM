The origin of the pseudogap (PG) phase and superconducting behaviors in high-Tc superconductors
is proposed, based on the picture of Euclidean Q-balls formation, that carry Cooper/local-pair
condensates inside their volumes. Unlike the baryonic Q-balls in supersymmetric standard model,
the Euclidean Q-balls describe spin-/charge densities, that oscillate in Matsubara time, and
are found in the 'nested' repulsive Hubbard model of high-Tc superconductors. Euclidean Q-balls
arise due to global invariance of the effective theory under the phase rotation of the Fourier amplitudes
of spin-/charge fluctuations, leading to conservation of the 'Noether charge' Q in Matsubara time.
Due to local minimum of their potential energy at finite amplitude of the density fluctuations,
the Q-balls provide greater binding energy of fermions into local/Cooper pairs than an exchange
with infinitesimal lattice/charge/spin quasiparticles in the usual Frohlich mechanism. We show
that below some temperature T* the Q-balls arise with a finite density of superconducting condensate
inside them. The Q-balls expand their sizes to infinity at superconducting transition temperature
Tc. Fermionic spectral gap inside the Q-balls arises in the vicinity of the 'nested' regions of the
bare Fermi surface. Solutions are found analytically from the Eliashberg like equations with the
'nesting' wave vectors connecting different 'hot spots' on the bare Fermi surface. The experimental
dependences of Uemura (1989) of Tc on superconducting density n_s, as well as of Li et al. (2010) of
diamagnetic moment on magnetic field above Tc in cuprates follow naturally from the proposed theory.
The 'breathing modes' of the Q-balls in Matsubara time, as well as sharp maximum in specific heat
temperature dependence in the vicinity of the 1-st order phase transition into Q-balls gas phase
are also predicted.

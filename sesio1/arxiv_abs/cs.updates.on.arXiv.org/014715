Motivated by the seemingly high accuracy levels of machine learning models in Moldavian versus
Romanian dialect identification and the increasing research interest on this topic, we provide
a follow-up on the Moldavian versus Romanian Cross-Dialect Topic Identification (MRC) shared
task of the VarDial 2019 Evaluation Campaign. The shared task included two sub-task types: one that
consisted in discriminating between the Moldavian and Romanian dialects and one that consisted
in classifying documents by topic across the two dialects of Romanian. Participants achieved impressive
scores, e.g. the top model for Moldavian versus Romanian dialect identification obtained a macro
F1 score of 0.895. We conduct a subjective evaluation by human annotators, showing that humans attain
much lower accuracy rates compared to machine learning (ML) models. Hence, it remains unclear why
the methods proposed by participants attain such high accuracy rates. Our goal is to understand
(i) why the proposed methods work so well (by visualizing the discriminative features) and (ii)
to what extent these methods can keep their high accuracy levels, e.g. when we shorten the text samples
to single sentences or when we use tweets at inference time. A secondary goal of our work is to propose
an improved ML model using ensemble learning. Our experiments show that ML models can accurately
identify the dialects, even at the sentence level and across different domains (news articles versus
tweets). We also analyze the most discriminative features of the best performing models, providing
some explanations behind the decisions taken by these models. Interestingly, we learn new dialectal
patterns previously unknown to us or to our human annotators. Furthermore, we conduct experiments
showing that the machine learning performance on the MRC shared task can be improved through an ensemble
based on stacking.

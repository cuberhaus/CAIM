Context. Computer workers in general, and software developers specifically, are under a high amount
of stress due to continuous deadlines and, often, over-commitment. Objective. This study investigates
the effects of a neuroplasticity practice, a specific breathing practice, on the attention awareness,
well-being, perceived productivity, and self-efficacy of computer workers. Method. We created
a questionnaire mainly from existing, validated scales as entry and exit survey for data points
for comparison before and after the intervention. The intervention was a 12-week program with a
weekly live session that included a talk on a well-being topic and a facilitated group breathing
session. During the intervention period, we solicited one daily journal note and one weekly well-being
rating. We replicated the intervention in a similarly structured 8-week program. The data was analyzed
using a Bayesian multi-level model for the quantitative part and thematic analysis for the qualitative
part. Results. The intervention showed improvements in participants' experienced inner states
despite an ongoing pandemic and intense outer circumstances for most. Over the course of the study,
we found an improvement in the participants' ratings of how often they found themselves in good spirits
as well as in a calm and relaxed state. We also aggregate a large number of deep inner reflections and
growth processes that may not have surfaced for the participants without deliberate engagement
in such a program. Conclusion. The data indicates usefulness and effectiveness of an intervention
for computer workers in terms of increasing well-being and resilience. Everyone needs a way to deliberately
relax, unplug, and recover. Breathing practice is a simple way to do so, and the results call for establishing
a larger body of work to make this common practice.

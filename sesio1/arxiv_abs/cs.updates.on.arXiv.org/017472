Chemical plant design and optimisation have proven challenging due to the complexity of these real-world
systems. The resulting complexity translates into high computational costs for these systems'
mathematical formulations and simulation models. Research has illustrated the benefits of using
machine learning surrogate models as substitutes for computationally expensive models during
optimisation. This paper extends recent research into optimising chemical plant design and operation.
The study further explores Surrogate Assisted Genetic Algorithms (SA-GA) in more complex variants
of the original plant design and optimisation problems, such as the inclusion of parallel and feedback
components. The novel extension to the original algorithm proposed in this study, Surrogate Assisted
NSGA-\Romannum{2} (SA-NSGA), was tested on a popular literature case, the Pressure Swing Adsorption
(PSA) system. We further provide extensive experimentation, comparing various meta-heuristic
optimisation techniques and numerous machine learning models as surrogates. The results for both
sets of systems illustrate the benefits of using Genetic Algorithms as an optimisation framework
for complex chemical plant system design and optimisation for both single and multi-objective
scenarios. We confirm that Random Forest surrogate assisted Evolutionary Algorithms can be scaled
to increasingly complex chemical systems with parallel and feedback components. We further find
that combining a Genetic Algorithm framework with Machine Learning Surrogate models as a substitute
for long-running simulation models yields significant computational efficiency improvements,
1.7 - 1.84 times speedup for the increased complexity examples and a 2.7 times speedup for the Pressure
Swing Adsorption system.

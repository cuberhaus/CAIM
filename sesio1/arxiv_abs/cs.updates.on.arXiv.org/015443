People and vehicle trajectories embody important information of transportation infrastructures,
and trajectory similarity computation is functionality in many real-world applications involving
trajectory data analysis. Recently, deep-learning based trajectory similarity techniques hold
the potential to offer improved efficiency and adaptability over traditional similarity techniques.
Nevertheless, the existing trajectory similarity learning proposals emphasize spatial similarity
over temporal similarity, making them suboptimal for time-aware analyses. To this end, we propose
ST2Vec, a trajectory-representation-learning based architecture that considers fine-grained
spatial and temporal correlations between pairs of trajectories for spatio-temporal similarity
learning in road networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first deep-learning proposal
for spatio-temporal trajectory similarity analytics. Specifically, ST2Vec encompasses three
phases: (i) training data preparation that selects representative training samples; (ii) spatial
and temporal modeling that encode spatial and temporal characteristics of trajectories, where
a generic temporal modeling module (TMM) is designed; and (iii) spatio-temporal co-attention
fusion (STCF), where a unified fusion (UF) approach is developed to help generating unified spatio-temporal
trajectory embeddings that capture the spatio-temporal similarity relations between trajectories.
Further, inspired by curriculum concept, ST2Vec employs the curriculum learning for model optimization
to improve both convergence and effectiveness. An experimental study offers evidence that ST2Vec
outperforms all state-of-the-art competitors substantially in terms of effectiveness, efficiency,
and scalability, while showing low parameter sensitivity and good model robustness.

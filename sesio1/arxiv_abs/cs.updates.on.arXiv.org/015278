Histopathological cancer diagnostics has become more complex, and the increasing number of biopsies
is a challenge for most pathology laboratories. Thus, development of automatic methods for evaluation
of histopathological cancer sections would be of value. In this study, we used 624 whole slide images
(WSIs) of breast cancer from a Norwegian cohort. We propose a cascaded convolutional neural network
design, called H2G-Net, for semantic segmentation of gigapixel histopathological images. The
design involves a detection stage using a patch-wise method, and a refinement stage using a convolutional
autoencoder. To validate the design, we conducted an ablation study to assess the impact of selected
components in the pipeline on tumour segmentation. Guiding segmentation, using hierarchical
sampling and deep heatmap refinement, proved to be beneficial when segmenting the histopathological
images. We found a significant improvement when using a refinement network for postprocessing
the generated tumour segmentation heatmaps. The overall best design achieved a Dice score of 0.933
on an independent test set of 90 WSIs. The design outperformed single-resolution approaches, such
as cluster-guided, patch-wise high-resolution classification using MobileNetV2 (0.872) and
a low-resolution U-Net (0.874). In addition, segmentation on a representative x400 WSI took ~58
seconds, using only the CPU. The findings demonstrate the potential of utilizing a refinement network
to improve patch-wise predictions. The solution is efficient and does not require overlapping
patch inference or ensembling. Furthermore, we showed that deep neural networks can be trained
using a random sampling scheme that balances on multiple different labels simultaneously, without
the need of storing patches on disk. Future work should involve more efficient patch generation
and sampling, as well as improved clustering.

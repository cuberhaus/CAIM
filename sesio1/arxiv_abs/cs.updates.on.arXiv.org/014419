Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) is a hardware security primitive with a desirable feature of
low-cost. Based on the space of challenge-response pairs (CRPs), it has two categories:weak PUF
and strong PUF. Though designing a reliable and secure lightweight strong PUF is challenging, there
is continuing efforts to fulfill this gap due to wide range of applications enabled by strong PUF.
It was prospected that the combination of MAX and MIN bit-wise operation is promising for improving
the modeling resilience when MAX and MIN are employed in the PUF recomposition. The main rationale
lies on the fact that each bit-wise might be mainly vulnerable to one specific type of modeling attack,
combining them can have an improved holistic resilience. This work is to first evaluate the main
PUF performance, in particular,uniformity and reliability of the OR-AND-XOR-PUF(OAX-PUF)-(x,
y, z)-OAX-PUF. Compared with the most used l-XOR-PUF, the (x, y, z)-OAX-PUF eventually exhibits
better reliability given l=x+y+z without degrading the uniformity retaining to be 50%. We further
examine the modeling resilience of the (x, y, z)-OAX-PUF with four powerful attacking strategies
to date, which are Logistic Regression (LR) attack, reliability assisted CMA-ES attack, multilayer
perceptron (MLP) attack, and the most recent hybrid LR-reliability attack. In comparison with
the XOR-APUF, the OAX-APUF successfully defeats the CAM-ES attack. However, it shows no notable
modeling accuracy drop against other three attacks, though the attacking times have been greatly
prolonged to LR and hybrid LR-reliability attacks. Overall, the OAX recomposition could be an alternative
lightweight recomposition method compared to XOR towards constructing strong PUFs if the underlying
PUF, e.g., FF-APUF, has exhibited improved resilience to modeling attack, because the OAX incurs
smaller reliability degradation compared to XOR.

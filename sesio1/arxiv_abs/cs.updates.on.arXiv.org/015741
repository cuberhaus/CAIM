Exponential random graph models, or ERGMs, are a flexible and general class of models for modeling
dependent data. While the early literature has shown them to be powerful in capturing many network
features of interest, recent work highlights difficulties related to the models' ill behavior,
such as most of the probability mass being concentrated on a very small subset of the parameter space.
This behavior limits both the applicability of an ERGM as a model for real data and inference and parameter
estimation via the usual Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. To address this problem, we propose
a new exponential family of models for random graphs that build on the standard ERGM framework. Specifically,
we solve the problem of computational intractability and `degenerate' model behavior by an interpretable
support restriction. We introduce a new parameter based on the graph-theoretic notion of degeneracy,
a measure of sparsity whose value is commonly low in real-worlds networks. The new model family is
supported on the sample space of graphs with bounded degeneracy and is called degeneracy-restricted
ERGMs, or DERGMs for short. Since DERGMs generalize ERGMs -- the latter is obtained from the former
by setting the degeneracy parameter to be maximal -- they inherit good theoretical properties,
while at the same time place their mass more uniformly over realistic graphs. The support restriction
allows the use of new (and fast) Monte Carlo methods for inference, thus making the models scalable
and computationally tractable. We study various theoretical properties of DERGMs and illustrate
how the support restriction improves the model behavior. We also present a fast Monte Carlo algorithm
for parameter estimation that avoids many issues faced by Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms used
for inference in ERGMs.

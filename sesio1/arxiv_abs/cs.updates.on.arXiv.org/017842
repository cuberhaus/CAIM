Rapid advances in sensor, wireless communication, cloud computing and data science have brought
unprecedented amount of data to assist transportation engineers and researchers in making better
decisions. However, traffic data in reality often has corrupted or incomplete values due to detector
and communication malfunctions. Data imputation is thus required to ensure the effectiveness
of downstream data-driven applications. To this end, numerous tensor-based methods treating
the imputation problem as the low-rank tensor completion (LRTC) have been attempted in previous
works. To tackle rank minimization, which is at the core of the LRTC, most of aforementioned methods
utilize the tensor nuclear norm (NN) as a convex surrogate for the minimization. However, the over-relaxation
issue in NN refrains it from desirable performance in practice. In this paper, we define an innovative
nonconvex truncated Schatten p-norm for tensors (TSpN) to approximate tensor rank and impute missing
spatiotemporal traffic data under the LRTC framework. We model traffic data into a third-order
tensor structure of (time intervals,locations (sensors),days) and introduce four complicated
missing patterns, including random missing and three fiber-like missing cases according to the
tensor mode-n fibers. Despite nonconvexity of the objective function in our model, we derive the
global optimal solutions by integrating the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)
with generalized soft-thresholding (GST). In addition, we design a truncation rate decay strategy
to deal with varying missing rate scenarios. Comprehensive experiments are finally conducted
using real-world spatiotemporal datasets, which demonstrate that the proposed LRTC-TSpN method
performs well under various missing cases, meanwhile outperforming other SOTA tensor-based imputation
models in almost all scenarios.

The omnipresent nature of mobile applications (apps) in all aspects of daily lives raises the necessity
of reflecting end-users values (e.g., fairness, honesty, etc.) in apps. However, there are limited
considerations of end-users values in apps development. Value violations by apps have been reported
in the media and are responsible for end-users dissatisfaction and negative socio-economic consequences.
Value violations may bring more severe and lasting problems for marginalized and vulnerable end-users
of apps, which have been explored less (if at all) in the software engineering community. However,
understanding the values of the end-users of apps is the essential first step towards values-based
apps development. This research aims to fill this gap by investigating the human values of Bangladeshi
female farmers as a marginalized and vulnerable group of end-users of Bangladeshi agriculture
apps. We conducted an empirical study that collected and analyzed data from a survey with 193 Bangladeshi
female farmers to explore the underlying factor structure of the values of Bangladeshi female farmers
and the significance of demographics on their values. The results identified three underlying
factors of Bangladeshi female farmers. The first factor comprises of five values: benevolence,
security, conformity, universalism, and tradition. The second factor consists of two values:
self-direction and stimulation. The third factor includes three values: power, achievement,
and hedonism. We also identified strong influences of demographics on some of the values of Bangladeshi
female farmers. For example, area has significant impacts on three values: hedonism, achievement,
and tradition. Similarly, there are also strong influences of household income on power and security.

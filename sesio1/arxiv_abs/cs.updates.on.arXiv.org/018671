In actual industrial production, the assessment of the steel plate welding effect is an important
task, and the segmentation of the weld section is the basis of the assessment. This paper proposes
an industrial weld segmentation network based on a deep learning semantic segmentation algorithm
fused with heatmap detail guidance and Image Matting to solve the automatic segmentation problem
of weld regions. In the existing semantic segmentation networks, the boundary information can
be preserved by fusing the features of both high-level and low-level layers. However, this method
can lead to insufficient expression of the spatial information in the low-level layer, resulting
in inaccurate segmentation boundary positioning. We propose a detailed guidance module based
on heatmaps to fully express the segmented region boundary information in the low-level network
to address this problem. Specifically, the expression of boundary information can be enhanced
by adding a detailed branch to predict segmented boundary and then matching it with the boundary
heat map generated by mask labels to calculate the mean square error loss. In addition, although
deep learning has achieved great success in the field of semantic segmentation, the precision of
the segmentation boundary region is not high due to the loss of detailed information caused by the
classical segmentation network in the process of encoding and decoding process. This paper introduces
a matting algorithm to calibrate the boundary of the segmentation region of the semantic segmentation
network to solve this problem. Through many experiments on industrial weld data sets, the effectiveness
of our method is demonstrated, and the MIOU reaches 97.93%. It is worth noting that this performance
is comparable to human manual segmentation ( MIOU 97.96%).

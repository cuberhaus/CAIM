The problem of identifying algorithmic recourse for people affected by machine learning model
decisions has received much attention recently. Some recent works model user-incurred cost, which
is directly linked to user satisfaction. But they assume a single global cost function that is shared
across all users. This is an unrealistic assumption when users have dissimilar preferences about
their willingness to act upon a feature and different costs associated with changing that feature.
In this work, we formalize the notion of user-specific cost functions and introduce a new method
for identifying actionable recourses for users. By default, we assume that users' cost functions
are hidden from the recourse method, though our framework allows users to partially or completely
specify their preferences or cost function. We propose an objective function, Expected Minimum
Cost (EMC), based on two key ideas: (1) when presenting a set of options to a user, it is vital that there
is at least one low-cost solution the user could adopt; (2) when we do not know the user's true cost
function, we can approximately optimize for user satisfaction by first sampling plausible cost
functions, then finding a set that achieves a good cost for the user in expectation. We optimize EMC
with a novel discrete optimization algorithm, Cost-Optimized Local Search (COLS), which is guaranteed
to improve the recourse set quality over iterations. Experimental evaluation on popular real-world
datasets with simulated user costs demonstrates that our method satisfies up to 25.89 percentage
points more users compared to strong baseline methods. Using standard fairness metrics, we also
show that our method can provide more fair solutions across demographic groups than comparable
methods, and we verify that our method is robust to misspecification of the cost function distribution.

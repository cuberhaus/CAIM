Early identification and prevention of various plant diseases in commercial farms and orchards
is a key feature of precision agriculture technology. This paper presents a high-performance real-time
fine-grain object detection framework that addresses several obstacles in plant disease detection
that hinder the performance of traditional methods, such as, dense distribution, irregular morphology,
multi-scale object classes, textural similarity, etc. The proposed model is built on an improved
version of the You Only Look Once (YOLOv4) algorithm. The modified network architecture maximizes
both detection accuracy and speed by including the DenseNet in the back-bone to optimize feature
transfer and reuse, two new residual blocks in the backbone and neck enhance feature extraction
and reduce computing cost; the Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) enhances receptive field, and a modified
Path Aggregation Network (PANet) preserves fine-grain localized information and improve feature
fusion. Additionally, the use of the Hard-Swish function as the primary activation improved the
model's accuracy due to better nonlinear feature extraction. The proposed model is tested in detecting
four different diseases in tomato plants under various challenging environments. The model outperforms
the existing state-of-the-art detection models in detection accuracy and speed. At a detection
rate of 70.19 FPS, the proposed model obtained a precision value of $90.33 \%$, F1-score of $93.64
\%$, and a mean average precision ($mAP$) value of $96.29 \%$. Current work provides an effective
and efficient method for detecting different plant diseases in complex scenarios that can be extended
to different fruit and crop detection, generic disease detection, and various automated agricultural
detection processes.

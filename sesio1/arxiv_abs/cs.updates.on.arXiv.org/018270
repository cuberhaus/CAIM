The future sixth generation (6G) of communication systems is envisioned to provide numerous applications
in safety-critical contexts, e.g., driverless traffic, modular industry, and smart cities, which
require outstanding performance, high reliability and fault tolerance, as well as autonomy. Ensuring
criticality awareness for diverse functional safety applications and providing fault tolerance
in an autonomous manner are essential for future 6G systems. Therefore, this paper proposes jointly
employing the concepts of resilience and mixed criticality. In this work, we conduct physical layer
resource management in cloud-based networks under the rate-splitting paradigm, which is a promising
factor towards achieving high resilience. We recapitulate the concepts individually, outline
a joint metric to measure the criticality-aware resilience, and verify its merits in a case study.
We, thereby, formulate a non-convex optimization problem, derive an efficient iterative algorithm,
propose four resilience mechanisms differing in quality and time of adaption, and conduct extensive
numerical simulations. Towards this end, we propose a highly autonomous rate-splitting-enabled
physical layer resource management algorithm for future 6G networks respecting mixed-critical
quality of service (QoS) levels and providing high levels of resilience. Results emphasize the
considerable improvements of incorporating a mixed criticality-aware resilience strategy under
channel outages and strict QoS demands. The rate-splitting paradigm is particularly shown to overcome
state-of-the-art interference management techniques, and the resilience and throughput adaption
over consecutive outage events reveals the proposed schemes contribution towards enabling future
6G networks.

Detection and mitigation of Byzantine behaviors in a decentralized learning setting is a daunting
task, especially when the data distribution at the users is heterogeneous. As our main contribution,
we propose Basil, a fast and computationally efficient Byzantine robust algorithm for decentralized
training systems, which leverages a novel sequential, memory assisted and performance-based
criteria for training over a logical ring while filtering the Byzantine users. In the IID dataset
distribution setting, we provide the theoretical convergence guarantees of Basil, demonstrating
its linear convergence rate. Furthermore, for the IID setting, we experimentally demonstrate
that Basil is robust to various Byzantine attacks, including the strong Hidden attack, while providing
up to ${\sim}16 \%$ higher test accuracy over the state-of-the-art Byzantine-resilient decentralized
learning approach. Additionally, we generalize Basil to the non-IID dataset distribution setting
by proposing Anonymous Cyclic Data Sharing (ACDS), a technique that allows each node to anonymously
share a random fraction of its local non-sensitive dataset (e.g., landmarks images) with all other
nodes. We demonstrate that Basil alongside ACDS with only $5\%$ data sharing provides effective
toleration of Byzantine nodes, unlike the state-of-the-art Byzantine robust algorithm that completely
fails in the heterogeneous data setting. Finally, to reduce the overall latency of Basil resulting
from its sequential implementation over the logical ring, we propose Basil+. In particular, Basil+
provides scalability by enabling Byzantine-robust parallel training across groups of logical
rings, and at the same time, it retains the performance gains of Basil due to sequential training
within each group. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate the scalability gains of Basil+
through different sets of experiments.

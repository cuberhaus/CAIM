It is increasingly acknowledged that a priori statistical power estimation for planned studies
with multiple model parameters is inherently a multivariate problem. Power for individual parameters
of interest cannot be reliably estimated univariately because sampling variably in, correlation
with, and variance explained relative to one parameter will impact the power for another parameter,
all usual univariate considerations being equal. Explicit solutions in such cases, especially
for models with many parameters, are either impractical or impossible to solve, leaving researchers
with the prevailing method of simulating power. However, point estimates for a vector of model parameters
are uncertain, and the impact of inaccuracy is unknown. In such cases, sensitivity analysis is recommended
such that multiple combinations of possible observable parameter vectors are simulated to understand
power trade-offs. A limitation to this approach is that it is computationally expensive to generate
sufficient sensitivity combinations to accurately map the power trade-off function in increasingly
high dimensional spaces for the models that social scientists estimate. This paper explores the
efficient estimation and graphing of statistical power for a study over varying model parameter
combinations. Optimally powering a study is crucial to ensure a minimum probability of finding
the hypothesized effect. We first demonstrate the impact of varying parameter values on power for
specific hypotheses of interest and quantify the computational intensity of computing such a graph
for a given level of precision. Finally, we propose a simple and generalizable machine learning
inspired solution to cut the computational cost to less than 7\% of what could be called a brute force
approach. [abridged]

Safety is a top priority for civil aviation. New anomaly detection methods, primarily clustering
methods, have been developed to monitor pilot operations and detect any risks from such flight data.
However, all existing anomaly detection methods are offlline learning - the models are trained
once using historical data and used for all future predictions. In practice, new flight data are
accumulated continuously and analyzed every month at airlines. Clustering such dynamically growing
data is challenging for an offlline method because it is memory and time intensive to re-train the
model every time new data come in. If the model is not re-trained, false alarms or missed detections
may increase since the model cannot reflect changes in data patterns. To address this problem, we
propose a novel incremental anomaly detection method based on Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to identify
common patterns and detect outliers in flight operations from digital flight data. It is a probabilistic
clustering model of flight operations that can incrementally update its clusters based on new data
rather than to re-cluster all data from scratch. It trains an initial GMM model based on historical
offlline data. Then, it continuously adapts to new incoming data points via an expectation-maximization
(EM) algorithm. To track changes in flight operation patterns, only model parameters need to be
saved. The proposed method was tested on three sets of simulation data and two sets of real-world
flight data. Compared with the traditional offline GMM method, the proposed method can generate
similar clustering results with significantly reduced processing time (57 % - 99 % time reduction
in testing sets) and memory usage (91 % - 95 % memory usage reduction in testing sets). Preliminary
results indicate that the incremental learning scheme is effective in dealing with dynamically
growing data in flight data analytics.

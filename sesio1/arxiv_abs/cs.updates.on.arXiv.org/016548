Liver cancer is one of the most common malignant diseases in the world. Segmentation and labeling
of liver tumors and blood vessels in CT images can provide convenience for doctors in liver tumor
diagnosis and surgical intervention. In the past decades, many state-of-the-art medical image
segmentation algorithms appeared during this period. With the development of embedded devices,
embedded deployment for medical segmentation and automatic reconstruction brings prospects
for future automated surgical tasks. Yet, most of the existing segmentation methods mostly care
about the spatial feature context and have a perception defect in the semantic relevance of medical
images, which significantly affects the segmentation accuracy of liver tumors and blood vessels.
Deploying large and complex models into embedded devices requires a reasonable trade-off between
model accuracy, reasoning speed and model capacity. Given these problems, we introduce a multi-scale
feature fusion network called TransFusionNet based on Transformer. This network achieved very
competitive performance for liver vessel and liver tumor segmentation tasks, meanwhile it can
improve the recognition of morphologic margins of liver tumors by exploiting the global information
of CT images. Experiments show that in vessel segmentation task TransFusionNet achieved mean Dice
coefficients of 0.899 and in liver tumor segmentation task TransFusionNet achieved mean Dice coefficients
of 0.961. Compared with the state-of-the-art framework, our model achieves the best segmentation
result. In addition, we deployed the model into an embedded micro-structure and constructed an
integrated model for liver tumor vascular segmentation and reconstruction. This proprietary
structure will be the exclusive component of the future medical field.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging can produce detailed images of the anatomy and physiology of the human
body that can assist doctors in diagnosing and treating pathologies such as tumours. However, MRI
suffers from very long acquisition times that make it susceptible to patient motion artifacts and
limit its potential to deliver dynamic treatments. Conventional approaches such as Parallel Imaging
and Compressed Sensing allow for an increase in MRI acquisition speed by reconstructing MR images
by acquiring less MRI data using multiple receiver coils. Recent advancements in Deep Learning
combined with Parallel Imaging and Compressed Sensing techniques have the potential to produce
high-fidelity reconstructions from highly accelerated MRI data. In this work we present a novel
Deep Learning-based Inverse Problem solver applied to the task of accelerated MRI reconstruction,
called Recurrent Variational Network (RecurrentVarNet) by exploiting the properties of Convolution
Recurrent Networks and unrolled algorithms for solving Inverse Problems. The RecurrentVarNet
consists of multiple blocks, each responsible for one unrolled iteration of the gradient descent
optimization algorithm for solving inverse problems. Contrary to traditional approaches, the
optimization steps are performed in the observation domain ($k$-space) instead of the image domain.
Each recurrent block of RecurrentVarNet refines the observed $k$-space and is comprised of a data
consistency term and a recurrent unit which takes as input a learned hidden state and the prediction
of the previous block. Our proposed method achieves new state of the art qualitative and quantitative
reconstruction results on 5-fold and 10-fold accelerated data from a public multi-channel brain
dataset, outperforming previous conventional and deep learning-based approaches. We will release
all models code and baselines on our public repository.

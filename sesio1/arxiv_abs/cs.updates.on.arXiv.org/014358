This dissertation rigorously characterizes many modern commodity DRAM devices and shows that
by exploiting DRAM access timing margins within manufacturer-recommended DRAM timing specifications,
we can significantly improve system performance, reduce power consumption, and improve device
reliability and security. First, we characterize DRAM timing parameter margins and find that certain
regions of DRAM can be accessed faster than other regions due to DRAM cell process manufacturing
variation. We exploit this by enabling variable access times depending on the DRAM cells being accessed,
which not only improves overall system performance, but also decreases power consumption. Second,
we find that we can uniquely identify DRAM devices by the locations of failures that result when we
access DRAM with timing parameters reduced below specification values. Because we induce these
failures with DRAM accesses, we can generate these unique identifiers significantly more quickly
than prior work. Third, we propose a random number generator that is based on our observation that
timing failures in certain DRAM cells are randomly induced and can thus be repeatedly polled to very
quickly generate true random values. Finally, we characterize the RowHammer security vulnerability
on a wide range of modern DRAM chips while violating the DRAM refresh requirement in order to directly
characterize the underlying DRAM technology without the interference of refresh commands. We
demonstrate with our characterization of real chips, that existing RowHammer mitigation mechanisms
either are not scalable or suffer from prohibitively large performance overheads in projected
future devices and it is critical to research more effective solutions to RowHammer. Overall, our
studies build a new understanding of modern DRAM devices to improve computing system performance,
reliability and security all at the same time.

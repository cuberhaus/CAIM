Robotic platforms are highly programmable, scalable and versatile to complete several tasks including
Inspection, Maintenance and Repair (IMR). Mobile robotics offer reduced restrictions in operating
environments, resulting in greater flexibility; operation at height, dangerous areas and repetitive
tasks. Cyber physical infrastructures have been identified by the UK Robotics Growth Partnership
as a key enabler in how we utilize and interact with sensors and machines via the virtual and physical
worlds. Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) allow for robotics and artificial intelligence to adapt and
repurpose at pace, allowing for the addressment of new challenges in CPS. A challenge exists within
robotics to secure an effective partnership in a wide range of areas which include shared workspaces
and Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS). Robotic manipulation abilities have improved a robots
accessibility via the ability to open doorways, however, challenges exist in how a robot decides
if it is safe to move into a new workspace. Current sensing methods are limited to line of sight and
are unable to capture data beyond doorways or walls, therefore, a robot is unable to sense if it is
safe to open a door. Another limitation exists as robots are unable to detect if a human is within a
shared workspace. Therefore, if a human is detected, extended safety precautions can be taken to
ensure the safe autonomous operation of a robot. These challenges are represented as safety, trust
and resilience, inhibiting the successful advancement of CPS. This paper evaluates the use of frequency
modulated continuous wave radar sensing for human detection and through-wall detection to increase
situational awareness. The results validate the use of the sensor to detect the difference between
a person and infrastructure, and increased situational awareness for navigation via foresight
monitoring through walls.

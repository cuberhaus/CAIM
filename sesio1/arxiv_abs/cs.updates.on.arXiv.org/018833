The COVID-19 pandemic has brought forth the importance of epidemic forecasting for decision makers
in multiple domains, ranging from public health to the economy as a whole. While forecasting epidemic
progression is frequently conceptualized as being analogous to weather forecasting, however
it has some key differences and remains a non-trivial task. The spread of diseases is subject to multiple
confounding factors spanning human behavior, pathogen dynamics, weather and environmental conditions.
Research interest has been fueled by the increased availability of rich data sources capturing
previously unobservable facets and also due to initiatives from government public health and funding
agencies. This has resulted, in particular, in a spate of work on 'data-centered' solutions which
have shown potential in enhancing our forecasting capabilities by leveraging non-traditional
data sources as well as recent innovations in AI and machine learning. This survey delves into various
data-driven methodological and practical advancements and introduces a conceptual framework
to navigate through them. First, we enumerate the large number of epidemiological datasets and
novel data streams that are relevant to epidemic forecasting, capturing various factors like symptomatic
online surveys, retail and commerce, mobility, genomics data and more. Next, we discuss methods
and modeling paradigms focusing on the recent data-driven statistical and deep-learning based
methods as well as on the novel class of hybrid models that combine domain knowledge of mechanistic
models with the effectiveness and flexibility of statistical approaches. We also discuss experiences
and challenges that arise in real-world deployment of these forecasting systems including decision-making
informed by forecasts. Finally, we highlight some challenges and open problems found across the
forecasting pipeline.

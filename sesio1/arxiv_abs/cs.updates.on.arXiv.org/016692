We introduce a higher order phase averaging method for nonlinear oscillatory systems. Phase averaging
is a technique to filter fast motions from the dynamics whilst still accounting for their effect
on the slow dynamics. Phase averaging is useful for deriving reduced models that can be solved numerically
with more efficiency, since larger timesteps can be taken. Recently, Haut and Wingate (2014) introduced
the idea of computing finite window numerical phase averages in parallel as the basis for a coarse
propagator for a parallel-in-time algorithm. In this contribution, we provide a framework for
higher order phase averages that aims to better approximate the unaveraged system whilst still
filtering fast motions. Whilst the basic phase average assumes that the solution independent of
changes of phase, the higher order method expands the phase dependency in a basis which the equations
are projected onto. In this new framework, the original numerical phase averaging formulation
arises as the lowest order version of this expansion. Our new projection onto functions that are
$k$th degree polynomials in the phase gives rise to higher order corrections to the phase averaging
formulation. We illustrate the properties of this method on an ODE that describes the dynamics of
a swinging spring due to Lynch (2002). Although idealized, this model shows an interesting analogy
to geophysical flows as it exhibits a slow dynamics that arises through the resonance between fast
oscillations. On this example, we show convergence to the non-averaged (exact) solution with increasing
approximation order also for finite averaging windows. At zeroth order, our method coincides with
a standard phase average, but at higher order it is more accurate in the sense that solutions of the
phase averaged model track the solutions of the unaveraged equations more accurately.

In this paper, we consider a distributed joint sensing and communication (DJSC) system in which
multiple radar sensors are deployed. Each sensor is equipped with a sensing function and a communication
function, and thus it is a JSC node. The JSC nodes are able to perform sensing their surrounding environments,
e.g., weather conditions or available spectrum. Furthermore, they can cooperatively detect and
track a common target. The information, i.e., of the environment and target, collected by the JSC
nodes is transmitted to a base station (BS) for further processing. As such, different aspects of
the target to be viewed simultaneously, which significantly improves the performance of the target
detection and tracking. However, both the sensing function and communication function require
a certain amount of bandwidth for their operations, and deploying multiple JSC nodes may consume
a large amount of bandwidth. Therefore, we investigate the bandwidth allocation problem for the
DJSC system. In particular, we aim to optimize the bandwidth allocation to the sensing function
and the communication function of the JSC nodes. To improve the allocation efficiency while benefiting
the spatial diversity advantage of the DJSC systems, the objective is to maximize the sum of sensing
performances, i.e., estimation rates, communication performances, i.e., communication data
rates, and fairnesses of all the users. The optimization problem is non-convex and difficult to
be solved. For this, we propose a fully polynomial time approximation algorithm, and we prove that
the approximation algorithm can guarantee a near-optimal solution with an accuracy bound of $\epsilon$.
Furthermore, we propose to use a heuristic algorithm with lower complexity. The simulation results
show that both the proposed algorithms are able to achieve the solutions close to the optimum in a
computationally efficient fashion.

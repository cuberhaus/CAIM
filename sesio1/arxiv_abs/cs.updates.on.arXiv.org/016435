The COVID-19 pandemic will be remembered as a uniquely disruptive period that altered the lives
of billions of citizens globally, resulting in new-normal for the way people live and work. With
the coronavirus pandemic, everyone had to adapt to the "work or study from home" operating model
that has transformed our online lives and exponentially increased the use of cyberspace. Concurrently,
there has been a huge spike in social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter during the COVID-19
lockdown periods. These lockdown periods have resulted in a set of new cybercrimes, thereby allowing
attackers to victimise users of social media platforms in times of fear, uncertainty, and doubt.
The threats range from running phishing campaigns and malicious domains to extracting private
information about victims for malicious purposes. This research paper performs a large-scale
study to investigate the impact of lockdown periods during the COVID-19 pandemic on the security
and privacy of social media users. We analyse 10.6 Million COVID-related tweets from 533 days of
data crawling and investigate users' security and privacy behaviour in three different periods
(i.e., before, during, and after lockdown). Our study shows that users unintentionally share more
personal identifiable information when writing about the pandemic situation in their tweets.
The privacy risk reaches 100% if a user posts three or more sensitive tweets about the pandemic. We
investigate the number of suspicious domains shared in social media during different pandemic
phases. Our analysis reveals an increase in suspicious domains during the lockdown compared to
other lockdown phases. We observe that IT, Search Engines, and Businesses are the top three categories
that contain suspicious domains. Our analysis reveals that adversaries' strategies to instigate
malicious activities change with the country's pandemic situation.

[HHM20] discovered, for 7 pairs (C,D) of seemingly distinct standard electoral control types,
that C and D are identical: For each input I and each election system, I is a "yes" instance of both C
and D, or of neither. Surprisingly this had gone undetected, even as the field was score-carding
how many standard control types election systems were resistant to; various "different" cells
on such score cards were, unknowingly, duplicate effort on the same issue. This naturally raises
the worry that other pairs of control types are also identical, and so work still is being needlessly
duplicated. We determine, for all standard control types, which pairs are, for elections whose
votes are linear orderings of the candidates, always identical. We show that no identical control
pairs exist beyond the known 7. We for 3 central election systems determine which control pairs are
identical ("collapse") with respect to those particular systems, and we explore containment/incomparability
relationships between control pairs. For approval voting, which has a different "type" for its
votes, [HHM20]'s 7 collapses still hold. But we find 14 additional collapses that hold for approval
voting but not for some election systems whose votes are linear orderings. We find 1 additional collapse
for veto. We prove that each of the 3 election systems mentioned have no collapses other than those
inherited from [HHM20] or added here. But we show many new containment relationships that hold between
some separating control pairs, and for each separating pair of standard types classify its separation
in terms of containment (always, and strict on some inputs) or incomparability. Our work, for the
general case and these 3 important election systems, clarifies the landscape of the 44 standard
control types, for each pair collapsing or separating them, and also providing finer-grained information
on the separations.

Spatial-temporal representation learning is ubiquitous in various real-world applications,
including visual comprehension, video understanding, multi-modal analysis, human-computer
interaction, and urban computing. Due to the emergence of huge amounts of multi-modal heterogeneous
spatial/temporal/spatial-temporal data in big data era, the lack of interpretability, robustness,
and out-of-distribution generalization are becoming the challenges of the existing visual models.
The majority of the existing methods tend to fit the original data/variable distributions, which
lack an unified guidance and analysis about why modern spatial-temporal representation learning
methods are easily collapse into data bias and have limited cognitive ability. Inspired by the strong
inference ability of human-level agents, recent years have therefore witnessed great effort in
developing causal reasoning paradigms to realize robust representation and model learning with
good cognitive ability. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive review of existing causal reasoning
methods for spatial-temporal representation learning, covering fundamental theories, models,
and datasets. The limitations of current methods and datasets are also discussed. Moreover, we
propose some primary challenges, opportunities, and future research directions for benchmarking
causal reasoning algorithms in spatial-temporal representation learning. This paper aims to
provide a comprehensive overview of this emerging field, attract attention, encourage discussions,
bring to the forefront the urgency of developing novel causal reasoning methods, publicly available
benchmarks, and consensus-building standards for reliable spatial-temporal representation
learning and related real-world applications more efficiently.

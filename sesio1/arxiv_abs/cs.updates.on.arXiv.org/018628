Research on intelligent tutoring systems has been exploring data-driven methods to deliver effective
adaptive assistance. While much work has been done to provide adaptive assistance when students
seek help, they may not seek help optimally. This had led to the growing interest in proactive adaptive
assistance, where the tutor provides unsolicited assistance upon predictions of struggle or unproductivity.
Determining when and whether to provide personalized support is a well-known challenge called
the assistance dilemma. Addressing this dilemma is particularly challenging in open-ended domains,
where there can be several ways to solve problems. Researchers have explored methods to determine
when to proactively help students, but few of these methods have taken prior hint usage into account.
In this paper, we present a novel data-driven approach to incorporate students' hint usage in predicting
their need for help. We explore its impact in an intelligent tutor that deals with the open-ended
and well-structured domain of logic proofs. We present a controlled study to investigate the impact
of an adaptive hint policy based on predictions of HelpNeed that incorporate students' hint usage.
We show empirical evidence to support that such a policy can save students a significant amount of
time in training, and lead to improved posttest results, when compared to a control without proactive
interventions. We also show that incorporating students' hint usage significantly improves the
adaptive hint policy's efficacy in predicting students' HelpNeed, thereby reducing training
unproductivity, reducing possible help avoidance, and increasing possible help appropriateness
(a higher chance of receiving help when it was likely to be needed). We conclude with suggestions
on the domains that can benefit from this approach as well as the requirements for adoption.

Thyroid disease instances have been continuously increasing since the 1990s, and thyroid cancer
has become the most rapidly rising disease among all the malignancies in recent years. Most existing
studies focused on applying deep convolutional neural networks for detecting thyroid cancer.
Despite their satisfactory performance on binary classification tasks, limited studies have
explored multi-class classification of thyroid disease types; much less is known of the diagnosis
of co-existence situation for different types of thyroid diseases. Therefore, this study proposed
a novel multi-channel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to address the multi-class
classification task of thyroid disease. The multi-channel CNN merits from computed tomography
to drive a comprehensive diagnostic decision for the overall thyroid gland, emphasizing the disease
co-existence circumstance. Moreover, this study also examined alternative strategies to enhance
the diagnostic accuracy of CNN models through concatenation of different scales of feature maps.
Benchmarking experiments demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed multi-channel
CNN architecture compared with the standard single-channel CNN architecture. More specifically,
the multi-channel CNN achieved an accuracy of 0.909, precision of 0.944, recall of 0.896, specificity
of 0.994, and F1 of 0.917, in contrast to the single-channel CNN, which obtained 0.902, 0.892, 0.909,
0.993, 0.898, respectively. In addition, the proposed model was evaluated in different gender
groups; it reached a diagnostic accuracy of 0.908 for the female group and 0.901 for the male group.
Collectively, the results highlight that the proposed multi-channel CNN has excellent generalization
and has the potential to be deployed to provide computational decision support in clinical settings.

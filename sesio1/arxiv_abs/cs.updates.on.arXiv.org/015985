This work elevates coded caching networks from their purely information-theoretic framework
to a stochastic setting, by exploring the effect of random user activity and by exploiting correlations
in the activity patterns of different users. In particular, the work studies the $K$-user cache-aided
broadcast channel with a limited number of cache states, and explores the effect of cache state association
strategies in the presence of arbitrary user activity levels; a combination that strikes at the
very core of the coded caching problem and its crippling subpacketization bottleneck. We first
present a statistical analysis of the average worst-case delay performance of such subpacketization-constrained
(state-constrained) coded caching networks, and provide computationally efficient performance
bounds as well as scaling laws for any arbitrary probability distribution of the user-activity
levels. The achieved performance is a result of a novel user-to-cache state association algorithm
that leverages the knowledge of probabilistic user-activity levels. We then follow a data-driven
approach that exploits the prior history on user-activity levels and correlations, in order to
predict interference patterns, and thus better design the caching algorithm. This optimized strategy
is based on the principle that users that overlap more, interfere more, and thus have higher priority
to secure complementary cache states. This strategy is proven here to be within a small constant
factor from the optimal. Finally, the above analysis is validated numerically using synthetic
data following the Pareto principle. To the best of our understanding, this is the first work that
seeks to exploit user-activity levels and correlations, in order to map future interference and
design optimized coded caching algorithms that better handle this interference.

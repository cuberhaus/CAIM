Existing studies on prejudice, which is important in multi-group dynamics in societies, focus
on the social-psychological knowledge behind the processes involving prejudice and its propagation.
We instead create a multi-agent framework that simulates the propagation of prejudice and measures
its tangible impact on the prosperity of individuals as well as of larger social structures, including
groups and factions within. Groups in society help us define prejudice, and factions represent
smaller tight-knit circles of individuals with similar opinions. We model social interactions
using the Continuous Prisoner's Dilemma (CPD) and a type of agent called a prejudiced agent, whose
cooperation is affected by a prejudice attribute, updated over time based both on the agent's own
experiences and those of others in its faction. Our simulations show that modeling prejudice as
an exclusively out-group phenomenon generates implicit in-group promotion, which eventually
leads to higher relative prosperity of the prejudiced population. This skew in prosperity is shown
to be correlated to factors such as size difference between groups and the number of prejudiced agents
in a group. Although prejudiced agents achieve higher prosperity within prejudiced societies,
their presence degrades the overall prosperity levels of their societies. Our proposed system
model can serve as a basis for promoting a deeper understanding of origins, propagation, and ramifications
of prejudice through rigorous simulative studies grounded in apt theoretical backgrounds. This
can help conduct impactful research on prominent social issues such as racism, religious discrimination,
and unfair immigrant treatment. This model can also serve as a foundation to study other socio-psychological
phenomena in tandem with prejudice such as the distribution of wealth, social status, and ethnocentrism
in a society.

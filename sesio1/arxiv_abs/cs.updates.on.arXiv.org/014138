We introduce a setting where a receiver aims to perfectly recover a source known privately to a \textit{strategic}
sender over a possibly noisy channel. The sender is endowed with a utility function and sends signals
to the receiver with the aim of maximizing this utility. Due to the strategic nature of the sender
not all the transmitted information is truthful, which leads to the question: how much true information
can be recovered by the receiver from such a sender? We study this question in this paper. We pose the
problem as a game between the sender and receiver, where the receiver tries to maximize the number
of sequences that can be recovered perfectly and the sender maximizes its utility. We show that,
in spite of the sender being strategic and the presence of noise in the channel, there is a strategy
for the receiver by which it can perfectly recover an \textit{exponentially} large number of sequences.
Our analysis leads to the notion of the \textit{information extraction capacity} of the sender
which quantifies the growth rate of the number of recovered sequences with blocklength, in the presence
of a noiseless channel. We show that the information extraction capacity generalizes the Shannon
capacity of a graph. While this implies that computing this quantity is hard in general, we derive
lower and upper bounds that allow us to approximate this capacity. The lower bound is in terms of an
optimization problem and the upper bound is in terms of the Shannon capacity of an appropriate graph.
These results also lead to an exact characterization of the information extraction capacity in
a large number of cases. We show that in the presence of a noisy channel, the rate of information extraction
achieved by the receiver is the minimum of the zero-error capacity of the channel and the information
extraction capacity of the sender.

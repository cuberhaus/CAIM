Coflow is a recently proposed networking abstraction to help improve the communication performance
of data-parallel computing jobs. In multi-stage jobs, each job consists of multiple coflows and
is represented by a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Efficiently scheduling coflows is critical to
improve the data-parallel computing performance in data centers. Compared with hand-tuned scheduling
heuristics, existing work DeepWeave [1] utilizes Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework to generate
highly-efficient coflow scheduling policies automatically. It employs a graph neural network
(GNN) to encode the job information in a set of embedding vectors, and feeds a flat embedding vector
containing the whole job information to the policy network. However, this method has poor scalability
as it is unable to cope with jobs represented by DAGs of arbitrary sizes and shapes, which requires
a large policy network for processing a high-dimensional embedding vector that is difficult to
train. In this paper, we first utilize a directed acyclic graph neural network (DAGNN) to process
the input and propose a novel Pipelined-DAGNN, which can effectively speed up the feature extraction
process of the DAGNN. Next, we feed the embedding sequence composed of schedulable coflows instead
of a flat embedding of all coflows to the policy network, and output a priority sequence, which makes
the size of the policy network depend on only the dimension of features instead of the product of dimension
and number of nodes in the job's DAG.Furthermore, to improve the accuracy of the priority scheduling
policy, we incorporate the Self-Attention Mechanism into a deep RL model to capture the interaction
between different parts of the embedding sequence to make the output priority scores relevant.
Based on this model, we then develop a coflow scheduling algorithm for online multi-stage jobs.

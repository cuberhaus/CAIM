Introduction: Background field removal (BFR) is a critical step required for successful quantitative
susceptibility mapping (QSM). However, eliminating the background field in brains containing
significant susceptibility sources, such as intracranial hemorrhages, is challenging due to
the relatively large scale of the field induced by these pathological susceptibility sources.
Method: This study proposes a new deep learning-based method, BFRnet, to remove background field
in healthy and hemorrhagic subjects. The network is built with the dual-frequency octave convolutions
on the U-net architecture, trained with synthetic field maps containing significant susceptibility
sources. The BFRnet method is compared with three conventional BFR methods and one previous deep
learning method using simulated and in vivo brains from 4 healthy and 2 hemorrhagic subjects. Robustness
against acquisition field-of-view (FOV) orientation and brain masking are also investigated.
Results: For both simulation and in vivo experiments, BFRnet led to the best visually appealing
results in the local field and QSM results with the minimum contrast loss and the most accurate hemorrhage
susceptibility measurements among all five methods. In addition, BFRnet produced the most consistent
local field and susceptibility maps between different sizes of brain masks, while conventional
methods depend drastically on precise brain extraction and further brain edge erosions. It is also
observed that BFRnet performed the best among all BFR methods for acquisition FOVs oblique to the
main magnetic field. Conclusion: The proposed BFRnet improved the accuracy of local field reconstruction
in the hemorrhagic subjects compared with conventional BFR algorithms. The BFRnet method was effective
for acquisitions of titled orientations and retained whole brains without edge erosion as often
required by traditional BFR methods.

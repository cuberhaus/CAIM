Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a well-established paradigm for simulating complex systems via
interactions between constituent entities. Machine learning (ML) refers to approaches whereby
statistical algorithms 'learn' from data on their own, without imposing a priori theories of system
behavior. Biological systems -- from molecules, to cells, to entire organisms -- consist of vast
numbers of entities, governed by complex webs of interactions that span many spatiotemporal scales
and exhibit nonlinearity, stochasticity and intricate coupling between entities. The macroscopic
properties and collective dynamics of such systems are difficult to capture via continuum modelling
and mean-field formalisms. ABM takes a 'bottom-up' approach that obviates these difficulties
by enabling one to easily propose and test a set of well-defined 'rules' to be applied to the individual
entities (agents) in a system. Evaluating a system and propagating its state over discrete time-steps
effectively simulates the system, allowing observables to be computed and system properties to
be analyzed. Because the rules that govern an ABM can be difficult to abstract and formulate from
experimental data, there is an opportunity to use ML to help infer optimal, system-specific ABM
rules. Once such rule-sets are devised, ABM calculations can generate a wealth of data, and ML can
be applied there too -- e.g., to probe statistical measures that meaningfully describe a system's
stochastic properties. As an example of synergy in the other direction (from ABM to ML), ABM simulations
can generate realistic datasets for training ML algorithms (e.g., for regularization, to mitigate
overfitting). In these ways, one can envision various synergistic ABM$\rightleftharpoons$ML
loops. This review summarizes how ABM and ML have been integrated in contexts that span spatial scales
from the cellular to population-level scale epidemiology.

Ego networks have proved to be a valuable tool for understanding the relationships that individuals
establish with their peers, both in offline and online social networks. Particularly interesting
are the cognitive constraints associated with the interactions between the ego and the members
of their ego network, which limit individuals to maintain meaningful interactions with no more
than 150 people, on average, and to arrange such relationships along concentric circles of decreasing
engagement. In this work, we focus on the ego networks of journalists on Twitter, considering 17
different countries, and we investigate whether they feature the same characteristics observed
for other relevant classes of Twitter users, like politicians and generic users. Our findings are
that journalists are generally more active and interact with more people than generic users, regardless
of their country. Their ego network structure is very aligned with reference models derived in anthropology
and observed in general human ego networks. Remarkably, the similarity is even higher than the one
of politicians and generic users ego networks. This may imply a greater cognitive involvement with
Twitter for journalists than for other user categories. From a dynamic perspective, journalists
have stable short-term relationships that do not change much over time. In the longer term, though,
ego networks can be pretty dynamic, especially in the innermost circles. Moreover, the ego-alter
ties of journalists are often information-driven, as they are mediated by hashtags both at their
inception and during their lifetime. Finally, we found that relationships between journalists
are assortative in popularity: journalists tend to engage with other journalists of similar popularity,
in all layers but especially in their innermost ones.

In solo research, scientists compete individually for prestige, sending clear signals about their
research ability, avoiding problems in credit allocation, and reducing conflicts about authorship.
We examine to what extent male and female scientists differ in their use of solo publishing across
various dimensions. This research is the first to comprehensively study the 'gender solo research
gap' among all internationally visible scientists within a whole national higher education system.
We examine the gap through 'individual publication portfolios' constructed for each Polish university
professor. We use the practical significance/statistical significance difference (based on
the effect-size r coefficient) and our analyses indicate that while some gender differences are
statistically significant, they have no practical significance. Using a partial effects of fractional
logistic regression approach, we estimate the probability of conducting solo research. In none
of the models does gender explain the variability of the individual solo publishing rate. The strongest
predictor of individual solo publishing rate is the average team size, publishing in STEM fields
negatively affects the rate, publishing in male-dominated disciplines positively affects it,
and the influence of international collaboration is negative. The gender solo research gap in Poland
is much weaker than expected: within a more general trend toward team research and international
research, gender differences in solo research are much weaker and less relevant than initially
assumed. We use our unique biographical, administrative, publication, and citation database
('Polish Science Observatory') with metadata on all Polish scientists present in Scopus (N=25,463)
and their 158,743 Scopus-indexed articles published in 2009-2018, including 18,900 solo articles.

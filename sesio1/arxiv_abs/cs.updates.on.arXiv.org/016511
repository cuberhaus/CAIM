Organ motion poses an unresolved challenge in image-guided interventions. In the pursuit of solving
this problem, the research field of time-resolved volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (4D MRI)
has evolved. However, current techniques are unsuitable for most interventional settings because
they lack sufficient temporal and/or spatial resolution or have long acquisition times. In this
work, we propose a novel approach for real-time, high-resolution 4D MRI with large fields of view
for MR-guided interventions. To this end, we trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) end-to-end
to predict a 3D liver MRI that correctly predicts the liver's respiratory state from a live 2D navigator
MRI of a subject. Our method can be used in two ways: First, it can reconstruct near real-time 4D MRI
with high quality and high resolution (209x128x128 matrix size with isotropic 1.8mm voxel size
and 0.6s/volume) given a dynamic interventional 2D navigator slice for guidance during an intervention.
Second, it can be used for retrospective 4D reconstruction with a temporal resolution of below 0.2s/volume
for motion analysis and use in radiation therapy. We report a mean target registration error (TRE)
of 1.19 $\pm$0.74mm, which is below voxel size. We compare our results with a state-of-the-art retrospective
4D MRI reconstruction. Visual evaluation shows comparable quality. We show that small training
sizes with short acquisition times down to 2min can already achieve promising results and 24min
are sufficient for high quality results. Because our method can be readily combined with earlier
methods, acquisition time can be further decreased while also limiting quality loss. We show that
an end-to-end, deep learning formulation is highly promising for 4D MRI reconstruction.

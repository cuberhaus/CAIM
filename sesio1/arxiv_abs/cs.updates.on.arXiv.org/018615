Camera Image Signal Processing(ISP) pipelines, including deep learning trained versions, can
get appealing results in different image signal processing tasks. However, most if not all of these
methods tend to apply a single filter that is homogeneous over the entire image. This is also particularly
true when an encoder-decoder type deep architecture is trained for the task. However, it is natural
to view a camera image as heterogeneous, as the color intensity and the artificial noise are distributed
vastly different, even across the two dimensional domain of a single image. Varied Moire ringing,
motion-blur, color-bleaching or lens based projection distortions can all potentially lead to
a heterogeneous image artifact filtering problem. In this paper, we present a specific patch-based,
local subspace deep neural network that improves Camera ISP to be robust to heterogeneous artifacts
(especially image denoising). We call our three-fold deep trained model the Patch Subspace Learning
Autoencoder (PSL-AE). PSL-AE does not necessarily assume uniform image distortion levels nor
repeated nor similar artifact types within the image. Rather, PSL-AE first diagnostically encodes
patches extracted from noisy and clean image pairs, with different artifact type and distortion
levels, by contrastive learning. Then, each image's patches are encoded into soft-clusters in
their appropriate latent sub-space, using a prior mixture model. Lastly, the decoders of the PSL-AE
are also trained in an unsupervised manner customized for the image patches in each soft-cluster.
Our experimental results demonstrates the flexibility and performance that one can achieve through
improved heterogeneous filtering, both from synthesized artifacts but also realistic SIDD image
pairs.

Drug-mediated blockade of the voltage-gated potassium channel(hERG) and the voltage-gated sodium
channel (Nav1.5) can lead to severe cardiovascular complications. This rising concern has been
reflected in the drug development arena, as the frequent emergence of cardiotoxicity from many
approved drugs led to either discontinuing their use or, in some cases, their withdrawal from the
market. Predicting potential hERG and Nav1.5 blockers at the outset of the drug discovery process
can resolve this problem and can, therefore, decrease the time and expensive cost of developing
safe drugs. One fast and cost-effective approach is to use in silico predictive methods to weed out
potential hERG and Nav1.5 blockers at the early stages of drug development. Here, we introduce two
robust 2D descriptor-based QSAR predictive models for both hERG and Nav1.5 liability predictions.
The machine learning models were trained for both regression, predicting the potency value of a
drug, and multiclass classification at three different potency cut-offs (i.e. 1{\mu}M, 10{\mu}M,
and 30{\mu}M), where ToxTree-hERG Classifier, a pipeline of Random Forest models, was trained
on a large curated dataset of 8380 unique molecular compounds. Whereas ToxTree-Nav1.5 Classifier,
a pipeline of kernelized SVM models, was trained on a large manually curated set of 1550 unique compounds
retrieved from both ChEMBL and PubChem publicly available bioactivity databases. The proposed
hERG inducer outperformed most metrics of the state-of-the-art published model and other existing
tools. Additionally, we are introducing the first Nav1.5 liability predictive model achieving
a Q4 = 74.9% and a binary classification of Q2 = 86.7% with MCC = 71.2% evaluated on an external test
set of 173 unique compounds. The curated datasets used in this project are made publicly available
to the research community.

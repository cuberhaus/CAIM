Micro-expression recognition (MER) is valuable because the involuntary nature of micro-expressions
(MEs) can reveal genuine emotions. Most works recognize MEs by taking RGB videos or images as input.
In fact, the activated facial regions in ME images are very small and the subtle motion can be easily
submerged in the unrelated information. Facial landmarks are a low-dimensional and compact modality,
which leads to much lower computational cost and can potentially concentrate more on ME-related
features. However, the discriminability of landmarks for MER is not clear. Thus, this paper explores
the contribution of facial landmarks and constructs a new framework to efficiently recognize MEs
with sole facial landmark information. Specially, we design a separate structure module to separately
aggregate the spatial and temporal information in the geometric movement graph based on facial
landmarks, and a Geometric Two-Stream Graph Network is constructed to aggregate the low-order
geometric information and high-order semantic information of facial landmarks. Furthermore,
two core components are proposed to enhance features. Specifically, a semantic adjacency matrix
can automatically model the relationship between nodes even long-distance nodes in a self-learning
fashion; and an Adaptive Action Unit loss is introduced to guide the learning process such that the
learned features are forced to have a synchronized pattern with facial action units. Notably, this
work tackles MER only utilizing geometric features, processed based on a graph model, which provides
a new idea with much higher efficiency to promote MER. The experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed method can achieve competitive or even superior performance with a significantly
reduced computational cost, and facial landmarks can significantly contribute to MER and are worth
further study for efficient ME analysis.

Open-set recognition and adversarial defense study two key aspects of deep learning that are vital
for real-world deployment. The objective of open-set recognition is to identify samples from open-set
classes during testing, while adversarial defense aims to robustify the network against images
perturbed by imperceptible adversarial noise. This paper demonstrates that open-set recognition
systems are vulnerable to adversarial samples. Furthermore, this paper shows that adversarial
defense mechanisms trained on known classes are unable to generalize well to open-set samples.
Motivated by these observations, we emphasize the necessity of an Open-Set Adversarial Defense
(OSAD) mechanism. This paper proposes an Open-Set Defense Network with Clean-Adversarial Mutual
Learning (OSDN-CAML) as a solution to the OSAD problem. The proposed network designs an encoder
with dual-attentive feature-denoising layers coupled with a classifier to learn a noise-free
latent feature representation, which adaptively removes adversarial noise guided by channel
and spatial-wise attentive filters. Several techniques are exploited to learn a noise-free and
informative latent feature space with the aim of improving the performance of adversarial defense
and open-set recognition. First, we incorporate a decoder to ensure that clean images can be well
reconstructed from the obtained latent features. Then, self-supervision is used to ensure that
the latent features are informative enough to carry out an auxiliary task. Finally, to exploit more
complementary knowledge from clean image classification to facilitate feature denoising and
search for a more generalized local minimum for open-set recognition, we further propose clean-adversarial
mutual learning, where a peer network (classifying clean images) is further introduced to mutually
learn with the classifier (classifying adversarial images).

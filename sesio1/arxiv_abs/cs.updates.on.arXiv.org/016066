We investigate the fundamental multiple access (MA) scheme in an active intelligent reflecting
surface (IRS) aided energy-constrained Internet-of-Things (IoT) system, where an active IRS
is deployed to assist the uplink transmission from multiple IoT devices to an access point (AP).
Our goal is to maximize the sum throughput by optimizing the IRS beamforming vectors across time
and resource allocation. To this end, we first study two typical active IRS aided MA schemes, namely
time division multiple access (TDMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), by analytically
comparing their achievable sum throughput and proposing corresponding algorithms. Interestingly,
we prove that given only one available IRS beamforming vector, the NOMA-based scheme generally
achieves a larger throughput than the TDMA-based scheme, whereas the latter can potentially outperform
the former if multiple IRS beamforming vectors are available to harness the favorable time selectivity
of the IRS. To strike a flexible balance between the system performance and the associated signaling
overhead incurred by more IRS beamforming vectors, we then propose a general hybrid TDMA-NOMA scheme
with user grouping, where the devices in the same group transmit simultaneously via NOMA while devices
in different groups occupy orthogonal time slots. By controlling the number of groups, the hybrid
TDMA-NOMA scheme is applicable for any given number of IRS beamforming vectors available. Despite
of the non-convexity of the considered optimization problem, we propose an efficient algorithm
based on alternating optimization. Simulation results illustrate the practical superiorities
of the active IRS over the passive IRS in terms of the coverage extension and supporting multiple
energy-limited devices, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed hybrid MA scheme for
flexibly balancing the performance-cost tradeoff.

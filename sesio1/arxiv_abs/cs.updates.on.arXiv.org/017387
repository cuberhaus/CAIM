Predicting incoming failures and scheduling maintenance based on sensors information in industrial
machines is increasingly important to avoid downtime and machine failure. Different machine learning
formulations can be used to solve the predictive maintenance problem. However, many of the approaches
studied in the literature are not directly applicable to real-life scenarios. Indeed, many of those
approaches usually either rely on labelled machine malfunctions in the case of classification
and fault detection, or rely on finding a monotonic health indicator on which a prediction can be
made in the case of regression and remaining useful life estimation, which is not always feasible.
Moreover, the decision-making part of the problem is not always studied in conjunction with the
prediction phase. This paper aims to design and compare different formulations for predictive
maintenance in a two-level framework and design metrics that quantify both the failure detection
performance as well as the timing of the maintenance decision. The first level is responsible for
building a health indicator by aggregating features using a learning algorithm. The second level
consists of a decision-making system that can trigger an alarm based on this health indicator. Three
degrees of refinements are compared in the first level of the framework, from simple threshold-based
univariate predictive technique to supervised learning methods based on the remaining time before
failure. We choose to use the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and its variations as the common algorithm
used in all the formulations. We apply and compare the different strategies on a real-world rotating
machine case study and observe that while a simple model can already perform well, more sophisticated
refinements enhance the predictions for well-chosen parameters.

E-governance is a process that aims to enhance a government's ability to simplify all the processes
that may involve government, citizens, businesses, and so on. The rapid evolution of digital technologies
has often created the necessity for the establishment of an e-Governance model. There is often a
need for an inclusive e-governance model with integrated multiactor governance services and where
a single market approach can be adopted. e-Governance often aims to minimise bureaucratic processes,
while at the same time including a digital-by-default approach to public services. This aims at
administrative efficiency and the reduction of bureaucratic processes. It can also improve government
capabilities, and enhances trust and security, which brings confidence in governmental transactions.
However, solid implementations of a distributed data sharing model within an e-governance architecture
is far from a reality; hence, citizens of European countries often go through the tedious process
of having their confidential information verified. This paper focuses on the sinGLe sign-on e-GovernAnce
Paradigm based on a distributed file-exchange network for security, transparency, cost-effectiveness
and trust (GLASS) model, which aims to ensure that a citizen can control their relationship with
governmental agencies. The paper thus proposes an approach that integrates a permissioned blockchain
with the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). This method demonstrates how we may encrypt and store
verifiable credentials of the GLASS ecosystem, such as academic awards, ID documents and so on,
within IPFS in a secure manner and thus only allow trusted users to read a blockchain record, and obtain
the encryption key. This allows for the decryption of a given verifiable credential that stored
on IPFS. This paper outlines the creation of a demonstrator that proves the principles of the GLASS
approach.

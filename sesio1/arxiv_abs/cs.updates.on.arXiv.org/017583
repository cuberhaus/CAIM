Several complex systems are characterized by presenting intricate characteristics taking place
at several scales of time and space. These multiscale characterizations are used in various applications,
including better understanding diseases, characterizing transportation systems, and comparison
between cities, among others. In particular, texts are also characterized by a hierarchical structure
that can be approached by using multi-scale concepts and methods. The multiscale properties of
texts constitute a subject worth further investigation. In addition, more effective approaches
to text characterization and analysis can be obtained by emphasizing words with potentially more
informational content. The present work aims at developing these possibilities while focusing
on mesoscopic representations of networks. More specifically, we adopt an extension to the mesoscopic
approach to represent text narratives, in which only the recurrent relationships among tagged
parts of speech (subject, verb and direct object) are considered to establish connections among
sequential pieces of text (e.g., paragraphs). The characterization of the texts was then achieved
by considering scale-dependent complementary methods: accessibility, symmetry and recurrence
signatures. In order to evaluate the potential of these concepts and methods, we approached the
problem of distinguishing between literary genres (fiction and non-fiction). A set of 300 books
organized into the two genres was considered and were compared by using the aforementioned approaches.
All the methods were capable of differentiating to some extent between the two genres. The accessibility
and symmetry reflected the narrative asymmetries, while the recurrence signature provided a more
direct indication about the non-sequential semantic connections taking place along the narrative.

One of the new scientific ways of understanding discourse dynamics is analyzing the public data
of social networks. This research's aim is Post-structuralist Discourse Analysis (PDA) of Covid-19
phenomenon (inspired by Laclau and Mouffe's Discourse Theory) by using Intelligent Data Mining
for Persian Society. The examined big data is five million tweets from 160,000 users of the Persian
Twitter network to compare two discourses. Besides analyzing the tweet texts individually, a social
network graph database has been created based on retweets relationships. We use the VoteRank algorithm
to introduce and rank people whose posts become word of mouth, provided that the total information
spreading scope is maximized over the network. These users are also clustered according to their
word usage pattern (the Gaussian Mixture Model is used). The constructed discourse of influential
spreaders is compared to the most active users. This analysis is done based on Covid-related posts
over eight episodes. Also, by relying on the statistical content analysis and polarity of tweet
words, discourse analysis is done for the whole mentioned subpopulations, especially for the top
individuals. The most important result of this research is that the Twitter subjects' discourse
construction is government-based rather than community-based. The analyzed Iranian society
does not consider itself responsible for the Covid-19 wicked problem, does not believe in participation,
and expects the government to solve all problems. The most active and most influential users' similarity
is that political, national, and critical discourse construction is the predominant one. In addition
to the advantages of its research methodology, it is necessary to pay attention to the study's limitations.
Suggestion for future encounters of Iranian society with similar crises is given.

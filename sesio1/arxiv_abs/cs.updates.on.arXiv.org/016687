Data poisoning attacks, in which an adversary corrupts a training set with the goal of inducing specific
desired mistakes, have raised substantial concern: even just the possibility of such an attack
can make a user no longer trust the results of a learning system. In this work, we show how to achieve
strong robustness guarantees in the face of such attacks across multiple axes. We provide robustly-reliable
predictions, in which the predicted label is guaranteed to be correct so long as the adversary has
not exceeded a given corruption budget, even in the presence of instance targeted attacks, where
the adversary knows the test example in advance and aims to cause a specific failure on that example.
Our guarantees are substantially stronger than those in prior approaches, which were only able
to provide certificates that the prediction of the learning algorithm does not change, as opposed
to certifying that the prediction is correct, as we are able to achieve in our work. Remarkably, we
provide a complete characterization of learnability in this setting, in particular, nearly-tight
matching upper and lower bounds on the region that can be certified, as well as efficient algorithms
for computing this region given an ERM oracle. Moreover, for the case of linear separators over logconcave
distributions, we provide efficient truly polynomial time algorithms (i.e., non-oracle algorithms)
for such robustly-reliable predictions. We also extend these results to the active setting where
the algorithm adaptively asks for labels of specific informative examples, and the difficulty
is that the adversary might even be adaptive to this interaction, as well as to the agnostic learning
setting where there is no perfect classifier even over the uncorrupted data.

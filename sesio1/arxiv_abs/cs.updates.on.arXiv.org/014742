Mathematical models in epidemiology are an indispensable tool to determine the dynamics and important
characteristics of infectious diseases. Apart from their scientific merit, these models are often
used to inform political decisions and intervention measures during an ongoing outbreak. However,
reliably inferring the dynamics of ongoing outbreaks by connecting complex models to real data
is still hard and requires either laborious manual parameter fitting or expensive optimization
methods which have to be repeated from scratch for every application of a given model. In this work,
we address this problem with a novel combination of epidemiological modeling with specialized
neural networks. Our approach entails two computational phases: In an initial training phase,
a mathematical model describing the epidemic is used as a coach for a neural network, which acquires
global knowledge about the full range of possible disease dynamics. In the subsequent inference
phase, the trained neural network processes the observed data of an actual outbreak and infers the
parameters of the model in order to realistically reproduce the observed dynamics and reliably
predict future progression. With its flexible framework, our simulation-based approach is applicable
to a variety of epidemiological models. Moreover, since our method is fully Bayesian, it is designed
to incorporate all available prior knowledge about plausible parameter values and returns complete
joint posterior distributions over these parameters. Application of our method to the early Covid-19
outbreak phase in Germany demonstrates that we are able to obtain reliable probabilistic estimates
for important disease characteristics, such as generation time, fraction of undetected infections,
likelihood of transmission before symptom onset, and reporting delays using a very moderate amount
of real-world observations.

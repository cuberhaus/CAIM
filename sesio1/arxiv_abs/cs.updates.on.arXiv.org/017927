Just noticeable difference (JND) of natural images refers to the maximum pixel intensity change
magnitude that typical human visual system (HVS) cannot perceive. Existing efforts on JND estimation
mainly dedicate to modeling the diverse masking effects in either/both spatial or/and frequency
domains, and then fusing them into an overall JND estimate. In this work, we turn to a dramatically
different way to address this problem with a top-down design philosophy. Instead of explicitly
formulating and fusing different masking effects in a bottom-up way, the proposed JND estimation
model dedicates to first predicting a critical perceptual lossless (CPL) counterpart of the original
image and then calculating the difference map between the original image and the predicted CPL image
as the JND map. We conduct subjective experiments to determine the critical points of 500 images
and find that the distribution of cumulative normalized KLT coefficient energy values over all
500 images at these critical points can be well characterized by a Weibull distribution. Given a
testing image, its corresponding critical point is determined by a simple weighted average scheme
where the weights are determined by a fitted Weibull distribution function. The performance of
the proposed JND model is evaluated explicitly with direct JND prediction and implicitly with two
applications including JND-guided noise injection and JND-guided image compression. Experimental
results have demonstrated that our proposed JND model can achieve better performance than several
latest JND models. In addition, we also compare the proposed JND model with existing visual difference
predicator (VDP) metrics in terms of the capability in distortion detection and discrimination.
The results indicate that our JND model also has a good performance in this task.

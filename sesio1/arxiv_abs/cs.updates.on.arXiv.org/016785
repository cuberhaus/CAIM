In this paper we propose a method to generate suitably refined finite element meshes using neural
networks. As a model problem we consider a linear elasticity problem on a planar domain (possibly
with holes) having a polygonal boundary. We impose boundary conditions by fixing the position of
a part of the boundary and applying a force on another part of the boundary. The resulting displacement
and distribution of stresses depend on the geometry of the domain and on the boundary conditions.
When applying a standard Galerkin discretization using quadrilateral finite elements, one usually
has to perform adaptive refinement to properly resolve maxima of the stress distribution. Such
an adaptive scheme requires a local error estimator and a corresponding local refinement strategy.
The overall costs of such a strategy are high. We propose to reduce the costs of obtaining a suitable
discretization by training a neural network whose evaluation replaces this adaptive refinement
procedure. We set up a single network for a large class of possible domains and boundary conditions
and not on a single domain of interest. The computational domain and boundary conditions are interpreted
as images, which are suitable inputs for convolution neural networks. We use the U-net architecture
and we devise training strategies by dividing the possible inputs into different categories based
on their overall geometric complexity. Thus, we compare different training strategies based on
varying geometric complexity. One of the advantages of the proposed approach is the interpretation
of input and output as images, which do not depend on the underlying discretization scheme. Another
is the generalizability and geometric flexibility. The network can be applied to previously unseen
geometries, even with different topology and level of detail. Thus, training can easily be extended
to other classes of geometries.

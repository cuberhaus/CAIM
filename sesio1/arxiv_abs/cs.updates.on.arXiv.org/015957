It is a challenging task to learn discriminative representation from images and videos, due to large
local redundancy and complex global dependency in these visual data. Convolution neural networks
(CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) have been two dominant frameworks in the past few years. Though
CNNs can efficiently decrease local redundancy by convolution within a small neighborhood, the
limited receptive field makes it hard to capture global dependency. Alternatively, ViTs can effectively
capture long-range dependency via self-attention, while blind similarity comparisons among
all the tokens lead to high redundancy. To resolve these problems, we propose a novel Unified transFormer
(UniFormer), which can seamlessly integrate the merits of convolution and self-attention in a
concise transformer format. Different from the typical transformer blocks, the relation aggregators
in our UniFormer block are equipped with local and global token affinity respectively in shallow
and deep layers, allowing to tackle both redundancy and dependency for efficient and effective
representation learning. Finally, we flexibly stack our UniFormer blocks into a new powerful backbone,
and adopt it for various vision tasks from image to video domain, from classification to dense prediction.
Without any extra training data, our UniFormer achieves 86.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K classification.
With only ImageNet-1K pre-training, it can simply achieve state-of-the-art performance in a broad
range of downstream tasks, e.g., it obtains 82.9/84.8 top-1 accuracy on Kinetics-400/600, 60.9/71.2
top-1 accuracy on Something-Something V1/V2 video classification tasks, 53.8 box AP and 46.4 mask
AP on COCO object detection task, 50.8 mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation task, and 77.4 AP on COCO
pose estimation task. Code is available at https://github.com/Sense-X/UniFormer.

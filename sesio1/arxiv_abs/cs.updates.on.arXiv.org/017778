The compositionality and sparsity of high-throughput sequencing data poses a challenge for regression
and classification. However, in microbiome research in particular, conditional modeling is an
essential tool to investigate relationships between phenotypes and the microbiome. Existing
techniques are often inadequate: they either rely on extensions of the linear log-contrast model
(which adjusts for compositionality, but is often unable to capture useful signals), or they are
based on black-box machine learning methods (which may capture useful signals, but ignore compositionality
in downstream analyses). We propose KernelBiome, a kernel-based nonparametric regression and
classification framework for compositional data. It is tailored to sparse compositional data
and is able to incorporate prior knowledge, such as phylogenetic structure. KernelBiome captures
complex signals, including in the zero-structure, while automatically adapting model complexity.
We demonstrate on par or improved predictive performance compared with state-of-the-art machine
learning methods. Additionally, our framework provides two key advantages: (i) We propose two
novel quantities to interpret contributions of individual components and prove that they consistently
estimate average perturbation effects of the conditional mean, extending the interpretability
of linear log-contrast models to nonparametric models. (ii) We show that the connection between
kernels and distances aids interpretability and provides a data-driven embedding that can augment
further analysis. Finally, we apply the KernelBiome framework to two public microbiome studies
and illustrate the proposed model analysis. KernelBiome is available as an open-source Python
package at https://github.com/shimenghuang/KernelBiome.

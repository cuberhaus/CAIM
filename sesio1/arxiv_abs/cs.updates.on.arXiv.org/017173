With the ever-growing communication demands and the unceasing miniaturization of mobile devices,
the Internet of Things is expanding the amount of mobile terminals to an enormous level. To deal with
such numbers of communication data, plenty of base stations (BSs) need to be deployed. However,
denser deployments of heterogeneous networks (HetNets) lead to more frequent handovers, which
could increase network burden and degrade the users experience, especially in traffic hotspot
areas. In this paper, we develop a unified framework to investigate the handover performance of
wireless networks with traffic hotspots. Using the stochastic geometry, we derive the theoretical
expressions of average distances and handover metrics in HetNets, where the correlations between
users and BSs in hotspots are captured. Specifically, the distributions of macro cells are modeled
as independent Poisson point processes (PPPs), and the two tiers of small cells outside and inside
the hotspots are modeled as PPP and Poisson cluster process (PCP) separately. A modified random
waypoint (MRWP) model is also proposed to eliminate the density wave phenomenon in traditional
models and to increase the accuracy of handover decision. By combining the PCP and MRWP model, the
distributions of distances from a typical terminal to the BSs in different tiers are derived. Afterwards,
we derive the expressions of average distances from a typical terminal to different BSs, and reveal
that the handover rate, handover failure rate, and ping-pong rate are deduced as the functions of
BS density, scattering variance of clustered small cell, user velocity, and threshold of triggered
time. Simulation results verify the accuracy of the proposed analytical model and closed-form
theoretical expressions.

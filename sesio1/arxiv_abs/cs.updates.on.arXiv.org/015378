In the research, we developed a computer vision solution to support diagnostic radiology in differentiating
between COVID-19 pneumonia, influenza virus pneumonia, and normal biomarkers. The chest radiograph
appearance of COVID-19 pneumonia is thought to be nonspecific, having presented a challenge to
identify an optimal architecture of a convolutional neural network (CNN) that would classify with
a high sensitivity among the pulmonary inflammation features of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 types
of pneumonia. Rahman (2021) states that COVID-19 radiography images observe unavailability and
quality issues impacting the diagnostic process and affecting the accuracy of the deep learning
detection models. A significant scarcity of COVID-19 radiography images introduced an imbalance
in data motivating us to use over-sampling techniques. In the study, we include an extensive set
of X-ray imaging of human lungs (CXR) with COVID-19 pneumonia, influenza virus pneumonia, and normal
biomarkers to achieve an extensible and accurate CNN model. In the experimentation phase of the
research, we evaluated a variety of convolutional network architectures, selecting a sequential
convolutional network with two traditional convolutional layers and two pooling layers with maximum
function. In its classification performance, the best performing model demonstrated a validation
accuracy of 93% and an F1 score of 0.95. We chose the Azure Machine Learning service to perform network
experimentation and solution deployment. The auto-scaling compute clusters offered a significant
time reduction in network training. We would like to see scientists across fields of artificial
intelligence and human biology collaborating and expanding on the proposed solution to provide
rapid and comprehensive diagnostics, effectively mitigating the spread of the virus

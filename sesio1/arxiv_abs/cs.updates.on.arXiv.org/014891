We present approximation algorithms for the following NP-hard optimization problems related
to bottleneck spanning trees in metric spaces. 1. The disjoint bottleneck spanning tree problem:
Given $n$ pairs of points in a metric space, find two disjoint trees each containing exactly one point
from each pair and minimize the largest edge length (over all edges of both trees). It is known that
approximating this problem by a factor better than 2 is NP-hard. We present a 4-approximation algorithm
for this problem. This improves upon the previous best known approximation ratio of $9$. Our algorithm
extends to a $(3k-2)$-approximation for a more general case where points are partitioned into $k$-tuples
and we seek $k$ disjoint trees. 2. The generalized bottleneck spanning tree problem: Given $n$ points
in some metric space that are partitioned into clusters of size at most 2, find a tree that contains
exactly one point from each cluster and minimizes the largest edge length. We show that it is NP-hard
to approximate this problem by a factor better than 2, and present a 3-approximation algorithm.
3. The partitioned bottleneck spanning tree problem: Given $kn$ points in some metric space, find
$k$ trees each containing exactly $n$ points and minimize the largest edge length (over all edges
of the $k$ trees). We show that it is NP-hard to approximate this problem by a factor better than 2 for
any $k\ge 2$. We present an $\alpha$-approximation algorithm for this problem where $\alpha=2$
for $k=2,3$ and $\alpha=3$ for $k\ge 4$. Towards obtaining these approximation ratios we present
tight upper bounds on the edge lengths of $k$ equal-size disjoint trees that can be obtained from
the nodes of a given tree. This result is of independent interest. Our hardness proofs imply that
it is NP-hard to approximate the non-metric version of the above problems within any constant factor.

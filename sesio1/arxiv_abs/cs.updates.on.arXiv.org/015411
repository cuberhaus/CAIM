The canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) of a low rank tensor plays a major role in data analysis
and signal processing by allowing for unique recovery of underlying factors. However, it is well
known that the low rank CPD approximation problem is ill-posed. That is, a tensor may fail to have
a best rank $R$ CPD approximation when $R>1$. This article gives deterministic bounds for the existence
of best low rank tensor approximations over $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{C}$.
More precisely, given a tensor $\mathcal{T} \in \mathbb{K}^{I \times I \times I}$ of rank $R \leq
I$, we compute the radius of a Frobenius norm ball centered at $\mathcal{T}$ in which best $\mathbb{K}$-rank
$R$ approximations are guaranteed to exist. In addition we show that every $\mathbb{K}$-rank $R$
tensor inside of this ball has a unique canonical polyadic decomposition. This neighborhood may
be interpreted as a neighborhood of "mathematical truth" in with CPD approximation and computation
is well-posed. In pursuit of these bounds, we describe low rank tensor decomposition as a ``joint
generalized eigenvalue" problem. Using this framework, we show that, under mild assumptions,
a low rank tensor which has rank strictly greater than border rank is defective in the sense of algebraic
and geometric multiplicities for joint generalized eigenvalues. Bounds for existence of best
low rank approximations are then obtained by establishing perturbation theoretic results for
the joint generalized eigenvalue problem. In this way we establish a connection between existence
of best low rank approximations and the tensor spectral norm. In addition we solve a "tensor Procrustes
problem" which examines orthogonal compressions for pairs of tensors. The main results of the article
are illustrated by a variety of numerical experiments.

During a pandemic people have to find a trade-off between meeting others and staying safely at home.
While meeting others is pleasant, it also increases the risk of infection. We consider this dilemma
by introducing a game-theoretic network creation model in which selfish agents can form bilateral
connections. They benefit from network neighbors, but at the same time, they want to maximize their
distance to all other agents. This models the inherent conflict that social distancing rules impose
on the behavior of selfish agents in a social network. Besides addressing this familiar issue, our
model can be seen as the inverse to the well-studied Network Creation Game by Fabrikant et al. [PODC
2003] where agents aim at being as central as possible in the created network. Thus, our work is in-line
with studies that compare minimization problems with their maximization versions. We look at two
variants of network creation governed by social distancing. In the first variant, there are no restrictions
on the connections being formed. We characterize optimal and equilibrium networks, and we derive
asymptotically tight bounds on the Price of Anarchy and Price of Stability. The second variant is
the model's generalization that allows restrictions on the connections that can be formed. As our
main result, we prove that Swap-Maximal Routing-Cost Spanning Trees, an efficiently computable
weaker variant of Maximum Routing-Cost Spanning Trees, actually resemble equilibria for a significant
range of the parameter space. Moreover, we give almost tight bounds on the Price of Anarchy and Price
of Stability. These results imply that, compared the well-studied inverse models, under social
distancing the agents' selfish behavior has a significantly stronger impact on the quality of the
equilibria, i.e., allowing socially much worse stable states.

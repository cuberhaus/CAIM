It is known that Deep Neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and the adversarial
robustness of DNNs could be improved by adding adversarial noises to training data (e.g., the standard
adversarial training (SAT)). However, inappropriate noises added to training data may reduce
a model's performance, which is termed the trade-off between accuracy and robustness. This problem
has been sufficiently studied for the classification of whole images but has rarely been explored
for image analysis tasks in the medical application domain, including image segmentation, landmark
detection, and object detection tasks. In this study, we show that, for those medical image analysis
tasks, the SAT method has a severe issue that limits its practical use: it generates a fixed and unified
level of noise for all training samples for robust DNN training. A high noise level may lead to a large
reduction in model performance and a low noise level may not be effective in improving robustness.
To resolve this issue, we design an adaptive-margin adversarial training (AMAT) method that generates
sample-wise adaptive adversarial noises for robust DNN training. In contrast to the existing,
classification-oriented adversarial training methods, our AMAT method uses a loss-defined-margin
strategy so that it can be applied to different tasks as long as the loss functions are well-defined.
We successfully apply our AMAT method to state-of-the-art DNNs, using five publicly available
datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that: (1) our AMAT method can be applied to the three
seemingly different tasks in the medical image application domain; (2) AMAT outperforms the SAT
method in adversarial robustness; (3) AMAT has a minimal reduction in prediction accuracy on clean
data, compared with the SAT method; and (4) AMAT has almost the same training time cost as SAT.

Visible Light Communication (VLC) is one the most promising enabling technology for future 6G networks
to overcome Radio-Frequency (RF)-based communication limitations thanks to a broader bandwidth,
higher data rate, and greater efficiency. However, from the security perspective, VLCs suffer
from all known wireless communication security threats (e.g., eavesdropping and integrity attacks).
For this reason, security researchers are proposing innovative Physical Layer Security (PLS)
solutions to protect such communication. Among the different solutions, the novel Reflective
Intelligent Surface (RIS) technology coupled with VLCs has been successfully demonstrated in
recent work to improve the VLC communication capacity. However, to date, the literature still lacks
analysis and solutions to show the PLS capability of RIS-based VLC communication. In this paper,
we combine watermarking and jamming primitives through the Watermark Blind Physical Layer Security
(WBPLSec) algorithm to secure VLC communication at the physical layer. Our solution leverages
RIS technology to improve the security properties of the communication. By using an optimization
framework, we can calculate RIS phases to maximize the WBPLSec jamming interference schema over
a predefined area in the room. In particular, compared to a scenario without RIS, our solution improves
the performance in terms of secrecy capacity without any assumption about the adversary's location.
We validate through numerical evaluations the positive impact of RIS-aided solution to increase
the secrecy capacity of the legitimate jamming receiver in a VLC indoor scenario. Our results show
that the introduction of RIS technology extends the area where secure communication occurs and
that by increasing the number of RIS elements the outage probability decreases.

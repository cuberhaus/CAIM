Objective: The majority of detailed patient information in real-world data (RWD) is only consistently
available in free-text clinical documents. Manual curation is expensive and time-consuming.
Developing natural language processing (NLP) methods for structuring RWD is thus essential for
scaling real-world evidence generation. Materials and Methods: Traditional rule-based systems
are vulnerable to the prevalent linguistic variations and ambiguities in clinical text, and prior
applications of machine-learning methods typically require sentence-level or report-level
labeled examples that are hard to produce at scale. We propose leveraging patient-level supervision
from medical registries, which are often readily available and capture key patient information,
for general RWD applications. To combat the lack of sentence-level or report-level annotations,
we explore advanced deep-learning methods by combining domain-specific pretraining, recurrent
neural networks, and hierarchical attention. Results: We conduct an extensive study on 135,107
patients from the cancer registry of a large integrated delivery network (IDN) comprising healthcare
systems in five western US states. Our deep learning methods attain test AUROC of 94-99% for key tumor
attributes and comparable performance on held-out data from separate health systems and states.
Discussion and Conclusion: Ablation results demonstrate clear superiority of these advanced
deep-learning methods over prior approaches. Error analysis shows that our NLP system sometimes
even corrects errors in registrar labels. We also conduct a preliminary investigation in accelerating
registry curation and general RWD structuring via assisted curation for over 1.2 million cancer
patients in this healthcare network.

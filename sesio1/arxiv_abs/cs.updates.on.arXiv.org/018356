The Ethereum platform allows developers to implement and deploy applications called Dapps onto
the blockchain for public use through the use of smart contracts. To execute code within a smart contract,
a paid transaction must be issued towards one of the functions that are exposed in the interface of
a contract. However, such a transaction is only processed once one of the miners in the peer-to-peer
network selects it, adds it to a block, and appends that block to the blockchain This creates a delay
between transaction submission and code execution. It is crucial for Dapp developers to be able
to precisely estimate when transactions will be processed, since this allows them to define and
provide a certain Quality of Service (QoS) level (e.g., 95% of the transactions processed within
1 minute). However, the impact that different factors have on these times have not yet been studied.
Processing time estimation services are used by Dapp developers to achieve predefined QoS. Yet,
these services offer minimal insights into what factors impact processing times. Considering
the vast amount of data that surrounds the Ethereum blockchain, changes in processing times are
hard for Dapp developers to predict, making it difficult to maintain said QoS. In our study, we build
random forest models to understand the factors that are associated with transaction processing
times. We engineer several features that capture blockchain internal factors, as well as gas pricing
behaviors of transaction issuers. By interpreting our models, we conclude that features surrounding
gas pricing behaviors are very strongly associated with transaction processing times. Based on
our empirical results, we provide Dapp developers with concrete insights that can help them provide
and maintain high levels of QoS.

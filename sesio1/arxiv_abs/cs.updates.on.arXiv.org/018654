Prior research on intelligent reflection surface (IRS)-assisted unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
communications has focused on a fixed location for the IRS or mounted on a UAV. The assumption that
the IRS is located at a fixed position will prohibit mobile users from maximizing many wireless network
benefits, such as data rate and coverage. Furthermore, assuming that the IRS is placed on a UAV is
impractical for various reasons, including the IRS's weight and size and the speed of wind in severe
weather. Unlike previous studies, this study assumes a single UAV and an IRS mounted on a mobile ground
vehicle (M-IRS) to be deployed in an Internet-of-Things (IoT) 6G wireless network to maximize the
average data rate. Such a methodology for providing wireless coverage using an M-IRS assisted UAV
system is expected in smart cities. In this paper, we formulate an optimization problem to find an
efficient trajectory for the UAV, an efficient path for the M-IRS, and users' power allocation coefficients
that maximize the average data rate for mobile ground users. Due to its intractability, we propose
efficient techniques that can help in finding the solution to the optimization problem. First,
we show that our dynamic power allocation technique outperforms the fixed power allocation technique
in terms of network average sum rate. Then we employ the individual movement model (Random Waypoint
Model) in order to represent the users' movements inside the coverage area. Finally, we propose
an efficient approach using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for finding an efficient trajectory for the
UAV, and an efficient path for the M-IRS to provide wireless connectivity for mobile users during
their movement. We demonstrate through simulations that our methodology can enhance the average
data rate by 15\% on average compared with the static IRS and by 25\% on average compared without the
IRS system.

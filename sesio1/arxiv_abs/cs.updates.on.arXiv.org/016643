Nitsche's method is a well-established approach for weak enforcement of boundary conditions for
partial differential equations (PDEs). It has many desirable properties, including the preservation
of variational consistency and the fact that it yields symmetric, positive-definite discrete
linear systems that are not overly ill-conditioned. In recent years, the method has gained in popularity
in a number of areas, including isogeometric analysis, immersed methods, and contact mechanics.
However, arriving at a formulation based on Nitsche's method can be a mathematically arduous process,
especially for high-order PDEs. Fortunately, the derivation is conceptually straightforward
in the context of variational problems. To facilitate the process, we devised an abstract framework
for constructing Nitsche's method for these types of problems in [J. Benzaken, J. A. Evans, S. McCormick,
and R. Tamstorf, Nitsche's method for linear Kirchhoff-Love shells: Formulation, error analysis,
and verification, Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Eng., 374 (2021), p. 113544]. The goal of this paper
is to elucidate the process through a sequence of didactic examples. First, we show the derivation
of Nitsche's method for Poisson's equation to gain an intuition for the various steps. Next, we present
the abstract framework and then revisit the derivation for Poisson's equation to use the framework
and add mathematical rigor. In the process, we extend our derivation to cover the vector-valued
setting. Armed with a basic recipe, we then show how to handle a higher-order problem by considering
the vector-valued biharmonic equation and the linearized Kirchhoff-Love plate. In the end, the
hope is that the reader will be able to apply Nitsche's method to any problem that arises from variational
principles.

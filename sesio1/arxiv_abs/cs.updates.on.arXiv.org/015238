The existence of a universal learning architecture in human cognition is a widely spread conjecture
supported by experimental findings from neuroscience. While no low-level implementation can
be specified yet, an abstract outline of human perception and learning is believed to entail three
basic properties: (a) hierarchical attention and processing, (b) memory-based knowledge representation,
and (c) progressive learning and knowledge compaction. We approach the design of such a learning
architecture from a system-theoretic viewpoint, developing a closed-loop system with three main
components: (i) a multi-resolution analysis pre-processor, (ii) a group-invariant feature extractor,
and (iii) a progressive knowledge-based learning module. Multi-resolution feedback loops are
used for learning, i.e., for adapting the system parameters to online observations. To design (i)
and (ii), we build upon the established theory of wavelet-based multi-resolution analysis and
the properties of group convolution operators. Regarding (iii), we introduce a novel learning
algorithm that constructs progressively growing knowledge representations in multiple resolutions.
The proposed algorithm is an extension of the Online Deterministic Annealing (ODA) algorithm based
on annealing optimization, solved using gradient-free stochastic approximation. ODA has inherent
robustness and regularization properties and provides a means to progressively increase the complexity
of the learning model i.e. the number of the neurons, as needed, through an intuitive bifurcation
phenomenon. The proposed multi-resolution approach is hierarchical, progressive, knowledge-based,
and interpretable. We illustrate the properties of the proposed architecture in the context of
the state-of-the-art learning algorithms and deep learning methods.

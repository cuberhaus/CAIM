The primordial power spectrum informs the possible inflationary histories of our universe. Given
a power spectrum, the ensuing cosmic microwave background is calculated and compared to the observed
one. Thus, one focus of modern cosmology is building well-motivated inflationary models that predict
the primordial power spectrum observables. The common practice uses analytic terms for the scalar
spectral index $n_s$ and the index running $\alpha$, forgoing the effort required to evaluate the
model numerically. However, the validity of these terms has never been rigorously probed and relies
on perturbative methods, which may lose their efficacy for large perturbations. The requirement
for more accurate theoretical predictions becomes crucial with the advent of highly sensitive
measuring instruments. This paper probes the limits of the perturbative treatment that connects
inflationary potential parameters to primordial power spectrum observables. We show that the
validity of analytic approximations of the scalar index roughly respects the large-field/small-field
dichotomy. We supply an easily calculated measure for relative perturbation amplitude and show
that, for large field models, the validity of analytical terms extends to $\sim 3\%$ perturbation
relative to a power-law inflation model. Conversely, the analytical treatment loses its validity
for small-field models with as little as $0.1\%$ perturbation relative to the small-field test-case.
By employing the most general artificial neural networks and multinomial functions up to the twentieth
degree and demonstrating their shortcomings, we show that no reasonable analytic expressions
correlating small field models to the observables the yield exists. Finally, we discuss the possible
implications of this work and supply the validity heuristic for large and small field models.

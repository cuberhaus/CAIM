Given a probability distribution $\mathcal{D}$ over the non-negative integers, a $\mathcal{D}$-repeat
channel acts on an input symbol by repeating it a number of times distributed as $\mathcal{D}$. For
example, the binary deletion channel ($\mathcal{D}=Bernoulli$) and the Poisson repeat channel
($\mathcal{D}=Poisson$) are special cases. We say a $\mathcal{D}$-repeat channel is square-integrable
if $\mathcal{D}$ has finite first and second moments. In this paper, we construct explicit codes
for all square-integrable $\mathcal{D}$-repeat channels with rate arbitrarily close to the capacity,
that are encodable and decodable in linear and quasi-linear time, respectively. We also consider
possible extensions to the repeat channel model, and illustrate how our construction can be extended
to an even broader class of channels capturing insertions, deletions, and substitutions. Our work
offers an alternative, simplified, and more general construction to the recent work of Rubinstein
(arXiv:2111.00261), who attains similar results to ours in the cases of the deletion channel and
the Poisson repeat channel. It also improves on the decoding failure probability of the polar codes
constructions of Tal et al. for the deletion channel (ISIT 2019) and certain insertion/deletion/substitution
channels (arXiv:2102.02155). Our techniques follow closely the approaches of Guruswami and Li
(IEEEToIT 2019) and Con and Shpilka (IEEEToIT 2020); what sets apart our work is that we show that
a capacity-achieving code for the channels in question can be assumed to have an "approximate balance"
in the frequency of zeros and ones of all sufficiently long substrings of all codewords. This allows
us to attain near-capacity-achieving codes in a general setting. We consider this "approximate
balance" result to be of independent interest, as it can be cast in much greater generality than repeat
channels.

A deep learning-based model reduction (DeePMR) method for simplifying chemical kinetics is proposed
and validated using high-temperature auto-ignitions, perfectly stirred reactors (PSR), and
one-dimensional freely propagating flames of n-heptane/air mixtures. The mechanism reduction
is modeled as an optimization problem on Boolean space, where a Boolean vector, each entry corresponding
to a species, represents a reduced mechanism. The optimization goal is to minimize the reduced mechanism
size given the error tolerance of a group of pre-selected benchmark quantities. The key idea of the
DeePMR is to employ a deep neural network (DNN) to formulate the objective function in the optimization
problem. In order to explore high dimensional Boolean space efficiently, an iterative DNN-assisted
data sampling and DNN training procedure are implemented. The results show that DNN-assistance
improves sampling efficiency significantly, selecting only $10^5$ samples out of $10^{34}$ possible
samples for DNN to achieve sufficient accuracy. The results demonstrate the capability of the DNN
to recognize key species and reasonably predict reduced mechanism performance. The well-trained
DNN guarantees the optimal reduced mechanism by solving an inverse optimization problem. By comparing
ignition delay times, laminar flame speeds, temperatures in PSRs, the resulting skeletal mechanism
has fewer species (45 species) but the same level of accuracy as the skeletal mechanism (56 species)
obtained by the Path Flux Analysis (PFA) method. In addition, the skeletal mechanism can be further
reduced to 28 species if only considering atmospheric, near-stoichiometric conditions (equivalence
ratio between 0.6 and 1.2). The DeePMR provides an innovative way to perform model reduction and
demonstrates the great potential of data-driven methods in the combustion area.

Future Internet involves several emerging technologies such as 5G and beyond 5G networks, vehicular
networks, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks, and Internet of Things (IoTs). Moreover, future
Internet becomes heterogeneous and decentralized with a large number of involved network entities.
Each entity may need to make its local decision to improve the network performance under dynamic
and uncertain network environments. Standard learning algorithms such as single-agent Reinforcement
Learning (RL) or Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) have been recently used to enable each network
entity as an agent to learn an optimal decision-making policy adaptively through interacting with
the unknown environments. However, such an algorithm fails to model the cooperations or competitions
among network entities, and simply treats other entities as a part of the environment that may result
in the non-stationarity issue. Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) allows each network
entity to learn its optimal policy by observing not only the environments, but also other entities'
policies. As a result, MARL can significantly improve the learning efficiency of the network entities,
and it has been recently used to solve various issues in the emerging networks. In this paper, we thus
review the applications of MARL in the emerging networks. In particular, we provide a tutorial of
MARL and a comprehensive survey of applications of MARL in next generation Internet. In particular,
we first introduce single-agent RL and MARL. Then, we review a number of applications of MARL to solve
emerging issues in future Internet. The issues consist of network access, transmit power control,
computation offloading, content caching, packet routing, trajectory design for UAV-aided networks,
and network security issues.

UAVs have become one of the widely used remote sensing platforms and played a critical role in the
construction of smart cities. However, due to the complex environment in urban scenes, secure and
accurate data acquisition brings great challenges to 3D modeling and scene updating. Optimal trajectory
planning of UAVs and accurate data collection of onboard cameras are non-trivial issues in urban
modeling. This study presents the principle of optimized views photogrammetry and verifies its
precision and potential in large-scale 3D modeling. Different from oblique photogrammetry, optimized
views photogrammetry uses rough models to generate and optimize UAV trajectories, which is achieved
through the consideration of model point reconstructability and view point redundancy. Based
on the principle of optimized views photogrammetry, this study first conducts a precision analysis
of 3D models by using UAV images of optimized views photogrammetry and then executes a large-scale
case study in the urban region of Qingdao city, China, to verify its engineering potential. By using
GCPs for image orientation precision analysis and TLS (terrestrial laser scanning) point clouds
for model quality analysis, experimental results show that optimized views photogrammetry could
construct stable image connection networks and could achieve comparable image orientation accuracy.
Benefiting from the accurate image acquisition strategy, the quality of mesh models significantly
improves, especially for urban areas with serious occlusions, in which 3 to 5 times of higher accuracy
has been achieved. Besides, the case study in Qingdao city verifies that optimized views photogrammetry
can be a reliable and powerful solution for the large-scale 3D modeling in complex urban scenes.

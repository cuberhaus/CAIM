Digitization is penetrating more and more areas of life. Tasks are increasingly being completed
digitally, and are therefore not only fulfilled faster, more efficiently but also more purposefully
and successfully. The rapid developments in the field of artificial intelligence in recent years
have played a major role in this, as they brought up many helpful approaches to build on. At the same
time, the eyes, their movements, and the meaning of these movements are being progressively researched.
The combination of these developments has led to exciting approaches. In this dissertation, I present
some of these approaches which I worked on during my Ph.D. First, I provide insight into the development
of models that use artificial intelligence to connect eye movements with visual expertise. This
is demonstrated for two domains or rather groups of people: athletes in decision-making actions
and surgeons in arthroscopic procedures. The resulting models can be considered as digital diagnostic
models for automatic expertise recognition. Furthermore, I show approaches that investigate
the transferability of eye movement patterns to different expertise domains and subsequently,
important aspects of techniques for generalization. Finally, I address the temporal detection
of confusion based on eye movement data. The results suggest the use of the resulting model as a clock
signal for possible digital assistance options in the training of young professionals. An interesting
aspect of my research is that I was able to draw on very valuable data from DFB youth elite athletes
as well as on long-standing experts in arthroscopy. In particular, the work with the DFB data attracted
the interest of radio and print media, namely DeutschlandFunk Nova and SWR DasDing. All resulting
articles presented here have been published in internationally renowned journals or at conferences.

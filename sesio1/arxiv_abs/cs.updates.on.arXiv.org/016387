Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness and is the leading cause of irreversible blindness
disease in the world. Early screening for glaucoma in the population is significant. Color fundus
photography is the most cost effective imaging modality to screen for ocular diseases. Deep learning
network is often used in color fundus image analysis due to its powful feature extraction capability.
However, the model training of deep learning method needs a large amount of data, and the distribution
of data should be abundant for the robustness of model performance. To promote the research of deep
learning in color fundus photography and help researchers further explore the clinical application
signification of AI technology, we held a REFUGE2 challenge. This challenge released 2,000 color
fundus images of four models, including Zeiss, Canon, Kowa and Topcon, which can validate the stabilization
and generalization of algorithms on multi-domain. Moreover, three sub-tasks were designed in
the challenge, including glaucoma classification, cup/optic disc segmentation, and macular
fovea localization. These sub-tasks technically cover the three main problems of computer vision
and clinicly cover the main researchs of glaucoma diagnosis. Over 1,300 international competitors
joined the REFUGE2 challenge, 134 teams submitted more than 3,000 valid preliminary results, and
22 teams reached the final. This article summarizes the methods of some of the finalists and analyzes
their results. In particular, we observed that the teams using domain adaptation strategies had
high and robust performance on the dataset with multi-domain. This indicates that UDA and other
multi-domain related researches will be the trend of deep learning field in the future, and our REFUGE2
datasets will play an important role in these researches.

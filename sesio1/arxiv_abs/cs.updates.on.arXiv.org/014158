In this article, theory-based analytical methodologies of astrophysics employed in the modern
era are suitably operated alongside a test research-grade telescope to image and determine the
orbit of a near-earth asteroid from original observations, measurements, and calculations. Subsequently,
its intrinsic orbital path has been calculated including the chance it would likely impact Earth
in the time ahead. More so specifically, this case-study incorporates the most effective, feasible,
and novel Gauss's Method in order to maneuver the orbital plane components of a planetesimal, further
elaborating and extending our probes on a selected near-earth asteroid (namely the 12538-1998
OH) through the observational data acquired over a six week period. Utilizing the CCD (Charge Coupled
Device) snapshots captured, we simulate and calculate the orbit of our asteroid as outlined in quite
detailed explanations. The uncertainties and deviations from the expected values are derived
to reach a judgement whether our empirical findings are truly reliable and representative measurements
by partaking a statistical analysis based systematic approach. Concluding the study by narrating
what could have caused such discrepancy of findings in the first place, if any, measures are put forward
that could be undertaken to improve the test-case for future investigations. Following the calculation
of orbital elements and their uncertainties using Monte Carlo analysis, simulations were executed
with various sample celestial bodies to derive a plausible prediction regarding the fate of Asteroid
1998 OH. Finally, the astrometric and photometric data, after their precise verification, were
officially submitted to the Minor Planet Center: an organization hosted by the Center for Astrophysics,
Harvard and Smithsonian and funded by NASA, for keeping track of the asteroid's potential trajectories.

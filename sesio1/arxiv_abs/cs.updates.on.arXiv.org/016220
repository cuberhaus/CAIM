We present a machine learning based long-term cough monitoring system by detecting patient's bed
occupancy from a bed-attached smartphone-inbuilt accelerometer automatically. Previously
this system was used to detect cough events successfully and long-term cough monitoring requires
bed occupancy detection, as the initial experiments show that patients leave their bed very often
for long period of time and using video-monitoring or pressure sensors are not patient-favourite
alternatives. We have compiled a 249-hour dataset of manually-labelled acceleration signals
gathered from seven adult male patients undergoing treatment for tuberculosis (TB). The bed occupancy
detection process consists of three detectors, among which the first one classifies occupancy-change
with high sensitivity, low specificity and the second one classifies occupancy-interval with
high specificity, low sensitivity. The final state detector corrects the miss-classified sections.
After using a leave-one-patient-out cross-validation scheme to train and evaluate four classifiers
such as LR, MLP, CNN and LSTM; LSTM produces the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.94 while comparing
the predicted bed occupancy as the output from the final state detector with the actual bed occupancy
sample by sample. We have also calculated colony forming unit and time to positivity of the sputum
samples of TB positive patients who were monitored for 14 days and the proposed system was used to
predict daily cough rates. The results show that patients who improve under TB treatment have decreasing
daily cough rates, indicating the proposed automatic, quick, non-invasive, non-intrusive, cost-effective
long-term cough monitoring system can be extremely useful in monitoring patients' recovery rate.

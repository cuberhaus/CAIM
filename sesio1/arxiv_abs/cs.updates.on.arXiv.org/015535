Large-scale human mobility data is a key resource in data-driven policy making and across many scientific
fields. Most recently, mobility data was extensively used during the COVID-19 pandemic to study
the effects of governmental policies and to inform epidemic models. Large-scale mobility is often
measured using digital tools such as mobile phones. However, it remains an open question how truthfully
these digital proxies represent the actual travel behavior of the general population. Here, we
examine mobility datasets from multiple countries and identify two fundamentally different types
of bias caused by unequal access to, and unequal usage of mobile phones. We introduce the concept
of data generation bias, a previously overlooked type of bias, which is present when the amount of
data that an individual produces influences their representation in the dataset. We find evidence
for data generation bias in all examined datasets in that high-wealth individuals are overrepresented,
with the richest 20% contributing over 50% of all recorded trips, substantially skewing the datasets.
This inequality is consequential, as we find mobility patterns of different wealth groups to be
structurally different, where the mobility networks of high-wealth users are denser and contain
more long-range connections. To mitigate the skew, we present a framework to debias data and show
how simple techniques can be used to increase representativeness. Using our approach we show how
biases can severely impact outcomes of dynamic processes such as epidemic simulations, where biased
data incorrectly estimates the severity and speed of disease transmission. Overall, we show that
a failure to account for biases can have detrimental effects on the results of studies and urge researchers
and practitioners to account for data-fairness in all future studies of human mobility.

This article describes a software package called ROS georegistration intended for use with the
Robot Operating System (ROS) and the Gazebo 3D simulation environment. ROSgeoregistration provides
tools for the simulation, test and deployment of aerial georegistration algorithms and is made
available with a link provided in the paper. A model creation package is provided which downloads
multi-spectral images from the Google Earth Engine database and, if necessary, incorporates these
images into a single, possibly very large, reference image. Additionally a Gazebo plugin which
uses the real-time sensor pose and image formation model to generate simulated imagery using the
specified reference image is provided along with related plugins for UAV relevant data. The novelty
of this work is threefold: (1) this is the first system to link the massive multi-spectral imaging
database of Google's Earth Engine to the Gazebo simulator, (2) this is the first example of a system
that can simulate geospatially and radiometrically accurate imagery from multiple sensor views
of the same terrain region, and (3) integration with other UAS tools creates a new holistic UAS simulation
environment to support UAS system and subsystem development where real-world testing would generally
be prohibitive. Sensed imagery and ground truth registration information is published to client
applications which can receive imagery synchronously with telemetry from other payload sensors,
e.g., IMU, GPS/GNSS, barometer, and windspeed sensor data. To highlight functionality, we demonstrate
ROSgeoregistration for simulating Electro-Optical (EO) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image
sensors and an example use case for developing and evaluating image-based UAS position feedback,
i.e., pose for image-based Guidance Navigation and Control (GNC) applications.

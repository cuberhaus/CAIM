Molecular communication (MC) implemented on Nano networks has extremely attractive characteristics
in terms of energy efficiency, dependability, and robustness. Even though, the impact of incredibly
slow molecule diffusion and high variability environments remains unknown. Analysis and designs
of communication systems usually rely on developing mathematical models that describe the communication
channel. However, the underlying channel models are unknown in some systems, such as MC systems,
where chemical signals are used to transfer information. In these cases, a new method to analyze
and design is needed. In this paper, we concentrate on one critical aspect of the MC system, modelling
MC received signal until time t , and demonstrate that using tools from ML makes it promising to train
detectors that can be executed well without any information about the channel model. Machine learning
(ML) is one of the intelligent methodologies that has shown promising results in the domain. This
paper applies Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) for flexible pavement maintenance regressions
problems and solutions. For prediction, four parameters are used as inputs: the receiver radius,
transmitter radius, distance between receiver and transmitter, and diffusion coefficient, while
the output is mAP (mean average precision) of the received signal. Azure ML enables algorithms that
can learn from data and experiences and accomplish tasks without having to be coded. In the established
Azure ML, the regression algorithms such as, boost decision tree regression, Bayesian linear regression,
neural network, and decision forest regression are selected. The best performance is chosen as
an optimality criterion. Finally, a comparison that shows the potential benefits of Azure ML tool
over programmed based tool (Python), used by developers on local PCs, is demonstrated

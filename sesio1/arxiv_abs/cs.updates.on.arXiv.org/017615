Multiple access (MA) design is investigated for facilitating the coexistence of the emerging semantic
transmission and the conventional bit-based transmission in future networks. The semantic rate
is considered for measuring the performance of the semantic transmission. However, a key challenge
is that there is a lack of a closed-form expression for a key parameter, namely the semantic similarity,
which characterizes the sentence similarity between an original sentence and the corresponding
recovered sentence. To overcome this challenge, we propose a data regression method, where the
semantic similarity is approximated by a generalized logistic function. Using the obtained tractable
function, we propose a heterogeneous semantic and bit communication framework, where an access
point simultaneously sends the semantic and bit streams to one semantics-interested user (S-user)
and one bit-interested user (B-user). To realize this heterogeneous semantic and bit transmission
in multi-user networks, three MA schemes are proposed, namely orthogonal multiple access (OMA),
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and semi-NOMA. More specifically, the bit stream in semi-NOMA
is split into two streams, one is transmitted with the semantic stream over the shared frequency
sub-band and the other is transmitted over the separate orthogonal frequency sub-band. To study
the fundamental performance limits of the three proposed MA schemes, the semantic-versus-bit
(SvB) rate region and the power region are defined. An optimal resource allocation procedure is
then derived for characterizing the boundary of the SvB rate region and the power region achieved
by each MA scheme. The structures of the derived solutions demonstrate that semi-NOMA is superior
to both NOMA and OMA given its highly flexible transmission policy. Our numerical results validate
the analysis and show the superiority of semi-NOMA.

We propose and experimentally motivate a new methodology to support decision-making processes
in healthcare with artificial intelligence based on personal rankings of care decision making
steps that can be identified with our methodology, questionnaire data and its statistical patterns.
Our longitudinal quantitative cross-sectional three-stage study gathered self-ratings for
437 expression statements concerning healthcare situations on Likert scales in respect to "the
need for help", "the advancement of health", "the hopefulness", "the indication of compassion"
and "the health condition", and 45 answers about the person's demographics, health and wellbeing,
also the duration of giving answers. Online respondents between 1 June 2020 and 29 June 2021 were
recruited from Finnish patient and disabled people's organizations, other health-related organizations
and professionals, and educational institutions (n=1075). With Kruskal-Wallis test, Wilcoxon
rank-sum test (i.e., Mann-Whitney U test), Wilcoxon rank-sum pairwise test, Welch's t test and
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) between groups test we identified statistically significant
differences of ratings and their durations for each expression statement in respect to respondent
groupings based on the answer values of each background question. Frequencies of the later reordering
of rating rankings showed dependencies with ratings given earlier in respect to various interpretation
task entities, interpretation dimensions and respondent groupings. Our methodology, questionnaire
data and its statistical patterns enable analyzing with self-rated expression statements the
representations of decision making steps in healthcare situations and their chaining, agglomeration
and branching in knowledge entities of personalized care paths. Our results support building artificial
intelligence solutions to address the patient's needs concerning care.

The curation of large-scale medical datasets from multiple institutions necessary for training
deep learning models is challenged by the difficulty in sharing patient data with privacy-preserving.
Federated learning (FL), a paradigm that enables privacy-protected collaborative learning among
different institutions, is a promising solution to this challenge. However, FL generally suffers
from performance deterioration due to heterogeneous data distributions across institutions
and the lack of quality labeled data. In this paper, we present a robust and label-efficient self-supervised
FL framework for medical image analysis. Specifically, we introduce a novel distributed self-supervised
pre-training paradigm into the existing FL pipeline (i.e., pre-training the models directly on
the decentralized target task datasets). Built upon the recent success of Vision Transformers,
we employ masked image encoding tasks for self-supervised pre-training, to facilitate more effective
knowledge transfer to downstream federated models. Extensive empirical results on simulated
and real-world medical imaging federated datasets show that self-supervised pre-training largely
benefits the robustness of federated models against various degrees of data heterogeneity. Notably,
under severe data heterogeneity, our method, without relying on any additional pre-training data,
achieves an improvement of 5.06%, 1.53% and 4.58% in test accuracy on retinal, dermatology and chest
X-ray classification compared with the supervised baseline with ImageNet pre-training. Moreover,
we show that our self-supervised FL algorithm generalizes well to out-of-distribution data and
learns federated models more effectively in limited label scenarios, surpassing the supervised
baseline by 10.36% and the semi-supervised FL method by 8.3% in test accuracy.

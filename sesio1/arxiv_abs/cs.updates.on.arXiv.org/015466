Software developers often look for solutions to their code-level problems by submitting questions
to technical Q&A websites like Stack Overflow (SO). They usually include example code segments
with questions to describe the programming issues. SO users prefer to reproduce the reported issues
using the given code segments when they attempt to answer the questions. Unfortunately, such code
segments could not always reproduce the issues due to several unmet challenges (e.g., external
library not found) that might prevent questions from receiving prompt and appropriate solutions.
A previous study produced a catalog of potential challenges that hinder the reproducibility of
issues reported at SO questions. However, it is unknown how the practitioners (i.e., developers)
perceive the challenge catalog. Understanding the developers' perspective is inevitable to introduce
interactive tool support that promotes reproducibility. We thus attempt to understand developers'
perspectives by surveying 53 users of SO. In particular, we attempt to -- (1) see developers' viewpoints
on the agreement to those challenges, (2) find the potential impact of those challenges, (3) see
how developers address them, and (4) determine and prioritize tool support needs. Survey results
show that about 90% of participants agree to the already exposed challenges. However, they report
some additional challenges (e.g., error log missing) that might prevent reproducibility. According
to the participants, too short code segment and absence of required Class/Interface/Method from
code segments severely prevent reproducibility, followed by missing important part of code. To
promote reproducibility, participants strongly recommend introducing tool support that interacts
with question submitters with suggestions for improving the code segments if the given code segments
fail to reproduce the issues.

Radiography is often used to probe complex, evolving density fields in dynamic systems and in so
doing gain insight into the underlying physics. This technique has been used in numerous fields
including materials science, shock physics, inertial confinement fusion, and other national
security applications. In many of these applications, however, complications resulting from
noise, scatter, complex beam dynamics, etc. prevent the reconstruction of density from being accurate
enough to identify the underlying physics with sufficient confidence. As such, density reconstruction
from static/dynamic radiography has typically been limited to identifying discontinuous features
such as cracks and voids in a number of these applications. In this work, we propose a fundamentally
new approach to reconstructing density from a temporal sequence of radiographic images. Using
only the robust features identifiable in radiographs, we combine them with the underlying hydrodynamic
equations of motion using a machine learning approach, namely, conditional generative adversarial
networks (cGAN), to determine the density fields from a dynamic sequence of radiographs. Next,
we seek to further enhance the hydrodynamic consistency of the ML-based density reconstruction
through a process of parameter estimation and projection onto a hydrodynamic manifold. In this
context, we note that the distance from the hydrodynamic manifold given by the training data to the
test data in the parameter space considered both serves as a diagnostic of the robustness of the predictions
and serves to augment the training database, with the expectation that the latter will further reduce
future density reconstruction errors. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of this method to outperform
a traditional radiographic reconstruction in capturing allowable hydrodynamic paths even when
relatively small amounts of scatter are present.

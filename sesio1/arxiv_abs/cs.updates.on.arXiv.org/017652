The Li-ion battery is a complex physicochemical system that generally takes applied current as
input and terminal voltage as output. The mappings from current to voltage can be described by several
kinds of models, such as accurate but inefficient physics-based models, and efficient but sometimes
inaccurate equivalent circuit and black-box models. To realize accuracy and efficiency simultaneously
in battery modeling, we propose to build a data-driven surrogate for a battery system while incorporating
the underlying physics as constraints. In this work, we innovatively treat the functional mapping
from current curve to terminal voltage as a composite of operators, which is approximated by the
powerful deep operator network (DeepONet). Its learning capability is firstly verified through
a predictive test for Li-ion concentration at two electrodes. In this experiment, the physics-informed
DeepONet is found to be more robust than the purely data-driven DeepONet, especially in temporal
extrapolation scenarios. A composite surrogate is then constructed for mapping current curve
and solid diffusivity to terminal voltage with three operator networks, in which two parallel physics-informed
DeepONets are firstly used to predict Li-ion concentration at two electrodes, and then based on
their surface values, a DeepONet is built to give terminal voltage predictions. Since the surrogate
is differentiable anywhere, it is endowed with the ability to learn from data directly, which was
validated by using terminal voltage measurements to estimate input parameters. The proposed surrogate
built upon operator networks possesses great potential to be applied in on-board scenarios, such
as battery management system, since it integrates efficiency and accuracy by incorporating underlying
physics, and also leaves an interface for model refinement through a totally differentiable model
structure.

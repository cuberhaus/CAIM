Background: A new illness could first come to the public attention over social media before it is
medically defined, formally documented or systematically studied. One example is a phenomenon
known as breast implant illness (BII) that has been extensively discussed on social media, though
vaguely defined in medical literature. Objectives: The objective of this study is to construct
a data analysis pipeline to understand emerging illness using social media data, and to apply the
pipeline to understand key attributes of BII. Methods: We conducted a pipeline of social media data
analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and topic modeling. We extracted mentions related
to signs/symptoms, diseases/disorders and medical procedures using the Clinical Text Analysis
and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES) from social media data. We mapped the mentions to standard
medical concepts. We summarized mapped concepts to topics using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).
Finally, we applied this pipeline to understand BII from several BII-dedicated social media sites.
Results: Our pipeline identified topics related to toxicity, cancer and mental health issues that
are highly associated with BII. Our pipeline also shows that cancers, autoimmune disorders and
mental health problems are emerging concerns associated with breast implants based on social media
discussions. The pipeline also identified mentions such as rupture, infection, pain and fatigue
as common self-reported issues among the public, as well as toxicity from silicone implants. Conclusions:
Our study could inspire future work studying the suggested symptoms and factors of BII. Our study
provides the first analysis and derived knowledge of BII from social media using NLP techniques,
and demonstrates the potential of using social media information to better understand similar
emerging illnesses.

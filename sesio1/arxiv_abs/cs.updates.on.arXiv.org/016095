Many neuromuscular disorders impair function of cranial nerve enervated muscles. Clinical assessment
of cranial muscle function has several limitations. Clinician rating of symptoms suffers from
inter-rater variation, qualitative or semi-quantitative scoring, and limited ability to capture
infrequent or fluctuating symptoms. Patient-reported outcomes are limited by recall bias and
poor precision. Current tools to measure orofacial and oculomotor function are cumbersome, difficult
to implement, and non-portable. Here, we show how Earable, a wearable device, can discriminate
certain cranial muscle activities such as chewing, talking, and swallowing. We demonstrate using
data from a pilot study of 10 healthy participants how Earable can be used to measure features from
EMG, EEG, and EOG waveforms from subjects performing mock Performance Outcome Assessments (mock-PerfOs),
utilized widely in clinical research. Our analysis pipeline provides a framework for how to computationally
process and statistically rank features from the Earable device. Finally, we demonstrate that
Earable data may be used to classify these activities. Our results, conducted in a pilot study of
healthy participants, enable a more comprehensive strategy for the design, development, and analysis
of wearable sensor data for investigating clinical populations. Additionally, the results from
this study support further evaluation of Earable or similar devices as tools to objectively measure
cranial muscle activity in the context of a clinical research setting. Future work will be conducted
in clinical disease populations, with a focus on detecting disease signatures, as well as monitoring
intra-subject treatment responses. Readily available quantitative metrics from wearable sensor
devices like Earable support strategies for the development of novel digital endpoints, a hallmark
goal of clinical research.

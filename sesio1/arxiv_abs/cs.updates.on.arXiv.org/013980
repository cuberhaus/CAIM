Background and Aim: Accurate classification of Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) is essential to
accurately predict Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) conversion. Meanwhile,
deep learning has been successfully implemented to classify and predict dementia disease. However,
the accuracy of MRI image classification is low. This paper aims to increase the accuracy and reduce
the processing time of classification through Deep Learning Architecture by using Elastic Net
Regularization in Feature Selection. Methodology: The proposed system consists of Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) to enhance the accuracy of classification and prediction by using Elastic
Net Regularization. Initially, the MRI images are fed into CNN for features extraction through
convolutional layers alternate with pooling layers, and then through a fully connected layer.
After that, the features extracted are subjected to Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and Elastic
Net Regularization for feature selection. Finally, the selected features are used as an input to
Extreme Machine Learning (EML) for the classification of MRI images. Results: The result shows
that the accuracy of the proposed solution is better than the current system. In addition to that,
the proposed method has improved the classification accuracy by 5% on average and reduced the processing
time by 30 ~ 40 seconds on average. Conclusion: The proposed system is focused on improving the accuracy
and processing time of MCI converters/non-converters classification. It consists of features
extraction, feature selection, and classification using CNN, FreeSurfer, PCA, Elastic Net, Extreme
Machine Learning. Finally, this study enhances the accuracy and the processing time by using Elastic
Net Regularization, which provides important selected features for classification.

We introduce the problem of unitarization. Unitarization is the problem of taking $k$ input quantum
circuits that produce orthogonal states from the all $0$ state, and create an output circuit implementing
a unitary with its first $k$ columns as those states. That is, the output circuit takes the $k$th computational
basis state to the state prepared by the $k$th input circuit. We allow the output circuit to use ancilla
qubits initialized to $0$. But ancilla qubits must always be returned to $0$ for any input. The input
circuits may use ancilla qubits, but we are only guaranteed the they return ancilla qubits to $0$
on the all $0$ input. The unitarization problem seems hard if the output states are neither orthogonal
to or in the span of the computational basis states that need to map to them. In this work, we approximately
solve this problem in the case where input circuits are given as black box oracles by probably finding
an approximate basis for our states. This method may be more interesting than the application. This
technique is a sort of quantum analogue of Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization for quantum states.
Specifically, we find an approximate basis in polynomial time for the following parameters. Take
any natural $n$, $k = O\left(\frac{\ln(n)}{\ln(\ln(n))}\right)$, and $\epsilon = 2^{-O(\sqrt{\ln(n)})}$.
Take any $k$ input quantum states, $(|\psi_i \rangle)_{i\in [k]}$, on polynomial in $n$ qubits
prepared by quantum oracles, $(V_i)_{i \in [k]}$ (that we can control call and control invert).
Then there is a quantum circuit with polynomial size in $n$ with access to the oracles $(V_i)_{i \in
[k]}$ that with at least $1 - \epsilon$ probability, computes at most $k$ circuits with size polynomial
in $n$ and oracle access to $(V_i)_{i \in [k]}$ that $\epsilon$ approximately computes an $\epsilon$
approximate orthonormal basis for $(|\psi_i \rangle)_{i\in [k]}$.

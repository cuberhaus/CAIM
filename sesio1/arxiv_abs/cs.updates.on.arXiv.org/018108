Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) have been widely used in image classification. Over the years,
they have also benefited from various enhancements and they are now considered as state of the art
techniques for image like data. However, when they are used for regression to estimate some function
value from images, fewer recommendations are available. In this study, a novel CNN regression model
is proposed. It combines convolutional neural layers to extract high level features representations
from images with a soft labelling technique. More specifically, as the deep regression task is challenging,
the idea is to account for some uncertainty in the targets that are seen as distributions around their
mean. The estimations are carried out by the model in the form of distributions. Building from earlier
work, a specific histogram loss function based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is applied
during training. The model takes advantage of the CNN feature representation and is able to carry
out estimation from multi-channel input images. To assess and illustrate the technique, the model
is applied to Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) multi-path estimation where multi-path
signal parameters have to be estimated from correlator output images from the I and Q channels. The
multi-path signal delay, magnitude, Doppler shift frequency and phase parameters are estimated
from synthetically generated datasets of satellite signals. Experiments are conducted under
various receiving conditions and various input images resolutions to test the estimation performances
quality and robustness. The results show that the proposed soft labelling CNN technique using distributional
loss outperforms classical CNN regression under all conditions. Furthermore, the extra learning
performance achieved by the model allows the reduction of input image resolution from 80x80 down
to 40x40 or sometimes 20x20.

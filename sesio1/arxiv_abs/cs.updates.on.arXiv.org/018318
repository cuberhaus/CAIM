Surface codes are generally studied based on the assumption that each of the qubits that make up the
surface code lattice suffers noise that is independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.).
However, real benchmarks of the individual relaxation ($T_1$) and dephasing ($T_2$) times of the
constituent qubits of state-of-the-art quantum processors have recently shown that the decoherence
effects suffered by each particular qubit actually vary in intensity. In consequence, in this article
we introduce the independent non-identically distributed (i.ni.d.) noise model, a decoherence
model that accounts for the non-uniform behaviour of the docoherence parameters of qubits. Additionally,
we use the i.ni.d model to study how it affects the performance of a specific family of Quantum Error
Correction (QEC) codes known as planar codes. For this purpose we employ data from four state-of-the-art
superconducting processors: ibmq\_brooklyn, ibm\_washington, Zuchongzhi and Rigetti Aspen-M-1.
Our results show that the i.i.d. noise assumption overestimates the performance of surface codes,
which can suffer up to $95\%$ performance decrements in terms of the code pseudo-threshold when
they are subjected to the i.ni.d. noise model. Furthermore, we consider and describe two methods
which enhance the performance of planar codes under i.ni.d. noise. The first method involves a so-called
re-weighting process of the conventional minimum weight perfect matching (MWPM) decoder, while
the second one exploits the relationship that exists between code performance and qubit arrangement
in the surface code lattice. The optimum qubit configuration derived through the combination of
the previous two methods can yield planar code pseudo-threshold values that are up to $650\%$ higher
than for the traditional MWPM decoder under i.ni.d. noise.

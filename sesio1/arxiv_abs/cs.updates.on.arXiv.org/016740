Among the seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) proposed within the 2030 Agenda and adopted
by all the United Nations member states, the 13$^{th}$ SDG is a call for action to combat climate change
for a better world. In this work, we provide an overview of areas in which audio intelligence -- a powerful
but in this context so far hardly considered technology -- can contribute to overcome climate-related
challenges. We categorise potential computer audition applications according to the five elements
of earth, water, air, fire, and aether, proposed by the ancient Greeks in their five element theory;
this categorisation serves as a framework to discuss computer audition in relation to different
ecological aspects. Earth and water are concerned with the early detection of environmental changes
and, thus, with the protection of humans and animals, as well as the monitoring of land and aquatic
organisms. Aerial audio is used to monitor and obtain information about bird and insect populations.
Furthermore, acoustic measures can deliver relevant information for the monitoring and forecasting
of weather and other meteorological phenomena. The fourth considered element is fire. Due to the
burning of fossil fuels, the resulting increase in CO$_2$ emissions and the associated rise in temperature,
fire is used as a symbol for man-made climate change and in this context includes the monitoring of
noise pollution, machines, as well as the early detection of wildfires. In all these areas, computer
audition can help counteract climate change. Aether then corresponds to the technology itself
that makes this possible. This work explores these areas and discusses potential applications,
while positioning computer audition in relation to methodological alternatives.

By trade we usually mean the exchange of goods between states and countries. International trade
acts as a barometer of the economic prosperity index and every country is overly dependent on resources,
so international trade is essential. Trade is significant to the global health crisis, saving lives
and livelihoods. By collecting the dataset called "Effects of COVID19 on trade" from the state website
NZ Tatauranga Aotearoa, we have developed a sustainable prediction process on the effects of COVID-19
in world trade using a deep learning model. In the research, we have given a 180-day trade forecast
where the ups and downs of daily imports and exports have been accurately predicted in the Covid-19
period. In order to fulfill this prediction, we have taken data from 1st January 2015 to 30th May 2021
for all countries, all commodities, and all transport systems and have recovered what the world
trade situation will be in the next 180 days during the Covid-19 period. The deep learning method
has received equal attention from both investors and researchers in the field of in-depth observation.
This study predicts global trade using the Long-Short Term Memory. Time series analysis can be useful
to see how a given asset, security, or economy changes over time. Time series analysis plays an important
role in past analysis to get different predictions of the future and it can be observed that some factors
affect a particular variable from period to period. Through the time series it is possible to observe
how various economic changes or trade effects change over time. By reviewing these changes, one
can be aware of the steps to be taken in the future and a country can be more careful in terms of imports
and exports accordingly. From our time series analysis, it can be said that the LSTM model has given
a very gracious thought of the future world import and export situation in terms of trade.

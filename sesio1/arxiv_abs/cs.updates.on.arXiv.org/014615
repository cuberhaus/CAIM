This paper presents the first large-scale multi-species dataset of acoustic recordings of mosquitoes
tracked continuously in free flight. We present 20 hours of audio recordings that we have expertly
labelled and tagged precisely in time. Significantly, 18 hours of recordings contain annotations
from 36 different species. Mosquitoes are well-known carriers of diseases such as malaria, dengue
and yellow fever. Collecting this dataset is motivated by the need to assist applications which
utilise mosquito acoustics to conduct surveys to help predict outbreaks and inform intervention
policy. The task of detecting mosquitoes from the sound of their wingbeats is challenging due to
the difficulty in collecting recordings from realistic scenarios. To address this, as part of the
HumBug project, we conducted global experiments to record mosquitoes ranging from those bred in
culture cages to mosquitoes captured in the wild. Consequently, the audio recordings vary in signal-to-noise
ratio and contain a broad range of indoor and outdoor background environments from Tanzania, Thailand,
Kenya, the USA and the UK. In this paper we describe in detail how we collected, labelled and curated
the data. The data is provided from a PostgreSQL database, which contains important metadata such
as the capture method, age, feeding status and gender of the mosquitoes. Additionally, we provide
code to extract features and train Bayesian convolutional neural networks for two key tasks: the
identification of mosquitoes from their corresponding background environments, and the classification
of detected mosquitoes into species. Our extensive dataset is both challenging to machine learning
researchers focusing on acoustic identification, and critical to entomologists, geo-spatial
modellers and other domain experts to understand mosquito behaviour, model their distribution,
and manage the threat they pose to humans.

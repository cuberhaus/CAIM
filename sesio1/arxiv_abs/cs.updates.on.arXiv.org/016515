Optimal treatment regimes are personalized policies for making a treatment decision based on subject
characteristics, with the policy chosen to maximize some value. It is common to aim to maximize the
mean outcome in the population, via a regime assigning treatment only to those whose mean outcome
is higher under treatment versus control. However, the mean can be an unstable measure of centrality,
resulting in imprecise statistical procedures, as well as unrobust decisions that can be overly
influenced by a small fraction of subjects. In this work, we propose a new median optimal treatment
regime that instead treats individuals whose conditional median is higher under treatment. This
ensures that optimal decisions for individuals from the same group are not overly influenced either
by (i) a small fraction of the group (unlike the mean criterion), or (ii) unrelated subjects from
different groups (unlike marginal median/quantile criteria). We introduce a new measure of value,
the Average Conditional Median Effect (ACME), which summarizes across-group median treatment
outcomes of a policy, and which the median optimal treatment regime maximizes. After developing
key motivating examples that distinguish median optimal treatment regimes from mean and marginal
median optimal treatment regimes, we give a nonparametric efficiency bound for estimating the
ACME of a policy, and propose a new doubly robust-style estimator that achieves the efficiency bound
under weak conditions. To construct the median optimal treatment regime, we introduce a new doubly
robust-style estimator for the conditional median treatment effect. Finite-sample properties
are explored via numerical simulations and the proposed algorithm is illustrated using data from
a randomized clinical trial in patients with HIV.

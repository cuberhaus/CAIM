Real-world IP network traffic is susceptible to external and internal factors such as new internet
service integration, traffic migration, internet application, etc. Due to these factors, the
actual internet traffic is non-linear and challenging to analyze using a statistical model for
future prediction. In this paper, we investigated and evaluated the performance of different statistical
prediction models for real IP network traffic; and showed a significant improvement in prediction
using the rolling prediction technique. Initially, a set of best hyper-parameters for the corresponding
prediction model is identified by analyzing the traffic characteristics and implementing a grid
search algorithm based on the minimum Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Then, we performed a
comparative performance analysis among AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Seasonal
ARIMA (SARIMA), SARIMA with eXogenous factors (SARIMAX), and Holt-Winter for single-step prediction.
The seasonality of our traffic has been explicitly modeled using SARIMA, which reduces the rolling
prediction Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE) by more than 4% compared to ARIMA (incapable of
handling the seasonality). We further improved traffic prediction using SARIMAX to learn different
exogenous factors extracted from the original traffic, which yielded the best rolling prediction
results with a MAPE of 6.83%. Finally, we applied the exponential smoothing technique to handle
the variability in traffic following the Holt-Winter model, which exhibited a better prediction
than ARIMA (around 1.5% less MAPE). The rolling prediction technique reduced prediction error
using real Internet Service Provider (ISP) traffic data by more than 50\% compared to the standard
prediction method.

High-resolution (HR) hyperspectral face image plays an important role in face related computer
vision tasks under uncontrolled conditions, such as low-light environment and spoofing attacks.
However, the dense spectral bands of hyperspectral face images come at the cost of limited amount
of photons reached a narrow spectral window on average, which greatly reduces the spatial resolution
of hyperspectral face images. In this paper, we investigate how to adapt the deep learning techniques
to hyperspectral face image super-resolution (HFSR), especially when the training samples are
very limited. Benefiting from the amount of spectral bands, in which each band can be seen as an image,
we present a spectral splitting and aggregation network (SSANet) for HFSR with limited training
samples. In the shallow layers, we split the hyperspectral image into different spectral groups
and take each of them as an individual training sample (in the sense that each group will be fed into
the same network). Then, we gradually aggregate the neighbor bands at the deeper layers to exploit
the spectral correlations. By this spectral splitting and aggregation strategy (SSAS), we can
divide the original hyperspectral image into multiple samples to support the efficient training
of the network and effectively exploit the spectral correlations among spectrum. To cope with the
challenge of small training sample size (S3) problem, we propose to expand the training samples
by a self-representation model and symmetry-induced augmentation. Experiments show that the
introduced SSANet can well model the joint correlations of spatial and spectral information. By
expanding the training samples, our proposed method can effectively alleviate the S3 problem.
The comparison results demonstrate that our proposed method can outperform the state-of-the-arts.

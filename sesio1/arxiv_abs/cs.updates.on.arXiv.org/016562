A fundamental task underlying many important optimization problems, from influence maximization
to sensor placement to content recommendation, is to select the optimal group of $k$ items from a
larger set. Submodularity has been very effective in allowing approximation algorithms for such
subset selection problems. However, in several applications, we are interested not only in the
elements of a set, but also the order in which they appear, breaking the assumption that all selected
items receive equal consideration. One such category of applications involves the presentation
of search results, product recommendations, news articles, and other content, due to the well-documented
phenomenon that humans pay greater attention to higher-ranked items. As a result, optimization
in content presentation for diversity, user coverage, calibration, or other objectives more accurately
represents a sequence selection problem, to which traditional submodularity approximation results
no longer apply. Although extensions of submodularity to sequences have been proposed, none is
designed to model settings where items contribute based on their position in a ranked list, and hence
they are not able to express these types of optimization problems. In this paper, we aim to address
this modeling gap. Here, we propose a new formalism of ordered submodularity that captures these
ordering problems in content presentation, and more generally a category of optimization problems
over ranked sequences in which different list positions contribute differently to the objective
function. We analyze the natural ordered analogue of the greedy algorithm and show that it provides
a $2$-approximation. We also show that this bound is tight, establishing that our new framework
is conceptually and quantitatively distinct from previous formalisms of set and sequence submodularity.

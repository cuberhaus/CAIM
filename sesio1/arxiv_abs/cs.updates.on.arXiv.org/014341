Simulation based or dynamic probabilistic risk assessment methodologies were primarily developed
for proving a more realistic and complete representation of complex systems accident response.
Such simulation based methodologies have proven to be particularly powerful for systems with control
loops and complex interactions between its elements, be they hardware, software, or human, as they
provide a natural probabilistic environment to include physical models of system behavior (e.g.,
coupled neutronics and thermal hydraulic codes for nuclear power plants), mechanistic models
of materials or hardware systems to predict failure, and those of natural hazards. Despite the advancements
in simulation based methodologies, the fundamental challenge still persists as the space of possible
probabilistic system trajectories is nearly infinite in size in simulating even systems of relatively
low complexity. In this paper, a framework is developed to identify rare and extreme events and enabling
the use of reverse trajectories to trace failures (or other system states) to causes for potential
mitigation actions. This framework consists of an Intelligent Guidance module, Trajectory Generation
module and Physical Simulation module. The Intelligent Guidance module provides planning information
to the Trajectory Generation module that creates scenarios by interacting with the Physical Simulation
in its environment. In turn, system trajectories or scenarios are created and post processed to
provide updating information to the Intelligent Guidance module or aggregate the results when
stopping criteria are met. The objective of guided simulation is to control the growth of the scenario
tree and to efficiently identify important scenarios that meet single or multiple criteria. We
present several solution strategies, both qualitative and data driven for each module.

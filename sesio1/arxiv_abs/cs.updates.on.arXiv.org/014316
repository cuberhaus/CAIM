Raga is a central musical concept in South Asia, especially India, and we investigate connections
between Western classical music and Melakarta raga that is a raga in Karnatak (south Indian) classical
music, through musical icosahedron. In our previous study, we introduced some kinds of musical
icosahedra connecting various musical concepts in Western music: chromatic/whole tone musical
icosahedra, Pythagorean/whole tone musical icosahedra, and exceptional musical icosahedra.
In this paper, first, we introduce kinds of musical icosahedra that connect the above musical icosahedra
through two kinds of permutations of 12 tones: inter-permutations and intra-permutations, and
we call them intermediate musical icosahedra. Next, we define a neighboring number as a number of
pairs of neighboring two tones in a given scale that neighbor each other on a given musical icosahedron,
and we also define a musical invariant as a linear combination of the neighboring numbers. We find
there exists a pair of a musical invariant and scales that is constant for some musical icosahedra
and analyze their mathematical structure. Last, we define an extension of a given scale by the inter-permutations
of a given musical icosahedron: the permutation-extension. Then, we show that the permutation-extension
of the C major scale by Melakarta raga musical icosahedra that are four of the intermediate musical
icosahedra from the type 1 chromatic/whole tone musical icosahedron to the type 1' Pythagorean/whole
tone musical icosahedron, is a set of all the scales included in Melakarta raga. There exists a musical
invariant that is constant for all the musical icosahedra corresponding to the scales of Melakarta
raga, and we obtained a diagram representation of those scales characterizing the musical invariant.

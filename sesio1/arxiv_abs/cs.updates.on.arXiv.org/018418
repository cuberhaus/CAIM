We study constant-cost randomized communication problems and relate them to implicit graph representations
in structural graph theory. Specifically, constant-cost communication problems correspond
to hereditary graph families that admit constant-size adjacency sketches, or equivalently constant-size
probabilistic universal graphs (PUGs), and these graph families are a subset of families that admit
adjacency labeling schemes of size O(log n), which are the subject of the well-studied implicit
graph question (IGQ). We initiate the study of the hereditary graph families that admit constant-size
PUGs, with the two (equivalent) goals of (1) understanding randomized constant-cost communication
problems, and (2) understanding a probabilistic version of the IGQ. For each family $\mathcal F$
studied in this paper (including the monogenic bipartite families, product graphs, interval and
permutation graphs, families of bounded twin-width, and others), it holds that the subfamilies
$\mathcal H \subseteq \mathcal F$ are either stable (in a sense relating to model theory), in which
case they admit constant-size PUGs, or they are not stable, in which case they do not. The correspondence
between communication problems and hereditary graph families allows for a new method of constructing
adjacency labeling schemes. By this method, we show that the induced subgraphs of any Cartesian
products are positive examples to the IGQ. We prove that this probabilistic construction cannot
be derandomized by using an Equality oracle, i.e. the Equality oracle cannot simulate the k-Hamming
Distance communication protocol. We also obtain constant-size sketches for deciding $\mathsf{dist}(x,
y) \le k$ for vertices $x$, $y$ in any stable graph family with bounded twin-width. This generalizes
to constant-size sketches for deciding first-order formulas over the same graphs.

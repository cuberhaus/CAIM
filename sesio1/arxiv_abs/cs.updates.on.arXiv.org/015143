Deepfake is content or material that is synthetically generated or manipulated using artificial
intelligence (AI) methods, to be passed off as real and can include audio, video, image, and text
synthesis. This survey has been conducted with a different perspective compared to existing survey
papers, that mostly focus on just video and image deepfakes. This survey not only evaluates generation
and detection methods in the different deepfake categories, but mainly focuses on audio deepfakes
that are overlooked in most of the existing surveys. This paper critically analyzes and provides
a unique source of audio deepfake research, mostly ranging from 2016 to 2020. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first survey focusing on audio deepfakes in English. This survey provides readers with
a summary of 1) different deepfake categories 2) how they could be created and detected 3) the most
recent trends in this domain and shortcomings in detection methods 4) audio deepfakes, how they
are created and detected in more detail which is the main focus of this paper. We found that Generative
Adversarial Networks(GAN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Deep Neural Networks (DNN)
are common ways of creating and detecting deepfakes. In our evaluation of over 140 methods we found
that the majority of the focus is on video deepfakes and in particular in the generation of video deepfakes.
We found that for text deepfakes there are more generation methods but very few robust methods for
detection, including fake news detection, which has become a controversial area of research because
of the potential of heavy overlaps with human generation of fake content. This paper is an abbreviated
version of the full survey and reveals a clear need to research audio deepfakes and particularly
detection of audio deepfakes.

In the task of Chinese named entity recognition based on deep learning, activation function plays
an irreplaceable role, it introduces nonlinear characteristics into neural network, so that the
fitted model can be applied to various tasks. However, the information density of industrial safety
analysis text is relatively high, and the correlation and similarity between the information are
large, which is easy to cause the problem of high deviation and high standard deviation of the model,
no specific activation function has been designed in previous studies, and the traditional activation
function has the problems of gradient vanishing and negative region, which also lead to the recognition
accuracy of the model can not be further improved. To solve these problems, a novel activation function
AIS is proposed in this paper. AIS is an activation function applied in industrial safety engineering,
which is composed of two piecewise nonlinear functions. In the positive region, the structure combining
exponential function and quadratic function is used to alleviate the problem of deviation and standard
deviation, and the linear function is added to modify it, which makes the whole activation function
smoother and overcomes the problem of gradient vanishing. In the negative region, the cubic function
structure is used to solve the negative region problem and accelerate the convergence of the model.
Based on the deep learning model of BERT-BiLSTM-CRF, the performance of AIS is evaluated. The results
show that, compared with other activation functions, AIS overcomes the problems of gradient vanishing
and negative region, reduces the deviation of the model, speeds up the model fitting, and improves
the extraction ability of the model for industrial entities.

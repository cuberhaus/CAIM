We consider the fundamental problem of assigning distinct labels to agents in the probabilistic
model of population protocols. Our protocols operate under the assumption that the size $n$ of the
population is embedded in the transition function. Our labeling protocols are silent w.h.p., i.e.,
eventually each agent reaches its final state and remains in it forever w.h.p., as well as safe, i.e.,
never update the label assigned to any single agent. We first present a fast, silent w.h.p.and safe
labeling protocol for which the required number of interactions is asymptotically optimal, i.e.,
$O(n \log n/\epsilon)$ w.h.p. It uses $(2+\epsilon)n+O(n^c)$ states, for any $c<1,$ and the label
range $1,\dots,(1+\epsilon)n.$ Furthermore, we consider the so-called pool labeling protocols
that include our fast protocol. We show that the expected number of interactions required by any
pool protocol is $\ge \frac{n^2}{r+1}$, when the labels range is $1,\dots, n+r<2n.$ Next, we provide
a protocol which is silent and safe once a unique leader is provided, and uses only $n+5\sqrt n +O(n^c)$
states, for any $c<1,$ and draws labels from the range $1,\dots,n.$ The expected number of interactions
required by the protocol is $O(n^3).$ On the other hand, we show that (even if a unique leader is given
in advance) any silent protocol that produces a valid labeling and is safe with probability $>1-\frac
1n$, uses $\ge n+\sqrt {n-1} -1$ states. Hence, our protocol is almost state-optimal. We also present
a generalization of the protocol to include a trade-off between the number of states and the expected
number of interactions. Furthermore, we show that for any silent and safe labeling protocol utilizing
$n+t<2n$ states the expected number of interactions required to achieve a valid labeling is $\ge
\frac{n^2}{t+1}$.

Software-related platforms have enabled their users to collaboratively label software entities
with topics. Tagging software repositories with relevant topics can be exploited for facilitating
various downstream tasks. For instance, a correct and complete set of topics assigned to a repository
can increase its visibility. Consequently, this improves the outcome of tasks such as browsing,
searching, navigation, and organization of repositories. Unfortunately, assigned topics are
usually highly noisy, and some repositories do not have well-assigned topics. Thus, there have
been efforts on recommending topics for software projects, however, the semantic relationships
among these topics have not been exploited so far. We propose two recommender models for tagging
software projects that incorporate the semantic relationship among topics. Our approach has two
main phases; (1) we first take a collaborative approach to curate a dataset of quality topics specifically
for the domain of software engineering and development. We also enrich this data with the semantic
relationships among these topics and encapsulate them in a knowledge graph we call SED-KGraph.
Then, (2) we build two recommender systems; The first one operates only based on the list of original
topics assigned to a repository and the relationships specified in our knowledge graph. The second
predictive model, however, assumes there are no topics available for a repository, hence it proceeds
to predict the relevant topics based on both textual information of a software project and SED-KGraph.
We built SED-KGraph in a crowd-sourced project with 170 contributors from both academia and industry.
The experiment results indicate that our solutions outperform baselines that neglect the semantic
relationships among topics by at least 25% and 23% in terms of ASR and MAP metrics.

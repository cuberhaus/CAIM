We propose a new abstraction set (SynopSet) that has a continuum of visual representations for the
explanatory analysis of molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) in the DNA nanotechnology domain.
By re-purposing the commonly used progress bar and designing novel visuals, as well as transforming
the data from the domain format to a format that better fits the newly designed visuals, we compose
this new set of representations. This set is also designed to be capable of showing all spatial and
temporal details, and all structural complexity, or abstracting these to various degrees, enabling
both the slow playback of the simulation for detailed examinations or very fast playback for an overview
that helps to efficiently identify events of interest, as well as several intermediate levels between
these two extremes. For any pair of successive representations, we demonstrate smooth, continuous
transitions, enabling users to keep track of relevant information from one representation to the
next. By providing multiple representations suited to different temporal resolutions and connected
by smooth transitions, we enable time-efficient simulation analysis, giving users the opportunity
to examine and present important phases in great detail, or leverage abstract representations
to go over uneventful phases much faster. Domain experts can thus gain actionable insight about
their simulations and communicate it in a much shorter time. Further, the novel representations
are more intuitive and also enable researchers unfamiliar with MDS analysis graphs to better understand
the simulation results. We assessed the effectiveness of SynopSet on 12 DNA nanostructure simulations
together with a domain expert. We have also shown that our set of representations can be systematically
located in a visualization space, dubbed SynopSpace.

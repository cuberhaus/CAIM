Visual-Inertial odometry (VIO) is known to suffer from drifting especially over long-term runs.
In this paper, we present GVINS, a non-linear optimization based system that tightly fuses GNSS
raw measurements with visual and inertial information for real-time and drift-free state estimation.
Our system aims to provide accurate global 6-DoF estimation under complex indoor-outdoor environment
where GNSS signals may be intermittent or even totally unavailable. To connect global measurements
with local states, a coarse-to-fine initialization procedure is proposed to efficiently calibrate
the transformation online and initialize GNSS states from only a short window of measurements.
The GNSS code pseudorange and Doppler shift measurements, along with visual and inertial information,
are then modelled and used to constrain the system states in a factor graph framework. For complex
and GNSS-unfriendly areas, the degenerate cases are discussed and carefully handled to ensure
robustness. Thanks to the tightly-coupled multi-sensor approach and system design, our system
fully exploits the merits of three types of sensors and is capable to seamlessly cope with the transition
between indoor and outdoor environments, where satellites are lost and reacquired. We extensively
evaluate the proposed system by both simulation and real-world experiments, and the result demonstrates
that our system substantially eliminates the drift of VIO and preserves the local accuracy in spite
of noisy GNSS measurements. The challenging indoor-outdoor and urban driving experiments verify
the availability and robustness of GVINS in complex environments. In addition, experiments also
show that our system can gain from even a single satellite while conventional GNSS algorithms need
four at least.

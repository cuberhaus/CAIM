Person search aims to simultaneously localize and identify a query person from realistic, uncropped
images. To achieve this goal, state-of-the-art models typically add a re-id branch upon two-stage
detectors like Faster R-CNN. Owing to the ROI-Align operation, this pipeline yields promising
accuracy as re-id features are explicitly aligned with the corresponding object regions, but in
the meantime, it introduces high computational overhead due to dense object anchors. In this work,
we present an anchor-free approach to efficiently tackling this challenging task, by introducing
the following dedicated designs. First, we select an anchor-free detector (i.e., FCOS) as the prototype
of our framework. Due to the lack of dense object anchors, it exhibits significantly higher efficiency
compared with existing person search models. Second, when directly accommodating this anchor-free
detector for person search, there exist several major challenges in learning robust re-id features,
which we summarize as the misalignment issues in different levels (i.e., scale, region, and task).
To address these issues, we propose an aligned feature aggregation module to generate more discriminative
and robust feature embeddings. Accordingly, we name our model as Feature-Aligned Person Search
Network (AlignPS). Third, by investigating the advantages of both anchor-based and anchor-free
models, we further augment AlignPS with an ROI-Align head, which significantly improves the robustness
of re-id features while still keeping our model highly efficient. Extensive experiments conducted
on two challenging benchmarks (i.e., CUHK-SYSU and PRW) demonstrate that our framework achieves
state-of-the-art or competitive performance, while displaying higher efficiency. All the source

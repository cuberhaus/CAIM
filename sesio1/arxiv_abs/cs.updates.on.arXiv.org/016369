Color fundus photography and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) are the two most cost-effective
tools for glaucoma screening. Both two modalities of images have prominent biomarkers to indicate
glaucoma suspected. Clinically, it is often recommended to take both of the screenings for a more
accurate and reliable diagnosis. However, although numerous algorithms are proposed based on
fundus images or OCT volumes in computer-aided diagnosis, there are still few methods leveraging
both of the modalities for the glaucoma assessment. Inspired by the success of Retinal Fundus Glaucoma
Challenge (REFUGE) we held previously, we set up the Glaucoma grAding from Multi-Modality imAges
(GAMMA) Challenge to encourage the development of fundus \& OCT-based glaucoma grading. The primary
task of the challenge is to grade glaucoma from both the 2D fundus images and 3D OCT scanning volumes.
As part of GAMMA, we have publicly released a glaucoma annotated dataset with both 2D fundus color
photography and 3D OCT volumes, which is the first multi-modality dataset for glaucoma grading.
In addition, an evaluation framework is also established to evaluate the performance of the submitted
methods. During the challenge, 1272 results were submitted, and finally, top-10 teams were selected
to the final stage. We analysis their results and summarize their methods in the paper. Since all
these teams submitted their source code in the challenge, a detailed ablation study is also conducted
to verify the effectiveness of the particular modules proposed. We find many of the proposed techniques
are practical for the clinical diagnosis of glaucoma. As the first in-depth study of fundus \& OCT
multi-modality glaucoma grading, we believe the GAMMA Challenge will be an essential starting
point for future research.

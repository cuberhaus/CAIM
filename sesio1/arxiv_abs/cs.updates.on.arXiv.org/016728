Spatial symmetries and invariances play an important role in the description of materials. When
modelling material properties, it is important to be able to respect such invariances. Here we discuss
how to model and generate random ensembles of tensors where one wants to be able to prescribe certain
classes of spatial symmetries and invariances for the whole ensemble, while at the same time demanding
that the mean or expected value of the ensemble to be subject to a possibly 'higher' spatial invariance
class. Our special interest is in the class of physically symmetric and positive definite tensors,
as they appear often in the description of materials. As the set of positive definite tensors is not
a linear space, but rather an open convex cone in the linear vector space of physically symmetric
tensors, we consider it advantageous to widen the notion of mean to the so-called Fr\'echet mean
on a metric space, which is based on distance measures or metrics between positive definite tensors
other than the usual Euclidean one. For the sake of simplicity, as well as to expose the main idea as
clearly as possible, we limit ourselves here to second order tensors. It is shown how the random ensemble
can be modelled and generated, with a fine control of the spatial symmetry or invariance of the whole
ensemble, as well as its Fr\'echet mean, independently in its scaling and orientational or directional
aspects. As an example, a 2D and a 3D model of steady-state heat conduction in a human proximal femur,
a bone with high material anisotropy, is explored. It is modelled with a random thermal conductivity
tensor, and the numerical results show the distinct impact of incorporating into the constitutive
model different material uncertainties$-$scaling, orientation, and prescribed material symmetry$-$on
the desired quantities of interest, such as temperature distribution and heat flux.

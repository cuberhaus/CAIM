The massive growth of network traffic data leads to a large volume of datasets. Labeling these datasets
for identifying intrusion attacks is very laborious and error-prone. Furthermore, network traffic
data have complex time-varying non-linear relationships. The existing state-of-the-art intrusion
detection solutions use a combination of various supervised approaches along with fused features
subsets based on correlations in traffic data. These solutions often require high computational
cost, manual support in fine-tuning intrusion detection models, and labeling of data that limit
real-time processing of network traffic. Unsupervised solutions do reduce computational complexities
and manual support for labeling data but current unsupervised solutions do not consider spatio-temporal
correlations in traffic data. To address this, we propose a unified Autoencoder based on combining
multi-scale convolutional neural network and long short-term memory (MSCNN-LSTM-AE) for anomaly
detection in network traffic. The model first employs Multiscale Convolutional Neural Network
Autoencoder (MSCNN-AE) to analyze the spatial features of the dataset, and then latent space features
learned from MSCNN-AE employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based Autoencoder Network to process
the temporal features. Our model further employs two Isolation Forest algorithms as error correction
mechanisms to detect false positives and false negatives to improve detection accuracy. %Additionally,
covariance matrices forms a Riemannian manifold that is naturally embedded with distance metrices
that facilitates descriminative patterns for detecting malicious network traffic. We evaluated
our model NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CICDDoS2019 dataset and showed our proposed method significantly
outperforms the conventional unsupervised methods and other existing studies on the dataset.

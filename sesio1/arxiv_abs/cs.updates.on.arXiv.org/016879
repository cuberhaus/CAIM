Text-based computational approaches for assessing the quality of psychotherapy are being developed
to support quality assurance and clinical training. However, due to the long durations of typical
conversation based therapy sessions, and due to limited annotated modeling resources, computational
methods largely rely on frequency-based lexical features or dialogue acts to assess the overall
session level characteristics. In this work, we propose a hierarchical framework to automatically
evaluate the quality of transcribed Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) interactions. Given the
richly dynamic nature of the spoken dialog within a talk therapy session, to evaluate the overall
session level quality, we propose to consider modeling it as a function of local variations across
the interaction. To implement that empirically, we divide each psychotherapy session into conversation
segments and initialize the segment-level qualities with the session-level scores. First, we
produce segment embeddings by fine-tuning a BERT-based model, and predict segment-level (local)
quality scores. These embeddings are used as the lower-level input to a Bidirectional LSTM-based
neural network to predict the session-level (global) quality estimates. In particular, we model
the global quality as a linear function of the local quality scores, which allows us to update the
segment-level quality estimates based on the session-level quality prediction. These newly estimated
segment-level scores benefit the BERT fine-tuning process, which in turn results in better segment
embeddings. We evaluate the proposed framework on automatically derived transcriptions from
real-world CBT clinical recordings to predict session-level behavior codes. The results indicate
that our approach leads to improved evaluation accuracy for most codes when used for both regression
and classification tasks.

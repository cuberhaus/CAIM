Convolutional Neural network-based MR reconstruction methods have shown to provide fast and high
quality reconstructions. A primary drawback with a CNN-based model is that it lacks flexibility
and can effectively operate only for a specific acquisition context limiting practical applicability.
By acquisition context, we mean a specific combination of three input settings considered namely,
the anatomy under study, undersampling mask pattern and acceleration factor for undersampling.
The model could be trained jointly on images combining multiple contexts. However the model does
not meet the performance of context specific models nor extensible to contexts unseen at train time.
This necessitates a modification to the existing architecture in generating context specific
weights so as to incorporate flexibility to multiple contexts. We propose a multiple acquisition
context based network, called MAC-ReconNet for MRI reconstruction, flexible to multiple acquisition
contexts and generalizable to unseen contexts for applicability in real scenarios. The proposed
network has an MRI reconstruction module and a dynamic weight prediction (DWP) module. The DWP module
takes the corresponding acquisition context information as input and learns the context-specific
weights of the reconstruction module which changes dynamically with context at run time. We show
that the proposed approach can handle multiple contexts based on cardiac and brain datasets, Gaussian
and Cartesian undersampling patterns and five acceleration factors. The proposed network outperforms
the naive jointly trained model and gives competitive results with the context-specific models
both quantitatively and qualitatively. We also demonstrate the generalizability of our model
by testing on contexts unseen at train time.

Deep transformer neural network models have improved the predictive accuracy of intelligent text
processing systems in the biomedical domain. They have obtained state-of-the-art performance
scores on a wide variety of biomedical and clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP) benchmarks.
However, the robustness and reliability of these models has been less explored so far. Neural NLP
models can be easily fooled by adversarial samples, i.e. minor changes to input that preserve the
meaning and understandability of the text but force the NLP system to make erroneous decisions.
This raises serious concerns about the security and trust-worthiness of biomedical NLP systems,
especially when they are intended to be deployed in real-world use cases. We investigated the robustness
of several transformer neural language models, i.e. BioBERT, SciBERT, BioMed-RoBERTa, and Bio-ClinicalBERT,
on a wide range of biomedical and clinical text processing tasks. We implemented various adversarial
attack methods to test the NLP systems in different attack scenarios. Experimental results showed
that the biomedical NLP models are sensitive to adversarial samples; their performance dropped
in average by 21 and 18.9 absolute percent on character-level and word-level adversarial noise,
respectively. Conducting extensive adversarial training experiments, we fine-tuned the NLP
models on a mixture of clean samples and adversarial inputs. Results showed that adversarial training
is an effective defense mechanism against adversarial noise; the models robustness improved in
average by 11.3 absolute percent. In addition, the models performance on clean data increased in
average by 2.4 absolute present, demonstrating that adversarial training can boost generalization
abilities of biomedical NLP systems.

Wildland fires pose an increasingly serious problem in our society. The number and severity of these
fires has been rising for many years. Wildfires pose direct threats to life and property as well as
threats through ancillary effects like reduced air quality. The aim of this thesis is to develop
techniques to help combat the impacts of wildfires by improving wildfire modeling capabilities
by using satellite fire observations. Already much work has been done in this direction by other
researchers. Our work seeks to expand the body of knowledge using mathematically sound methods
to utilize information about wildfires that considers the uncertainties inherent in the satellite
data. In this thesis we explore methods for using satellite data to help initialize and steer wildfire
simulations. In particular, we develop a method for constructing the history of a fire, a new technique
for assimilating wildfire data, and a method for modifying the behavior of a modeled fire by inferring
information about the fuels in the fire domain. These goals rely on being able to estimate the time
a fire first arrived at every location in a geographic region of interest. Because detailed knowledge
of real wildfires is typically unavailable, the basic procedure for developing and testing the
methods in this thesis will be to first work with simulated data so that the estimates produced can
be compared with known solutions. The methods thus developed are then applied to real-world scenarios.
Analysis of these scenarios shows that the work with constructing the history of fires and data assimilation
improves improves fire modeling capabilities. The research is significant because it gives us
a better understanding of the capabilities and limitations of using satellite data to inform wildfire
models and it points the way towards new avenues for modeling fire behavior.

Estimating forest aboveground biomass at fine spatial scales has become increasingly important
for greenhouse gas estimation, monitoring, and verification efforts to mitigate climate change.
Airborne LiDAR continues to be a valuable source of remote sensing data for estimating aboveground
biomass. However airborne LiDAR collections may take place at local or regional scales covering
irregular, non-contiguous footprints, resulting in a 'patchwork' of different landscape segments
at different points in time. Here we addressed common obstacles including selection of training
data, the investigation of regional or coverage specific patterns in bias and error, and map agreement,
and model-based precision assessments at multiple scales. Three machine learning algorithms
and an ensemble model were trained using field inventory data (FIA), airborne LiDAR, and topographic,
climatic and cadastral geodata. Using strict selection criteria, 801 FIA plots were selected with
co-located point clouds drawn from a patchwork of 17 leaf-off LiDAR coverages 2014-2019). Our ensemble
model created 30m AGB prediction surfaces within a predictor-defined area of applicability (98%
of LiDAR coverage) and resulting AGB predictions were compared with FIA plot-level and areal estimates
at multiple scales of aggregation. Our model was overall accurate (% RMSE 13-33%), had very low bias
(MBE $\leq$ $\pm$5 Mg ha$^{-1}$), explained most field-observed variation (R$^2$ 0.74-0.93),
produced estimates that were both largely consistent with FIA's aggregate summaries (86% of estimates
within 95% CI), as well as precise when aggregated to arbitrary small-areas (mean bootstrap standard
error 0.37 Mg ha$^{-1}$). We share practical solutions to challenges faced when using spatiotemporal
patchworks of LiDAR to meet growing needs for biomass prediction and mapping, and applications
in carbon accounting and ecosystem stewardship.

We analyze the high-SNR regime of the MxK Network MISO channel in which each transmitter has access
to a different channel estimate, possibly with different precision. It has been recently shown
that, for some regimes, this setting attains the same Degrees-of-Freedom as the ideal centralized
setting with perfect CSI sharing, in which all the transmitters are endowed with the best estimate
available at any transmitter. This result is restricted by the limitations of the DoF metric, as
it only provides information about the slope of growth of the capacity as a function of the SNR, without
any insight about the possible performance at a given SNR. To overcome this limitation, we analyze
the affine approximation of the rate on the high-SNR regime for this decentralized Network MISO
setting for the antenna configurations in which it achieves the DoF of the centralized setting.
We show that, for a regime of antenna configurations, it is possible to asymptotically attain the
same achievable rate as in the ideal centralized scenario. Consequently, it is possible to achieve
the beamforming gain of the ideal perfect-CSI-sharing setting even if only a subset of transmitters
is endowed with precise CSI, which can be exploited in scenarios such as distributed massive MIMO
where the number of transmit antennas is much bigger than the number of served users. This outcome
is a consequence of the synergistic compromise between CSI precision at the transmitters and consistency
between the locally-computed precoders, which is an inherent trade-off of decentralized settings
that does not exist in a centralized CSI configuration. We propose a precoding scheme achieving
the previous result, which is built on an uneven structure in which some transmitters reduce the
precision of their own precoding for the sake of using transmission parameters that can be more easily
predicted by the other transmitters.

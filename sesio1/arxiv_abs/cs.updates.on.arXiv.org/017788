The mechanism of our NN is in line with the results of the latest MIT brain plasticity study, in which
researchers found that as a synapse strengthens, neighboring synapses automatically weaken themselves
to compensate. Regarding this mechanism, Dr. Luo's team at Stanford University has put forward
that competition regarding synapse formation for dendritic morphogenesis is crucial. The astrocyte
impacts on Brain Plasticity and Synapse Formation is an important mechanism of our NN at critical
period and closure of critical period. We try to conduct research of failure in brain plasticity
by model at the closure of critical period by contrasting with studies before. Cutting edge imaging
and genetic tools are combined in their studies, whereas our research lays more emphasis on a new
NN. In tests, possible explanations of dendrite morphogenesis are derived, which demonstrate
that dendrite generation, to a certain extent, is curbed by synapse formation. Current and mnemonic
brain plasticity as well as synaptic action range are also taken into account in the study. Furthermore,
the frame of NN is based on current and mnemonic dynamic gradient informational synapse formation.
The mnemonic gradient information needs to take into account the forgotten memory-astrocytic
synapse formation memory factor. Mnemonic brain plasticity involves the plus or minus disturbance-astrocytic
brain plasticity phagocytose factor. The influence of astrocyte made local synaptic action range
remain in an appropriate length at critical period. Through the tabular data of the PNN test, we found
that the memory factor of astrocytes, like the phagocytose factor, produces the effect of reducing
the local accumulation of synapses. Therefore, is it possible to reduce the number of animal experiments
and their suffering by simulating and planning the factors of biological experiments through Deep
Learning models?

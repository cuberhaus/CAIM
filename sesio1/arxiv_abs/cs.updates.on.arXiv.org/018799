Reliable quantification of natural and anthropogenic gas release (e.g.\ CO$_2$, methane) from
the seafloor into the water column, and potentially to the atmosphere, is a challenging task. While
ship-based echo sounders such as single beam and multibeam systems allow detection of free gas,
bubbles, in the water even from a great distance, exact quantification utilizing the hydroacoustic
data requires additional parameters such as rise speed and bubble size distribution. Optical methods
are complementary in the sense that they can provide high temporal and spatial resolution of single
bubbles or bubble streams from close distance. In this contribution we introduce a complete instrument
and evaluation method for optical bubble stream characterization targeted at flows of up to 100ml/min
and bubbles with a few millimeters radius. The dedicated instrument employs a high-speed deep sea
capable stereo camera system that can record terabytes of bubble imagery when deployed at a seep
site for later automated analysis. Bubble characteristics can be obtained for short sequences,
then relocating the instrument to other locations, or in autonomous mode of definable intervals
up to several days, in order to capture bubble flow variations due to e.g. tide dependent pressure
changes or reservoir depletion. Beside reporting the steps to make bubble characterization robust
and autonomous, we carefully evaluate the reachable accuracy to be in the range of 1-2\% of the bubble
radius and propose a novel auto-calibration procedure that, due to the lack of point correspondences,
uses only the silhouettes of bubbles. The system has been operated successfully in 1000m water depth
at the Cascadia margin offshore Oregon to assess methane fluxes from various seep locations. Besides
sample results we also report failure cases and lessons learnt during deployment and method development.

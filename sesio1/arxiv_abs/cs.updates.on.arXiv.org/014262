Online auctions are one of the most fundamental facets of the modern economy and power an industry
generating hundreds of billions of dollars a year in revenue. Auction theory has historically focused
on the question of designing the best way to sell a single item to potential buyers, with the concurrent
objectives of maximizing revenue generated or welfare created. Theoretical results in this area
have typically relied on some prior Bayesian knowledge agents were assumed to have on each-other.
This assumption is no longer satisfied in new markets such as online advertising: similar items
are sold repeatedly, and agents are unaware of each other or might try to manipulate each-other.
On the other hand, statistical learning theory now provides tools to supplement those missing pieces
of information given enough data, as agents can learn from their environment to improve their strategies.
This survey covers recent advances in learning in repeated auctions, starting from the traditional
economic study of optimal one-shot auctions with a Bayesian prior. We then focus on the question
of learning optimal mechanisms from a dataset of bidders' past values. The sample complexity as
well as the computational efficiency of different methods will be studied. We will also investigate
online variants where gathering data has a cost to be accounted for, either by seller or buyers ("earning
while learning"). Later in the survey, we will further assume that bidders are also adaptive to the
mechanism as they interact repeatedly with the same seller. We will show how strategic agents can
actually manipulate repeated auctions, to their own advantage. All the questions discussed in
this survey are grounded in real-world applications and many of the ideas and algorithms we describe
are used every day to power the Internet economy.

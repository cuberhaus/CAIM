Safety-critical designs need to ensure reliable operations under hostile conditions with a certain
degree of confidence. The continuously higher complexity of these designs makes them more susceptible
to the risk of failure. ISO26262 recommends fault injection as the proper technique to verify and
measure the dependability of safety-critical designs. To cope with the complexity, a lot of effort
and stringent verification flow is needed. Moreover, many fault injection tools offer only a limited
degree of controllability. We propose MetaFI, a model-driven simulator-independent fault simulation
framework that provides multi-purpose fault injection strategies such as Statistical Fault Injection,
Direct Fault Injection, Exhaustive Fault Injection, and at the same time reduces manual efforts.
The framework enables injection of Stuck-at faults, Single-Event Transient faults, Single-Event
Upset faults as well as Timing faults. The fault simulation is performed at the Register Transfer
Level (RTL) of a design, in which parts of the design targeted for fault simulation are represented
with Gate-level (GL) granularity. MetaFI is scalable with a full System-on-Chip (SoC) design and
to demonstrate the applicability of the framework, fault simulation was applied to various components
of two different SoCs. One SoC is running the Dhrystone application and the other one is running a
Fingerprint calculation application. A minimal effort of 2 persondays was required to run 38 various
fault injection campaigns on both the designs. The framework provided significant data regarding
failure rates of the components. Results concluded that Prefetcher, a component of the SoC processor,
is more susceptible to failures than the other targeted components on both the SoCs, regardless
of the running application.

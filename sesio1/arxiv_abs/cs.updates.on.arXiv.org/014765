Source camera identification tools assist image forensic investigators to associate an image
in question with a suspect camera. Various techniques have been developed based on the analysis
of the subtle traces left in the images during the acquisition. The Photo Response Non Uniformity
(PRNU) noise pattern caused by sensor imperfections has been proven to be an effective way to identify
the source camera. The existing literature suggests that the PRNU is the only fingerprint that is
device-specific and capable of identifying the exact source device. However, the PRNU is susceptible
to camera settings, image content, image processing operations, and counter-forensic attacks.
A forensic investigator unaware of counter-forensic attacks or incidental image manipulations
is at the risk of getting misled. The spatial synchronization requirement during the matching of
two PRNUs also represents a major limitation of the PRNU. In recent years, deep learning based approaches
have been successful in identifying source camera models. However, the identification of individual
cameras of the same model through these data-driven approaches remains unsatisfactory. In this
paper, we bring to light the existence of a new robust data-driven device-specific fingerprint
in digital images which is capable of identifying the individual cameras of the same model. It is
discovered that the new device fingerprint is location-independent, stochastic, and globally
available, which resolve the spatial synchronization issue. Unlike the PRNU, which resides in
the high-frequency band, the new device fingerprint is extracted from the low and mid-frequency
bands, which resolves the fragility issue that the PRNU is unable to contend with. Our experiments
on various datasets demonstrate that the new fingerprint is highly resilient to image manipulations
such as rotation, gamma correction, and aggressive JPEG compression.

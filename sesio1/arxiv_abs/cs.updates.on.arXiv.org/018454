Risk measures are commonly used to capture the risk preferences of decision-makers (DMs). The decisions
of DMs can be nudged or manipulated when their risk preferences are influenced by factors like the
perception of losses and the availability of information about the uncertainties. In this work,
we propose a Stackelberg risk preference design (STRIPE) problem to capture a designer's incentive
to influence DMs' risk preferences. STRIPE consists of two levels. In the lower-level, individual
DMs in a population, known as the followers, respond to uncertainties according to their risk preference
types that specify their risk measures. In the upper-level, the leader influences the distribution
of the types to induce targeted decisions and steers the follower's preferences to it. Our analysis
centers around the solution concept of approximate Stackelberg equilibrium that yields suboptimal
behaviors of the players. We show the existence of the approximate Stackelberg equilibrium. The
primitive risk perception gap, defined as the Wasserstein distance between the original and the
target type distributions, is important in estimating the optimal design cost. We connect the leader's
optimality tolerance on the cost with her ambiguity tolerance on the follower's approximate solutions
leveraging Lipschitzian properties of the lower-level solution mapping. To obtain the Stackelberg
equilibrium, we reformulate STRIPE into a single-level optimization problem using the spectral
representations of law-invariant coherent risk measures. We create a data-driven approach for
computation and study its performance guarantees. We apply STRIPE to contract design problems
to mitigate the intensity of moral hazard. Moreover, we connect STRIPE with meta-learning problems
and derive adaptation performance estimates of the meta-parameter using the sensitivity of the
optimal value function in the lower-level.

We present the Regensburg Breast Shape Model (RBSM) -- a 3D statistical shape model of the female
breast built from 110 breast scans acquired in a standing position, and the first publicly available.
Together with the model, a fully automated, pairwise surface registration pipeline used to establish
dense correspondence among 3D breast scans is introduced. Our method is computationally efficient
and requires only four landmarks to guide the registration process. A major challenge when modeling
female breasts from surface-only 3D breast scans is the non-separability of breast and thorax.
In order to weaken the strong coupling between breast and surrounding areas, we propose to minimize
the variance outside the breast region as much as possible. To achieve this goal, a novel concept
called breast probability masks (BPMs) is introduced. A BPM assigns probabilities to each point
of a 3D breast scan, telling how likely it is that a particular point belongs to the breast area. During
registration, we use BPMs to align the template to the target as accurately as possible inside the
breast region and only roughly outside. This simple yet effective strategy significantly reduces
the unwanted variance outside the breast region, leading to better statistical shape models in
which breast shapes are quite well decoupled from the thorax. The RBSM is thus able to produce a variety
of different breast shapes as independently as possible from the shape of the thorax. Our systematic
experimental evaluation reveals a generalization ability of 0.17 mm and a specificity of 2.8 mm.
To underline the expressiveness of the proposed model, we finally demonstrate in two showcase applications
how the RBSM can be used for surgical outcome simulation and the prediction of a missing breast from
the remaining one. Our model is available at https://www.rbsm.re-mic.de/.

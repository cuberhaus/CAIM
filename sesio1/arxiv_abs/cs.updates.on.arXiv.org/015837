Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully applied to the single target tracking
task in recent years. Generally, training a deep CNN model requires numerous labeled training samples,
and the number and quality of these samples directly affect the representational capability of
the trained model. However, this approach is restrictive in practice, because manually labeling
such a large number of training samples is time-consuming and prohibitively expensive. In this
paper, we propose an active learning method for deep visual tracking, which selects and annotates
the unlabeled samples to train the deep CNNs model. Under the guidance of active learning, the tracker
based on the trained deep CNNs model can achieve competitive tracking performance while reducing
the labeling cost. More specifically, to ensure the diversity of selected samples, we propose an
active learning method based on multi-frame collaboration to select those training samples that
should be and need to be annotated. Meanwhile, considering the representativeness of these selected
samples, we adopt a nearest neighbor discrimination method based on the average nearest neighbor
distance to screen isolated samples and low-quality samples. Therefore, the training samples
subset selected based on our method requires only a given budget to maintain the diversity and representativeness
of the entire sample set. Furthermore, we adopt a Tversky loss to improve the bounding box estimation
of our tracker, which can ensure that the tracker achieves more accurate target states. Extensive
experimental results confirm that our active learning-based tracker (ALT) achieves competitive
tracking accuracy and speed compared with state-of-the-art trackers on the seven most challenging
evaluation benchmarks.

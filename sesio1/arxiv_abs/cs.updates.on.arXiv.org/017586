Modeling biological soft tissue is complex in part due to material heterogeneity. Microstructural
patterns, which play a major role in defining the mechanical behavior of these tissues, are both
challenging to characterize, and difficult to simulate. Recently, machine learning-based methods
to predict the mechanical behavior of heterogeneous materials have made it possible to more thoroughly
explore the massive input parameter space associated with heterogeneous blocks of material. Specifically,
we can train machine learning (ML) models to closely approximate computationally expensive heterogeneous
material simulations where the ML model is trained on a dataset of simulations that capture the range
of spatial heterogeneity present in the material of interest. However, when it comes to applying
these techniques to biological tissue more broadly, there is a major limitation: the relevant microstructural
patterns are both challenging to obtain and difficult to analyze. Consequently, the number of useful
examples available to characterize the input domain under study is limited. In this work, we investigate
the efficacy of ML-based generative models as well as procedural methods as a tool for augmenting
limited input pattern datasets. We find that a Style-based Generative Adversarial Network with
adaptive discriminator augmentation is able to successfully leverage just 1,000 example patterns
to create the most authentic generated patterns. In general, diverse generated patterns with adequate
resemblance to the real patterns can be used as inputs to finite element simulations to meaningfully
augment the training dataset. To enable this methodological contribution, we have created an open
access dataset of Finite Element Analysis simulations based on Cahn-Hilliard patterns. We anticipate
that future researchers will be able to leverage this dataset and build on the work presented here.

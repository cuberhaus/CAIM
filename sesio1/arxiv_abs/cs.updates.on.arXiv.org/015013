Deep learning belongs to the field of artificial intelligence, where machines perform tasks that
typically require some kind of human intelligence. Similar to the basic structure of a brain, a deep
learning algorithm consists of an artificial neural network, which resembles the biological brain
structure. Mimicking the learning process of humans with their senses, deep learning networks
are fed with (sensory) data, like texts, images, videos or sounds. These networks outperform the
state-of-the-art methods in different tasks and, because of this, the whole field saw an exponential
growth during the last years. This growth resulted in way over 10,000 publications per year in the
last years. For example, the search engine PubMed alone, which covers only a sub-set of all publications
in the medical field, provides already over 11,000 results in Q3 2020 for the search term 'deep learning',
and around 90% of these results are from the last three years. Consequently, a complete overview
over the field of deep learning is already impossible to obtain and, in the near future, it will potentially
become difficult to obtain an overview over a subfield. However, there are several review articles
about deep learning, which are focused on specific scientific fields or applications, for example
deep learning advances in computer vision or in specific tasks like object detection. With these
surveys as a foundation, the aim of this contribution is to provide a first high-level, categorized
meta-survey of selected reviews on deep learning across different scientific disciplines. The
categories (computer vision, language processing, medical informatics and additional works)
have been chosen according to the underlying data sources (image, language, medical, mixed). In
addition, we review the common architectures, methods, pros, cons, evaluations, challenges and
future directions for every sub-category.

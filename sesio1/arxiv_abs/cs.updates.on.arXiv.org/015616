Controlling chaos is a long-standing problem in engineering. Here, we introduce Physics-Informed
Deep Operator Control (PIDOC), by encoding control signal and initial position into the losses
of a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN), the nonlinear system exhibits the desired route given
the control signal. The framework has a clear application scenario: receiving signals as physics
commands and learning chaotic data from the nonlinear van der Pol system, PIDOC is able to execute
the controlled signal as the output of the PINN. PIDOC is first applied to a benchmark problem, unveils
a fluctuating behavior of the acceleration that seemingly behave in the same frequency of the desired
signal, indicating the learning of neural networks (NN) elicit stochasticity for higher-order
terms, yet still successfully impose the control that enforces the system behave as in the same frequency
of the control signal. PIDOC is also proved capable of converging to different desired trajectories
based on case studies. Initial positions slightly affect the control accuracy at the beginning
stage yet still converge to the control signal based on numerical experiments. To note, for highly
nonlinear systems, PIDOC is not able to execute control as high accuracies compared with the benchmark
problem, yet still, PIDOC converges to decent trajectories corresponding to given signals with
fair predictable behavior. The depth and width of the NN structure did not heavily variate the convergence
of PIDOC based on case studies on van der Pol systems with low and high nonlinearities. Surprisingly,
by enlarging the control signal by multiplying a Lagrangian multiplier, PIDOC failed to converge
to the desired trajectory, indicating enlarging the control signal does not increase control quality,
which is not intuitive. The proposed framework can be potentially applied to many nonlinear systems
for controlling chaos.

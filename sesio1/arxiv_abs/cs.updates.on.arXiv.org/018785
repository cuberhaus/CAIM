Plant diseases are the primary cause of crop losses globally, with an impact on the world economy.
To deal with these issues, smart agriculture solutions are evolving that combine the Internet of
Things and machine learning for early disease detection and control. Many such systems use vision-based
machine learning methods for real-time disease detection and diagnosis. With the advancement
in deep learning techniques, new methods have emerged that employ convolutional neural networks
for plant disease detection and identification. Another trend in vision-based deep learning is
the use of vision transformers, which have proved to be powerful models for classification and other
problems. However, vision transformers have rarely been investigated for plant pathology applications.
In this study, a Vision Transformer enabled Convolutional Neural Network model called "PlantXViT"
is proposed for plant disease identification. The proposed model combines the capabilities of
traditional convolutional neural networks with the Vision Transformers to efficiently identify
a large number of plant diseases for several crops. The proposed model has a lightweight structure
with only 0.8 million trainable parameters, which makes it suitable for IoT-based smart agriculture
services. The performance of PlantXViT is evaluated on five publicly available datasets. The proposed
PlantXViT network performs better than five state-of-the-art methods on all five datasets. The
average accuracy for recognising plant diseases is shown to exceed 93.55%, 92.59%, and 98.33% on
Apple, Maize, and Rice datasets, respectively, even under challenging background conditions.
The efficiency in terms of explainability of the proposed model is evaluated using gradient-weighted
class activation maps and Local Interpretable Model Agnostic Explanation.

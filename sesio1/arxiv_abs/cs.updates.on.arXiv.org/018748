Platooning and coordination are two implementation strategies that are frequently proposed for
traffic control of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) at signal-free intersections instead
of using conventional traffic signals. However, few studies have attempted to integrate both strategies
to better facilitate the CAV control at signal-free intersections. To this end, this study proposes
a hierarchical control model, named COOR-PLT, to coordinate adaptive CAV platoons at a signal-free
intersection based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). COOR-PLT has a two-layer framework.
The first layer uses a centralized control strategy to form adaptive platoons. The optimal size
of each platoon is determined by considering multiple objectives (i.e., efficiency, fairness
and energy saving). The second layer employs a decentralized control strategy to coordinate multiple
platoons passing through the intersection. Each platoon is labeled with coordinated status or
independent status, upon which its passing priority is determined. As an efficient DRL algorithm,
Deep Q-network (DQN) is adopted to determine platoon sizes and passing priorities respectively
in the two layers. The model is validated and examined on the simulator Simulation of Urban Mobility
(SUMO). The simulation results demonstrate that the model is able to: (1) achieve satisfactory
convergence performances; (2) adaptively determine platoon size in response to varying traffic
conditions; and (3) completely avoid deadlocks at the intersection. By comparison with other control
methods, the model manifests its superiority of adopting adaptive platooning and DRL-based coordination
strategies. Also, the model outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on reducing travel
time and fuel consumption in different traffic conditions.

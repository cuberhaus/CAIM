Progress in digital pathology is hindered by high-resolution images and the prohibitive cost of
exhaustive localized annotations. The commonly used paradigm to categorize pathology images
is patch-based processing, which often incorporates multiple instance learning (MIL) to aggregate
local patch-level representations yielding image-level prediction. Nonetheless, diagnostically
relevant regions may only take a small fraction of the whole tissue, and MIL-based aggregation operation
assumes that all patch representations are independent and thus mislays the contextual information
from adjacent cell and tissue microenvironments. Consequently, the computational resources
dedicated to a specific region are independent of its information contribution. This paper proposes
a transformer-based architecture specifically tailored for histopathological image classification,
which combines fine-grained local attention with a coarse global attention mechanism to learn
meaningful representations of high-resolution images at an efficient computational cost. More
importantly, based on the observation above, we propose a novel mixing-based data-augmentation
strategy, namely ScoreMix, by leveraging the distribution of the semantic regions of images during
the training and carefully guiding the data mixing via sampling the locations of discriminative
image content. Thorough experiments and ablation studies on three challenging representative
cohorts of Haematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) tumour regions-of-interest (TRoIs) datasets have validated
the superiority of our approach over existing state-of-the-art methods and effectiveness of our
proposed components, e.g., data augmentation in improving classification performance. We also
demonstrate our method's interpretability, robustness, and cross-domain generalization capability.

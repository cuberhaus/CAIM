In laboratory object recognition tasks based on undistorted photographs, both adult humans and
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) perform close to ceiling. Unlike adults', whose object recognition
performance is robust against a wide range of image distortions, DNNs trained on standard ImageNet
(1.3M images) perform poorly on distorted images. However, the last two years have seen impressive
gains in DNN distortion robustness, predominantly achieved through ever-increasing large-scale
datasets$\unicode{x2014}$orders of magnitude larger than ImageNet. While this simple brute-force
approach is very effective in achieving human-level robustness in DNNs, it raises the question
of whether human robustness, too, is simply due to extensive experience with (distorted) visual
input during childhood and beyond. Here we investigate this question by comparing the core object
recognition performance of 146 children (aged 4$\unicode{x2013}$15) against adults and against
DNNs. We find, first, that already 4$\unicode{x2013}$6 year-olds showed remarkable robustness
to image distortions and outperform DNNs trained on ImageNet. Second, we estimated the number of
$\unicode{x201C}$images$\unicode{x201D}$ children have been exposed to during their lifetime.
Compared to various DNNs, children's high robustness requires relatively little data. Third,
when recognizing objects children$\unicode{x2014}$like adults but unlike DNNs$\unicode{x2014}$rely
heavily on shape but not on texture cues. Together our results suggest that the remarkable robustness
to distortions emerges early in the developmental trajectory of human object recognition and is
unlikely the result of a mere accumulation of experience with distorted visual input. Even though
current DNNs match human performance regarding robustness they seem to rely on different and more
data-hungry strategies to do so.

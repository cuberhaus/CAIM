Object density reconstruction from projections containing scattered radiation and noise is of
critical importance in many applications. Existing scatter correction and density reconstruction
methods may not provide the high accuracy needed in many applications and can break down in the presence
of unmodeled or anomalous scatter and other experimental artifacts. Incorporating machine-learned
models could prove beneficial for accurate density reconstruction particularly in dynamic imaging,
where the time-evolution of the density fields could be captured by partial differential equations
or by learning from hydrodynamics simulations. In this work, we demonstrate the ability of learned
deep neural networks to perform artifact removal in noisy density reconstructions, where the noise
is imperfectly characterized. We use a Wasserstein generative adversarial network (WGAN), where
the generator serves as a denoiser that removes artifacts in densities obtained from traditional
reconstruction algorithms. We train the networks from large density time-series datasets, with
noise simulated according to parametric random distributions that may mimic noise in experiments.
The WGAN is trained with noisy density frames as generator inputs, to match the generator outputs
to the distribution of clean densities (time-series) from simulations. A supervised loss is also
included in the training, which leads to improved density restoration performance. In addition,
we employ physics-based constraints such as mass conservation during network training and application
to further enable highly accurate density reconstructions. Our preliminary numerical results
show that the models trained in our frameworks can remove significant portions of unknown noise
in density time-series data.

Models are used in both Software Engineering (SE) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). SE models may
specify the architecture at different levels of abstraction and for addressing different concerns
at various stages of the software development life-cycle, from early conceptualization and design,
to verification, implementation, testing and evolution. However, AI models may provide smart
capabilities, such as prediction and decision-making support. For instance, in Machine Learning
(ML), which is currently the most popular sub-discipline of AI, mathematical models may learn useful
patterns in the observed data and can become capable of making predictions. The goal of this work
is to create synergy by bringing models in the said communities together and proposing a holistic
approach to model-driven software development for intelligent systems that require ML. We illustrate
how software models can become capable of creating and dealing with ML models in a seamless manner.
The main focus is on the domain of the Internet of Things (IoT), where both ML and model-driven SE play
a key role. In the context of the need to take a Cyber-Physical System-of-Systems perspective of
the targeted architecture, an integrated design environment for both SE and ML sub-systems would
best support the optimization and overall efficiency of the implementation of the resulting system.
In particular, we implement the proposed approach, called ML-Quadrat, based on ThingML, and validate
it using a case study from the IoT domain, as well as through an empirical user evaluation. It transpires
that the proposed approach is not only feasible, but may also contribute to the performance leap
of software development for smart Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) which are connected to the IoT,
as well as an enhanced user experience of the practitioners who use the proposed modeling solution.

Over 12 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered at the time of writing. However,
public perceptions of vaccines have been complex. We analyzed COVID-19 vaccine-related tweets
to understand the evolving perceptions of COVID-19 vaccines. We finetuned a deep learning classifier
using a state-of-the-art model, XLNet, to detect each tweet's sentiment automatically. We employed
validated methods to extract the users' race or ethnicity, gender, age, and geographical locations
from user profiles. Incorporating multiple data sources, we assessed the sentiment patterns among
subpopulations and juxtaposed them against vaccine uptake data to unravel their interactive patterns.
11,211,672 COVID-19 vaccine-related tweets corresponding to 2,203,681 users over two years were
analyzed. The finetuned model for sentiment classification yielded an accuracy of 0.92 on testing
set. Users from various demographic groups demonstrated distinct patterns in sentiments towards
COVID-19 vaccines. User sentiments became more positive over time, upon which we observed subsequent
upswing in the population-level vaccine uptake. Surrounding dates where positive sentiments
crest, we detected encouraging news or events regarding vaccine development and distribution.
Positive sentiments in pregnancy-related tweets demonstrated a delayed pattern compared with
trends in general population, with postponed vaccine uptake trends. Distinctive patterns across
subpopulations suggest the need of tailored strategies. Global news and events profoundly involved
in shaping users' thoughts on social media. Populations with additional concerns, such as pregnancy,
demonstrated more substantial hesitancy since lack of timely recommendations. Feature analysis
revealed hesitancies of various subpopulations stemmed from clinical trial logics, risks and
complications, and urgency of scientific evidence.

We investigate traffic routing both from the perspective of theory as well as real world data. First,
we introduce a new type of games: $\theta$-free flow games. Here, commuters only consider, in their
strategy sets, paths whose free-flow costs (informally their lengths) are within a small multiplicative
$(1+\theta)$ constant of the optimal free-flow cost path connecting their source and destination,
where $\theta\geq0$. We provide an exhaustive analysis of tight bounds on PoA($\theta$) for arbitrary
classes of cost functions, both in the case of general congestion/routing games as well as in the
special case of path-disjoint networks. Second, by using a large mobility dataset in Singapore,
we inspect minute-by-minute decision-making of thousands of commuters, and find that $\theta=1$
is a good estimate of agents' route (pre)selection mechanism. In contrast, in Pigou networks, the
ratio of the free-flow costs of the routes, and thus $\theta$, is \textit{infinite}; so, although
such worst case networks are mathematically simple, they correspond to artificial routing scenarios
with little resemblance to real world conditions, opening the possibility of proving much stronger
Price of Anarchy guarantees by explicitly studying their dependency on $\theta$. For example,
in the case of the standard Bureau of Public Roads (BPR) cost model, where$c_e(x)= a_e x^4+b_e$,
and for quartic cost functions in general, the standard PoA bound for $\theta=\infty$ is $2.1505$,
and this is tight both for general networks as well as path-disjoint and even parallel-edge networks.
In comparison, for $\theta=1$, the PoA in the case of general networks is only $1.6994$, whereas
for path-disjoint/parallel-edge networks is even smaller ($1.3652$), showing that both the route
geometries as captured by the parameter $\theta$ as well as the network topology have significant
effects on PoA.

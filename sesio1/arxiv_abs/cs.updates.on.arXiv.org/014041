Random effect models are popular statistical models for detecting and correcting spurious sample
correlations due to hidden confounders in genome-wide gene expression data. In applications where
some confounding factors are known, estimating simultaneously the contribution of known and latent
variance components in random effect models is a challenge that has so far relied on numerical gradient-based
optimizers to maximize the likelihood function. This is unsatisfactory because the resulting
solution is poorly characterized and the efficiency of the method may be suboptimal. Here we prove
analytically that maximum-likelihood latent variables can always be chosen orthogonal to the
known confounding factors, in other words, that maximum-likelihood latent variables explain
sample covariances not already explained by known factors. Based on this result we propose a restricted
maximum-likelihood method which estimates the latent variables by maximizing the likelihood
on the restricted subspace orthogonal to the known confounding factors, and show that this reduces
to probabilistic PCA on that subspace. The method then estimates the variance-covariance parameters
by maximizing the remaining terms in the likelihood function given the latent variables, using
a newly derived analytic solution for this problem. Compared to gradient-based optimizers, our
method attains greater or equal likelihood values, can be computed using standard matrix operations,
results in latent factors that don't overlap with any known factors, and has a runtime reduced by
several orders of magnitude. Hence the restricted maximum-likelihood method facilitates the
application of random effect modelling strategies for learning latent variance components to
much larger gene expression datasets than possible with current methods.

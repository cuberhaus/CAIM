Observational studies are regarded as economic alternatives to randomized trials, often used
in their stead to investigate and determine treatment efficacy. Due to lack of sample size, observational
studies commonly combine data from multiple sources or different sites/centers. Despite the benefits
of an increased sample size, a naive combination of multicenter data may result in incongruities
stemming from center-specific protocols for generating cohorts or reactions towards treatments
distinct to a given center, among other things. These issues arise in a variety of other contexts,
including capturing a treatment effect related to an individual's unique biological characteristics.
Existing methods for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects have not adequately addressed
the multicenter context, but rather treat it simply as a means to obtain sufficient sample size.
Additionally, previous approaches to estimating treatment effects do not straightforwardly
generalize to the multicenter design, especially when required to provide treatment insights
for patients from a new, unobserved center. To address these shortcomings, we propose Multiple
Domain Causal Networks (MDCN), an approach that simultaneously strengthens the information sharing
between similar centers while addressing the selection bias in treatment assignment through learning
of a new feature embedding. In empirical evaluations, MDCN is consistently more accurate when estimating
the heterogeneous treatment effect in new centers compared to benchmarks that adjust solely based
on treatment imbalance or general center differences. Finally, we justify our approach by providing
theoretical analyses that demonstrate that MDCN improves on the generalization bound of the new,
unobserved target center.

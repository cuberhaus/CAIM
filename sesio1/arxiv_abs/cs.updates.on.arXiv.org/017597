Facial thermography is one of the most popular research areas in infrared thermal imaging, with
diverse applications in medical, surveillance, and environmental monitoring. However, in contrast
to facial imagery in the visual spectrum, the lack of public datasets on facial thermal images is
an obstacle to research improvement in this area. Thermal face imagery is still a relatively new
research area to be evaluated and studied in different domains.The current thermal face datasets
are limited in regards to the subjects' distance from the camera, the ambient temperature variation,
and facial landmarks' localization. We address these gaps by presenting a new facial thermography
dataset. This article makes two main contributions to the body of knowledge. First, it presents
a comprehensive review and comparison of current public datasets in facial thermography. Second,
it introduces and studies a novel public dataset on facial thermography, which we call it Charlotte-ThermalFace.
Charlotte-ThermalFace contains more than10000 infrared thermal images in varying thermal conditions,
several distances from the camera, and different head positions. The data is fully annotated with
the facial landmarks, ambient temperature, relative humidity, the air speed of the room, distance
to the camera, and subject thermal sensation at the time of capturing each image. Our dataset is the
first publicly available thermal dataset annotated with the thermal sensation of each subject
in different thermal conditions and one of the few datasets in raw 16-bit format. Finally, we present
a preliminary analysis of the dataset to show the applicability and importance of the thermal conditions
in facial thermography. The full dataset, including annotations, are freely available for research
purpose at https://github.com/TeCSAR-UNCC/UNCC-ThermalFace

Many additive manufacturing (AM) technologies rely on powder feedstock, which is fused to form
the final part either by melting or by chemical binding with subsequent sintering. In both cases,
process stability and resulting part quality depend on dynamic interactions between powder particles
and a fluid phase, i.e., molten metal or liquid binder. The present work proposes a versatile computational
modeling framework for simulating such coupled microfluid-powder dynamics problems involving
thermo-capillary flow and reversible phase transitions. In particular, a liquid and a gas phase
are interacting with a solid phase that consists of a substrate and mobile powder particles while
simultaneously considering temperature-dependent surface tension and wetting effects. In case
of laser-metal interactions, the effect of rapid evaporation is incorporated through additional
mechanical and thermal interface fluxes. All phase domains are spatially discretized using smoothed
particle hydrodynamics. The method's Lagrangian nature is beneficial in the context of dynamically
changing interface topologies. Special care is taken in the formulation of phase transitions,
which is crucial for the robustness of the computational scheme. While the underlying model equations
are of a very general nature, the proposed framework is especially suitable for the mesoscale modeling
of various AM processes. To this end, the generality and robustness of the computational modeling
framework is demonstrated by several application-motivated examples representing the specific
AM processes binder jetting, material jetting, directed energy deposition, and powder bed fusion.
Among others, it is shown how the dynamic impact of droplets in binder jetting or the evaporation-induced
recoil pressure in powder bed fusion leads to powder motion, distortion of the powder packing structure,
and powder particle ejection.

Cyber attacks are becoming more sophisticated and diverse, making detection increasingly challenging.
To combat these attacks, security practitioners actively summarize and exchange their knowledge
about attacks across organizations in the form of cyber threat intelligence (CTI) reports. However,
as CTI reports written in natural language texts are not structured for automatic analysis, the
report usage requires tedious manual efforts of cyber threat intelligence recovery. Additionally,
individual reports typically cover only a limited aspect of attack patterns (techniques) and thus
are insufficient to provide a comprehensive view of attacks with multiple variants. To take advantage
of threat intelligence delivered by CTI reports, we propose AttacKG to automatically extract structured
attack behavior graphs from CTI reports and identify the adopted attack techniques. We then aggregate
cyber threat intelligence across reports to collect different aspects of techniques and enhance
attack behavior graphs into technique knowledge graphs (TKGs). In our evaluation against 1,515
real-world CTI reports from diverse intelligence sources, AttacKG effectively identifies 28,262
attack techniques with 8,393 unique Indicators of Compromises (IoCs). To further verify the accuracy
of AttacKG in extracting threat intelligence, we run AttacKG on 16 manually labeled CTI reports.
Empirical results show that AttacKG accurately identifies attack-relevant entities, dependencies,
and techniques with F1-scores of 0.887, 0.896, and 0.789, which outperforms the state-of-the-art
approaches Extractor and TTPDrill. Moreover, the unique technique-level intelligence will directly
benefit downstream security tasks that rely on technique specifications, e.g., APT detection
and cyber attack reconstruction.

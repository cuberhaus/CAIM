In the modern era of computing, machine learning tools have demonstrated their potential in vital
sectors, such as healthcare and finance, to derive proper inferences. The sensitive and confidential
nature of the data in such sectors raises genuine concerns for data privacy. This motivated the area
of Privacy-preserving Machine Learning (PPML), where privacy of data is guaranteed. In this thesis,
we design an efficient platform, MPCLeague, for PPML in the Secure Outsourced Computation (SOC)
setting using Secure Multi-party Computation (MPC) techniques. MPC, the holy-grail problem of
secure distributed computing, enables a set of n mutually distrusting parties to perform joint
computation on their private inputs in a way that no coalition of t parties can learn more information
than the output (privacy) or affect the true output of the computation (correctness). While MPC,
in general, has been a subject of extensive research, the area of MPC with a small number of parties
has drawn popularity of late mainly due to its application to real-time scenarios, efficiency and
simplicity. This thesis focuses on designing efficient MPC frameworks for 2, 3 and 4 parties, with
at most one corruption and supports ring structures. At the heart of this thesis are four frameworks
- ASTRA, SWIFT, Tetrad, ABY2.0 - catered to different settings. The practicality of our framework
is argued through improvements in the benchmarking of widely used ML algorithms -- Linear Regression,
Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines. We propose two variants for
each of our frameworks, with one variant aiming to minimise the execution time while the other focuses
on the monetary cost. The concrete efficiency gains of our frameworks coupled with the stronger
security guarantee of robustness make our platform an ideal choice for a real-time deployment of
PPML techniques.

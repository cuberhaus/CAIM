In classical cosmological analysis of large scale structure surveys with 2-pt functions, the parameter
measurement precision is limited by several key degeneracies within the cosmology and astrophysics
sectors. For cosmic shear, clustering amplitude $\sigma_8$ and matter density $\Omega_m$ roughly
follow the $S_8=\sigma_8(\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5}$ relation. In turn, $S_8$ is highly correlated
with the intrinsic galaxy alignment amplitude $A_{\rm{IA}}$. For galaxy clustering, the bias
$b_g$ is degenerate with both $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_m$, as well as the stochasticity $r_g$. Moreover,
the redshift evolution of IA and bias can cause further parameter confusion. A tomographic 2-pt
probe combination can partially lift these degeneracies. In this work we demonstrate that a deep
learning analysis of combined probes of weak gravitational lensing and galaxy clustering, which
we call DeepLSS, can effectively break these degeneracies and yield significantly more precise
constraints on $\sigma_8$, $\Omega_m$, $A_{\rm{IA}}$, $b_g$, $r_g$, and IA redshift evolution
parameter $\eta_{\rm{IA}}$. The most significant gains are in the IA sector: the precision of $A_{\rm{IA}}$
is increased by approximately 8x and is almost perfectly decorrelated from $S_8$. Galaxy bias $b_g$
is improved by 1.5x, stochasticity $r_g$ by 3x, and the redshift evolution $\eta_{\rm{IA}}$ and
$\eta_b$ by 1.6x. Breaking these degeneracies leads to a significant gain in constraining power
for $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_m$, with the figure of merit improved by 15x. We give an intuitive explanation
for the origin of this information gain using sensitivity maps. These results indicate that the
fully numerical, map-based forward modeling approach to cosmological inference with machine
learning may play an important role in upcoming LSS surveys. We discuss perspectives and challenges
in its practical deployment for a full survey analysis.

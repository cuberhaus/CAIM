In this work, we investigate pronunciation differences in English spoken by Singaporean children
in relation to their American and British counterparts by conducting Kmeans clustering and Archetypal
analysis on selected vowel pairs and approximants. Given that Singapore adopts British English
as the institutional standard due to historical reasons, one might expect Singaporean children
to follow British pronunciation patterns. Indeed, Singaporean and British children are more similar
in their production of syllable-final /r/ -- they do not lower their third formant nearly as much
as American children do, suggesting a lack of rhoticity. Interestingly, Singaporean children
also present similar patterns to American children when it comes to their fronting of vowels as demonstrated
across various vowels including TRAP-BATH split vowels. Singaporean children's English also
demonstrated characteristics that do not resemble any of the other two populations. We observe
that Singaporean children's vowel height characteristics are distinct from both that of American
and British children. In tense and lax vowel pairs, we also consistently observe that the distinction
is less conspicuous for Singaporean children compared to the other speaker groups. Further, while
American and British children demonstrate lowering of F1 and F2 formants in transitions into syllable-final
/l/s, a wide gap between F2 and F3 formants, and small difference between F1 and F2 formants, all of
these are not exhibited in Singaporean children's pronunciation. These findings point towards
potential sociolinguistic implications of how Singapore English might be evolving to embody more
than British pronunciation characteristics. Furthermore, these findings also suggest that Singapore
English could be have been influenced by languages beyond American and British English, potentially
due to Singapore's multilingual environment.

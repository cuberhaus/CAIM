In package-handling facilities, boxes of varying sizes are used to ship products. Improperly sized
boxes with box dimensions much larger than the product dimensions create wastage and unduly increase
the shipping costs. Since it is infeasible to make unique, tailor-made boxes for each of the $N$ products,
the fundamental question that confronts e-commerce companies is: How many $K << N$ cuboidal boxes
need to manufactured and what should be their dimensions? In this paper, we propose a solution for
the single-count shipment containing one product per box in two steps: (i) reduce it to a clustering
problem in the $3$ dimensional space of length, width and height where each cluster corresponds
to the group of products that will be shipped in a particular size variant, and (ii) present an efficient
forward-backward decision tree based clustering method with low computational complexity on
$N$ and $K$ to obtain these $K$ clusters and corresponding box dimensions. Our algorithm has multiple
constituent parts, each specifically designed to achieve a high-quality clustering solution.
As our method generates clusters in an incremental fashion without discarding the present solution,
adding or deleting a size variant is as simple as stopping the backward pass early or executing it
for one more iteration. We tested the efficacy of our approach by simulating actual single-count
shipments that were transported during a month by Amazon using the proposed box dimensions. Even
by just modifying the existing box dimensions and not adding a new size variant, we achieved a reduction
of $4.4\%$ in the shipment volume, contributing to the decrease in non-utilized, air volume space
by $2.2\%$. The reduction in shipment volume and air volume improved significantly to $10.3\%$
and $6.1\%$ when we introduced $4$ additional boxes.

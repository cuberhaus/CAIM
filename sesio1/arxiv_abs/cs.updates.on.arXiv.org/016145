With the rapid development of communication technology, connected vehicles (CV) have the potential,
through the sharing of data, to enhance vehicle safety and reduce vehicle energy consumption and
emissions. Numerous research efforts are quantifying the impacts of CV applications, assuming
instant and accurate communication among vehicles, devices, pedestrians, infrastructure, the
network, the cloud, and the grid, collectively known as V2X (vehicle-to-everything). The use of
cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X), to share data is emerging as an efficient means to achieve
this objective. C-V2X releases 14 and 15 utilize the 4G LTE technology and release 16 utilizes the
new 5G new radio (NR) technology. C-V2X can function without network infrastructure coverage and
has a better communication range, improved latency, and greater data rates compared to older technologies.
Such highly efficient interchange of information among all participating parts in a CV environment
will not only provide timely data to enhance the capacity of the transportation system but can also
be used to develop applications that enhance vehicle safety and minimize negative environmental
impacts. However, before the full benefits of CV can be achieved, there is a need to thoroughly investigate
the effectiveness, strengths, and weaknesses of different CV applications, the communication
protocols, the varied results with different CV market penetration rates (MPRs), the interaction
of CVs and human driven vehicles, the integration of multiple applications, and the errors and latencies
associated with data communication. This paper reviews existing literature on the environmental,
mobility and safety impacts of CV applications, identifies the gaps in our current research of CVs
and recommends future research directions.

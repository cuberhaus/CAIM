This paper is a summary of the findings from a series of workshops which were held by Thinknet 6G and
MUENCHNER KREIS in 2021, with the goal to provide orientation and input for developing a strategic
6G research plan. The topics selected for the workshops are aspects of 6G that we expect will have
a significant impact on other industries and on society: - 6G as both a communication infrastructure
and a sensing infrastructure - The extensive use of artificial intelligence in 6G - The security
and resilience of 6G This paper does not go into the technical details of how to develop and implement
6G. Rather, it provides input from experts from both the wireless industry as well as from other sectors
about (mostly) non-technical topics that will need to be addressed in parallel with the technical
developments, such as new use cases, regulation, communication with the public, and cross-industry
cooperation. We have identified six areas that will have a significant impact on the development
and use of 6G, and that organizations must consider as they begin their plans and designs for 6G. Based
on these six impact areas and on the discussion in the workshops, we compiled a list of the top 10 recommendations
for specific areas where organizations should place their focus when developing their strategic
plan for 6G. In addition, for our readers who are involved in 6G research, be it at a university, at
a research institute or in industrial research, we also included a summary of the top 10 areas that
require additional research, again based on the input received in the workshops. A version of this
paper is also available at www.thinknet-6g.de. If you had a copy of the preview version of this paper,
the text is exactly the same. Only the layout and graphics have changed.

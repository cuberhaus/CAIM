Being able to recommend links between users in online social networks is important for users to connect
with like-minded individuals as well as for the platforms themselves and third parties leveraging
social media information to grow their business. Predictions are typically based on unsupervised
or supervised learning, often leveraging simple yet effective graph topological information,
such as the number of common neighbors. However, we argue that richer information about personal
social structure of individuals might lead to better predictions. In this paper, we propose to leverage
well-established social cognitive theories to improve link prediction performance. According
to these theories, individuals arrange their social relationships along, on average, five concentric
circles of decreasing intimacy. We postulate that relationships in different circles have different
importance in predicting new links. In order to validate this claim, we focus on popular feature-extraction
prediction algorithms (both unsupervised and supervised) and we extend them to include social-circles
awareness. We validate the prediction performance of these circle-aware algorithms against several
benchmarks (including their baseline versions as well as node-embedding- and GNN-based link prediction),
leveraging two Twitter datasets comprising a community of video gamers and generic users. We show
that social-awareness generally provides significant improvements in the prediction performance,
beating also state-of-the-art solutions like node2vec and SEAL, and without increasing the computational
complexity. Finally, we show that social-awareness can be used in place of using a classifier (which
may be costly or impractical) for targeting a specific category of users.

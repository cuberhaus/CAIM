The visualization and detection of anomalies (outliers) are of crucial importance to many fields,
particularly cybersecurity. Several approaches have been proposed in these fields, yet to the
best of our knowledge, none of them has fulfilled both objectives, simultaneously or cooperatively,
in one coherent framework. The visualization methods of these approaches were introduced for explaining
the output of a detection algorithm, not for data exploration that facilitates a standalone visual
detection. This is our point of departure: UN-AVOIDS, an unsupervised and nonparametric approach
for both visualization (a human process) and detection (an algorithmic process) of outliers, that
assigns invariant anomalous scores (normalized to $[0,1]$), rather than hard binary-decision.
The main aspect of novelty of UN-AVOIDS is that it transforms data into a new space, which is introduced
in this paper as neighborhood cumulative density function (NCDF), in which both visualization
and detection are carried out. In this space, outliers are remarkably visually distinguishable,
and therefore the anomaly scores assigned by the detection algorithm achieved a high area under
the ROC curve (AUC). We assessed UN-AVOIDS on both simulated and two recently published cybersecurity
datasets, and compared it to three of the most successful anomaly detection methods: LOF, IF, and
FABOD. In terms of AUC, UN-AVOIDS was almost an overall winner. The article concludes by providing
a preview of new theoretical and practical avenues for UN-AVOIDS. Among them is designing a visualization
aided anomaly detection (VAAD), a type of software that aids analysts by providing UN-AVOIDS' detection
algorithm (running in a back engine), NCDF visualization space (rendered to plots), along with
other conventional methods of visualization in the original feature space, all of which are linked
in one interactive environment.

We consider learning a trading agent acting on behalf of the treasury of a firm earning revenue in
a foreign currency (FC) and incurring expenses in the home currency (HC). The goal of the agent is
to maximize the expected HC at the end of the trading episode by deciding to hold or sell the FC at each
time step in the trading episode. We pose this as an optimization problem, and consider a broad spectrum
of approaches with the learning component ranging from supervised to imitation to reinforcement
learning. We observe that most of the approaches considered struggle to improve upon simple heuristic
baselines. We identify two key aspects of the problem that render standard solutions ineffective
- i) while good forecasts of future FX rates can be highly effective in guiding good decisions, forecasting
FX rates is difficult, and erroneous estimates tend to degrade the performance of trading agents
instead of improving it, ii) the inherent non-stationary nature of FX rates renders a fixed decision-threshold
highly ineffective. To address these problems, we propose a novel supervised learning approach
that learns to forecast the top-K future FX rates instead of forecasting all the future FX rates,
and bases the hold-versus-sell decision on the forecasts (e.g. hold if future FX rate is higher than
current FX rate, sell otherwise). Furthermore, to handle the non-stationarity in the FX rates data
which poses challenges to the i.i.d. assumption in supervised learning methods, we propose to adaptively
learn decision-thresholds based on recent historical episodes. Through extensive empirical
evaluation, we show that our approach is the only approach which is able to consistently improve
upon a simple heuristic baseline. Further experiments show the inefficacy of state-of-the-art
statistical and deep-learning-based forecasting methods as they degrade the performance of the
trading agent.

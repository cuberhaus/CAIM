The first known case of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was identified in December 2019. It
has spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic, imposed restrictions and costs to many countries.
Predicting the number of new cases and deaths during this period can be a useful step in predicting
the costs and facilities required in the future. The purpose of this study is to predict new cases
and deaths rate one, three and seven-day ahead during the next 100 days. The motivation for predicting
every n days (instead of just every day) is the investigation of the possibility of computational
cost reduction and still achieving reasonable performance. Such a scenario may be encountered
in real-time forecasting of time series. Six different deep learning methods are examined on the
data adopted from the WHO website. Three methods are LSTM, Convolutional LSTM, and GRU. The bidirectional
extension is then considered for each method to forecast the rate of new cases and new deaths in Australia
and Iran countries. This study is novel as it carries out a comprehensive evaluation of the aforementioned
three deep learning methods and their bidirectional extensions to perform prediction on COVID-19
new cases and new death rate time series. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that Bi-GRU
and Bi-Conv-LSTM models are used for prediction on COVID-19 new cases and new deaths time series.
The evaluation of the methods is presented in the form of graphs and Friedman statistical test. The
results show that the bidirectional models have lower errors than other models. A several error
evaluation metrics are presented to compare all models, and finally, the superiority of bidirectional
methods is determined. This research could be useful for organisations working against COVID-19
and determining their long-term plans.

Analyzing long time series with RNNs often suffers from infeasible training. Segmentation is therefore
commonly used in data pre-processing. However, in non-stationary time series, there exists often
distribution shift among different segments. RNN is easily swamped in the dilemma of fitting bias
in these segments due to the lack of global information, leading to poor generalization, known as
Temporal Covariate Shift (TCS) problem, which is only addressed by a recently proposed RNN-based
model. One of the assumptions in TCS is that the distribution of all divided intervals under the same
segment are identical. This assumption, however, may not be true on high-frequency time series,
such as traffic flow, that also have large stochasticity. Besides, macro information across long
periods isn't adequately considered in the latest RNN-based methods. To address the above issues,
we propose Hyper Attention Recurrent Neural Network (HARNN) for the modeling of temporal patterns
containing both micro and macro information. An HARNN consists of a meta layer for parameter generation
and an attention-enabled main layer for inference. High-frequency segments are transformed into
low-frequency segments and fed into the meta layers, while the first main layer consumes the same
high-frequency segments as conventional methods. In this way, each low-frequency segment in the
meta inputs generates a unique main layer, enabling the integration of both macro information and
micro information for inference. This forces all main layers to predict the same target which fully
harnesses the common knowledge in varied distributions when capturing temporal patterns. Evaluations
on multiple benchmarks demonstrated that our model outperforms a couple of RNN-based methods on
a federation of key metrics.

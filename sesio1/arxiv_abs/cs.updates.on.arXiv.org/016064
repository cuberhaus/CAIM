Aligning a sequence to a walk in a labeled graph is a problem of fundamental importance to Computational
Biology. For finding a walk in an arbitrary graph with $|E|$ edges that exactly matches a pattern
of length $m$, a lower bound based on the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) implies an algorithm
significantly faster than $O(|E|m)$ time is unlikely [Equi et al., ICALP 2019]. However, for many
special graphs, such as de Bruijn graphs, the problem can be solved in linear time [Bowe et al., WABI
2012]. For approximate matching, the picture is more complex. When edits (substitutions, insertions,
and deletions) are only allowed to the pattern, or when the graph is acyclic, the problem is again
solvable in $O(|E|m)$ time. When edits are allowed to arbitrary cyclic graphs, the problem becomes
NP-complete, even on binary alphabets [Jain et al., RECOMB 2019]. These results hold even when edits
are restricted to only substitutions. The complexity of approximate pattern matching on de Bruijn
graphs remained open. We investigate this problem and show that the properties that make de Bruijn
graphs amenable to efficient exact pattern matching do not extend to approximate matching, even
when restricted to the substitutions only case with alphabet size four. We prove that determining
the existence of a matching walk in a de Bruijn graph is NP-complete when substitutions are allowed
to the graph. In addition, we demonstrate that an algorithm significantly faster than $O(|E|m)$
is unlikely for de Bruijn graphs in the case where only substitutions are allowed to the pattern.
This stands in contrast to pattern-to-text matching where exact matching is solvable in linear
time, like on de Bruijn graphs, but approximate matching under substitutions is solvable in subquadratic
$O(n\sqrt{m})$ time, where $n$ is the text's length [Abrahamson, SIAM J. Computing 1987].

In today's modern world, the usage of technology is unavoidable and the rapid advances in the Internet
and communication fields have resulted to expand the Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technology.
A huge number of sensing devices collect and/or generate numerous sensory data throughout time
for a wide range of fields and applications. However, WSN has been proven to be vulnerable to security
breaches, the harsh and unattended deployment of these networks, combined with their constrained
resources and the volume of data generated introduce a major security concern. WSN applications
are extremely critical, it is essential to build reliable solutions that involve fast and continuous
mechanisms for online data stream analysis enabling the detection of attacks and intrusions. In
this context, our aim is to develop an intelligent, efficient, and updatable intrusion detection
system by applying an important machine learning concept known as ensemble learning in order to
improve detection performance. Although ensemble models have been proven to be useful in offline
learning, they have received less attention in streaming applications. In this paper, we examine
the application of different homogeneous and heterogeneous online ensembles in sensory data analysis,
on a specialized wireless sensor network-detection system (WSN-DS) dataset in order to classify
four types of attacks: Blackhole attack, Grayhole, Flooding, and Scheduling among normal network
traffic. Among the proposed novel online ensembles, both the heterogeneous ensemble consisting
of an Adaptive Random Forest (ARF) combined with the Hoeffding Adaptive Tree (HAT) algorithm and
the homogeneous ensemble HAT made up of 10 models achieved higher detection rates of 96.84% and 97.2%,
respectively. The above models are efficient and effective in dealing with concept drift, while
taking into account the resource constraints of WSNs.

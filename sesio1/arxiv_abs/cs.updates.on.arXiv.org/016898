Water networks are used in numerous applications, all of which have the essential task of real-time
monitoring and control of water states. A framework for the generation of efficient models of water
networks suitable for real-time monitoring and control purposes is proposed. The proposed models
preserve the distributed parameter character of the connected local elements. Hence, the spatial
resolution of the property under consideration is recovered. The real-time feasibility of the
network model is ensured by means of reduced order modeling of the models constituting components.
A novel model order reduction procedure that preserves the model parametric dependency is introduced.
The proposed concept is evaluated with the water temperature as the property under consideration.
The formulated model is applied for the prediction of the water temperature within an experimental
test bench of a 60 meter exemplary circulation network at the company VIEGA. A reduced order model
(ROM) with a 50 mm spatial resolution, i.e. 1200 discretization points, is constructed and utilized
as the identification model for a single path of the test bench. Afterwards, the ROM is evaluated
in a Hardware in the Loop experiment for the prediction of the downstream temperature showing high
prediction accuracy with mean relative error below 3.5 \%. The ROM single step computation time
did not exceed 2 msec highlighting the real-time potential of the method. Moreover, full network
model validation experiments featuring both diffusion and transport dominated parts were conducted.
The network model is able to predict the temperature evolution, flow rate, and pressure accurately
at the different paths of the network with mean relative errors below 4 \%, 2 \%, and 2 \%, respectively.

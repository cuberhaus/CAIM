Social media becomes the central way for people to obtain and utilise news, due to its rapidness and
inexpensive value of data distribution. Though, such features of social media platforms also present
it a root cause of fake news distribution, causing adverse consequences on both people and culture.
Hence, detecting fake news has become a significant research interest for bringing feasible real
time solutions to the problem. Most current techniques of fake news disclosure are supervised,
that need large cost in terms of time and effort to make a certainly interpreted dataset. The proposed
framework concentrates on the text-based detection of fake news items while considering that only
limited number of labels are available. Graphs are functioned extensively under several purposes
of real-world problems on the strength of their property to structure things easily. Deep neural
networks are used to generate great results within tasks that utilizes graph classification. The
Graph Convolution Network works as a deep learning paradigm which works on graphs. Our proposed
framework deals with limited amount of labelled data; we go for a semi-supervised learning method.
We come up with a semi-supervised fake news detection technique based on GCN (Graph Convolutional
Networks). The recommended architecture comprises of three basic components: collecting word
embeddings from the news articles in datasets utilising GloVe, building similarity graph using
Word Movers Distance (WMD) and finally applying Graph Convolution Network (GCN) for binary classification
of news articles in semi-supervised paradigm. The implemented technique is validated on three
different datasets by varying the volume of labelled data achieving 95.27 % highest accuracy on
Real or Fake dataset. Comparison with other contemporary techniques also reinforced the supremacy
of the proposed framework.

Steer-by-Wire (SBW) systems are being adapted widely in semi-autonomous and fully autonomous
vehicles. The main control challenge in a SBW system is to follow the steering commands in the face
of parametric uncertainties, external disturbances and actuator delay; crucially, perturbations
in inertial parameters and damping forces give rise to state-dependent uncertainties, which cannot
be bounded a priori by a constant. However, the state-of-the-art control methods of SBW system rely
on a priori bounded uncertainties, and thus, become inapplicable when state-dependent dynamics
become unknown. In addition, ensuring tracking accuracy under actuator delay is always a challenging
task. This work proposes two control frameworks to overcome these challenges. Firstly, an adaptive
controller is proposed to tackle the state-dependent uncertainties and external disturbances
in a typical SBW system without any a priori knowledge of their structures and of their bounds. The
stability of the closed-loop system is studied analytically via uniformly ultimately bounded
notion and the effectiveness of the proposed solution is verified via simulations against the state-of-the-art
solution. While this proposed controller handles the uncertainties and external perturbations,
it does not consider the actuator delay which sometimes result in decreased accuracy. Therefore,
a new adaptive-robust control framework is devised to tackle the same control problem of an SBW system
under the influence of time-varying input delay. In comparison to the existing strategies, the
proposed framework removes the conservative assumption of a priori bounded uncertainty and, in
addition, the Razumikhin theorem based stability analysis allows the proposed scheme to deal with
arbitrary variation in input delay. The effectiveness of the both controllers is proved using comparative
simulation studies.

Since the popularisation of the Internet in the 1990s, the cyberspace has kept evolving. We have
created various computer-mediated virtual environments including social networks, video conferencing,
virtual 3D worlds (e.g., VR Chat), augmented reality applications (e.g., Pokemon Go), and Non-Fungible
Token Games (e.g., Upland). Such virtual environments, albeit non-perpetual and unconnected,
have bought us various degrees of digital transformation. The term `metaverse' has been coined
to further facilitate the digital transformation in every aspect of our physical lives. At the core
of the metaverse stands the vision of an immersive Internet as a gigantic, unified, persistent,
and shared realm. While the metaverse may seem futuristic, catalysed by emerging technologies
such as Extended Reality, 5G, and Artificial Intelligence, the digital `big bang' of our cyberspace
is not far away. This survey paper presents the first effort to offer a comprehensive framework that
examines the latest metaverse development under the dimensions of state-of-the-art technologies
and metaverse ecosystems, and illustrates the possibility of the digital `big bang'. First, technologies
are the enablers that drive the transition from the current Internet to the metaverse. We thus examine
eight enabling technologies rigorously - Extended Reality, User Interactivity (Human-Computer
Interaction), Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, Computer Vision, Edge and Cloud computing,
and Future Mobile Networks. In terms of applications, the metaverse ecosystem allows human users
to live and play within a self-sustaining, persistent, and shared realm. Therefore, we discuss
six user-centric factors -- Avatar, Content Creation, Virtual Economy, Social Acceptability,
Security and Privacy, and Trust and Accountability. Finally, we propose a concrete research agenda
for the development of the metaverse.

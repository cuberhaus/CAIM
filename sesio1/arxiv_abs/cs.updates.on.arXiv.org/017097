Technological advances allow manufacturers to collect and access data from a production system
effectively. The objective of data collection is to deploy the collected data in developing decision
support systems for performance evaluation, problem identification, and production control.
The goal of this dissertation is to investigate how the collected data can be used to evaluate performance
and optimize manufacturing systems, analytically and empirically. In the first part of the thesis,
I investigate how can the collected data from the shop-floor be used in the efficient control and
design of manufacturing systems? To investigate the impact of possible dependency in the inter-event
times on the optimal control and performance measures of the system, a manufacturing system that
is controlled by using a single-threshold production control policy is analyzed. It is shown that
ignoring autocorrelation in inter-arrival or service times leads to overestimation (underestimation)
of the optimal threshold level for negatively (positively) correlated processes. Then, it is shown
that the optimal control policy of a production/inventory system with correlated inter-arrival
and service times modeled as Markovian Arrival Processes is a state-dependent threshold policy.
In the second part of the thesis, an exploratory data analysis is conducted by using a large industrial
dataset related to the flow of the products at a semiconductor wafer fabrication. Then, the cycle
times of the products are predicted using Machine Learning methods, and the performance of different
prediction algorithms is assessed. The analytical and empirical results presented in this dissertation
show that effective use of collected data from a manufacturing system enables controlling the system
effectively and predicting its main performance measures accurately.

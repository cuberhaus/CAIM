The misunderstanding and incorrect configurations of cryptographic primitives have exposed
severe security vulnerabilities to attackers. Due to the pervasiveness and diversity of cryptographic
misuses, a comprehensive and accurate understanding of how cryptographic misuses can undermine
the security of an Android app is critical to the subsequent mitigation strategies but also challenging.
Although various approaches have been proposed to detect cryptographic misuses in Android apps,
seldom studies have focused on estimating the security risks introduced by cryptographic misuses.
To address this problem, we present an extensible framework for deciding the threat level of cryptographic
misuses in Android apps. Firstly, we propose a unified specification for representing cryptographic
misuses to make our framework extensible and develop adapters to unify the detection results of
the state-of-the-art cryptographic misuse detectors, resulting in an adapter-based detection
toolchain for a more comprehensive list of cryptographic misuses. Secondly, we employ a misuse-originating
data-flow analysis to connect each cryptographic misuse to a set of data-flow sinks in an app, based
on which we propose a quantitative data-flow-driven metric for assessing the overall risk of the
app introduced by cryptographic misuses. To make the per-app assessment more useful in the app vetting
at the app-store level, we apply unsupervised learning to predict and classify the top risky threats,
to guide more efficient subsequent mitigations. In the experiments on an instantiated implementation
of the framework, we evaluate the accuracy of our detection and the effect of data-flow-driven risk
assessment of our framework. Our empirical study on over 40,000 apps as well as the analysis of popular
apps reveals important security observations on the real threats of cryptographic misuses in Android
apps.

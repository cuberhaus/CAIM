Purpose: Mitral valve repair is a complex minimally invasive surgery of the heart valve. In this
context, suture detection from endoscopic images is a highly relevant task that provides quantitative
information to analyse suturing patterns, assess prosthetic configurations and produce augmented
reality visualisations. Facial or anatomical landmark detection tasks typically contain a fixed
number of landmarks, and use regression or fixed heatmap-based approaches to localize the landmarks.
However in endoscopy, there are a varying number of sutures in every image, and the sutures may occur
at any location in the annulus, as they are not semantically unique. Method: In this work, we formulate
the suture detection task as a multi-instance deep heatmap regression problem, to identify entry
and exit points of sutures. We extend our previous work, and introduce the novel use of a 2D Gaussian
layer followed by a differentiable 2D spatial Soft-Argmax layer to function as a local non-maximum
suppression. Results: We present extensive experiments with multiple heatmap distribution functions
and two variants of the proposed model. In the intra-operative domain, Variant 1 showed a mean F1
of +0.0422 over the baseline. Similarly, in the simulator domain, Variant 1 showed a mean F1 of +0.0865
over the baseline. Conclusion: The proposed model shows an improvement over the baseline in the
intra-operative and the simulator domains. The data is made publicly available within the scope
of the MICCAI AdaptOR2021 Challenge https://adaptor2021.github.io/, and the code at https://github.com/Cardio-AI/suture-detection-pytorch/.

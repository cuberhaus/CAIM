Distributional shift, or the mismatch between training and deployment data, is a significant obstacle
to the usage of machine learning in high-stakes industrial applications, such as autonomous driving
and medicine. This creates a need to be able to assess how robustly ML models generalize as well as
the quality of their uncertainty estimates. Standard ML baseline datasets do not allow these properties
to be assessed, as the training, validation and test data are often identically distributed. Recently,
a range of dedicated benchmarks have appeared, featuring both distributionally matched and shifted
data. Among these benchmarks, the Shifts dataset stands out in terms of the diversity of tasks as
well as the data modalities it features. While most of the benchmarks are heavily dominated by 2D
image classification tasks, Shifts contains tabular weather forecasting, machine translation,
and vehicle motion prediction tasks. This enables the robustness properties of models to be assessed
on a diverse set of industrial-scale tasks and either universal or directly applicable task-specific
conclusions to be reached. In this paper, we extend the Shifts Dataset with two datasets sourced
from industrial, high-risk applications of high societal importance. Specifically, we consider
the tasks of segmentation of white matter Multiple Sclerosis lesions in 3D magnetic resonance brain
images and the estimation of power consumption in marine cargo vessels. Both tasks feature ubiquitous
distributional shifts and a strict safety requirement due to the high cost of errors. These new datasets
will allow researchers to further explore robust generalization and uncertainty estimation in
new situations. In this work, we provide a description of the dataset and baseline results for both
tasks.

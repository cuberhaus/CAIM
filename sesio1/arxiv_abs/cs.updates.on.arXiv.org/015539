Road maintenance planning is an integral part of road asset management. One of the main challenges
in Maintenance and Rehabilitation (M&R) practices is to determine maintenance type and timing.
This research proposes a framework using Reinforcement Learning (RL) based on the Long Term Pavement
Performance (LTPP) database to determine the type and timing of M&R practices. A predictive DNN
model is first developed in the proposed algorithm, which serves as the Environment for the RL algorithm.
For the Policy estimation of the RL model, both DQN and PPO models are developed. However, PPO has
been selected in the end due to better convergence and higher sample efficiency. Indicators used
in this study are International Roughness Index (IRI) and Rutting Depth (RD). Initially, we considered
Cracking Metric (CM) as the third indicator, but it was then excluded due to the much fewer data compared
to other indicators, which resulted in lower accuracy of the results. Furthermore, in cost-effectiveness
calculation (reward), we considered both the economic and environmental impacts of M&R treatments.
Costs and environmental impacts have been evaluated with paLATE 2.0 software. Our method is tested
on a hypothetical case study of a six-lane highway with 23 kilometers length located in Texas, which
has a warm and wet climate. The results propose a 20-year M&R plan in which road condition remains
in an excellent condition range. Because the early state of the road is at a good level of service,
there is no need for heavy maintenance practices in the first years. Later, after heavy M&R actions,
there are several 1-2 years of no need for treatments. All of these show that the proposed plan has
a logical result. Decision-makers and transportation agencies can use this scheme to conduct better
maintenance practices that can prevent budget waste and, at the same time, minimize the environmental
impacts.

Edge computing is projected to have profound implications in the coming decades, proposed to provide
solutions for applications such as augmented reality, predictive functionalities, and collaborative
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). For such applications, edge computing addresses the new computational
needs, as well as privacy, availability, and real-time constraints, by providing local high-performance
computing capabilities to deal with the limitations and constraints of cloud and embedded systems.
Our interests lie in the applications of edge computing as part of CPS, where several properties
(or attributes) of trustworthiness, including safety, security, and predictability/availability
are of particular concern, each facing challenges for the introduction of edge-based CPS. We present
the results of a systematic mapping study, a kind of systematic literature survey, investigating
the use of edge computing for CPS with a special emphasis on trustworthiness. The main contributions
of this study are a detailed description of the current research efforts in edge-based CPS and the
identification and discussion of trends and research gaps. The results show that the main body of
research in edge-based CPS only to a very limited extent consider key attributes of system trustworthiness,
despite many efforts referring to critical CPS and applications like intelligent transportation.
More research and industrial efforts will be needed on aspects of trustworthiness of future edge-based
CPS including their experimental evaluation. Such research needs to consider the multiple interrelated
attributes of trustworthiness including safety, security, and predictability, and new methodologies
and architectures to address them. It is further important to provide bridges and collaboration
between edge computing and CPS disciplines.

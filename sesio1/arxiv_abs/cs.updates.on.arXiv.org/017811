Building Information Modeling (BIM) produces three-dimensional models of buildings combining
the geometrical information with a wide range of properties. BIM is slowly but inevitably revolutionizing
the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. Buildings need to be compliant
with regulations about stability, safety, and environmental impact. Manual compliance checking
is tedious and error-prone, and amending flaws discovered only at construction time causes huge
additional costs and delays. Several tools can check BIM models for conformance with rules/guidelines.
For example, Singapore's CORENET e-Submission System checks fire safety. But since the current
BIM exchange format only contains basic information of building objects, a separate, ad-hoc model
pre-processing is required to determine, e.g., evacuation routes. Moreover, they face difficulties
in adapting existing built-in rules and/or adding new ones (to cater for building regulations,
that can vary not only among countries but also among parts of the same city), if at all possible. We
propose the use of logic-based executable formalisms (CLP and Constraint ASP) to couple BIM models
with advanced knowledge representation and reasoning capabilities. Previous experience shows
that such formalisms can be used to uniformly capture and reason with knowledge (including ambiguity)
in a large variety of domains. Additionally, incorporating checking within design tools makes
it possible to ensure that models are rule-compliant at every step. This also prevents erroneous
designs from having to be (partially) redone, which is also costly and burdensome. To validate our
proposal, we implemented a preliminary reasoner under CLP(Q/R) and ASP with constraints and evaluated
it with several BIM models. Under consideration for acceptance in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming
(TPLP).

During the diagnosis of ischemic strokes, the Circle of Willis and its surrounding vessels are the
arteries of interest. Their visualization in case of an acute stroke is often enabled by Computed
Tomography Angiography (CTA). Still, the identification and analysis of the cerebral arteries
remain time consuming in such scans due to a large number of peripheral vessels which may disturb
the visual impression. In previous work we proposed VirtualDSA++, an algorithm designed to segment
and label the cerebrovascular tree on CTA scans. Especially with stroke patients, labeling is a
delicate procedure, as in the worst case whole hemispheres may not be present due to impeded perfusion.
Hence, we extended the labeling mechanism for the cerebral arteries to identify occluded vessels.
In the work at hand, we place the algorithm in a clinical context by evaluating the labeling and occlusion
detection on stroke patients, where we have achieved labeling sensitivities comparable to other
works between 92\,\% and 95\,\%. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work to address labeling
and occlusion detection at once, whereby a sensitivity of 67\,\% and a specificity of 81\,\% were
obtained for the latter. VirtualDSA++ also automatically segments and models the intracranial
system, which we further used in a deep learning driven follow up work. We present the generic concept
of iterative systematic search for pathways on all nodes of said model, which enables new interactive
features. Exemplary, we derive in detail, firstly, the interactive planning of vascular interventions
like the mechanical thrombectomy and secondly, the interactive suppression of vessel structures
that are not of interest in diagnosing strokes (like veins). We discuss both features as well as further
possibilities emerging from the proposed concept.

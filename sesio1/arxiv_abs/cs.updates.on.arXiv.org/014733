Requirements engineering process intends to obtain software services and constraints. This process
is essential to meet the customer's needs and expectations. This process includes three main activities
in general. These are detecting requirements by interacting with software stakeholders, transferring
these requirements into a standard document, and examining that the requirements really define
the software that the client needs. Functional requirements are services that the software should
deliver to the end-user. In addition, functional requirements describe how the software should
respond to specific inputs, and how the software should behave in certain circumstances. This paper
aims to develop a software requirements specification document of the electronic IT news magazine
system. The electronic magazine provides users to post and view up-to-date IT news. Still, there
is a lack in the literature of comprehensive studies about the construction of the electronic magazine
software specification and design in conformance with the contemporary software development
processes. Moreover, there is a need for a suitable research framework to support the requirements
engineering process. The novelty of this paper is the construction of software specification and
design of the electronic magazine by following the Al-Msie'deen research framework. All the documents
of software requirements specification and design have been constructed to conform to the agile
usage-centered design technique and the proposed research framework. A requirements specification
and design are suggested and followed for the construction of the electronic magazine software.
This study proved that involving users extensively in the process of software requirements specification
and design will lead to the creation of dependable and acceptable software systems.

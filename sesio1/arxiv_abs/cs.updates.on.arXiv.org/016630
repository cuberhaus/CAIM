Perching on surfaces of moving objects, like vehicles, could extend the flight times and range of
quadrotors. For surfaces attachment, suction cups are usually adopted due to their durability
and large adhesion force. To seal on surfaces, suction cups are required to be aligned with surfaces
and match to the frictions on end faces induced by relative tangential velocity. However, when the
object surface is moving and inclined such that an aggressive maneuver is required, the attitude
and relative velocity errors of quadrotors would become significant, which poses challenges to
perch. To address the problem, we proposed a real-time trajectory planning algorithm to alleviate
the velocity errors of quadrotors relative to moving surfaces. Multimodal search in dynamic time-domain
is developed in the algorithm and thus the time-optimal aggressive trajectories can be efficiently
generated. To further adapt to the residual attitude and relative velocity errors, we design a compliant
gripper using self-sealing cups. Multiple cups in different directions are integrated into a wheel-like
mechanism to increase the tolerance to attitude errors. The wheel mechanism in the gripper also
eliminates the requirement of matching the attitude and tangential velocity and thus increases
the adaptability to tangential velocity. Extensive tests are conducted, including comparison
experiments, to perch on static and moving surfaces at various inclinations. Results demonstrate
that our proposed system enables a quadrotor to reliably perch on static and moving inclined (up
to 1.18$m/s$ and 90$^\circ$) surfaces with a success rate of 70\% or higher. The trajectory planner
is valid and efficient. Compared to conventional suction cup grippers in moving surface perching,
our gripper has larger adaptability to attitude errors and tangential velocities, and the success
rate increases by 45\%.

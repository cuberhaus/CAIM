A canonical problem in voting theory is: which voting rule should we use to aggregate voters' preferences
into a collective decision over alternatives? When applying the axiomatic approach to evaluate
and compare voting rules, we are faced with prohibitive impossibilities. However, these impossibilities
occur under the assumption that voters' preferences (collectively called a profile) will be worst-case
with respect to the desired criterion. In this paper, we study the axiomatic approach slightly \emph{beyond}
the worst-case: we present and apply a "smoothed" model of the voting setting, which assumes that
while inputs (profiles) may be worst-case, all inputs will be perturbed by a small amount of noise.
In defining and analyzing our noise model, we do not aim to substantially technically innovate on
Lirong Xia's recently-proposed smoothed model of social choice; rather, we offer an alternative
model and approach to analyzing it that aims to strike a different balance of simplicity and technical
generality, and to correspond closely to Spielman and Teng's (2004) original work on smoothed analysis.
Within our model, we then give simple proofs of smoothed-satisfaction or smoothed-violation of
several axioms and paradoxes, including most of those studied by Xia as well as some previously unstudied.
Novel results include smoothed analysis of Arrow's theorem and analyses of the axioms Consistency
and Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives. In independent work from a recent paper by Xia (2022),
we also show the smoothed-satisfaction of coalition-based notions of Strategy-Proofness, Monotonocity,
and Participation. A final, central component of our contributions are the high-level insights
and future directions we identify based on this work, which we describe in detail to maximally facilitate
additional research in this area.

Many of the key enabling technologies of the fifth-generation (5G), such as network slicing, spectrum
sharing, and federated learning, rely on a centralized authority. This may lead to pitfalls in terms
of security or single point of failure. Distributed ledger technology, specifically blockchain,
is currently employed by different applications related to the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G to
address the drawbacks of centralized systems. For this reason, mobile blockchain networks (MBNs)
have recently attracted a great deal of attention. To add a transaction to the blockchain in MBNs,
mobile or IoT users must perform various tasks like encryption, decryption, and mining. These tasks
require energy and processing power, which impose limitations on mobile and IoT users' performance
because they are usually battery powered and have a low processing power. One possible solution
is to perform the tasks virtually on commodity servers provided by mobile edge computing (MEC) or
cloud computing. To do so, all tasks needed to add a transaction to the blockchain can be treated as
virtual blockchain functions that can be executed on commodity servers. We introduce a blockchain
virtualization framework called blockchain function virtualization (BFV), through which all
blockchain functions can be performed virtually by MEC or cloud computing. Furthermore, we describe
applications of the BFV framework and resource allocation challenges brought by the BFV framework
in mobile networks. In addition, to illustrate the advantages of BFV, we define an optimization
problem to simultaneously minimize the energy consumption cost and maximize miners' rewards.
Finally, simulation results show the performance of the proposed framework in terms of total energy
consumption, transaction confirmation rate, and miners' average profit.

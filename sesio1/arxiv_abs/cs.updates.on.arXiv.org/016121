Soccer has a considerable market share of the global sports industry, and the interest in viewing
videos from soccer games continues to grow. In this respect, it is important to provide game summaries
and highlights of the main game events. However, annotating and producing events and summaries
often require expensive equipment and a lot of tedious, cumbersome, manual labor. Therefore, automating
the video production pipeline providing fast game highlights at a much lower cost is seen as the "holy
grail". In this context, recent developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology have
shown great potential. Still, state-of-the-art approaches are far from being adequate for practical
scenarios that have demanding real-time requirements, as well as strict performance criteria
(where at least the detection of official events such as goals and cards must be 100% accurate). In
addition, event detection should be thoroughly enhanced by annotation and classification, proper
clipping, generating short descriptions, selecting appropriate thumbnails for highlight clips,
and finally, combining the event highlights into an overall game summary, similar to what is commonly
aired during sports news. Even though the event tagging operation has by far received the most attention,
an end-to-end video production pipeline also includes various other operations which serve the
overall purpose of automated soccer analysis. This challenge aims to assist the automation of such
a production pipeline using AI. In particular, we focus on the enhancement operations that take
place after an event has been detected, namely event clipping (Task 1), thumbnail selection (Task
2), and game summarization (Task 3). Challenge website: https://mmsys2022.ie/authors/grand-challenge.

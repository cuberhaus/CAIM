A proof of work (PoW) is an important cryptographic construct enabling a party to convince others
that they invested some effort in solving a computational task. Arguably, its main impact has been
in the setting of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain protocol, which
received significant attention in recent years due to its potential for various applications as
well as for solving fundamental distributed computing questions in novel threat models. PoWs enable
the linking of blocks in the blockchain data structure and thus the problem of interest is the feasibility
of obtaining a sequence (chain) of such proofs. In this work, we examine the hardness of finding such
chain of PoWs against quantum strategies. We prove that the chain of PoWs problem reduces to a problem
we call multi-solution Bernoulli search, for which we establish its quantum query complexity.
Effectively, this is an extension of a threshold direct product theorem to an average-case unstructured
search problem. Our proof, adding to active recent efforts, simplifies and generalizes the recording
technique due to Zhandry (Crypto 2019). In addition, we revisit the formal treatment of security
of the core of the Bitcoin consensus protocol, called the Bitcoin backbone (Eurocrypt 2015), against
quantum adversaries and show that its security holds under a quantum analogue of the ``honest majority''
assumption that we formulate. Our analysis indicates that security of the Bitcoin backbone protocol
is guaranteed provided that the number of adversarial quantum queries is bounded so that each quantum
query is worth $O(p^{-1/2})$ classical ones, where $p$ is the probability of success of a single
classical query to the protocol's underlying hash function. Somewhat surprisingly, the wait time
for safe settlement in the case of quantum adversaries matches the safe settlement time in the classical
case.

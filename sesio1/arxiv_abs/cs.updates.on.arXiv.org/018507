Heterogeneous tabular data are the most commonly used form of data and are essential for numerous
critical and computationally demanding applications. On homogeneous data sets, deep neural networks
have repeatedly shown excellent performance and have therefore been widely adopted. However,
their adaptation to tabular data for inference or data generation tasks remains challenging. To
facilitate further progress in the field, this work provides an overview of state-of-the-art deep
learning methods for tabular data. We categorize these methods into three groups: data transformations,
specialized architectures, and regularization models. For each of these groups, our work offers
a comprehensive overview of the main approaches. Moreover, we discuss deep learning approaches
for generating tabular data, and we also provide an overview over strategies for explaining deep
models on tabular data. Thus, our first contribution is to address the main research streams and
existing methodologies in the mentioned areas, while highlighting relevant challenges and open
research questions. Our second contribution is to provide an empirical comparison of traditional
machine learning methods with eleven deep learning approaches across five popular real-world
tabular data sets of different sizes and with different learning objectives. Our results, which
we have made publicly available as competitive benchmarks, indicate that algorithms based on gradient-boosted
tree ensembles still mostly outperform deep learning models on supervised learning tasks, suggesting
that the research progress on competitive deep learning models for tabular data is stagnating.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth overview of deep learning approaches for
tabular data; as such, this work can serve as a valuable starting point to guide researchers and practitioners
interested in deep learning with tabular data.

Virtual Research Environments (VREs) provide user-centric support in the lifecycle of research
activities, e.g., discovering and accessing research assets, or composing and executing application
workflows. A typical VRE is often implemented as an integrated environment, which includes a catalog
of research assets, a workflow management system, a data management framework, and tools for enabling
collaboration among users. Notebook environments, such as Jupyter, allow researchers to rapidly
prototype scientific code and share their experiments as online accessible notebooks. Jupyter
can support several popular languages that are used by data scientists, such as Python, R, and Julia.
However, such notebook environments do not have seamless support for running heavy computations
on remote infrastructure or finding and accessing software code inside notebooks. This paper investigates
the gap between a notebook environment and a VRE and proposes an embedded VRE solution for the Jupyter
environment called Notebook-as-a-VRE (NaaVRE). The NaaVRE solution provides functional components
via a component marketplace and allows users to create a customized VRE on top of the Jupyter environment.
From the VRE, a user can search research assets (data, software, and algorithms), compose workflows,
manage the lifecycle of an experiment, and share the results among users in the community. We demonstrate
how such a solution can enhance a legacy workflow that uses Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data
from country-wide airborne laser scanning surveys for deriving geospatial data products of ecosystem
structure at high resolution over broad spatial extents. This enables users to scale out the processing
of multi-terabyte LiDAR point clouds for ecological applications to more data sources in a distributed
cloud environment.

In recent years, deep-learning-based image processing has emerged as a valuable tool for medical
imaging owing to its high performance. However, the quality of deep-learning-based methods heavily
relies on the amount of training data; the high cost of acquiring a large dataset is a limitation to
their utilization in medical fields. Herein, based on deep learning, we developed a computed tomography
(CT) modality conversion method requiring only a few unsupervised images. The proposed method
is based on CycleGAN with several extensions tailored for CT images, which aims at preserving the
structure in the processed images and reducing the amount of training data. This method was applied
to realize the conversion of megavoltage computed tomography (MVCT) to kilovoltage computed tomography
(kVCT) images. Training was conducted using several datasets acquired from patients with head
and neck cancer. The size of the datasets ranged from 16 slices (two patients) to 2745 slices (137
patients) for MVCT and 2824 slices (98 patients) for kVCT. The required size of the training data
was found to be as small as a few hundred slices. By statistical and visual evaluations, the quality
improvement and structure preservation of the MVCT images converted by the proposed model were
investigated. As a clinical benefit, it was observed by medical doctors that the converted images
enhanced the precision of contouring. We developed an MVCT to kVCT conversion model based on deep
learning, which can be trained using only a few hundred unpaired images. The stability of the model
against changes in data size was demonstrated. This study promotes the reliable use of deep learning
in clinical medicine by partially answering commonly asked questions, such as "Is our data sufficient?"
and "How much data should we acquire?"

In this paper, we present a deep learning-based reduced-order model (DL-ROM) for the stability
prediction of unsteady 3D fluid-structure interaction systems. The proposed DL-ROM has the format
of a nonlinear state-space model and employs a recurrent neural network with long short-term memory
(LSTM). We consider a canonical fluid-structure system of an elastically-mounted sphere coupled
with incompressible fluid flow in a state-space format. We develop a nonlinear data-driven coupling
for predicting unsteady forces and vortex-induced vibration (VIV) lock-in of the freely vibrating
sphere in a transverse direction. We design an input-output relationship as a temporal sequence
of force and displacement datasets for a low-dimensional approximation of the fluid-structure
system. Based on the prior knowledge of the VIV lock-in process, the input function contains a range
of frequencies and amplitudes, which enables an efficient DL-ROM without the need for a massive
training dataset for the low-dimensional modeling. Once trained, the network provides a nonlinear
mapping of input-output dynamics that can predict the coupled fluid-structure dynamics for a longer
horizon via the feedback process. By integrating the LSTM network with the eigensystem realization
algorithm (ERA), we construct a data-driven state-space model for the reduced-order stability
analysis. We investigate the underlying mechanism and stability characteristics of VIV via an
eigenvalue selection process. To understand the frequency lock-in mechanism, we study the eigenvalue
trajectories for a range of the reduced oscillation frequencies and the mass ratios. Consistent
with the full-order simulations, the frequency lock-in branches are accurately captured by the
combined LSTM-ERA procedure. The proposed DL-ROM aligns with the development of physics-based
digital twin of engineering systems involving fluid-structure interactions.

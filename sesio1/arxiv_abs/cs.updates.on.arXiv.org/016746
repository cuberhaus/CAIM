Pressure ulcers are a challenge for patients and healthcare professionals. In the UK, 700,000 people
are affected by pressure ulcers each year. Treating them costs the National Health Service {\pounds}3.8
million every day. Their etiology is complex and multifactorial. However, evidence has shown a
strong link between old age, disease-related sedentary lifestyles and unhealthy eating habits.
Pressure ulcers are caused by direct skin contact with a bed or chair without frequent position changes.
Urinary and faecal incontinence, diabetes, and injuries that restrict body position and nutrition
are also known risk factors. Guidelines and treatments exist but their implementation and success
vary across different healthcare settings. This is primarily because healthcare practitioners
have a) minimal experience in dealing with pressure ulcers, and b) a general lack of understanding
of pressure ulcer treatments. Poorly managed, pressure ulcers lead to severe pain, poor quality
of life, and significant healthcare costs. In this paper, we report the findings of a clinical trial
conducted by Mersey Care NHS Foundation Trust that evaluated the performance of a faster region-based
convolutional neural network and mobile platform that categorised and documented pressure ulcers.
The neural network classifies category I, II, III, and IV pressure ulcers, deep tissue injuries,
and unstageable pressure ulcers. Photographs of pressure ulcers taken by district nurses are transmitted
over 4/5G communications to an inferencing server for classification. Classified images are stored
and reviewed to assess the model's predictions and relevance as a tool for clinical decision making
and standardised reporting. The results from the study generated a mean average Precision=0.6796,
Recall=0.6997, F1-Score=0.6786 with 45 false positives using an @.75 confidence score threshold.

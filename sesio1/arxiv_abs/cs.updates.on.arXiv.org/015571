Large genomic datasets are now created through numerous activities, including recreational genealogical
investigations, biomedical research, and clinical care. At the same time, genomic data has become
valuable for reuse beyond their initial point of collection, but privacy concerns often hinder
access. Over the past several years, Beacon services have emerged to broaden accessibility to such
data. These services enable users to query for the presence of a particular minor allele in a private
dataset, information that can help care providers determine if genomic variation is spurious or
has some known clinical indication. However, various studies have shown that even this limited
access model can leak if individuals are members in the underlying dataset. Several approaches
for mitigating this vulnerability have been proposed, but they are limited in that they 1) typically
rely on heuristics and 2) offer probabilistic privacy guarantees, but neglect utility. In this
paper, we present a novel algorithmic framework to ensure privacy in a Beacon service setting with
a minimal number of query response flips (e.g., changing a positive response to a negative). Specifically,
we represent this problem as combinatorial optimization in both the batch setting (where queries
arrive all at once), as well as the online setting (where queries arrive sequentially). The former
setting has been the primary focus in prior literature, whereas real Beacons allow sequential queries,
motivating the latter investigation. We present principled algorithms in this framework with
both privacy and, in some cases, worst-case utility guarantees. Moreover, through an extensive
experimental evaluation, we show that the proposed approaches significantly outperform the state
of the art in terms of privacy and utility.

This work proposes a domain-informed neural network architecture for experimental particle physics,
using particle interaction localization with the time-projection chamber (TPC) technology for
dark matter research as an example application. A key feature of the signals generated within the
TPC is that they allow localization of particle interactions through a process called reconstruction.
While multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) have emerged as a leading contender for reconstruction in
TPCs, such a black-box approach does not reflect prior knowledge of the underlying scientific processes.
This paper looks anew at neural network-based interaction localization and encodes prior detector
knowledge, in terms of both signal characteristics and detector geometry, into the feature encoding
and the output layers of a multilayer neural network. The resulting Domain-informed Neural Network
(DiNN) limits the receptive fields of the neurons in the initial feature encoding layers in order
to account for the spatially localized nature of the signals produced within the TPC. This aspect
of the DiNN, which has similarities with the emerging area of graph neural networks in that the neurons
in the initial layers only connect to a handful of neurons in their succeeding layer, significantly
reduces the number of parameters in the network in comparison to an MLP. In addition, in order to account
for the detector geometry, the output layers of the network are modified using two geometric transformations
to ensure the DiNN produces localizations within the interior of the detector. The end result is
a neural network architecture that has 60% fewer parameters than an MLP, but that still achieves
similar localization performance and provides a path to future architectural developments with
improved performance because of their ability to encode additional domain knowledge into the architecture.

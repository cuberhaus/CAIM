Challenging environments comprise a range of scenarios, which share the fact that it is extremely
difficult to establish a communication link using conventional technology due to many impairments
typically associated with the propagation medium and increased signal scattering. Specifically,
underwater and underground media are known to absorb electromagnetic radiation, which heavily
affects the overall path loss. Industrial and disaster environments can be viewed as rich scattering
environments with corresponding substantial multipath propagation leading to intersymbol interference
and deterioration of signal quality. Although the challenges for the design of communication networks,
and specifically the Internet of Things (IoT), in such environments are known, there is no common
enabler or solution for all these applications. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have
been introduced to improve the signal propagation characteristics by focusing the signal power
in the preferred direction, thus making the communication environment 'smart'. While the usual
application of RIS is related to blockage avoidance, the very same technique can be used to reduce
the effect of multipath and even partially compensate the signal absorption via passive beamforming.
Due to the beneficial properties of RIS, its use in challenging environments can become the aforementioned
enabler and a game changing technology. In this paper, we discuss potential use cases, deployment
strategies and design aspects for RIS devices in underwater IoT, underground IoT as well as Industry
4.0 and emergency networks. Furthermore, we provide a potential hardware architecture and derive
the expected signal quality. The numerical results reveal substantial performance gains of up
to 20 dB per decade. In addition, novel research challenges to be addressed in this context are described.

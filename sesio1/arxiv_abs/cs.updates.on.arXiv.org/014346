Recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in the blockchain technology, and many blockchain-based
applications have been developed to take advantage of its decentralization, transparency, fault
tolerance, and strong security. In the field of smart grids, a plethora of proposals have emerged
to utilize blockchain for augmenting intelligent energy management, energy trading, security
and privacy protection, microgrid management, and energy vehicles. Compared with traditional
centralized approaches, blockchain-based solutions are able to exploit the advantages of blockchain
to realize better functionality in smart grids. However, the blockchain technology itself has
its disadvantages in low processing throughput and weak privacy protection. Therefore, it is of
paramount importance to study how to integrate blockchain with smart grids in a more effective way
so that the advantages of blockchain can be maximized and its disadvantages can be avoided. This
article surveys the state-of-the-art solutions aiming to integrate the emergent blockchain technology
with smart grids. The goal of this survey is to discuss the necessity of applying blockchain in different
components of smart grids, identify the challenges encountered by current solutions, and highlight
the frameworks and techniques used to integrate blockchain with smart grids. We also present thorough
comparison studies among blockchain-based solutions for smart grids from different perspectives,
with the aim to provide insights on integrating blockchain with smart grids for different smart
grid management tasks. Finally, we list the current projects and initiatives demonstrating the
current effort from the practice side. Additionally, we draw attention to open problems that have
not yet been tackled by existing solutions, and point out possible future research directions.

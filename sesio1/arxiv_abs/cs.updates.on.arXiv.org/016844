In simulation sciences, it is desirable to capture the real-world problem features as accurately
as possible. Methods popular for scientific simulations such as the finite element method (FEM)
and finite volume method (FVM) use piecewise polynomials to approximate various characteristics
of a problem, such as the concentration profile and the temperature distribution across the domain.
Polynomials are prone to creating artifacts such as Gibbs oscillations while capturing a complex
profile. An efficient and accurate approach must be applied to deal with such inconsistencies in
order to obtain accurate simulations. This often entails dealing with negative values for the concentration
of chemicals, exceeding a percentage value over 100, and other such problems. We consider these
inconsistencies in the context of partial differential equations (PDEs). We propose an innovative
filter based on convex optimization to deal with the inconsistencies observed in polynomial-based
simulations. In two or three spatial dimensions, additional complexities are involved in solving
the problems related to structure preservation. We present the construction and application of
a structure-preserving filter with a focus on multidimensional PDEs. Methods used such as the Barycentric
interpolation for polynomial evaluation at arbitrary points in the domain and an optimized root-finder
to identify points of interest improve the filter efficiency, usability, and robustness. Lastly,
we present numerical experiments in 2D and 3D using discontinuous Galerkin formulation and demonstrate
the filter's efficacy to preserve the desired structure. As a real-world application, implementation
of the mathematical biology model involving platelet aggregation and blood coagulation has been
reviewed and the issues around FEM implementation of the model are resolved by applying the proposed
structure-preserving filter.

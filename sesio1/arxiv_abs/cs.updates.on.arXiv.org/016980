As one of the main governing equations in kinetic theory, the Boltzmann equation is widely utilized
in aerospace, microscopic flow, etc. Its high-resolution simulation is crucial in these related
areas. However, due to the high dimensionality of the Boltzmann equation, high-resolution simulations
are often difficult to achieve numerically. The moment method which was first proposed by Grad is
among the popular numerical methods to achieve efficient high-resolution simulations. We can
derive the governing equations in the moment method by taking moments on both sides of the Boltzmann
equation, which effectively reduces the dimensionality of the problem. However, one of the main
challenges is that it leads to an unclosed moment system, and closure is needed to obtain a closed
moment system. It is truly an art in designing closures for moment systems and has been a significant
research field in kinetic theory. Other than the traditional human designs of closures, the machine
learning-based approach has attracted much attention lately in Han et al. and Huang et al. In this
work, we propose a machine learning-based method to derive a moment closure model for the Boltzmann-BGK
equation. In particular, the closure relation is approximated by a carefully designed deep neural
network that possesses desirable physical invariances, i.e., the Galilean invariance, reflecting
invariance, and scaling invariance, inherited from the original Boltzmann-BGK equation and playing
an important role in the correct simulation of the Boltzmann equation. Numerical simulations on
the 1D-1D examples including the smooth and discontinuous initial condition problems, Sod shock
tube problem, the shock structure problems, and the 1D-3D examples including the smooth and discontinuous
problems demonstrate satisfactory numerical performances of the proposed invariance preserving
neural closure method.

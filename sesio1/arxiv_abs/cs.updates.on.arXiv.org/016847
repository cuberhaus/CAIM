Digital systems for analyzing human communication data have become prevalent in recent years.
Intelligence analysis of communications data in investigative journalism, criminal intelligence,
and law present particularly interesting cases, as they must take into account the often highly
sensitive properties of the underlying operations and data. At the same time, these are areas where
increasingly automated, sophisticated approaches systems can be particularly relevant, especially
in terms of Big Data manageability. However, by the shifting of responsibilities, this also poses
dangers. In addition to privacy concerns, these dangers relate to uncertain or poor data quality,
leading to discrimination and potentially misleading insights. Visual analytics combines machine
learning methods with interactive visual interfaces to enable human sense- and decision-making.
This technique can be key for designing and operating meaningful interactive communication analysis
systems that consider these ethical challenges. In this interdisciplinary work, a joint endeavor
of computer scientists, ethicists, and scholars in Science & Technology Studies, we investigate
and evaluate opportunities and risks involved in using Visual analytics approaches for communication
analysis in intelligence applications in particular. We introduce, at first, the common technological
systems used in communication analysis, further discussing the domain-specific ethical implications,
tensions, and risks involved. We then make the case of how tailored Visual Analytics approaches
may reduce and mitigate the described problems, both theoretically and through practical examples.
We show that finding Visual Analytics design solutions for ethical issues is not a mere optimization
task, but balancing out and negotiating these trade-offs has, as we argue, to be an integral aspect
of the system design process from the outset.

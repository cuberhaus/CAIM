In this paper, we propose a probabilistic physics-guided framework, termed Physics-guided Deep
Markov Model (PgDMM). The framework is especially targeted to the inference of the characteristics
and latent structure of nonlinear dynamical systems from measurement data, where it is typically
intractable to perform exact inference of latent variables. A recently surfaced option pertains
to leveraging variational inference to perform approximate inference. In such a scheme, transition
and emission functions of the system are parameterized via feed-forward neural networks (deep
generative models). However, due to the generalized and highly versatile formulation of neural
network functions, the learned latent space is often prone to lack physical interpretation and
structured representation. To address this, we bridge physics-based state space models with Deep
Markov Models, thus delivering a hybrid modeling framework for unsupervised learning and identification
for nonlinear dynamical systems. Specifically, the transition process can be modeled as a physics-based
model enhanced with an additive neural network component, which aims to learn the discrepancy between
the physics-based model and the actual dynamical system being monitored. The proposed framework
takes advantage of the expressive power of deep learning, while retaining the driving physics of
the dynamical system by imposing physics-driven restrictions on the side of the latent space. We
demonstrate the benefits of such a fusion in terms of achieving improved performance on illustrative
simulation examples and experimental case studies of nonlinear systems. Our results indicate
that the physics-based models involved in the employed transition and emission functions essentially
enforce a more structured and physically interpretable latent space, which is essential to generalization
and prediction capabilities.

Artificial intelligence is already ubiquitous, and is increasingly being used to autonomously
make ever more consequential decisions. However, there has been relatively little research into
the existing and possible consequences for population health equity. A narrative review was undertaken
using a hermeneutic approach to explore current and future uses of narrow AI and automated decision
systems (ADS) in medicine and public health, issues that have emerged, and implications for equity.
Accounts reveal a tremendous expectation on AI to transform medical and public health practices.
Prominent demonstrations of AI capability - particularly in diagnostic decision making, risk
prediction, and surveillance - are stimulating rapid adoption, spurred by COVID-19. Automated
decisions being made have significant consequences for individual and population health and wellbeing.
Meanwhile, it is evident that hazards including bias, incontestability, and privacy erosion have
emerged in sensitive domains such as criminal justice where narrow AI and ADS are in common use. Reports
of issues arising from their use in health are already appearing. As the use of ADS in health expands,
it is probable that these hazards will manifest more widely. Bias, incontestability, and privacy
erosion give rise to mechanisms by which existing social, economic and health disparities are perpetuated
and amplified. Consequently, there is a significant risk that use of ADS in health will exacerbate
existing population health inequities. The industrial scale and rapidity with which ADS can be
applied heightens the risk to population health equity. It is incumbent on health practitioners
and policy makers therefore to explore the potential implications of using ADS, to ensure the use
of artificial intelligence promotes population health and equity.

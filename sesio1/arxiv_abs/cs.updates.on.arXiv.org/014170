We conduct a large-scale social media-based study of oral health during the COVID-19 pandemic based
on tweets from 9,104 Twitter users across 26 states (with sufficient samples) in the United States
for the period between November 12, 2020 and June 14, 2021. To better understand how discussions
on different topics/oral diseases vary across the users, we acquire or infer demographic information
of users and other characteristics based on retrieved information from user profiles. Women and
younger adults (19-29) are more likely to talk about oral health problems. We use the LDA topic model
to extract the major topics/oral diseases in tweets. Overall, 26.70% of the Twitter users talk about
wisdom tooth pain/jaw hurt, 23.86% tweet about dental service/cavity, 18.97% discuss chipped
tooth/tooth break, 16.23% talk about dental pain, and the rest are about tooth decay/gum bleeding.
By conducting logistic regression, we find that discussions vary across user characteristics.
More importantly, we find social disparities in oral health during the pandemic. Specifically,
we find that health insurance coverage rate is the most significant predictor in logistic regression
for topic prediction. People from counties with higher insurance coverage tend to tweet less about
all topics of oral diseases. People from counties at a higher risk of COVID-19 talk more about tooth
decay/gum bleeding and chipped tooth/tooth break. Older adults (50+), who are vulnerable to COVID-19,
are more likely to discuss dental pain. To our best knowledge, this is the first large-scale social
media-based study to analyze and understand oral health in America amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
We hope the findings of our study through the lens of social media can provide insights for oral health
practitioners and policy makers.

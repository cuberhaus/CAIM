With the rapid proliferation of the Internet, the area of education has undergone a massive transformation
in terms of how students and instructors interact in a classroom. Online learning now takes more
than one form, including the use of technology to enhance a face-to-face class, a hybrid class that
combines both face-to-face meetings and online work, and fully online courses. Further, online
classrooms are usually composed of an online education forum (OEF) where students and instructor
discuss open-ended questions for gaining better understanding of the subject. However, empirical
studies have repeatedly shown that the dropout rates in these online courses are very high partly
due to the lack of motivation among the enrolled students. We undertake an empirical comparison
of student behavior in OEFs associated with a graduate-level course during two terms. We identify
key parameters dictating the dynamics of OEFs like effective incentive design, student heterogeneity,
and super-posters phenomenon. Motivated by empirical observations, we propose an analytical
model based on continuous time Markov chains (CTMCs) to capture instructor-student interactions
in an OEF. Using concepts from lumpability of CTMCs, we compute steady state and transient probabilities
along with expected net-rewards for the instructor and the students. We formulate a mixed-integer
linear program which views an OEF as a single-leader-multiple-followers Stackelberg game. Through
simulations, we observe that students exhibit varied degree of non-monotonicity in their participation
(with increasing instructor involvement). We also study the effect of instructor bias and budget
on the student participation levels. Our model exhibits the empirically observed super-poster
phenomenon under certain parameter configurations and recommends an optimal plan to the instructor
for maximizing student participation in OEFs.

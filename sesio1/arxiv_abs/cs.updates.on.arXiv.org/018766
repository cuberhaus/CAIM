By the end of 2021, the renewable energy share of the global electricity capacity reached 38.3% and
the new installations are dominated by wind and solar energy, showing global increases of 12.7%
and 18.5%, respectively. However, both wind and photovoltaic energy sources are highly volatile
making planning difficult for grid operators, so accurate forecasts of the corresponding weather
variables are essential for reliable electricity predictions. The most advanced approach in weather
prediction is the ensemble method, which opens the door for probabilistic forecasting; though
ensemble forecast are often underdispersive and subject to systematic bias. Hence, they require
some form of statistical post-processing, where parametric models provide full predictive distributions
of the weather variables at hand. We propose a general two-step machine learning-based approach
to calibrating ensemble weather forecasts, where in the first step improved point forecasts are
generated, which are then together with various ensemble statistics serve as input features of
the neural network estimating the parameters of the predictive distribution. In two case studies
based of 100m wind speed and global horizontal irradiance forecasts of the operational ensemble
pre diction system of the Hungarian Meteorological Service, the predictive performance of this
novel method is compared with the forecast skill of the raw ensemble and the state-of-the-art parametric
approaches. Both case studies confirm that at least up to 48h statistical post-processing substantially
improves the predictive performance of the raw ensemble for all considered forecast horizons.
The investigated variants of the proposed two-step method outperform in skill their competitors
and the suggested new approach is well applicable for different weather quantities and for a fair
range of predictive distributions.

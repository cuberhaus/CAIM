The ongoing NIST standardization process has shown that Proof of Knowledge (PoK) based signatures
have become an important type of possible post-quantum signatures. Regarding code-based cryptography,
the original approach for PoK based signatures is the Stern protocol which allows to prove the knowledge
of a small weight vector solving a given instance of the Syndrome Decoding (SD) problem over F2. It
features a soundness error equal to 2/3. This protocol was improved a few years later by V\'eron who
proposed a variation of the scheme based on the General Syndrome Decoding (GSD) problem which leads
to better results in term of communication. A few years later, the AGS protocol introduced a variation
of the V\'eron protocol based on Quasi-Cyclic (QC) matrices. The AGS protocol permits to obtain
an asymptotic soundness error of 1/2 and an improvement in term of communications. In the present
paper, we introduce the Quasi-Cyclic Stern PoK which constitutes an adaptation of the AGS scheme
in a SD context, as well as several new optimizations for code-based PoK. Our main optimization on
the size of the signature can't be applied to GSD based protocols such as AGS and therefore motivated
the design of our new protocol. In addition, we also provide a special soundness proof that is compatible
with the use of the Fiat-Shamir transform for 5-round protocols. This approach is valid for our protocol
but also for the AGS protocol which was lacking such a proof. We compare our results with existing
signatures including the recent code-based signatures based on PoK leveraging the MPC in the head
paradigm. In practice, our new protocol is as fast as AGS while reducing its associated signature
length by 20%. As a consequence, it constitutes an interesting trade-off between signature length
and execution time for the design of a code-based signature relying only on the difficulty of the
SD problem.

Algorithmic classification of research publications has been created to study different aspects
of research. Such classifications can be used to support information needs in universities for
decision making. However, the classifications have foremost been evaluated quantitatively regarding
their content, but not qualitatively regarding their feasibility in a specific context. The aim
of this study was to explore and evaluate the usefulness of such classifications to users in the context
of exploring an emerging research area. I conducted four interviews with managers of a project aimed
to support research and application of artificial intelligence at the Swedish medical university
Karolinska Institutet. The interviews focused on the information need of the managers. To support
the project, a classification was created by clustering of publications in a citation network.
A cluster map based on this classification was provided to the project leader and one interview focused
on the use of the classification in the project in relation to the stated information needs. The interviews
showed that the aim of the project was to improve competence, enhance communication between researchers
and develop support structures. Getting an overview of artificial intelligence at the university
and information about who is doing what was important to fulfill this aim. The cluster map was used
to support activities conducted by the project leader, such as interviews and information gathering.
It was also used to get overview and display of AI research at KI. Interpretation was found to be challenging
in some cases. The interactivity of the map facilitated interpretation. This study was small in
scope, but it provides one piece of knowledge about the information needs related to algorithmic
classifications.

Imagine a swarm of terrestrial robots that can explore an environment, and, upon completion of this
task, reconfigure into a spherical ball and roll out. This dimensional change alters the dynamics
of locomotion and can assist them to maneuver variable terrains. The sphere-plane reconfiguration
is equivalent to projecting a spherical shell onto a plane, an operation which is not possible without
distortions. Fortunately, soft materials have potential to adapt to this disparity of the Gaussian
curvatures. Modular Soft Robots (MSoRos) have promise of achieving dimensional change by exploiting
their continuum and deformable nature. We present topology and morphology design of MSoRos capable
of reconfiguring between spherical and planar configurations. Our approach is based in geometry,
where a platonic solid determines the number of modules required for plane-to-sphere reconfiguration
and the radius of the resulting sphere, e.g., four `tetrahedron-based' or six `cube-based' MSoRos
are required for spherical reconfiguration. The methodology involves: (1)inverse orthographic
projection of a `module-topology curve' onto the circumscribing sphere to generate the spherical
topology,(2)azimuthal projection of the spherical topology onto a tangent plane at the center
of the module resulting in the planar topology, and (3)adjusting the limb stiffness and curling
ability by manipulating the geometry of cavities to realize a physical finite-width, Motor-Tendon
Actuated MSoRo. The topology design is shown to be scale invariant, i.e., scaling of base platonic
solid is reflected linearly in spherical and planar topologies. The module-topology curve is optimized
for the reconfiguration and locomotion ability using a metric that quantifies sphere-to-plane
distortion. The geometry of the cavity optimizes for the limb stiffness and curling ability without
compromising the actuator's structural integrity.

This article presents a new high-order accurate algorithm for finding a particular solution to
a linear, constant-coefficient partial differential equation (PDE) by means of a convolution
of the volumetric source function with the Green's function in complex geometries. Utilizing volumetric
domain decomposition, the integral is computed over a union of regular boxes (lending the scheme
compatibility with adaptive box codes) and triangular regions (which may be potentially curved
near boundaries). Singular and near-singular quadrature is handled by converting integrals on
volumetric regions to line integrals bounding a reference volume cell using cell mappings and elements
of the Poincar\'e lemma, followed by leveraging existing one-dimensional near-singular and singular
quadratures appropriate to the singular nature of the kernel. The scheme achieves compatibility
with fast multipole methods (FMMs) and thereby optimal asymptotic complexity by coupling global
rules for target-independent quadrature of smooth functions to local target-dependent singular
quadrature corrections, and it relies on orthogonal polynomial systems on each cell for well-conditioned,
high-order and efficient (with respect to number of required volume function evaluations) approximation
of arbitrary volumetric sources. Our domain discretization scheme is naturally compatible with
standard meshing software such as Gmsh, which are employed to discretize a narrow region surrounding
the domain boundaries. We present 8th-order accurate results, demonstrate the success of the method
with examples showing up to 12-digit accuracy on complex geometries, and, for static geometries,
our numerical examples show well over $99\%$ of evaluation time of the particular solution is spent
in the FMM step.

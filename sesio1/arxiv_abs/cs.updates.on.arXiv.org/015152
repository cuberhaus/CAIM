Seminal works on light spanners over the years provide spanners with optimal lightness in various
graph classes, such as in general graphs, Euclidean spanners, and minor-free graphs. Three shortcomings
of previous works on light spanners are: (1) The techniques are ad hoc per graph class, and thus can't
be applied broadly. (2) The runtimes of these constructions are almost always sub-optimal, and
usually far from optimal. (3) These constructions are optimal in the standard and crude sense, but
not in a refined sense that takes into account a wider range of involved parameters. This work aims
at addressing these shortcomings by presenting a unified framework of light spanners in a variety
of graph classes. Informally, the framework boils down to a transformation from sparse spanners
to light spanners; since the state-of-the-art for sparse spanners is much more advanced than that
for light spanners, such a transformation is powerful. Our framework is developed in two papers.
The current paper is the first of the two -- it lays the basis of the unified framework and then applies
it to design fast constructions with optimal lightness for several graph classes. Among various
applications and implications of our framework, we highlight here the following: _ In low-dimensional
Euclidean spaces, we present an $O(n\log n)$-time construction of $(1+\epsilon)$-spanners with
lightness and degree both bounded by constants in the algebraic computation tree (ACT). Our construction
resolves a major problem in the area of geometric spanners, which was open for three decades. _ In
general graphs, for any $k \geq 2$, we construct a $(2k-1)(1+\epsilon)$-spanner with lightness
$O(n^{1/k})$ in $O(m \alpha(m,n))$ time. This result for light spanners in general weighted graphs
is surprising, as it outperforms the analog one for sparse spanners.

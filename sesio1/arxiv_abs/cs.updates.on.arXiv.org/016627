In sponsored search advertising, advertisers need to make a series of keyword decisions. Among
them, how to group these keywords to form several adgroups within a campaign is a challenging task,
due to the highly uncertain environment of search advertising. This paper proposes a stochastic
programming model for keywords grouping, taking click-through rate and conversion rate as random
variables, with consideration of budget constraints and advertisers' risk-tolerance. A branch-and-bound
algorithm is developed to solve our model. Furthermore, we conduct computational experiments
to evaluate the effectiveness of our model and solution, with two real-world datasets collected
from reports and logs of search advertising campaigns. Experimental results illustrated that
our keywords grouping approach outperforms five baselines, and it can approximately approach
the optimum in a steady way. This research generates several interesting findings that illuminate
critical managerial insights for advertisers in sponsored search advertising. First, keywords
grouping does matter for advertisers, especially in the situation with a large number of keywords.
Second, in keyword grouping decisions, the marginal profit does not necessarily show the marginal
diminishing phenomenon as the budget increases. Such that, it's a worthy try for advertisers to
increase their budget in keywords grouping decisions, in order to obtain additional profit. Third,
the optimal keywords grouping solution is a result of multifaceted trade-off among various advertising
factors. In particular, assigning more keywords into adgroups or having more budget won't certainly
lead to higher profits. This suggests a warning for advertisers that it's not wise to take the number
of keywords as the criterion for keywords grouping decisions.

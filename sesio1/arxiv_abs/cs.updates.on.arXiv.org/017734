The collection and the analysis of kidney stone morphological criteria are essential for an aetiological
diagnosis of stone disease. However, in-situ LASER-based fragmentation of urinary stones, which
is now the most established chirurgical intervention, may destroy the morphology of the targeted
stone. In the current study, we assess the performance and added value of processing complete digital
endoscopic video sequences for the automatic recognition of stone morphological features during
a standard-of-care intra-operative session. To this end, a computer-aided video classifier was
developed to predict in-situ the morphology of stone using an intra-operative digital endoscopic
video acquired in a clinical setting. The proposed technique was evaluated on pure (i.e. include
one morphology) and mixed (i.e. include at least two morphologies) stones involving "Ia/Calcium
Oxalate Monohydrate (COM)", "IIb/ Calcium Oxalate Dihydrate (COD)" and "IIIb/Uric Acid (UA)"
morphologies. 71 digital endoscopic videos (50 exhibited only one morphological type and 21 displayed
two) were analyzed using the proposed video classifier (56840 frames processed in total). Using
the proposed approach, diagnostic performances (averaged over both pure and mixed stone types)
were as follows: balanced accuracy=88%, sensitivity=80%, specificity=95%, precision=78% and
F1-score=78%. The obtained results demonstrate that AI applied on digital endoscopic video sequences
is a promising tool for collecting morphological information during the time-course of the stone
fragmentation process without resorting to any human intervention for stone delineation or selection
of good quality steady frames. To this end, irrelevant image information must be removed from the
prediction process at both frame and pixel levels, which is now feasible thanks to the use of AI-dedicated
networks.

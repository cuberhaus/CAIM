Understanding the movement of animals is crucial to conservation efforts. Past research often
focuses on factors affecting movement, rather than locations of interest that animals return to
or habitat. We explore the use of clustering to identify locations of interest to African Elephants
in regions of Sub-Saharan Africa. Our analysis was performed using publicly available datasets
for tracking African elephants at Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa; Etosha National Park,
Namibia; as well as areas in Burkina Faso and the Congo. Using the DBSCAN and KMeans clustering algorithms,
we calculate clusters and centroids to simplify elephant movement data and highlight important
locations of interest. Through a comparison of feature spaces with and without temperature, we
show that temperature is an important feature to explain movement clustering. Recognizing the
importance of temperature, we develop a technique to add external temperature data from an API to
other geospatial datasets that would otherwise not have temperature data. After addressing the
hurdles of using external data with marginally different timestamps, we consider the quality of
this data, and the quality of the centroids of the clusters calculated based on this external temperature
data. Finally, we overlay these centroids onto satellite imagery and locations of human settlements
to validate the real-life applications of the calculated centroids to identify locations of interest
for elephants. As expected, we confirmed that elephants tend to cluster their movement around sources
of water as well as some human settlements, especially those with water holes. Identifying key locations
of interest for elephants is beneficial in predicting the movement of elephants and preventing
poaching. These methods may in the future be applied to other animals beyond elephants to identify
locations of interests for them.

The Area Under the the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) Curve, referred to as AUC, is a well-known
performance measure in the supervised learning domain. Due to its compelling features, it has been
employed in a number of studies to evaluate and compare the performance of different classifiers.
In this work, we explore AUC as a performance measure in the unsupervised learning domain, more specifically,
in the context of cluster analysis. In particular, we elaborate on the use of AUC as an internal/relative
measure of clustering quality, which we refer to as Area Under the Curve for Clustering (AUCC). We
show that the AUCC of a given candidate clustering solution has an expected value under a null model
of random clustering solutions, regardless of the size of the dataset and, more importantly, regardless
of the number or the (im)balance of clusters under evaluation. In addition, we elaborate on the fact
that, in the context of internal/relative clustering validation as we consider, AUCC is actually
a linear transformation of the Gamma criterion from Baker and Hubert (1975), for which we also formally
derive a theoretical expected value for chance clusterings. We also discuss the computational
complexity of these criteria and show that, while an ordinary implementation of Gamma can be computationally
prohibitive and impractical for most real applications of cluster analysis, its equivalence with
AUCC actually unveils a much more efficient algorithmic procedure. Our theoretical findings are
supported by experimental results. These results show that, in addition to an effective and robust
quantitative evaluation provided by AUCC, visual inspection of the ROC curves themselves can be
useful to further assess a candidate clustering solution from a broader, qualitative perspective
as well.

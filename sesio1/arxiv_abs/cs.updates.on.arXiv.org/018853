A simultaneously transmitting and reflecting intelligent surface (STARS) enabled integrated
sensing and communications (ISAC) framework is proposed, where the whole space is divided by STARS
into a sensing space and a communication space. A novel sensing-at-STARS structure, where dedicated
sensors are installed at the STARS, is proposed to address the significant path loss and clutter
interference for sensing. The Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) of the 2-dimension (2D) direction-of-arrivals
(DOAs) estimation of the sensing target is derived, which is then minimized subject to the minimum
communication requirement. A novel approach is proposed to transform the complicated CRB minimization
problem into a trackable modified Fisher information matrix (FIM) optimization problem. Both
independent and coupled phase-shift models of STARS are investigated: 1) For the independent phase-shift
model, to address the coupling of ISAC waveform and STARS coefficient in the modified FIM, an efficient
double-loop iterative algorithm based on the penalty dual decomposition (PDD) framework is conceived;
2) For the coupled phase-shift model, based on the PDD framework, a low complexity alternating optimization
algorithm is proposed to tackle coupled phase-shift constants by alternatively optimizing amplitude
and phase-shift coefficients in closed-form. Finally, the numerical results demonstrate that:
1) STARS significantly outperforms the conventional RIS in CRB under the communication constraints;
2) The coupled phase-shift model achieves comparable performance to the independent one for low
communication requirements or sufficient STARS elements; 3) It is more efficient to increase the
number of passive elements of STARS rather than the active elements of the sensor; 4) High sensing
accuracy can be achieved by STARS using the practical 2D maximum likelihood estimator compared
with the conventional RIS.

For the past two decades, there have been significant efforts to develop methods for object detection
in Remote Sensing (RS) images. In most cases, the datasets for small object detection in remote sensing
images are inadequate. Many researchers used scene classification datasets for object detection,
which has its limitations; for example, the large-sized objects outnumber the small objects in
object categories. Thus, they lack diversity; this further affects the detection performance
of small object detectors in RS images. This paper reviews current datasets and object detection
methods (deep learning-based) for remote sensing images. We also propose a large-scale, publicly
available benchmark Remote Sensing Super-resolution Object Detection (RSSOD) dataset. The RSSOD
dataset consists of 1,759 hand-annotated images with 22,091 instances of very high resolution
(VHR) images with a spatial resolution of ~0.05 m. There are five classes with varying frequencies
of labels per class. The image patches are extracted from satellite images, including real image
distortions such as tangential scale distortion and skew distortion. We also propose a novel Multi-class
Cyclic super-resolution Generative adversarial network with Residual feature aggregation (MCGR)
and auxiliary YOLOv5 detector to benchmark image super-resolution-based object detection and
compare with the existing state-of-the-art methods based on image super-resolution (SR). The
proposed MCGR achieved state-of-the-art performance for image SR with an improvement of 1.2dB
PSNR compared to the current state-of-the-art NLSN method. MCGR achieved best object detection
mAPs of 0.758, 0.881, 0.841, and 0.983, respectively, for five-class, four-class, two-class,
and single classes, respectively surpassing the performance of the state-of-the-art object detectors
YOLOv5, EfficientDet, Faster RCNN, SSD, and RetinaNet.

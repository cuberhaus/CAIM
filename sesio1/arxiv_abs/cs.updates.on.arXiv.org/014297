Fractured surfaces carry unique details that can provide an accurate quantitative comparison
to support comparative forensic analysis of those fractured surfaces. In this study, a statistical
analysis comparison protocol was applied to a set of 3D topological images of fractured surface
pairs and their replicas to provide confidence in the quantitative statistical comparison between
fractured items and their replicas. A set of 10 fractured stainless steel samples was fractured
from the same metal rod under controlled conditions and were cast using a standard forensic casting
technique. Six 3D topological maps with 50% overlap were acquired for each fractured pair. Spectral
analysis was utilized to identify the correlation between topological surface features at different
length scales of the surface topology. We selected two frequency bands over the critical wavelength
(which is greater than two-grain diameters) for statistical comparison. Our statistical model
utilized a matrix-variate-$t$ distribution that accounts for the image-overlap to model the match
and non-match population densities. A decision rule was developed to identify the probability
of matched and unmatched pairs of surfaces. The proposed methodology correctly classified the
fractured steel surfaces and their replicas with a posterior probability of match exceeding 99.96%.
Moreover, the replication technique shows the potential to accurately replicate fracture surface
topological details with a wavelength greater than 20$\mu$m, which far exceeds the range for comparison
of most metallic alloys of 50-200$\mu$m. The developed framework establishes the basis of forensic
comparison of fractured articles and their replicas while providing a reliable quantitative statistical
forensic comparison, utilizing fracture mechanics-based analysis of the fracture surface topology.

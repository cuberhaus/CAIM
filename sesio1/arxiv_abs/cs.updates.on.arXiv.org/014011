Recent studies have demonstrated improved skill in numerical weather prediction via the use of
spatially correlated observation error covariance information in data assimilation systems.
In this case, the observation weighting matrices (inverse error covariance matrices) used in the
assimilation may be full matrices rather than diagonal. Thus, the computation of matrix-vector
products in the variational minimization problem may be very time-consuming, particularly if
the parallel computation of the matrix-vector product requires a high degree of communication
between processing elements. Hence, we introduce a well-known numerical approximation method,
called the fast multipole method (FMM), to speed up the matrix-vector multiplications in data assimilation.
We explore a particular type of FMM that uses a singular value decomposition (SVD-FMM) and adjust
it to suit our new application in data assimilation. By approximating a large part of the computation
of the matrix-vector product, the SVD-FMM technique greatly reduces the computational complexity
compared with the standard approach. We develop a novel possible parallelization scheme of the
SVD-FMM for our application, which can reduce the communication costs. We investigate the accuracy
of the SVD-FMM technique in several numerical experiments: we first assess the accuracy using covariance
matrices that are created using different correlation functions and lengthscales; then investigate
the impact of reconditioning the covariance matrices on the accuracy; and finally examine the feasibility
of the technique in the presence of missing observations. We also provide theoretical explanations
for some numerical results. Our results show that the SVD-FMM technique has potential as an efficient
technique for assimilation of a large volume of observational data within a short time interval.

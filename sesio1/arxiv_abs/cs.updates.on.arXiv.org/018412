Incremental Structure from Motion (ISfM) has been widely used for UAV image orientation. Its efficiency,
however, decreases dramatically due to the sequential constraint. Although the divide-and-conquer
strategy has been utilized for efficiency improvement, cluster merging becomes difficult or depends
on seriously designed overlap structures. This paper proposes an algorithm to extract the global
model for cluster merging and designs a parallel SfM solution to achieve efficient and accurate
UAV image orientation. First, based on vocabulary tree retrieval, match pairs are selected to construct
an undirected weighted match graph, whose edge weights are calculated by considering both the number
and distribution of feature matches. Second, an algorithm, termed weighted connected dominating
set (WCDS), is designed to achieve the simplification of the match graph and build the global model,
which incorporates the edge weight in the graph node selection and enables the successful reconstruction
of the global model. Third, the match graph is simultaneously divided into compact and non-overlapped
clusters. After the parallel reconstruction, cluster merging is conducted with the aid of common
3D points between the global and cluster models. Finally, by using three UAV datasets that are captured
by classical oblique and recent optimized views photogrammetry, the validation of the proposed
solution is verified through comprehensive analysis and comparison. The experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed parallel SfM can achieve 17.4 times efficiency improvement and comparative
orientation accuracy. In absolute BA, the geo-referencing accuracy is approximately 2.0 and 3.0
times the GSD (Ground Sampling Distance) value in the horizontal and vertical directions, respectively.
For parallel SfM, the proposed solution is a more reliable alternative.

In low-income settings, the most critical piece of information for electric utilities is the anticipated
consumption of a customer. Electricity consumption assessment is difficult to do in settings where
a significant fraction of households do not yet have an electricity connection. In such settings
the absolute levels of anticipated consumption can range from 5-100 kWh/month, leading to high
variability amongst these customers. Precious resources are at stake if a significant fraction
of low consumers are connected over those with higher consumption. This is the first study of it's
kind in low-income settings that attempts to predict a building's consumption and not that of an
aggregate administrative area. We train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) over pre-electrification
daytime satellite imagery with a sample of utility bills from 20,000 geo-referenced electricity
customers in Kenya (0.01% of Kenya's residential customers). This is made possible with a two-stage
approach that uses a novel building segmentation approach to leverage much larger volumes of no-cost
satellite imagery to make the most of scarce and expensive customer data. Our method shows that competitive
accuracies can be achieved at the building level, addressing the challenge of consumption variability.
This work shows that the building's characteristics and it's surrounding context are both important
in predicting consumption levels. We also evaluate the addition of lower resolution geospatial
datasets into the training process, including nighttime lights and census-derived data. The results
are already helping inform site selection and distribution-level planning, through granular
predictions at the level of individual structures in Kenya and there is no reason this cannot be extended
to other countries.

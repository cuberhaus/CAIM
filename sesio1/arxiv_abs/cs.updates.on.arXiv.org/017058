Radiology reports are one of the main forms of communication between radiologists and other clinicians
and contain important information for patient care. In order to use this information for research
and automated patient care programs, it is necessary to convert the raw text into structured data
suitable for analysis. State-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) domain-specific
contextual word embeddings have been shown to achieve impressive accuracy for these tasks in medicine,
but have yet to be utilized for section structure segmentation. In this work, we pre-trained a contextual
embedding BERT model using breast radiology reports and developed a classifier that incorporated
the embedding with auxiliary global textual features in order to perform section segmentation.
This model achieved a 98% accuracy at segregating free text reports sentence by sentence into sections
of information outlined in the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) lexicon, a significant
improvement over the Classic BERT model without auxiliary information. We then evaluated whether
using section segmentation improved the downstream extraction of clinically relevant information
such as modality/procedure, previous cancer, menopausal status, the purpose of the exam, breast
density, and breast MRI background parenchymal enhancement. Using the BERT model pre-trained
on breast radiology reports combined with section segmentation resulted in an overall accuracy
of 95.9% in the field extraction tasks. This is a 17% improvement compared to an overall accuracy
of 78.9% for field extraction with models using Classic BERT embeddings and not using section segmentation.
Our work shows the strength of using BERT in radiology report analysis and the advantages of section
segmentation in identifying key features of patient factors recorded in breast radiology reports.

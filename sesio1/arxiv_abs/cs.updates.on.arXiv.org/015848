The modeling of optical wave propagation in optical fiber is a task of fast and accurate solving the
nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE), and can enable the research progress and system design
of optical fiber communications, which are the infrastructure of modern communication systems.
Traditional modeling of fiber channels using the split-step Fourier method (SSFM) has long been
regarded as challenging in long-haul wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) optical fiber communication
systems because it is extremely time-consuming. Here we propose a linear-nonlinear feature decoupling
distributed (FDD) waveform modeling scheme to model long-haul WDM fiber channel, where the channel
linear effects are modelled by the NLSE-derived model-driven methods and the nonlinear effects
are modelled by the data-driven deep learning methods. Meanwhile, the proposed scheme only focuses
on one-span fiber distance fitting, and then recursively transmits the model to achieve the required
transmission distance. The proposed modeling scheme is demonstrated to have high accuracy, high
computing speeds, and robust generalization abilities for different optical launch powers, modulation
formats, channel numbers and transmission distances. The total running time of FDD waveform modeling
scheme for 41-channel 1040-km fiber transmission is only 3 minutes versus more than 2 hours using
SSFM for each input condition, which achieves a 98% reduction in computing time. Considering the
multi-round optimization by adjusting system parameters, the complexity reduction is significant.
The results represent a remarkable improvement in nonlinear fiber modeling and open up novel perspectives
for solution of NLSE-like partial differential equations and optical fiber physics problems.

Recent breakthroughs in high resolution imaging of biomolecules in solution with cryo-electron
microscopy (cryo-EM) have unlocked new doors for the reconstruction of molecular volumes, thereby
promising further advances in biology, chemistry, and pharmacological research amongst others.
Despite significant headway, the immense challenges in cryo-EM data analysis remain legion and
intricately inter-disciplinary in nature, requiring insights from physicists, structural biologists,
computer scientists, statisticians, and applied mathematicians. Meanwhile, recent next-generation
volume reconstruction algorithms that combine generative modeling with end-to-end unsupervised
deep learning techniques have shown promising results on simulated data, but still face considerable
hurdles when applied to experimental cryo-EM images. In light of the proliferation of such methods
and given the interdisciplinary nature of the task, we propose here a critical review of recent advances
in the field of deep generative modeling for high resolution cryo-EM volume reconstruction. The
present review aims to (i) compare and contrast these new methods, while (ii) presenting them from
a perspective and using terminology familiar to scientists in each of the five aforementioned fields
with no specific background in cryo-EM. The review begins with an introduction to the mathematical
and computational challenges of deep generative models for cryo-EM volume reconstruction, along
with an overview of the baseline methodology shared across this class of algorithms. Having established
the common thread weaving through these different models, we provide a practical comparison of
these state-of-the-art algorithms, highlighting their relative strengths and weaknesses, along
with the assumptions that they rely on. This allows us to identify bottlenecks in current methods
and avenues for future research.

This paper presents how learning experience influences students' capability to learn and their
motivation for learning. Although each student is different, standard instruction methods do
not adapt to individuals. Adaptive learning reverses this practice and attempts to improve the
student experience. While adaptive learning is well-established in programming, it is rarely
used in cybersecurity education. This paper is one of the first works investigating adaptive learning
in security training. First, we analyze the performance of 95 students in 12 training sessions to
understand the limitations of the current training practice. Less than half of the students completed
the training without displaying a solution, and only in two sessions, all students completed all
phases. Then, we simulate how students would proceed in one of the past training sessions if it would
offer more paths of various difficulty. Based on this simulation, we propose a novel tutor model
for adaptive training, which considers students' proficiency before and during an ongoing training
session. The proficiency is assessed using a pre-training questionnaire and various in-training
metrics. Finally, we conduct a study with 24 students and new training using the proposed tutor model
and adaptive training format. The results show that the adaptive training does not overwhelm students
as the original static training. Adaptive training enables students to enter several alternative
training phases with lower difficulty than the original training. The proposed format is not restricted
to a particular training. Therefore, it can be applied to practicing any security topic or even in
related fields, such as networking or operating systems. Our study indicates that adaptive learning
is a promising approach for improving the student experience in security education. We also highlight
implications for educational practice.

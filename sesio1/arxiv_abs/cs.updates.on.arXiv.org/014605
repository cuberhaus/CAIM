Over the last decade, simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) has become
a practical and promising solution for connecting and recharging battery-limited devices, thanks
to significant advances in low-power electronics technology and wireless communications techniques.
To realize the promised potentials, advanced resource allocation design plays a decisive role
in revealing, understanding, and exploiting the intrinsic rate-energy tradeoff capitalizing
on the dual use of radio frequency (RF) signals for wireless charging and communication. In this
paper, we provide a comprehensive tutorial overview of SWIPT from the perspective of resource allocation
design. The fundamental concepts, system architectures, and RF energy harvesting (EH) models
are introduced. In particular, three commonly adopted EH models, namely the linear EH model, the
nonlinear saturation EH model, and the nonlinear circuit-based EH model are characterized and
discussed. Then, for a typical wireless system setup, we establish a generalized resource allocation
design framework which subsumes conventional resource allocation design problems as special
cases. Subsequently, we elaborate on relevant tools from optimization theory and exploit them
for solving representative resource allocation design problems for SWIPT systems with and without
perfect channel state information (CSI) available at the transmitter, respectively. The associated
technical challenges and insights are also highlighted. Furthermore, we discuss several promising
and exciting future research directions for resource allocation design for SWIPT systems intertwined
with cutting-edge communication technologies, such as intelligent reflecting surfaces, unmanned
aerial vehicles, mobile edge computing, federated learning, and machine learning.

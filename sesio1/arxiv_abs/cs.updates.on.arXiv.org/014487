Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of blindness in developed countries,
especially in people over 60 years of age. The workload of specialists and the healthcare system
in this field has increased in recent years mainly dues to three reasons: 1) increased use of retinal
optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging technique, 2) prevalence of population aging worldwide,
and 3) chronic nature of AMD. Recent developments in deep learning have provided a unique opportunity
for the development of fully automated diagnosis frameworks. Considering the presence of AMD-related
retinal pathologies in varying sizes in OCT images, our objective was to propose a multi-scale convolutional
neural network (CNN) capable of distinguishing pathologies using receptive fields with various
sizes. The multi-scale CNN was designed based on the feature pyramid network (FPN) structure and
was used to diagnose normal and two common clinical characteristics of dry and wet AMD, namely drusen
and choroidal neovascularization (CNV). The proposed method was evaluated on a national dataset
gathered at Noor Eye Hospital (NEH), consisting of 12649 retinal OCT images from 441 patients, and
a UCSD public dataset, consisting of 108312 OCT images. The results show that the multi-scale FPN-based
structure was able to improve the base model's overall accuracy by 0.4% to 3.3% for different backbone
models. In addition, gradual learning improved the performance in two phases from 87.2%+-2.5%
to 93.4%+-1.4% by pre-training the base model on ImageNet weights in the first phase and fine-tuning
the resulting model on a dataset of OCT images in the second phase. The promising quantitative and
qualitative results of the proposed architecture prove the suitability of the proposed method
to be used as a screening tool in healthcare centers assisting ophthalmologists in making better
diagnostic decisions.

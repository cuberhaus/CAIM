Computer assisted diagnosis in digital pathology is becoming ubiquitous as it can provide more
efficient and objective healthcare diagnostics. Recent advances have shown that the convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) architectures, a well-established deep learning paradigm, can be used to
design a Computer Aided Diagnostic (CAD) System for breast cancer detection. However, the challenges
due to stain variability and the effect of stain normalization with such deep learning frameworks
are yet to be well explored. Moreover, performance analysis with arguably more efficient network
models, which may be important for high throughput screening, is also not well explored.To address
this challenge, we consider some contemporary CNN models for binary classification of breast histopathology
images that involves (1) the data preprocessing with stain normalized images using an adaptive
colour deconvolution (ACD) based color normalization algorithm to handle the stain variabilities;
and (2) applying transfer learning based training of some arguably more efficient CNN models, namely
Visual Geometry Group Network (VGG16), MobileNet and EfficientNet. We have validated the trained
CNN networks on a publicly available BreaKHis dataset, for 200x and 400x magnified histopathology
images. The experimental analysis shows that pretrained networks in most cases yield better quality
results on data augmented breast histopathology images with stain normalization, than the case
without stain normalization. Further, we evaluated the performance and efficiency of popular
lightweight networks using stain normalized images and found that EfficientNet outperforms VGG16
and MobileNet in terms of test accuracy and F1 Score. We observed that efficiency in terms of test
time is better in EfficientNet than other networks; VGG Net, MobileNet, without much drop in the
classification accuracy.

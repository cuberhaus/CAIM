Mining processes of Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies are currently incentivized with voluntary
transaction fees and fixed block rewards which will halve gradually to zero. In the setting where
optional and arbitrary transaction fee becomes the remaining incentive, Carlsten et al.\ [CCS~2016]
find that an undercutting attack can become the equilibrium strategy for miners. In undercutting,
the attacker deliberately forks an existing chain by leaving wealthy transactions unclaimed to
attract petty complaint miners to its fork. We observe that two simplifying assumptions in [CCS~2016]
of fees arriving at fixed rates and miners collecting {\em all} accumulated fees regardless of block
size limit are often infeasible in practice and find that they are inaccurately inflating the profitability
of undercutting. Studying Bitcoin and Monero blockchain data, we find that the fees deliberately
left out by an undercutter may not be attractive to other miners (hence to the attacker itself): the
deliberately left out transactions may not fit into a new block without "squeezing out" some other
to-be transactions, and thus claimable fees in the next round cannot be raised arbitrarily. This
work views undercutting and shifting among chains rationally as mining strategies of rational
miners. We model profitability of undercutting strategy with block size limit present, which bounds
the claimable fees in a round and gives rise to a pending (cushion) transaction set. In the proposed
model, we first identify the conditions necessary to make undercutting profitable. We then present
an easy-to-deploy defense against undercutting by selectively assembling transactions into
the new block to invalidate the identified conditions. Under a typical setting with undercutters
present, applying this avoidance technique is a Nash Equilibrium. Finally, we complement the above
analytical results with experiments.

Aeroengine performance is determined by temperature and pressure profiles along various axial
stations within an engine. Given limited sensor measurements both along and between axial stations,
we require a statistically principled approach to inferring these profiles. In this paper we detail
a Bayesian methodology for interpolating the spatial temperature or pressure profile at axial
stations within an aeroengine. The profile at any given axial station is represented as a spatial
Gaussian random field on an annulus, with circumferential variations modelled using a Fourier
basis and radial variations modelled with a squared exponential kernel. This Gaussian random field
is extended to ingest data from multiple axial measurement planes, with the aim of transferring
information across the planes. To facilitate this type of transfer learning, a novel planar covariance
kernel is proposed, with hyperparameters that characterise the correlation between any two measurement
planes. In the scenario where precise frequencies comprising the temperature field are unknown,
we utilise a sparsity-promoting prior on the frequencies to encourage sparse representations.
This easily extends to cases with multiple engine planes whilst accommodating frequency variations
between the planes. The main quantity of interest, the spatial area average is readily obtained
in closed form. We term this the Bayesian area average and demonstrate how this metric offers far
more precise averages than a sector area average -- a widely used area averaging approach. Furthermore,
the Bayesian area average naturally decomposes the posterior uncertainty into terms characterising
insufficient sampling and sensor measurement error respectively. This too provides a significant
improvement over prior standard deviation based uncertainty breakdowns.

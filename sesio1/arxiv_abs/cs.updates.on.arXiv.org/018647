This paper investigates the problem of collecting multidimensional data throughout time (i.e.,
longitudinal studies) for the fundamental task of frequency estimation under Local Differential
Privacy (LDP) guarantees. Contrary to frequency estimation of a single attribute, the multidimensional
aspect demands particular attention to the privacy budget. Besides, when collecting user statistics
longitudinally, privacy progressively degrades. Indeed, the ``multiple" settings in combination
(i.e., many attributes and several collections throughout time) impose several challenges, for
which this paper proposes the first solution for frequency estimates under LDP. To tackle these
issues, we extend the analysis of three state-of-the-art LDP protocols (Generalized Randomized
Response -- GRR, Optimized Unary Encoding -- OUE, and Symmetric Unary Encoding -- SUE) for both longitudinal
and multidimensional data collections. While the known literature uses OUE and SUE for two rounds
of sanitization (a.k.a. memoization), i.e., L-OUE and L-SUE, respectively, we analytically and
experimentally show that starting with OUE and then with SUE provides higher data utility (i.e.,
L-OSUE). Also, for attributes with small domain sizes, we propose Longitudinal GRR (L-GRR), which
provides higher utility than the other protocols based on unary encoding. Last, we also propose
a new solution named Adaptive LDP for LOngitudinal and Multidimensional FREquency Estimates (ALLOMFREE),
which randomly samples a single attribute to be sent with the whole privacy budget and adaptively
selects the optimal protocol, i.e., either L-GRR or L-OSUE. As shown in the results, ALLOMFREE consistently
and considerably outperforms the state-of-the-art L-SUE and L-OUE protocols in the quality of
the frequency estimates.

Open Source Software (OSS) forms much of the fabric of our digital society, especially successful
and sustainable ones. But many OSS projects do not become sustainable, resulting in abandonment
and even risks for the world's digital infrastructure. Prior work has looked at the reasons for this
mainly from two very different perspectives. In software engineering, the focus has been on understanding
success and sustainability from the socio-technical perspective: the OSS programmers' day-to-day
activities and the artifacts they create. In institutional analysis, on the other hand, emphasis
has been on institutional designs (e.g., policies, rules, and norms) that structure governance.
Even though each is necessary for a comprehensive understanding of OSS projects, the connection
and interaction between the two approaches have been barely explored. In this paper, we make the
first effort toward understanding OSS project sustainability using a dual-view analysis, by combining
institutional analysis with socio-technical systems analysis. In particular, we (i) use linguistic
approaches to extract institutional rules and norms from OSS contributors' communications to
represent the evolution of their governance systems, and (ii) construct socio-technical networks
based on longitudinal collaboration records to represent each project's organizational structure.
We combined the two methods and applied them to a dataset of developer traces from 253 nascent OSS
projects within the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) incubator. We find that the socio-technical
and institutional features relate to each other, and provide complementary views into the progress
of the ASF's OSS projects. Refining these combined analyses can help provide a more precise understanding
of the synchronization between the evolution of institutional governance and organizational
structure.

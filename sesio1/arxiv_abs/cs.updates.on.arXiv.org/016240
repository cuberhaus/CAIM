As an important task for the management of bike sharing systems, accurate forecast of travel demand
could facilitate dispatch and relocation of bicycles to improve user satisfaction. In recent years,
many deep learning algorithms have been introduced to improve bicycle usage forecast. A typical
practice is to integrate convolutional (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) to capture spatial-temporal
dependency in historical travel demand. For typical CNN, the convolution operation is conducted
through a kernel that moves across a "matrix-format" city to extract features over spatially adjacent
urban areas. This practice assumes that areas close to each other could provide useful information
that improves prediction accuracy. However, bicycle usage in neighboring areas might not always
be similar, given spatial variations in built environment characteristics and travel behavior
that affect cycling activities. Yet, areas that are far apart can be relatively more similar in temporal
usage patterns. To utilize the hidden linkage among these distant urban areas, the study proposes
an irregular convolutional Long-Short Term Memory model (IrConv+LSTM) to improve short-term
bike sharing demand forecast. The model modifies traditional CNN with irregular convolutional
architecture to extract dependency among "semantic neighbors". The proposed model is evaluated
with a set of benchmark models in five study sites, which include one dockless bike sharing system
in Singapore, and four station-based systems in Chicago, Washington, D.C., New York, and London.
We find that IrConv+LSTM outperforms other benchmark models in the five cities. The model also achieves
superior performance in areas with varying levels of bicycle usage and during peak periods. The
findings suggest that "thinking beyond spatial neighbors" can further improve short-term travel
demand prediction of urban bike sharing systems.

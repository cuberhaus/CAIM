We study incentive designs for a class of stochastic Stackelberg games with one leader and a large
number of (finite as well as infinite population of) followers. We investigate whether the leader
can craft a strategy under a dynamic information structure that induces a desired behavior among
the followers. For the finite population setting, under sufficient conditions, we show that there
exist symmetric incentive strategies for the leader that attain approximately optimal performance
from the leader's viewpoint and lead to an approximate symmetric (pure) Nash best response among
the followers. Driving the follower population to infinity, we arrive at the interesting result
that in this infinite-population regime the leader cannot design a smooth "finite-energy" incentive
strategy, namely, a mean-field limit for such games is not well-defined. As a way around this, we
introduce a class of stochastic Stackelberg games with a leader, a major follower, and a finite or
infinite population of minor followers, where the leader provides an incentive only for the major
follower, who in turn influences the rest of the followers through her strategy. For this class of
problems, we are able to establish the existence of an incentive strategy with finitely many minor
followers. We also show that if the leader's strategy with finitely many minor followers converges
as their population size grows, then the limit defines an incentive strategy for the corresponding
mean-field Stackelberg game. Examples of quadratic Gaussian games are provided to illustrate
both positive and negative results. In addition, as a byproduct of our analysis, we establish existence
of a randomized incentive strategy for the class mean-field Stackelberg games, which in turn provides
an approximation for an incentive strategy of the corresponding finite population Stackelberg
game.

We propose a novel constraint-handling technique for the covariance matrix adaptation evolution
strategy (CMA-ES). The proposed technique is aimed at solving explicitly constrained black-box
continuous optimization problems, in which the explicit constraint is a constraint whereby the
computational time for the constraint violation and its (numerical) gradient are negligible compared
to that for the objective function. This method is designed to realize two invariance properties:
invariance to the affine transformation of the search space, and invariance to the increasing transformation
of the objective and constraint functions. The CMA-ES is designed to possess these properties for
handling difficulties that appear in black-box optimization problems, such as non-separability,
ill-conditioning, ruggedness, and the different orders of magnitude in the objective. The proposed
constraint-handling technique (CHT), known as ARCH, modifies the underlying CMA-ES only in terms
of the ranking of the candidate solutions. It employs a repair operator and an adaptive ranking aggregation
strategy to compute the ranking. We developed test problems to evaluate the effects of the invariance
properties, and performed experiments to empirically verify the invariance of the algorithm.
We compared the proposed method with other CHTs on the CEC 2006 constrained optimization benchmark
suite to demonstrate its efficacy. Empirical studies reveal that ARCH is able to exploit the explicitness
of the constraint functions effectively, sometimes even more efficiently than an existing box-constraint
handling technique on box-constrained problems, while exhibiting the invariance properties.
Moreover, ARCH overwhelmingly outperforms CHTs by not exploiting the explicit constraints in
terms of the number of objective function calls.

Using tools from stochastic geometry, this paper develops a tractable framework to analyze the
performance of a mobile user in a two-tier wireless network operating on sub-6GHz and terahertz
(THz) transmission frequencies. Specifically, using an equivalence distance approach, we characterize
the overall handoff (HO) probability in terms of the horizontal and vertical HO and mobility-aware
coverage probability. In addition, we characterize novel coverage probability expressions for
THz network in the presence of molecular absorption noise and highlight its significant impact
on the users' performance. Specifically, we derive a novel closed-form expression for the Laplace
Transform of the cumulative molecular noise and interference observed by a mobile user in a hybrid
RF-THz network. Furthermore, we provide a novel approximation to derive the conditional distance
distributions of a typical user in a hybrid RF-THz network. Finally, using the overall HO probability
and coverage probability expressions, the mobility-aware probability of coverage has been derived
in a hybrid RF-THz network. Our mathematical results validate the correctness of the derived expressions
using Monte-Carlo simulations. The results offer insights into the adverse impact of users' mobility
and molecular noise in THz transmissions on the probability of coverage of mobile users. Our results
demonstrate that a small increase in the intensity of terahertz base-stations (TBSs) (about 5 times)
can increase the HO probability much more compared to the case when the intensity of RF BSs (RBSs)
is increased by 100 times. Furthermore, we note that high molecular absorption can be beneficial
(in terms of minimizing interference and molecular noise) for specific deployment intensity of
TBSs and the benefits can outweigh the drawbacks of signal degradation due to molecular absorption.

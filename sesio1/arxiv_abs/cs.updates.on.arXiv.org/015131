This study presents a comprehensive spatial eigenanalysis of fully-discrete discontinuous spectral
element methods, now generalizing previous spatial eigenanalysis that did not include time integration
errors. The influence of discrete time integration is discussed in detail for different explicit
Runge-Kutta (1st to 4th order accurate) schemes combined with either Discontinuous Galerkin (DG)
or Spectral Difference (SD) methods, both here recovered from the Flux Reconstruction (FR) scheme.
Selected numerical experiments using the improved SD method by Liang and Jameson [1] are performed
to quantify the influence of time integration errors on actual simulations. These involve test
cases of varied complexity, from one-dimensional linear advection equation studies to well-resolved
and under-resolved inviscid vortical flows. It is shown that, while both well-resolved and under-resolved
simulations of linear problems correlate well with the eigenanalysis prediction of time integration
errors, the correlation can be much worse for under-resolved nonlinear problems. The effect of
mesh regularity is also considered, where time integration errors are found to be, in the case of
irregular grids, less pronounced than those of the spatial discretisation. In fact, for the under-resolved
vortical flows considered, the predominance of spatial errors made it practically impossible
for time integration errors to be distinctly identified. Nevertheless, for well-resolved nonlinear
simulations, the effect of time integration errors could still be recognized. This highlights
that the interaction between space and time discretisation errors is more complex than otherwise
anticipated, contributing to the current understanding about when eigenanalysis can effectively
predict the behaviour of numerical errors in practical under-resolved nonlinear problems, including
under-resolved turbulence computations.

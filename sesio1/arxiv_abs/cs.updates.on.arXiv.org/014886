Fairness is a critical system-level objective in recommender systems that has been the subject
of extensive recent research. It is especially important in multi-sided recommendation platforms
where it may be crucial to optimize utilities not just for the end user, but also for other actors such
as item sellers or producers who desire a fair representation of their items. Existing solutions
do not properly address various aspects of multi-sided fairness in recommendations as they may
either solely have one-sided view (i.e. improving the fairness only for one side), or do not appropriately
measure the fairness for each actor involved in the system. In this thesis, I aim at first investigating
the impact of unfair recommendations on the system and how these unfair recommendations can negatively
affect major actors in the system. Then, I seek to propose solutions to tackle the unfairness of recommendations.
I propose a rating transformation technique that works as a pre-processing step before building
the recommendation model to alleviate the inherent popularity bias in the input data and consequently
to mitigate the exposure unfairness for items and suppliers in the recommendation lists. Also,
as another solution, I propose a general graph-based solution that works as a post-processing approach
after recommendation generation for mitigating the multi-sided exposure bias in the recommendation
results. For evaluation, I introduce several metrics for measuring the exposure fairness for items
and suppliers, and show that these metrics better capture the fairness properties in the recommendation
results. I perform extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions.
The experiments on different publicly-available datasets and comparison with various baselines
confirm the superiority of the proposed solutions in improving the exposure fairness for items
and suppliers.

Background: Risk prediction models are useful tools in clinical decision-making which help with
risk stratification and resource allocations and may lead to a better health care for patients.
AutoScore is a machine learning-based automatic clinical score generator for binary outcomes.
This study aims to expand the AutoScore framework to provide a tool for interpretable risk prediction
for ordinal outcomes. Methods: The AutoScore-Ordinal framework is generated using the same 6 modules
of the original AutoScore algorithm including variable ranking, variable transformation, score
derivation (from proportional odds models), model selection, score fine-tuning, and model evaluation.
To illustrate the AutoScore-Ordinal performance, the method was conducted on electronic health
records data from the emergency department at Singapore General Hospital over 2008 to 2017. The
model was trained on 70% of the data, validated on 10% and tested on the remaining 20%. Results: This
study included 445,989 inpatient cases, where the distribution of the ordinal outcome was 80.7%
alive without 30-day readmission, 12.5% alive with 30-day readmission, and 6.8% died inpatient
or by day 30 post discharge. Two point-based risk prediction models were developed using two sets
of 8 predictor variables identified by the flexible variable selection procedure. The two models
indicated reasonably good performance measured by mean area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (0.785 and 0.793) and generalized c-index (0.737 and 0.760), which were comparable to alternative
models. Conclusion: AutoScore-Ordinal provides an automated and easy-to-use framework for development
and validation of risk prediction models for ordinal outcomes, which can systematically identify
potential predictors from high-dimensional data.

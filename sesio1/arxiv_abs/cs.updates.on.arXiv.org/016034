Transit Timing Variations (TTVs) can provide useful information for systems observed by transit,
by putting constraints on the masses and eccentricities of the observed planets, or even constrain
the existence of non-transiting companions. However, TTVs can also prevent the detection of small
planets in transit surveys, or bias the recovered planetary and transit parameters. Here we show
that Kepler-1972 c, initially the "not transit-like" false positive KOI-3184.02, is an Earth-sized
planet whose orbit is perturbed by Kepler-1972 b (initially KOI-3184.01). The pair is locked in
a 3:2 Mean-motion resonance, each planet displaying TTVs of more than 6h hours of amplitude over
the duration of the Kepler mission. The two planets have similar masses $m_b/m_c =0.956_{-0.051}^{+0.056}$
and radii $R_b=0.802_{-0.041}^{+0.042}R_{Earth}$, $R_c=0.868_{-0.050}^{+0.051}R_{Earth}$,
and the whole system, including the inner candidate KOI-3184.03, appear to be coplanar. Despite
the faintness of the signals (SNR of 1.35 for each transit of Kepler-1972 b and 1.10 for Kepler-1972
c), we recovered the transits of the planets using the RIVERS method, based on the recognition of
the tracks of planets in river diagrams using machine learning, and a photo-dynamic fit of the lightcurve.
Recovering the correct ephemerides of the planets is essential to have a complete picture of the
observed planetary systems. In particular, we show that in Kepler-1972, not taking into account
planet-planet interactions yields an error of $\sim 30\%$ on the radii of planets b and c, in addition
to generating in-transit scatter, which leads to mistake KOI3184.02 for a false positive. Alleviating
this bias is essential for an unbiased view of Kepler systems, some of the TESS stars, and the upcoming
PLATO mission.

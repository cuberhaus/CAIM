Gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the world. At the same time, it is also the fourth
most deadly cancer. Early detection of cancer exists as a guide for the treatment of gastric cancer.
Nowadays, computer technology has advanced rapidly to assist physicians in the diagnosis of pathological
pictures of gastric cancer. Ensemble learning is a way to improve the accuracy of algorithms, and
finding multiple learning models with complementarity types is the basis of ensemble learning.
The complementarity of sub-size pathology image classifiers when machine performance is insufficient
is explored in this experimental platform. We choose seven classical machine learning classifiers
and four deep learning classifiers for classification experiments on the GasHisSDB database.
Among them, classical machine learning algorithms extract five different image virtual features
to match multiple classifier algorithms. For deep learning, we choose three convolutional neural
network classifiers. In addition, we also choose a novel Transformer-based classifier. The experimental
platform, in which a large number of classical machine learning and deep learning methods are performed,
demonstrates that there are differences in the performance of different classifiers on GasHisSDB.
Classical machine learning models exist for classifiers that classify Abnormal categories very
well, while classifiers that excel in classifying Normal categories also exist. Deep learning
models also exist with multiple models that can be complementarity. Suitable classifiers are selected
for ensemble learning, when machine performance is insufficient. This experimental platform
demonstrates that multiple classifiers are indeed complementarity and can improve the efficiency
of ensemble learning. This can better assist doctors in diagnosis, improve the detection of gastric
cancer, and increase the cure rate.

Aiming at ontology-based data access to temporal data, we design two-dimensional temporal ontology
and query languages by combining logics from the (extended) DL-Lite family with linear temporal
logic LTL over discrete time (Z,<). Our main concern is first-order rewritability of ontology-mediated
queries (OMQs) that consist of a 2D ontology and a positive temporal instance query. Our target languages
for FO-rewritings are two-sorted FO(<) - first-order logic with sorts for time instants ordered
by the built-in precedence relation < and for the domain of individuals - its extension FOE with the
standard congruence predicates t \equiv 0 mod n, for any fixed n > 1, and FO(RPR) that admits relational
primitive recursion. In terms of circuit complexity, FOE- and FO(RPR)-rewritability guarantee
answering OMQs in uniform AC0 and NC1, respectively. We proceed in three steps. First, we define
a hierarchy of 2D DL-Lite/LTL ontology languages and investigate the FO-rewritability of OMQs
with atomic queries by constructing projections onto 1D LTL OMQs and employing recent results on
the FO-rewritability of propositional LTL OMQs. As the projections involve deciding consistency
of ontologies and data, we also consider the consistency problem for our languages. While the undecidability
of consistency for 2D ontology languages with expressive Boolean role inclusions might be expected,
we also show that, rather surprisingly, the restriction to Krom and Horn role inclusions leads to
decidability (and ExpSpace-completeness), even if one admits full Booleans on concepts. As a final
step, we lift some of the rewritability results for atomic OMQs to OMQs with expressive positive
temporal instance queries. The lifting results are based on an in-depth study of the canonical models
and only concern Horn ontologies.

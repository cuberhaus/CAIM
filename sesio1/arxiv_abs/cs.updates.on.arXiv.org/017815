Nowadays, 3D data plays an indelible role in the computer vision field. However, extensive studies
have proved that deep neural networks (DNNs) fed with 3D data, such as point clouds, are susceptible
to adversarial examples, which aim to misguide DNNs and might bring immeasurable losses. Currently,
3D adversarial point clouds are chiefly generated in three fashions, i.e., point shifting, point
adding, and point dropping. These point manipulations would modify geometrical properties and
local correlations of benign point clouds more or less. Motivated by this basic fact, we propose
to defend such adversarial examples with the aid of 3D steganalysis techniques. Specifically,
we first introduce an adversarial attack and defense model adapted from the celebrated Prisoners'
Problem in steganography to help us comprehend 3D adversarial attack and defense more generally.
Then we rethink two significant but vague concepts in the field of adversarial example, namely,
active defense and passive defense, from the perspective of steganalysis. Most importantly, we
design a 3D adversarial point cloud detector through the lens of 3D steganalysis. Our detector is
double-blind, that is to say, it does not rely on the exact knowledge of the adversarial attack means
and victim models. To enable the detector to effectively detect malicious point clouds, we craft
a 64-D discriminant feature set, including features related to first-order and second-order local
descriptions of point clouds. To our knowledge, this work is the first to apply 3D steganalysis to
3D adversarial example defense. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
3D adversarial point cloud detector can achieve good detection performance on multiple types of
3D adversarial point clouds.

Demand response involves system operators using incentives to modulate electricity consumption
during peak hours or when faced with an incidental supply shortage. However, system operators typically
have imperfect information about their customers' baselines, that is, their consumption had the
incentive been absent. The standard approach to estimate the reduction in a customer's electricity
consumption then is to estimate their counterfactual baseline. However, this approach is not robust
to estimation errors or strategic exploitation by the customers and can potentially lead to overpayments
to customers who do not reduce their consumption and underpayments to those who do. Moreover, optimal
power consumption reductions of the customers depend on the costs that they incur for curtailing
consumption, which in general are private knowledge of the customers, and which they could strategically
misreport in an effort to improve their own utilities even if it deteriorates the overall system
cost. The two-stage mechanism proposed in this paper circumvents the aforementioned issues. In
the day-ahead market, the participating loads are required to submit only a probabilistic description
of their next-day consumption and costs to the system operator for day-ahead planning. It is only
in real-time, if and when called upon for demand response, that the loads are required to report their
baselines and costs. They receive credits for reductions below their reported baselines. The mechanism
for calculating the credits guarantees incentive compatibility of truthful reporting of the probability
distribution in the day-ahead market and truthful reporting of the baseline and cost in real-time.
The mechanism can be viewed as an extension of the celebrated Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism
augmented with a carefully crafted second-stage penalty for deviations from the day-ahead bids.

In the last years there has been a growing attention towards predicting the political orientation
of active social media users, being this of great help to study political forecasts, opinion dynamics
modeling and users polarization. Existing approaches, mainly targeting Twitter users, rely on
content-based analysis or are based on a mixture of content, network and communication analysis.
The recent research perspective exploits the fact that a user's political affinity mainly depends
on his/her positions on major political and social issues, thus shifting the focus on detecting
the stance of users through user-generated content shared on social networks. The work herein described
focuses on a completely unsupervised stance detection framework that predicts the user's stance
about specific social-political statements by exploiting content-based analysis of its Twitter
timeline. The ground-truth user's stance may come from Voting Advice Applications, online tools
that help citizens to identify their political leanings by comparing their political preferences
with party political stances. Starting from the knowledge of the agreement level of six parties
on 20 different statements, the objective of the study is to predict the stance of a Party p in regard
to each statement s exploiting what the Twitter Party account wrote on Twitter. To this end we propose
Tweets2Stance (T2S), a novel and totally unsupervised stance detector framework which relies
on the zero-shot learning technique to quickly and accurately operate on non-labeled data. Interestingly,
T2S can be applied to any social media user for any context of interest, not limited to the political
one. Results obtained from multiple experiments show that, although the general maximum F1 value
is 0.4, T2S can correctly predict the stance with a general minimum MAE of 1.13, which is a great achievement
considering the task complexity.

Public clouds are one of the most thriving technologies of the past decade. Major applications over
public clouds require world-wide distribution and large amounts of data exchange between their
distributed servers. To that end, major cloud providers have invested tens of billions of dollars
in building world-wide inter-region networking infrastructure that can support high performance
communication into, out of, and across public cloud geographic regions. In this paper, we lay the
foundation for a comprehensive study and real time monitoring of various characteristic of networking
within and between public clouds. We start by presenting CloudCast, a world-wide and expandable
measurements and analysis system, currently (January 2019)collecting data from three major public
clouds (AWS, GCPand Azure), 59 regions, 1184 intra-cloud and 2238 cross-cloud links (each link
represents a direct connection between a pair of regions), amounting to a total of 3422 continuously
monitored links and providing active measurements every minute.CloudCast is composed of measurement
agents automatically installed in each public cloud region, centralized control, measurement
data base, analysis engine and visualization tools. Then we turn to analyze the latency measurement
data collected over almost a year . Our analysis yields surprising results. First, each public cloud
exhibits a unique set of link latency behaviors along time. Second, using a novel, fair evaluation
methodology, termed similar links, we compare the three clouds. Third, we prove that more than 50%
of all links do not provide the optimal RTT through the methodology of triangles. Triangles also
provide a framework to get around bottlenecks, benefiting not only the majority (53%-70%) of the
cross-cloud links by 30% to 70%, but also a significant portion (29%-45%) of intra-cloud links by
14%-33%.

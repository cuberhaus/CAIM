Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) can effectively control the wavefront of the impinging
signals and has emerged as a cost-effective promising solution to improve the spectrum and energy
efficiency of wireless systems. Most existing researches on RIS assume that the hardware operations
are perfect. However, both physical transceiver and RIS suffer from inevitable hardware impairments
in practice, which can lead to severe system performance degradation and increase the complexity
of beamforming optimization. Consequently, the existing researches on RIS, including channel
estimation, beamforming optimization, spectrum and energy efficiency analysis, etc., cannot
directly apply to the case of hardware impairments. In this paper, by taking hardware impairments
into consideration, we conduct the joint transmit and reflect beamforming optimization, and reevaluate
the system performance. First, we characterize the closed-form estimators of direct and cascaded
channels in both single-user and multi-user cases, and analyze the impact of hardware impairments
on channel estimation accuracy. Then, the optimal transmit beamforming solution is derived, and
a gradient descent method-based algorithm is also proposed to optimize the reflect beamforming.
Moreover, we analyze the three types of asymptotic channel capacities with respect to the transmit
power, the antenna number, and the reflecting element number. Finally, in terms of the system energy
consumption, we analyze the power scaling law and the energy efficiency. Our experimental results
also reveal an encouraging phenomenon that the RIS-assisted wireless system with massive reflecting
elements can achieve both high spectrum and energy efficiency without the need for massive antennas
and without allocating too many resources to optimize the reflect beamforming.

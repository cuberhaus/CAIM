Objective: Ubiquitous internet access is reshaping the way we live, but it is accompanied by unprecedented
challenges in preventing chronic diseases that are usually planted by long exposure to unhealthy
lifestyles. This paper proposes leveraging online shopping behaviors as a proxy for personal lifestyle
choices to improve chronic disease prevention literacy, targeted for times when e-commerce user
experience has been assimilated into most people's everyday lives. Methods: Longitudinal query
logs and purchase records from 15 million online shoppers were accessed, constructing a broad spectrum
of lifestyle features covering assorted product categories and buyer personas. Using the lifestyle-related
information preceding their first purchases of specific prescription drugs, we could determine
associations between online shoppers' past lifestyle choices and whether they suffered from a
particular chronic disease or not. Results: Novel lifestyle risk factors were discovered in two
exemplars -- depression and diabetes, most of which showed cognitive congruence with existing
healthcare knowledge. Further, such empirical findings could be adopted to locate online shoppers
at high risk of these chronic diseases with decent accuracy (i.e., [area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve] AUC=0.68 for depression and AUC=0.70 for diabetes), closely matching the
performance of screening surveys benchmarked against medical diagnosis. Conclusions: Mining
online shopping behaviors can point medical experts to a series of lifestyle issues associated
with chronic diseases that are less explored to date. Hopefully, unobtrusive chronic disease surveillance
via e-commerce sites can grant consenting individuals a privilege to be connected more readily
with the medical profession and sophistication.

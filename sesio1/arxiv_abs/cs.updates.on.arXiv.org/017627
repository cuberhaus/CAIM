Problem: There is a lack of big data for the training of deep learning models in medicine, characterized
by the time cost of data collection and privacy concerns. Generative adversarial networks (GANs)
offer both the potential to generate new data, as well as to use this newly generated data, without
inclusion of patients' real data, for downstream applications. Approach: A series of GANs were
trained and applied for a downstream computer vision spine radiograph abnormality classification
task. Separate classifiers were trained with either access or no access to the original imaging.
Trained GANs included a conditional StyleGAN2 with adaptive discriminator augmentation, a conditional
StyleGAN2 with adaptive discriminator augmentation to generate spine radiographs conditional
on lesion type, and using a novel clinical loss term for the generator a StyleGAN2 with adaptive discriminator
augmentation conditional on abnormality (SpineGAN). Finally, a differential privacy imposed
StyleGAN2 with adaptive discriminator augmentation conditional on abnormality was trained and
an ablation study was performed on its differential privacy impositions. Key Results: We accomplish
GAN generation of synthetic spine radiographs without meaningful input for the first time from
a literature review. We further demonstrate the success of synthetic learning for the spine domain
with a downstream clinical classification task (AUC of 0.830 using synthetic data compared to AUC
of 0.886 using the real data). Importantly, the introduction of a new clinical loss term for the generator
was found to increase generation recall as well as accelerate model training. Lastly, we demonstrate
that, in a limited size medical dataset, differential privacy impositions severely impede GAN
training, finding that this is specifically due to the requirement for gradient perturbation with
noise.

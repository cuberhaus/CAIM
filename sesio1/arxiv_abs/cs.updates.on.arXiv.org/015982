Traditional media coding schemes typically encode image/video into a semantic-unknown binary
stream, which fails to directly support downstream intelligent tasks at the bitstream level. Semantically
Structured Image Coding (SSIC) framework makes the first attempt to enable decoding-free or partial-decoding
image intelligent task analysis via a Semantically Structured Bitstream (SSB). However, the SSIC
only considers image coding and its generated SSB only contains the static object information.
In this paper, we extend the idea of semantically structured coding from video coding perspective
and propose an advanced Semantically Structured Video Coding (SSVC) framework to support heterogeneous
intelligent applications. Video signals contain more rich dynamic motion information and exist
more redundancy due to the similarity between adjacent frames. Thus, we present a reformulation
of semantically structured bitstream (SSB) in SSVC which contains both static object characteristics
and dynamic motion clues. Specifically, we introduce optical flow to encode continuous motion
information and reduce cross-frame redundancy via a predictive coding architecture, then the
optical flow and residual information are reorganized into SSB, which enables the proposed SSVC
could better adaptively support video-based downstream intelligent applications. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed SSVC framework could directly support multiple intelligent
tasks just depending on a partially decoded bitstream. This avoids the full bitstream decompression
and thus significantly saves bitrate/bandwidth consumption for intelligent analytics. We verify
this point on the tasks of image object detection, pose estimation, video action recognition, video
object segmentation, etc.

Human-machine interfaces (HMI) play a pivotal role in the rehabilitation and daily assistance
of lower-limb amputees. The brain of such interfaces is a control model that detects the user's intention
using sensor input and generates corresponding output (control commands). With recent advances
in technology, AI-based policies have gained attention as control models for HMIs. However, supervised
learning techniques require affluent amounts of labeled training data from the user, which is challenging
in the context of lower-limb rehabilitation. Moreover, a static pre-trained model does not take
the temporal variations in the motion of the amputee (e.g., due to speed, terrain) into account.
In this study, we aimed to address both of these issues by creating an incremental training approach
for a torque prediction model using incomplete user-specific training data and biologically inspired
temporal patterns of human gait. To reach this goal, we created a hybrid of two distinct approaches,
a generic inter-individual and an adapting individual-specific model that exploits the inter-limb
synergistic coupling during human gait to learn a function that predicts the torque at the ankle
joint continuously based on the kinematic sequences of the hip, knee, and shank. An inter-individual
generic base model learns temporal patterns of gait from a set of able-bodied individuals and predicts
the gait patterns for a new individual, while the individual-specific adaptation model learns
and predicts the temporal patterns of gait specific to a particular individual. The iterative training
using the hybrid model was validated on eight able-bodied and five transtibial amputee subjects.
It was found that, with the addition of estimators fitted to individual-specific data, the accuracy
significantly increased from the baseline inter-individual model and plateaued within two to
three iterations.

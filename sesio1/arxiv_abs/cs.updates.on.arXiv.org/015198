Extra-label drug use in food animal medicine is authorized by the US Animal Medicinal Drug Use Clarification
Act (AMDUCA), and estimated withdrawal intervals are based on published scientific pharmacokinetic
data. Occasionally there is a paucity of scientific data on which to base a withdrawal interval or
a large number of animals being treated, driving the need to test for drug residues. Rapid assay commercial
farm-side tests are essential for monitoring drug residues in animal products to protect human
health. Active ingredients, sensitivity, matrices, and species that have been evaluated for commercial
rapid assay tests are typically reported on manufacturers' websites or in PDF documents that are
available to consumers but may require a special access request. Additionally, this information
is not always correlated with FDA-approved tolerances. Furthermore, parameter changes for these
tests can be very challenging to regularly identify, especially those listed on websites or in documents
that are not publicly available. Therefore, artificial intelligence plays a critical role in efficiently
extracting the data and ensure current information. Extracting tables from PDF and HTML documents
has been investigated both by academia and commercial tool builders. Research in text mining of
such documents has become a widespread yet challenging arena in implementing natural language
programming. However, techniques of extracting tables are still in their infancy and being investigated
and improved by researchers. In this study, we developed and evaluated a data-mining method for
automatically extracting rapid assay data from electronic documents. Our automatic electronic
data extraction method includes a software package module, a developed pattern recognition tool,
and a data mining engine. Assay details were provided by several commercial entities that produce

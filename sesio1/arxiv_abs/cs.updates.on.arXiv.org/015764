Compared with the traditional collaborative filtering methods, the graph convolution network
can explicitly model the interaction between the nodes of the user-item bipartite graph and effectively
use higher-order neighbors, which enables the graph neural network to obtain more effective embeddings
for recommendation, such as NGCF And LightGCN. However, its representations is very susceptible
to the noise of interaction. In response to this problem, SGL explored the self-supervised learning
on the user-item graph to improve the robustness of GCN. Although effective, we found that SGL directly
applies SimCLR's comparative learning framework. This framework may not be directly applicable
to the scenario of the recommendation system, and does not fully consider the uncertainty of user-item
interaction.In this work, we aim to consider the application of contrastive learning in the scenario
of the recommendation system adequately, making it more suitable for recommendation task. We propose
a supervised contrastive learning framework to pre-train the user-item bipartite graph, and then
fine-tune the graph convolutional neural network. Specifically, we will compare the similarity
between users and items during data preprocessing, and then when applying contrastive learning,
not only will the augmented views be regarded as the positive samples, but also a certain number of
similar samples will be regarded as the positive samples, which is different from SimCLR who treats
other samples in a batch as negative samples. We term this learning method as Supervised Contrastive
Learning(SCL) and apply it on the most advanced LightGCN. In addition, in order to consider the uncertainty
of node interaction, we also propose a new data augment method called node replication.

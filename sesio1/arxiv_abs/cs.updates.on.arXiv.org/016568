Discovery program (DISC) is an affirmative action policy used by the New York City Department of
Education (NYC DOE). It has been instrumental in increasing the number of admissions for disadvantaged
students at specialized high schools. However, our empirical analysis of the student-school matches
shows that about 950 in-group blocking pairs were created each year amongst the disadvantaged group
of students, impacting about 650 disadvantaged students. Moreover, we find that this program usually
benefits lower-performing disadvantaged students more than the top-performing ones, thus unintentionally
creating an incentive to under-perform. In this work, we explore two affirmative action policies
that can be used to minimally modify and improve the discovery program: minority reserve (MR) and
joint-seat allocation (JSA). We show that (i) both MR and JSA result in no in-group blocking pairs,
and (ii) JSA is weakly group strategy-proof, ensures that at least one disadvantaged is not worse
off, and when reservation quotas are carefully chosen then no disadvantaged student is worse-off.
In the general setting, we show that there is no clear winner in terms of the matchings provided by
DISC, JSA and MR, from the perspective of disadvantaged students. We however characterize a condition
for markets, that we term high competitiveness, where JSA dominates MR for disadvantaged students.
This condition is verified in markets when there is a higher demand for seats than supply, and the
performances of disadvantaged students are significantly lower than that of advantaged students.
Data from NYC DOE satisfy the high competitiveness condition, and for this dataset our empirical
results corroborate our theoretical predictions, showing the superiority of JSA. We believe that
the discovery program, and more generally affirmative action mechanisms, can be changed for the
better by implementing JSA.

Background: Vaccination programs are effective only when a significant percentage of people are
vaccinated. However, vaccine acceptance varies among communities around the world. Social media
usage is arguably one of the factors affecting public attitudes towards vaccines. Objective: This
study aims to identify if the social media usages factors can be used to predict attitudes and behavior
towards the COVID-19 vaccines among the people in the Arab world. Methods: An online survey was conducted
in the Arab countries and 217 Arab people participated in this study. Logistic regression was applied
to identify what demographics and social media usage factors predict public attitudes and behavior
towards the COVID-19 vaccines. Results: Of the 217 participants, 56.22% of them were willing to
accept the vaccine and 41.47% of them were hesitant. This study shows that none of the social media
usages factors were significant enough to predict the actual vaccine acceptance behavior. Whereas
the analysis showed few of the social media usage factors can predict public attitudes towards the
COVID-19 vaccines. For example, frequent social media users were 2.85 times more likely to agree
that the risk of COVID-19 is being exaggerated (OR=2.85, 95% CI=0.86-9.45, p=0.046) than infrequent
social media users. Whereas participants having more trust in vaccine information shared by their
contacts are less likely to agree that decision-makers have verified that vaccines are safe (OR=0.528,
95% CI= 0.276-1.012, p=0.05). Conclusion: The use of social media and information shared on it may
affect public attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines. Therefore, disseminating correct and validated
information about COVID-19 and other vaccines on social media is important for increasing public
trust and countering the impact of incorrect and misinformation.

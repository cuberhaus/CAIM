A key challenge in inventory management is to identify policies that optimally replenish inventory
from multiple suppliers. To solve such optimization problems, inventory managers need to decide
what quantities to order from each supplier, given the on-hand inventory and outstanding orders,
so that the expected backlogging, holding, and sourcing costs are jointly minimized. Inventory
management problems have been studied extensively for over 60 years, and yet even basic dual sourcing
problems, in which orders from an expensive supplier arrive faster than orders from a regular supplier,
remain intractable in their general form. In addition, there is an emerging need to develop proactive,
scalable optimization algorithms that can adjust their recommendations to dynamic demand shifts
in a timely fashion. In this work, we approach dual sourcing from a neural-network-based optimization
lens and incorporate inventory dynamics into the design of deep neural networks. We show that the
proposed inventory-dynamics-informed neural networks (IDINNs) are able to learn near-optimal
policies of commonly used instances within a few minutes of CPU time on a regular personal computer.
To demonstrate the versatility of IDINNs, we also show that they can control inventory dynamics
with empirical, non-stationary demand distributions that are challenging to tackle effectively
using alternative, state-of-the-art approaches.Our work shows that high-quality solutions
of complex inventory management problems with non-stationary demand can be obtained with deep
neural-network optimization approaches that directly account for inventory dynamics in their
optimization process. As such, our research opens up new ways of efficiently managing complex,
high-dimensional inventory dynamics.

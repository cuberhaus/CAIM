The classical (parallel) black pebbling game is a useful abstraction which allows us to analyze
the resources (space, space-time, cumulative space) necessary to evaluate a function $f$ with
a static data-dependency graph $G$. Of particular interest in the field of cryptography are data-independent
memory-hard functions $f_{G,H}$ which are defined by a directed acyclic graph (DAG) $G$ and a cryptographic
hash function $H$. The pebbling complexity of the graph $G$ characterized the amortized cost of
evaluating $f_{G,H}$ multiple times or the total cost to run a brute-force preimage attack over
a fixed domain $\mathcal{X}$, i.e., given $y \in \{0,1\}^*$ find $x \in \mathcal{X}$ such that $f_{G,H}(x)=y$.
While a classical attacker will need to evaluate the function $f_{G,H}$ at least $m=|\mathcal{X}|$
times a quantum attacker running Grover's algorithm only requires $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{m})$ blackbox
calls to a quantum circuit $C_{G,H}$ evaluating the function $f_{G,H}$. Thus, to analyze the cost
of a quantum attack it is crucial to understand the space-time cost (equivalently width times depth)
of the quantum circuit $C_{G,H}$. We first observe that a legal black pebbling strategy for the graph
$G$ does not necessarily imply the existence of a quantum circuit with comparable complexity --
in contrast to the classical setting where any efficient pebbling strategy for $G$ corresponds
to an algorithm with comparable complexity evaluating $f_{G,H}$. Motivated by this observation
we introduce a new (parallel) quantum pebbling game which captures additional restrictions imposed
by the No-Deletion Theorem in Quantum Computing. We apply our new quantum pebbling game to analyze
the quantum space-time complexity of several important graphs: the line graph, Argon2i-A, Argon2i-B,
and DRSample. (See the paper for the full abstract.)

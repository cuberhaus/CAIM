The minimizers sampling mechanism is a popular mechanism for string sampling introduced independently
by Schleimer et al. [SIGMOD 2003] and by Roberts et al. [Bioinf. 2004]. Given two positive integers
$w$ and $k$, it selects the lexicographically smallest length-$k$ substring in every fragment
of $w$ consecutive length-$k$ substrings (in every sliding window of length $w + k - 1$). Minimizers
samples are approximately uniform, locally consistent, and computable in linear time. Two main
disadvantages of minimizers sampling mechanisms are: first, they do not have good guarantees on
the expected size of their samples for every combination of $w$ and $k$; and, second, indexes that
are constructed over their samples do not have good worst-case guarantees for on-line pattern searches.
We introduce bidirectional string anchors (bd-anchors), a new string sampling mechanism. Given
a positive integer $\ell$, our mechanism selects the lexicographically smallest rotation in every
length-$\ell$ fragment (in every sliding window of length $\ell$). We show that bd-anchors samples
are also approximately uniform, locally consistent, and computable in linear time. In addition,
our experiments using several datasets demonstrate that the bd-anchors sample sizes decrease
proportionally to $\ell$; and that these sizes are competitive to or smaller than the minimizers
sample sizes using the analogous sampling parameters. We provide theoretical justification for
these results by analyzing the expected size of bd-anchors samples. As a negative result, we show
that computing a total order $\leq$ on the input alphabet, which minimizes the bd-anchors sample
size, is NP-hard. We also show that by using any bd-anchors sample, we can construct, in near-linear
time, an index which requires linear (extra) space in the size of the sample and answers on-line pattern
searches in near-optimal time.

We develop a systematic approach to measuring combinatorial innovation in the biomedical sciences
based upon the comprehensive ontology of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). This approach leverages
an expert-defined knowledge ontology that features both breadth (27,875 MeSH analyzed across
25 million articles indexed by PubMed from 1902 onwards) and depth (we differentiate between Major
and Minor MeSH terms to identify differences in the knowledge network representation constructed
from primary research topics only). With this level of uniform resolution we differentiate between
three different modes of innovation contributing to the combinatorial knowledge network: (i)
conceptual innovation associated with the emergence of new concepts and entities (measured as
the entry of new MeSH); and (ii) recombinant innovation, associated with the emergence of new combinations,
which itself consists of two types: peripheral (i.e., combinations involving new knowledge) and
core (combinations comprised of pre-existing knowledge only). Another relevant question we seek
to address is whether examining triplet and quartet combinations, in addition to the more traditional
dyadic or pairwise combinations, provide evidence of any new phenomena associated with higher-order
combinations. Analysis of the size, growth, and coverage of combinatorial innovation yield results
that are largely independent of the combination order, thereby suggesting that the common dyadic
approach is sufficient to capture essential phenomena. Our main results are twofold: (a) despite
the persistent addition of new MeSH terms, the network is densifying over time meaning that scholars
are increasingly exploring and realizing the vast space of all knowledge combinations; and (b)
conceptual innovation is increasingly concentrated within single research articles, a harbinger
of the recent paradigm shift towards convergence science.

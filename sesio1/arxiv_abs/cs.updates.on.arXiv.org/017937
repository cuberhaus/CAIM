Posting help-seeking requests on social media has been broadly adopted by victims during natural
disasters to look for urgent rescue and supplies. The help-seeking requests need to get sufficient
public attention and be promptly routed to the intended target(s) for timely responses. However,
the huge volume and diverse types of crisis-related posts on social media might limit help-seeking
requests to receive adequate engagement and lead to their overwhelm. To understand this problem,
this work proposes a mixed-methods approach to figure out the overwhelm situation of help-seeking
requests, and individuals' and online communities' strategies to cope. We focused on the 2021 Henan
Floods in China and collected 141,674 help-seeking posts with the keyword "Henan Rainstorm Mutual
Aid" on a popular Chinese social media platform Weibo. The findings indicate that help-seeking
posts confront critical challenges of both external overwhelm (i.e., an enormous number of non-help-seeking
posts with the help-seeking-related keyword distracting public attention) and internal overwhelm
(i.e., attention inequality with 5% help-seeking posts receiving more than 95% likes, comments,
and shares). We discover linguistic and non-linguistic help-seeking strategies that could help
to prevent the overwhelm, such as including contact information, disclosing situational vulnerabilities,
using subjective narratives, and structuring help-seeking posts to a normalized syntax. We also
illustrate how community members spontaneously work to prevent the overwhelm with their collective
wisdom (e.g., norm development through discussion) and collaborative work (e.g., cross-community
support). We reflect on how the findings enrich the literature in crisis informatics and raise design
implications that facilitate effective help-seeking on social media during natural disasters.

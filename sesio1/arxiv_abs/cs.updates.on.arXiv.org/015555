Satellite-based Communication (SATCOM) systems are gaining renewed momentum in Industry and
Academia, thanks to innovative services introduced by leading tech companies and the promising
impact they can deliver towards the global connectivity objective tackled by early 6G initiatives.
On the one hand, the emergence of new manufacturing processes and radio technologies promises to
reduce service costs while guaranteeing outstanding communication latency, available bandwidth,
flexibility, and coverage range. On the other hand, cybersecurity techniques and solutions applied
in SATCOM links should be updated to reflect the enormous advancements in attacker capabilities
characterizing the last two decades. However, business urgency and opportunities are leading
operators towards challenging system trade-offs, leading to an increased attack surface and a
general relaxation of the available security services. This paper tackles the cited problems and
presents a comprehensive survey on the security threats, solutions, and challenges faced when
deploying and operating SATCOM systems. Specifically, we classify the literature on security
for SATCOM systems into two main branches, i.e., physical-layer security and cryptography schemes.
Then, we further identify specific research domains for each of the identified branches, focusing
on dedicated security issues, including, e.g., physical-layer confidentiality, anti-jamming
schemes, anti-spoofing strategies, and quantum-based key distribution schemes. For each of the
above domains, we highlight the most essential techniques, peculiarities, advantages, disadvantages,
lessons learned, and future directions. Finally, we also identify emerging research topics whose
additional investigation by Academia and Industry could further attract researchers and investors,
ultimately unleashing the potential behind ubiquitous satellite communications.

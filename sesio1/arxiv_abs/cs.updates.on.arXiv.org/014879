The analysis of electrical impulse phenomena in cardiac muscle tissue is important for the diagnosis
of heart rhythm disorders and other cardiac pathophysiology. Cardiac mapping techniques acquire
local temporal measurements and combine them to visualize the spread of electrophysiological
wave phenomena across the heart surface. However, low spatial resolution, sparse measurement
locations, noise and other artifacts make it challenging to accurately visualize spatio-temporal
activity. For instance, electro-anatomical catheter mapping is severely limited by the sparsity
of the measurements, and optical mapping is prone to noise and motion artifacts. In the past, several
approaches have been proposed to obtain more reliable maps from noisy or sparse mapping data. Here,
we demonstrate that deep learning can be used to compute phase maps and detect phase singularities
in optical mapping videos of ventricular fibrillation, as well as in very noisy, low-resolution
and extremely sparse simulated data of reentrant wave chaos mimicking catheter mapping data. The
deep learning approach learns to directly associate phase maps and the positions of phase singularities
with short spatio-temporal sequences of electrical data. We tested several neural network architectures,
based on a convolutional neural network with an encoding and decoding structure, to predict phase
maps or rotor core positions either directly or indirectly via the prediction of phase maps and a
subsequent classical calculation of phase singularities. Predictions can be performed across
different data, with models being trained on one species and then successfully applied to another,
or being trained solely on simulated data and then applied to experimental data. Future uses may
include the analysis of optical mapping studies in basic cardiovascular research, as well as the
mapping of atrial fibrillation in the clinical setting.

Scientific collaboration at international level has increased manifolds during last two decades.
Collaboration is not only associated with higher research productivity but has also been found
to be positively correlated with impact. Considering the benefits and advantages of international
collaboration for the national science and technology systems of a country, policymakers in different
countries have designed programs to promote international collaboration in science. Several
proximity dimensions: mainly geographical, cognitive, institutional, social, and economic,
are found to shape and drive the international collaborations. This paper attempts to measure and
characterize the international collaboration patterns in Indian scientific research. Research
publication data for the last 20 years (2001-2020), obtained from Web of Science, is analysed for
the purpose. Analytical results show that Indian international collaboration has grown at a rate
of 12.27% during this period, rising from only 20.73% internationally collaborated papers in 2001
to 32.35% internationally collaborated papers in 2020. USA, Germany, England, South Korea and
China are found to be the top 5 major collaborating partners for India during his period, however,
some subject area-wise variations are also seen. Among the internationally collaborated papers,
about 50% papers have an Indian researcher as lead (first) author, and more than 50% authors of such
internationally collaborated papers are from India. The internationally collaborated papers
from India are also found to have a slight advantage in terms of citation impact and social media visibility.
The cognitive proximity is found to be the most effective proximity dimension in shaping the international
collaboration patterns of India.

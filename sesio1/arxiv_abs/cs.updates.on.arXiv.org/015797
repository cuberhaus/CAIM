Quantum computing is the process of performing calculations using quantum mechanics. This field
studies the quantum behavior of certain subatomic particles for subsequent use in performing calculations,
as well as for large-scale information processing. These capabilities can give quantum computers
an advantage in terms of computational time and cost over classical computers. Nowadays, there
are scientific challenges that are impossible to perform by classical computation due to computational
complexity or the time the calculation would take, and quantum computation is one of the possible
answers. However, current quantum devices have not yet the necessary qubits and are not fault-tolerant
enough to achieve these goals. Nonetheless, there are other fields like machine learning or chemistry
where quantum computation could be useful with current quantum devices. This manuscript aims to
present a Systematic Literature Review of the papers published between 2017 and 2021 to identify,
analyze and classify the different algorithms used in quantum machine learning and their applications.
Consequently, this study identified 52 articles that used quantum machine learning techniques
and algorithms. The main types of found algorithms are quantum implementations of classical machine
learning algorithms, such as support vector machines or the k-nearest neighbor model, and classical
deep learning algorithms, like quantum neural networks. Many articles try to solve problems currently
answered by classical machine learning but using quantum devices and algorithms. Even though results
are promising, quantum machine learning is far from achieving its full potential. An improvement
in the quantum hardware is required since the existing quantum computers lack enough quality, speed,
and scale to allow quantum computing to achieve its full potential.

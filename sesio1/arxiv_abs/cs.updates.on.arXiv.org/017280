Purpose: The optic nerve head (ONH) undergoes complex and deep 3D morphological changes during
the development and progression of glaucoma. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is the current
gold standard to visualize and quantify these changes, however the resulting 3D deep-tissue information
has not yet been fully exploited for the diagnosis and prognosis of glaucoma. To this end, we aimed:
(1) To compare the performance of two relatively recent geometric deep learning techniques in diagnosing
glaucoma from a single OCT scan of the ONH; and (2) To identify the 3D structural features of the ONH
that are critical for the diagnosis of glaucoma. Methods: In this study, we included a total of 2,247
non-glaucoma and 2,259 glaucoma scans from 1,725 subjects. All subjects had their ONHs imaged in
3D with Spectralis OCT. All OCT scans were automatically segmented using deep learning to identify
major neural and connective tissues. Each ONH was then represented as a 3D point cloud. We used PointNet
and dynamic graph convolutional neural network (DGCNN) to diagnose glaucoma from such 3D ONH point
clouds and to identify the critical 3D structural features of the ONH for glaucoma diagnosis. Results:
Both the DGCNN (AUC: 0.97$\pm$0.01) and PointNet (AUC: 0.95$\pm$0.02) were able to accurately
detect glaucoma from 3D ONH point clouds. The critical points formed an hourglass pattern with most
of them located in the inferior and superior quadrant of the ONH. Discussion: The diagnostic accuracy
of both geometric deep learning approaches was excellent. Moreover, we were able to identify the
critical 3D structural features of the ONH for glaucoma diagnosis that tremendously improved the
transparency and interpretability of our method. Consequently, our approach may have strong potential
to be used in clinical applications for the diagnosis and prognosis of a wide range of ophthalmic
disorders.

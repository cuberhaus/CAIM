Analog over-the-air computation (OAC) is an efficient solution to a class of uplink data aggregation
tasks over a multiple-access channel (MAC), wherein the receiver, dubbed the fusion center, aims
to reconstruct a function of the data distributed at edge devices rather than the individual data
themselves. Existing OAC relies exclusively on the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation at the fusion
center to recover the arithmetic sum of the transmitted signals from different devices. ML estimation,
however, is much susceptible to noise. In particular, in the misaligned OAC where there are channel
misalignments among transmitted signals, ML estimation suffers from severe error propagation
and noise enhancement. To address these challenges, this paper puts forth a Bayesian approach for
OAC by letting each edge device transmit two pieces of prior information to the fusion center. Three
OAC systems are studied: the aligned OAC with perfectly-aligned signals; the synchronous OAC with
misaligned channel gains among the received signals; and the asynchronous OAC with both channel-gain
and time misalignments. Using the prior information, we devise linear minimum mean squared error
(LMMSE) estimators and a sum-product maximum a posteriori (SP-MAP) estimator for the three OAC
systems. Numerical results verify that, 1) For the aligned and synchronous OAC, our LMMSE estimator
significantly outperforms the ML estimator. In the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, the
LMMSE estimator reduces the mean squared error (MSE) by at least 6 dB; in the high SNR regime, the LMMSE
estimator lowers the error floor on the MSE by 86.4%; 2) For the asynchronous OAC, our LMMSE and SP-MAP
estimators are on an equal footing in terms of the MSE performance, and are significantly better
than the ML estimator.

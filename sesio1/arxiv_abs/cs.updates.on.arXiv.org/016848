Soft electronic skins are one of the means to turn an industrial manipulator into a collaborative
robot. For manipulators that are already fit for physical human-robot collaboration, soft skins
can make them safer. In this work, we study the after impact behavior of two collaborative manipulators
(UR10e and KUKA LBR iiwa) and one classical industrial manipulator (KUKA Cybertech), in the presence
or absence of an industrial protective skin (AIRSKIN). In addition, we isolate the effects of the
passive padding and the active contribution of the sensor to robot reaction. We present a total of
2250 collision measurements and study the impact force, contact duration, clamping force, and
impulse. The dataset is publicly available. We summarize our results as follows. For transient
collisions, the passive skin properties lowered the impact forces by about 40 %. During quasi-static
contact, the effect of skin covers -- active or passive -- cannot be isolated from the collision detection
and reaction by the collaborative robots. Important effects of the stop categories triggered by
the active protective skin were found. We systematically compare the different settings and the
empirically established safe velocities with prescriptions by the ISO/TS 15066. In some cases,
up to the quadruple of the ISO/TS 15066 prescribed velocity can comply with the impact force limits
and thus be considered safe. We propose an extension of the formulas relating impact force and permissible
velocity that take into account the stiffness and compressible thickness of the protective cover,
leading to better predictions of the collision forces. At the same time, this work emphasizes the
need for in situ measurements as all the factors we studied -- presence of active/passive skin, safety
stop settings, robot collision reaction, impact direction, and, of course, velocity -- have effects
on the force evolution after impact.

Over-the-air computation (AirComp) has emerged as a new analog power-domain non-orthogonal multiple
access (NOMA) technique for low-latency model/gradient-updates aggregation in federated edge
learning (FEEL). By integrating communication and computation into a joint design, AirComp can
significantly enhance the communication efficiency, but at the cost of aggregation errors caused
by channel fading and noise. This paper studies a particular type of FEEL with federated averaging
(FedAvg) and AirComp-based model-update aggregation, namely over-the-air FedAvg (Air-FedAvg).
We investigate the transmission power control to combat against the AirComp aggregation errors
for enhancing the training accuracy and accelerating the training speed of Air-FedAvg. Towards
this end, we first analyze the convergence behavior (in terms of the optimality gap) of Air-FedAvg
with aggregation errors at different outer iterations. Then, to enhance the training accuracy,
we minimize the optimality gap by jointly optimizing the transmission power control at edge devices
and the denoising factors at edge server, subject to a series of power constraints at individual
edge devices. Furthermore, to accelerate the training speed, we also minimize the training latency
of Air-FedAvg with a given targeted optimality gap, in which learning hyper-parameters including
the numbers of outer iterations and local training epochs are jointly optimized with the power control.
Finally, numerical results show that the proposed transmission power control policy achieves
significantly faster convergence for Air-FedAvg, as compared with benchmark policies with fixed
power transmission or per-iteration mean squared error (MSE) minimization. It is also shown that
the Air-FedAvg achieves an order-of-magnitude shorter training latency than the conventional
FedAvg with digital orthogonal multiple access (OMA-FedAvg).

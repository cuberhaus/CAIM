The diagonal distance or graph distance is an important parameter of a quantum error-correcting
code that characterizes whether the code is degenerate or not. Degeneracy is a property unique to
quantum codes, which allows quantum codes, unlike their classical counterparts, to correct more
errors than they can uniquely identify. In the CWS framework introduced by Cross, Smith, Smolin
and Zeng (2009), a quantum code is constructed using a classical code and a graph. It is known that
the diagonal distance of such a code is upper bounded by $\delta+1$, where $\delta$ is the minimum
degree of the associated graph. In this paper, we give sufficient conditions on a graph such that
a CWS code constructed from it has diagonal distance at least $\delta$, and in fact most of the graphs
in our sufficient class achieve the upper bound of $\delta+1$. Using this result, first we give necessary
conditions for a CWS code to be degenerate. Secondly, we prove hardness results for the problem of
finding the distance of a CWS code. We construct a CWS code from a given classical code, with the distance
of the CWS code being equal to the distance of the classical code. This allows us to translate well-known
hardness results for computing the minimum distance in classical codes to quantum codes. Specifically,
we show that exactly computing the distance of a CWS code is NP-complete, and multiplicatively or
additively approximating it is NP-hard under polynomial-time randomized reductions. Our reduction
from the classical problems to the quantum problems results in a non-degenerate quantum code, hence
our result implies that the quantum problems remain NP-hard even with the promise that the code is
non-degenerate. Moreover, using a mapping from stabilizer codes to CSS codes due to Bravyi, Terhal
and Leemhuis (2010), we are able to show that the hardness results hold for CSS codes as well.

The release of SOSTOOLS v4.00 comes as we approach the 20th anniversary of the original release of
SOSTOOLS v1.00 back in April, 2002. SOSTOOLS was originally envisioned as a flexible tool for parsing
and solving polynomial optimization problems, using the SOS tightening of polynomial positivity
constraints, and capable of adapting to the ever-evolving fauna of applications of SOS. There are
now a variety of SOS programming parsers beyond SOSTOOLS, including YALMIP, Gloptipoly, SumOfSquares,
and others. We hope SOSTOOLS remains the most intuitive, robust and adaptable toolbox for SOS programming.
Recent progress in Semidefinite programming has opened up new possibilities for solving large
Sum of Squares programming problems, and we hope the next decade will be one where SOS methods will
find wide application in different areas. In SOSTOOLS v4.00, we implement a parsing approach that
reduces the computational and memory requirements of the parser below that of the SDP solver itself.
We have re-developed the internal structure of our polynomial decision variables. Specifically,
polynomial and SOS variable declarations made using sossosvar, sospolyvar, sosmatrixvar, etc
now return a new polynomial structure, dpvar. This new polynomial structure, is documented in the
enclosed dpvar guide, and isolates the scalar SDP decision variables in the SOS program from the
independent variables used to construct the SOS program. As a result, the complexity of the parser
scales almost linearly in the number of decision variables. As a result of these changes, almost
all users will notice a significant increase in speed, with large-scaleproblems experiencing
the most dramatic speedups. Parsing time is now always less than 10% of time spent in the SDP solver.
Finally, SOSTOOLS now provides support for the MOSEK solver interface as well as the SeDuMi, SDPT3,
CSDP, SDPNAL, SDPNAL+, and SDPA solvers.

Monitoring medical data, e.g., Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, is a common application of Internet
of Things (IoT) devices. Compression methods are often applied on the massive amounts of sensor
data generated prior to sending it to the Cloud to reduce the storage and delivery costs. A lossy compression
provides high compression gain (CG), but may reduce the performance of an ECG application (downstream
task) due to information loss. Previous works on ECG monitoring focus either on optimizing the signal
reconstruction or the task's performance. Instead, we advocate a self-adapting lossy compression
solution that enables configuring a desired performance level on the downstream tasks while maintaining
an optimized CG that reduces Cloud costs. We propose Dynamic-Deep, a task-aware compression geared
for IoT-Cloud architectures. Our compressor is trained to optimize the CG while maintaining the
performance requirement of the downstream tasks chosen out of a wide range. In deployment, the IoT
edge device adapts the compression and sends an optimized representation for each data segment,
accounting for the downstream task's desired performance without relying on feedback from the
Cloud. We conduct an extensive evaluation of our approach on common ECG datasets using two popular
ECG applications, which includes heart rate (HR) arrhythmia classification. We demonstrate that
Dynamic-Deep can be configured to improve HR classification F1-score in a wide range of requirements.
One of which is tuned to improve the F1-score by 3 and increases CG by up to 83% compared to the previous
state-of-the-art (autoencoder-based) compressor. Analyzing Dynamic-Deep on the Google Cloud
Platform, we observe a 97% reduction in cloud costs compared to a no compression solution.

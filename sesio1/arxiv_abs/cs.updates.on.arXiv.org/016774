Purpose: To introduce a dual-domain reconstruction network with V-Net and K-Net for accurate MR
image reconstruction from undersampled k-space data. Methods: Most state-of-the-art reconstruction
methods apply U-Net or cascaded U-Nets in image domain and/or k-space domain. Nevertheless, these
methods have following problems: (1) Directly applying U-Net in k-space domain is not optimal for
extracting features in k-space domain; (2) Classical image-domain oriented U-Net is heavy-weight
and hence is inefficient to be cascaded many times for yielding good reconstruction accuracy; (3)
Classical image-domain oriented U-Net does not fully make use information of encoder network for
extracting features in decoder network; and (4) Existing methods are ineffective in simultaneously
extracting and fusing features in image domain and its dual k-space domain. To tackle these problems,
we propose in this paper (1) an image-domain encoder-decoder sub-network called V-Net which is
more light-weight for cascading and effective in fully utilizing features in the encoder for decoding,
(2) a k-space domain sub-network called K-Net which is more suitable for extracting hierarchical
features in k-space domain, and (3) a dual-domain reconstruction network where V-Nets and K-Nets
are parallelly and effectively combined and cascaded. Results: Extensive experimental results
on the challenging fastMRI dataset demonstrate that the proposed KV-Net can reconstruct high-quality
images and outperform current state-of-the-art approaches with fewer parameters. Conclusions:
To reconstruct images effectively and efficiently from incomplete k-space data, we have presented
a parallel dual-domain KV-Net to combine K-Nets and V-Nets. The KV-Net is more lightweight than
state-of-the-art methods but achieves better reconstruction performance.

Background & Aims: Hepatic steatosis is a major cause of chronic liver disease. 2D ultrasound is
the most widely used non-invasive tool for screening and monitoring, but associated diagnoses
are highly subjective. We developed a scalable deep learning (DL) algorithm for quantitative scoring
of liver steatosis from 2D ultrasound images. Approach & Results: Using retrospectively collected
multi-view ultrasound data from 3,310 patients, 19,513 studies, and 228,075 images, we trained
a DL algorithm to diagnose steatosis stages (healthy, mild, moderate, or severe) from ultrasound
diagnoses. Performance was validated on two multi-scanner unblinded and blinded (initially to
DL developer) histology-proven cohorts (147 and 112 patients) with histopathology fatty cell
percentage diagnoses, and a subset with FibroScan diagnoses. We also quantified reliability across
scanners and viewpoints. Results were evaluated using Bland-Altman and receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) analysis. The DL algorithm demonstrates repeatable measurements with a moderate number
of images (3 for each viewpoint) and high agreement across 3 premium ultrasound scanners. High diagnostic
performance was observed across all viewpoints: area under the curves of the ROC to classify >=mild,
>=moderate, =severe steatosis grades were 0.85, 0.90, and 0.93, respectively. The DL algorithm
outperformed or performed at least comparably to FibroScan with statistically significant improvements
for all levels on the unblinded histology-proven cohort, and for =severe steatosis on the blinded
histology-proven cohort. Conclusions: The DL algorithm provides a reliable quantitative steatosis
assessment across view and scanners on two multi-scanner cohorts. Diagnostic performance was
high with comparable or better performance than FibroScan.

The thin-file borrowers are customers for whom a creditworthiness assessment is uncertain due
to their lack of credit history; many researchers have used borrowers' relationships and interactions
networks in the form of graphs as an alternative data source to address this. Incorporating network
data is traditionally made by hand-crafted feature engineering, and lately, the graph neural network
has emerged as an alternative, but it still does not improve over the traditional method's performance.
Here we introduce a framework to improve credit scoring models by blending several Graph Representation
Learning methods: feature engineering, graph embeddings, and graph neural networks. We stacked
their outputs to produce a single score in this approach. We validated this framework using a unique
multi-source dataset that characterizes the relationships and credit history for the entire population
of a Latin American country, applying it to credit risk models, application, and behavior, targeting
both individuals and companies. Our results show that the graph representation learning methods
should be used as complements, and these should not be seen as self-sufficient methods as is currently
done. In terms of AUC and KS, we enhance the statistical performance, outperforming traditional
methods. In Corporate lending, where the gain is much higher, it confirms that evaluating an unbanked
company cannot solely consider its features. The business ecosystem where these firms interact
with their owners, suppliers, customers, and other companies provides novel knowledge that enables
financial institutions to enhance their creditworthiness assessment. Our results let us know
when and which group to use graph data and what effects on performance to expect. They also show the
enormous value of graph data on the unbanked credit scoring problem, principally to help companies'
banking.

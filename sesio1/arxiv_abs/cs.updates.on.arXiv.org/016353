Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of visual impairment among elderly
in the world. Early detection of AMD is of great importance as the vision loss caused by AMD is irreversible
and permanent. Color fundus photography is the most cost-effective imaging modality to screen
for retinal disorders. \textcolor{red}{Recently, some algorithms based on deep learning had
been developed for fundus image analysis and automatic AMD detection. However, a comprehensive
annotated dataset and a standard evaluation benchmark are still missing.} To deal with this issue,
we set up the Automatic Detection challenge on Age-related Macular degeneration (ADAM) for the
first time, held as a satellite event of the ISBI 2020 conference. The ADAM challenge consisted of
four tasks which cover the main topics in detecting AMD from fundus images, including classification
of AMD, detection and segmentation of optic disc, localization of fovea, and detection and segmentation
of lesions. The ADAM challenge has released a comprehensive dataset of 1200 fundus images with the
category labels of AMD, the pixel-wise segmentation masks of the full optic disc and lesions (drusen,
exudate, hemorrhage, scar, and other), as well as the location coordinates of the macular fovea.
A uniform evaluation framework has been built to make a fair comparison of different models. During
the ADAM challenge, 610 results were submitted for online evaluation, and finally, 11 teams participated
in the onsite challenge. This paper introduces the challenge, dataset, and evaluation methods,
as well as summarizes the methods and analyzes the results of the participating teams of each task.
In particular, we observed that ensembling strategy and clinical prior knowledge can better improve
the performances of the deep learning models.

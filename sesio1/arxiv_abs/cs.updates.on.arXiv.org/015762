This paper proposes a segmentation method of infection regions in the lung from CT volumes of COVID-19
patients. COVID-19 spread worldwide, causing many infected patients and deaths. CT image-based
diagnosis of COVID-19 can provide quick and accurate diagnosis results. An automated segmentation
method of infection regions in the lung provides a quantitative criterion for diagnosis. Previous
methods employ whole 2D image or 3D volume-based processes. Infection regions have a considerable
variation in their sizes. Such processes easily miss small infection regions. Patch-based process
is effective for segmenting small targets. However, selecting the appropriate patch size is difficult
in infection region segmentation. We utilize the scale uncertainty among various receptive field
sizes of a segmentation FCN to obtain infection regions. The receptive field sizes can be defined
as the patch size and the resolution of volumes where patches are clipped from. This paper proposes
an infection segmentation network (ISNet) that performs patch-based segmentation and a scale
uncertainty-aware prediction aggregation method that refines the segmentation result. We design
ISNet to segment infection regions that have various intensity values. ISNet has multiple encoding
paths to process patch volumes normalized by multiple intensity ranges. We collect prediction
results generated by ISNets having various receptive field sizes. Scale uncertainty among the
prediction results is extracted by the prediction aggregation method. We use an aggregation FCN
to generate a refined segmentation result considering scale uncertainty among the predictions.
In our experiments using 199 chest CT volumes of COVID-19 cases, the prediction aggregation method
improved the dice similarity score from 47.6% to 62.1%.

The most prominent Agile framework Scrum, is often criticized for its amount of meetings. These
regular events are essential to the empirical inspect-and-adapt cycle proposed by Agile methods.
Scrum meetings face several challenges, such as being perceived as boring, repetitive, or irrelevant,
leading to decreased cooperation in teams and less successful projects. In an attempt to address
these challenges, Agile practitioners have adopted teamwork, innovation, and design techniques
geared towards improving collaboration. Additionally, they have developed their own activities
to be used in Scrum meetings, most notably for conducting retrospective and planning events. Design
thinking incorporates non-designers and designers in design and conceptualization activities,
including user research, ideation, or testing. Accordingly, the design thinking approach provides
a process with different phases and accompanying techniques for each step. These design thinking
techniques can support shared understanding in teams and can improve collaboration, creativity,
and product understanding. For these reasons, design thinking techniques represent a worthwhile
addition to the Scrum meeting toolkit and can support Agile meetings in preventing or countering
common meeting challenges and achieving meeting goals. This chapter explores how techniques from
the design thinking toolkit can support Scrum meetings from a theoretical and practical viewpoint.
We analyze Scrum meetings' requirements, goals, and challenges and link them to groups of techniques
from the design thinking toolkit. In addition, we review interview and observational data from
two previous studies with software development practitioners and derive concrete examples. As
a result, we present initial guidelines on integrating design thinking techniques into Scrum meetings
to make them more engaging, collaborative, and interactive.

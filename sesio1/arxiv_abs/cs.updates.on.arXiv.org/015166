The purpose of the paper is to provide innovative emerging technology framework for community to
combat epidemic situations. The paper proposes a unique outbreak response system framework based
on artificial intelligence and edge computing for citizen centric services to help track and trace
people eluding safety policies like mask detection and social distancing measure in public or workplace
setup. The framework further provides implementation guideline in industrial setup as well for
governance and contact tracing tasks. The adoption will thus lead in smart city planning and development
focusing on citizen health systems contributing to improved quality of life. The conceptual framework
presented is validated through quantitative data analysis via secondary data collection from
researcher's public websites, GitHub repositories and renowned journals and further benchmarking
were conducted for experimental results in Microsoft Azure cloud environment. The study includes
selective AI-models for benchmark analysis and were assessed on performance and accuracy in edge
computing environment for large scale societal setup. Overall YOLO model Outperforms in object
detection task and is faster enough for mask detection and HRNetV2 outperform semantic segmentation
problem applied to solve social distancing task in AI-Edge inferencing environmental setup. The
paper proposes new Edge-AI algorithm for building technology-oriented solutions for detecting
mask in human movement and social distance. The paper enriches the technological advancement in
artificial intelligence and edge-computing applied to problems in society and healthcare systems.
The framework further equips government agency, system providers to design and constructs technology-oriented
models in community setup to Increase the quality of life using emerging technologies into smart
urban environments.

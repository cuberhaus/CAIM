Understanding and mitigating drivers' negative emotions, stress levels, and anxiety is of high
importance for decreasing accident rates, enhancing road safety, and providing a healthy lifestyle
to the community of drivers. While detecting drivers' stress and negative emotions can significantly
help with this goal, understanding what might be associated with increases in drivers' negative
emotions and high stress level, might better help with planning interventions. While studies have
provided significant insight into detecting drivers' emotions and stress levels; not many studies
focused on the reasons behind changes in stress levels and negative emotions. In this study, by using
a naturalistic driving study database, we analyze the changes in the driving scene, including road
objects and the dynamical relationship between the ego vehicle and the lead vehicle with respect
to changes in drivers' psychophysiological metrics (i.e., heart rate (HR) and facial expressions).
We find that different road objects might be associated with varying levels of increase in drivers'
HR as well as different proportions of negative facial emotions detected through computer vision.
Our results indicate that larger vehicles on the road, such as trucks and buses, are associated with
the highest amount of increase in drivers' HR as well as negative emotions. Additionally, we provide
evidence that shorter distances to the lead vehicle in naturalistic driving, as well as the higher
standard deviation in the distance, might be associated with a higher number of abrupt increases
in drivers' HR, depicting a possible increase in stress level. Lastly, our results indicate more
positive emotions, lower facial engagement, and a lower abrupt increase in HR at a higher speed of
driving, which often happens in highway driving.

How can humans remain in control of artificial intelligence (AI)-based systems designed to perform
tasks autonomously? Such systems are increasingly ubiquitous, creating benefits - but also undesirable
situations where moral responsibility for their actions cannot be properly attributed to any particular
person or group. The concept of meaningful human control has been proposed to address responsibility
gaps and mitigate them by establishing conditions that enable a proper attribution of responsibility
for humans; however, clear requirements for researchers, designers, and engineers are yet inexistent,
making the development of AI-based systems that remain under meaningful human control challenging.
In this paper, we address the gap between philosophical theory and engineering practice by identifying,
through an iterative process of abductive thinking, four actionable properties for AI-based systems
under meaningful human control, which we discuss making use of two applications scenarios: automated
vehicles and AI-based hiring. First, a system in which humans and AI algorithms interact should
have an explicitly defined domain of morally loaded situations within which the system ought to
operate. Second, humans and AI agents within the system should have appropriate and mutually compatible
representations. Third, responsibility attributed to a human should be commensurate with that
human's ability and authority to control the system. Fourth, there should be explicit links between
the actions of the AI agents and actions of humans who are aware of their moral responsibility. We
argue that these four properties will support practically-minded professionals to take concrete
steps toward designing and engineering for AI systems that facilitate meaningful human control.

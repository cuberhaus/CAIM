A graph $G$ is called self-ordered (a.k.a asymmetric) if the identity permutation is its only automorphism.
Equivalently, there is a unique isomorphism from $G$ to any graph that is isomorphic to $G$. We say
that $G=(V,E)$ is robustly self-ordered if the size of the symmetric difference between $E$ and
the edge-set of the graph obtained by permuting $V$ using any permutation $\pi:V\to V$ is proportional
to the number of non-fixed-points of $\pi$. In this work, we initiate the study of the structure,
construction and utility of robustly self-ordered graphs. We show that robustly self-ordered
bounded-degree graphs exist (in abundance), and that they can be constructed efficiently, in a
strong sense. Specifically, given the index of a vertex in such a graph, it is possible to find all
its neighbors in polynomial-time (i.e., in time that is poly-logarithmic in the size of the graph).
We also consider graphs of unbounded degree, seeking correspondingly unbounded robustness parameters.
We again demonstrate that such graphs (of linear degree) exist (in abundance), and that they can
be constructed efficiently, in a strong sense. This turns out to require very different tools. Specifically,
we show that the construction of such graphs reduces to the construction of non-malleable two-source
extractors (with very weak parameters but with some additional natural features). We demonstrate
that robustly self-ordered bounded-degree graphs are useful towards obtaining lower bounds on
the query complexity of testing graph properties both in the bounded-degree and the dense graph
models. One of the results that we obtain, via such a reduction, is a subexponential separation between
the query complexities of testing and tolerant testing of graph properties in the bounded-degree
graph model.

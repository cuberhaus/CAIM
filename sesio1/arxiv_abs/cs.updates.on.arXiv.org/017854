The performance of existing underwater object detection methods degrades seriously when facing
domain shift caused by complicated underwater environments. Due to the limitation of the number
of domains in the dataset, deep detectors easily memorize a few seen domains, which leads to low generalization
ability. There are two common ideas to improve the domain generalization performance. First, it
can be inferred that the detector trained on as many domains as possible is domain-invariant. Second,
for the images with the same semantic content in different domains, their hidden features should
be equivalent. This paper further excavates these two ideas and proposes a domain generalization
framework (named DMC) that learns how to generalize across domains from Domain Mixup and Contrastive
Learning. First, based on the formation of underwater images, an image in an underwater environment
is the linear transformation of another underwater environment. Thus, a style transfer model,
which outputs a linear transformation matrix instead of the whole image, is proposed to transform
images from one source domain to another, enriching the domain diversity of the training data. Second,
mixup operation interpolates different domains on the feature level, sampling new domains on the
domain manifold. Third, contrastive loss is selectively applied to features from different domains
to force the model to learn domain invariant features but retain the discriminative capacity. With
our method, detectors will be robust to domain shift. Also, a domain generalization benchmark S-UODAC2020
for detection is set up to measure the performance of our method. Comprehensive experiments on S-UODAC2020
and two object recognition benchmarks (PACS and VLCS) demonstrate that the proposed method is able
to learn domain-invariant representations, and outperforms other domain generalization methods.

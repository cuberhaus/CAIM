In this paper, we study edit distance (ED) and longest common subsequence (LCS) in the asymmetric
streaming model, introduced by Saks and Seshadhri [SS13]. As an intermediate model between the
random access model and the streaming model, this model allows one to have streaming access to one
string and random access to the other string. Our first main contribution is a systematic study of
space lower bounds for ED and LCS in the asymmetric streaming model. Previously, there are no explicitly
stated results in this context, although some lower bounds about LCS can be inferred from the lower
bounds for longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in [SW07][GG10][EJ08]. Yet these bounds only
work for large alphabet size. In this paper, we develop several new techniques to handle ED in general
and LCS for small alphabet size, thus establishing strong lower bounds for both problems. In particular,
our lower bound for ED provides an exponential separation between edit distance and Hamming distance
in the asymmetric streaming model. Our lower bounds also extend to LIS and longest non-decreasing
sequence (LNS) in the standard streaming model. Together with previous results, our bounds provide
an almost complete picture for these two problems. As our second main contribution, we give improved
algorithms for ED and LCS in the asymmetric streaming model. For ED, we improve the space complexity
of the constant factor approximation algorithms in [FHRS20][CJLZ20] from $\tilde{O}(\frac{n^\delta}{\delta})$
to $O(\frac{d^\delta}{\delta}\;\mathsf{polylog}(n))$, where $n$ is the length of each string
and $d$ is the edit distance between the two strings. For LCS, we give the first $1/2+\epsilon$ approximation
algorithm with space $n^{\delta}$ for any constant $\delta>0$, over a binary alphabet.

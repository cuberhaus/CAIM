To develop an automated workflow for rectal cancer three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy
treatment planning that combines deep-learning(DL) aperture predictions and forward-planning
algorithms. We designed an algorithm to automate the clinical workflow for planning with field-in-field.
DL models were trained, validated, and tested on 555 patients to automatically generate aperture
shapes for primary and boost fields. Network inputs were digitally reconstructed radiography,
gross tumor volume(GTV), and nodal GTV. A physician scored each aperture for 20 patients on a 5-point
scale(>3 acceptable). A planning algorithm was then developed to create a homogeneous dose using
a combination of wedges and subfields. The algorithm iteratively identifies a hotspot volume,
creates a subfield, and optimizes beam weight all without user intervention. The algorithm was
tested on 20 patients using clinical apertures with different settings, and the resulting plans(4
plans/patient) were scored by a physician. The end-to-end workflow was tested and scored by a physician
on 39 patients using DL-generated apertures and planning algorithms. The predicted apertures
had Dice scores of 0.95, 0.94, and 0.90 for posterior-anterior, laterals, and boost fields, respectively.
100%, 95%, and 87.5% of the posterior-anterior, laterals, and boost apertures were scored as clinically
acceptable, respectively. Wedged and non-wedged plans were clinically acceptable for 85% and
50% of patients, respectively. The final plans hotspot dose percentage was reduced from 121%($\pm$
14%) to 109%($\pm$ 5%) of prescription dose. The integrated end-to-end workflow of automatically
generated apertures and optimized field-in-field planning gave clinically acceptable plans
for 38/39(97%) of patients. We have successfully automated the clinical workflow for generating
radiotherapy plans for rectal cancer for our institution.

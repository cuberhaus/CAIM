A voting rule decides on a probability distribution over a set of $m$ alternatives, based on rankings
of those alternatives provided by agents. We assume that agents have cardinal utility functions
over the alternatives, but voting rules have access to only the rankings induced by these utilities.
We evaluate how well voting rules do on measures of social welfare and of proportional fairness,
computed based on the hidden utility functions. In particular, we study the distortion of voting
rules, which is a worst-case measure. It is an approximation ratio comparing the utilitarian social
welfare of the optimum outcome to the welfare of the outcome selected by the voting rule, in the worst
case over possible input profiles and utility functions that are consistent with the input. The
literature has studied distortion with unit-sum utility functions, and left a small asymptotic
gap in the best possible distortion. Using tools from the theory of fair multi-winner elections,
we propose the first voting rule which achieves the optimal distortion $\Theta(\sqrt{m})$ for
unit-sum utilities. Our voting rule also achieves optimum $\Theta(\sqrt{m})$ distortion for
unit-range and approval utilities. We then take a similar worst-case approach to a quantitative
measure of the fairness of a voting rule, called proportional fairness. Informally, it measures
whether the influence of cohesive groups of agents on the voting outcome is proportional to the group
size. We show that there is a voting rule which, without knowledge of the utilities, can achieve an
$O(\log m)$-approximation to proportional fairness, the best possible approximation. As a consequence
of its proportional fairness, we show that this voting rule achieves $O(\log m)$ distortion with
respect to Nash welfare, and provides an $O(\log m)$-approximation to the core, making it interesting
for applications in participatory budgeting.

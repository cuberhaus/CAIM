Quantitative investment is a fundamental financial task that highly relies on accurate stock prediction
and profitable investment decision making. Despite recent advances in deep learning (DL) have
shown stellar performance on capturing trading opportunities in the stochastic stock market,
we observe that the performance of existing DL methods is sensitive to random seeds and network initialization.
To design more profitable DL methods, we analyze this phenomenon and find two major limitations
of existing works. First, there is a noticeable gap between accurate financial predictions and
profitable investment strategies. Second, investment decisions are made based on only one individual
predictor without consideration of model uncertainty, which is inconsistent with the workflow
in real-world trading firms. To tackle these two limitations, we first reformulate quantitative
investment as a multi-task learning problem. Later on, we propose AlphaMix, a novel two-stage mixture-of-experts
(MoE) framework for quantitative investment to mimic the efficient bottom-up trading strategy
design workflow of successful trading firms. In Stage one, multiple independent trading experts
are jointly optimized with an individual uncertainty-aware loss function. In Stage two, we train
neural routers (corresponding to the role of a portfolio manager) to dynamically deploy these experts
on an as-needed basis. AlphaMix is also a universal framework that is applicable to various backbone
network architectures with consistent performance gains. Through extensive experiments on long-term
real-world data spanning over five years on two of the most influential financial markets (US and
China), we demonstrate that AlphaMix significantly outperforms many state-of-the-art baselines
in terms of four financial criteria.

Blockchain technology enables stakeholders to conduct trusted data sharing and exchange without
a trusted centralized institution. These features make blockchain applications attractive to
enhance trustworthiness in very different contexts. Due to unique design concepts and outstanding
performance, blockchain has become a popular research topic in industry and academia in recent
years. Every participant is anonymous in a permissionless blockchain represented by cryptocurrency
applications such as Bitcoin. In this situation, some special incentive mechanisms are applied
to permissionless blockchain, such as mined native cryptocurrency to solve the trust issues of
permissionless blockchain. In many use cases, permissionless blockchain has bottlenecks in transaction
throughput performance, which restricts further application in the real world. A permissioned
blockchain can reach a consensus among a group of entities that do not establish an entire trust relationship.
Unlike permissionless blockchains, the participants must be identified in permissioned blockchains.
By relying on the traditional crash fault-tolerant consensus protocols, permissioned blockchains
can achieve high transaction throughput and low latency without sacrificing security. However,
how to balance the security and consensus efficiency is still the issue that needs to be solved urgently
in permissioned blockchains. As the core module of blockchain technology, the consensus algorithm
plays a vital role in the performance of the blockchain system. Thus, this paper proposes a new consensus
algorithm for permissioned blockchain, the Risk Assessment-based Consensus protocol (RAC),
combined with the decentralized design concept and the risk-node assessment mechanism to address
the unbalance issues of performance in speed, scalability, and security.

As a well-known physical unclonable function that can provide huge number of challenge response
pairs (CRP) with a compact design and fully compatibility with current electronic fabrication
process, the arbiter PUF (APUF) has attracted great attention. To improve its resilience against
modeling attacks, many APUF variants have been proposed so far. Though the modeling resilience
of response obfuscated APUF variants such as XOR-APUF and lightweight secure APUF (LSPUF) have
been well studied, the challenge obfuscated APUFs (CO-APUFs) such as feed-forward APUF (FF-APUF),
and XOR-FF-APUF are less elucidated, especially, with the deep learning (DL) methods. This work
systematically evaluates five CO-APUFs including three influential designs of FF-APUF, XOR-FF-APUF,
iPUF, one very recently design and our newly optimized design (dubbed as OAX-FF-APUF), in terms
of their reliability, uniformity (related to uniqueness), and modeling resilience. Three DL techniques
of GRU, TCN and MLP are employed to examine these CO-APUFs' modeling resilience -- the first two are
newly explored. With computation resource of a common personal computer, we show that all five CO-APUFs
with relatively large scale can be successfully modeled -- attacking accuracy higher or close to
its reliability. The hyper-parameter tuning of DL technique is crucial for implementing efficient
attacks. Increasing the scale of the CO-APUF is validated to be able to improve the resilience but
should be done with minimizing the reliability degradation. As the powerful capability of DL technique
affirmed by us, we recommend the DL, specifically the MLP technique always demonstrating best efficacy,
to be always considered for examining the modeling resilience when newly composited APUFs are devised
or to a large extent, other strong PUFs are constructed.

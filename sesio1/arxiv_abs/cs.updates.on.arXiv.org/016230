Reliable probability estimation is of crucial importance in many real-world applications where
there is inherent uncertainty, such as weather forecasting, medical prognosis, or collision avoidance
in autonomous vehicles. Probability-estimation models are trained on observed outcomes (e.g.
whether it has rained or not, or whether a patient has died or not), because the ground-truth probabilities
of the events of interest are typically unknown. The problem is therefore analogous to binary classification,
with the important difference that the objective is to estimate probabilities rather than predicting
the specific outcome. The goal of this work is to investigate probability estimation from high-dimensional
data using deep neural networks. There exist several methods to improve the probabilities generated
by these models but they mostly focus on classification problems where the probabilities are related
to model uncertainty. In the case of problems with inherent uncertainty, it is challenging to evaluate
performance without access to ground-truth probabilities. To address this, we build a synthetic
dataset to study and compare different computable metrics. We evaluate existing methods on the
synthetic data as well as on three real-world probability estimation tasks, all of which involve
inherent uncertainty. We also give a theoretical analysis of a model for high-dimensional probability
estimation which reproduces several of the phenomena evinced in our experiments. Finally, we propose
a new method for probability estimation using neural networks, which modifies the training process
to promote output probabilities that are consistent with empirical probabilities computed from
the data. The method outperforms existing approaches on most metrics on the simulated as well as
real-world data.

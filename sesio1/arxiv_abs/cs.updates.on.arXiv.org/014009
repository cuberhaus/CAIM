Social media plays a crucial role in today's society. It results in paradigm changes in how people
relate and communicate, convey and exchange ideas. Moreover, social media has evolved into critical
knowledge networks for consumers and also affects decision-making. In elections, social media
became an integral part of political campaigning to reach a greater audience and gather more support.
The 2019 Lok Sabha election saw a massive spike in the usage of online social media platforms such
as Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp; with every major political party launching its own organized
social media campaigns. In 2014, Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) took one step ahead in organizing the
campaign by launching its app - NaMo App. We focus our research on Twitter and NaMo App during the 2019
Lok Sabha elections and CAA protests. Twitter is a platform where every individual can express their
views and is not biased. In contrast, NaMo App is one of the first apps centered around a specific political
party. It acted as a digital medium for BJP for organizing the political campaign to make people's
opinion in their favour. This research aims to characterize the role of the NaMo App in a more traditional
network as Twitter in shaping political discourse and studies the existence of an online echo chamber.
We began by analyzing the amount and type of content shared using the NaMo App on Twitter. We performed
content and network analysis for the existence of the echo chamber. We also applied Hawkes process
to see the influence that NaMo App has on Twitter. Through this research, we can conclude that the
users who share content using NaMo App, may be part of an online echo chamber and are likely to be BJP
workers. We show the reach and influence that the NaMo App has on Twitter is significantly less, indicating
its inability to break through the diverse audience and change the narrative on Twitter.

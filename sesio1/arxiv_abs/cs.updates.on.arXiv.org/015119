Many different studies have suggested that episodic memory is a generative process, but most computational
models adopt a storage view. In this work, we propose a computational model for generative episodic
memory. It is based on the central hypothesis that the hippocampus stores and retrieves selected
aspects of an episode as a memory trace, which is necessarily incomplete. At recall, the neocortex
reasonably fills in the missing information based on general semantic information in a process
we call semantic completion. As episodes we use images of digits (MNIST) augmented by different
backgrounds representing context. Our model is based on a VQ-VAE which generates a compressed latent
representation in form of an index matrix, which still has some spatial resolution. We assume that
attention selects some part of the index matrix while others are discarded, this then represents
the gist of the episode and is stored as a memory trace. At recall the missing parts are filled in by
a PixelCNN, modeling semantic completion, and the completed index matrix is then decoded into a
full image by the VQ-VAE. The model is able to complete missing parts of a memory trace in a semantically
plausible way up to the point where it can generate plausible images from scratch. Due to the combinatorics
in the index matrix, the model generalizes well to images not trained on. Compression as well as semantic
completion contribute to a strong reduction in memory requirements and robustness to noise. Finally
we also model an episodic memory experiment and can reproduce that semantically congruent contexts
are always recalled better than incongruent ones, high attention levels improve memory accuracy
in both cases, and contexts that are not remembered correctly are more often remembered semantically
congruently than completely wrong.

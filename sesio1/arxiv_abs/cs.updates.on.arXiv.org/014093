This paper presents the development of a multi-sensor extended reality platform to improve the
teaching and learning experience of arc welding tasks. Traditional methods to acquire hand-eye
welding coordination skills are typically conducted through one-to-one instruction where trainees/trainers
must wear protective helmets and conduct several hands-on tests with metal workpieces. This approach
is inefficient as the harmful light emitted from the electric arc impedes the close monitoring of
the welding process (practitioners can only observe a small bright spot and most geometric information
cannot be perceived). To tackle these problems, some recent training approaches have leveraged
on virtual reality (VR) as a way to safely simulate the process and visualize the geometry of the workpieces.
However, the synthetic nature of the virtual simulation reduces the effectiveness of the platform;
It fails to comprise actual interactions with the welding environment, which may hinder the learning
process of a trainee. To incorporate a real welding experience, in this work we present a new automated
multi-sensor extended reality platform for arc welding training. It consists of three components:
(1) An HDR camera, monitoring the real welding spot in real-time; (2) A depth sensor, capturing the
3D geometry of the scene; and (3) A head-mounted VR display, visualizing the process safely. Our
innovative platform provides trainees with a "bot trainer", virtual cues of the seam geometry,
automatic spot tracking, and a performance score. To validate the platform's feasibility, we conduct
extensive experiments with several welding training tasks. We show that compared with the traditional
training practice and recent virtual reality approaches, our automated method achieves better
performances in terms of accuracy, learning curve, and effectiveness.

Wideband extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) is a promising technique
to achieve Tbps data rates in future 6G systems through beamforming and spatial multiplexing. Due
to the extensive bandwidth and the huge number of antennas for wideband XL-MIMO, a significant near-field
beam split effect will be induced, where beams at different frequencies are focused on different
locations. The near-field beam split effect results in a severe array gain loss, so existing works
mainly focus on compensating for this loss by utilizing the time delay (TD) beamformer. By contrast,
this paper demonstrates that although the near-field beam split effect degrades the array gain,
it also provides a new possibility to realize fast near-field beam training. Specifically, we first
reveal the mechanism of the near-field controllable beam split effect. This effect indicates that,
by dedicatedly designing the delay parameters, a TD beamformer is able to control the degree of the
near-field beam split effect, i.e., beams at different frequencies can flexibly occupy the desired
location range. Due to the similarity with the dispersion of natural light caused by a prism, this
effect is also termed as the near-field rainbow in this paper. Then, taking advantage of the near-field
rainbow effect, a fast wideband beam training scheme is proposed. In our scheme, the close form of
the beamforming vector is elaborately derived to enable beams at different frequencies to be focused
on different desired locations. By this means, the optimal beamforming vector with the largest
array gain can be rapidly searched out by generating multiple beams focused on multiple locations
simultaneously through only one radio-frequency (RF) chain. Finally, simulation results demonstrate
the proposed scheme is able to realize near-optimal nearfield beam training with a very low training
overhead.

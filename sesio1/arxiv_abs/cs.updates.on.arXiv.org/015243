We aim to counter the tendency for specialization in science by advancing a language that can facilitate
the translation of ideas and methods between disparate contexts. The focus is on questions of "resource-theoretic
nature". In a resource theory, one identifies resources and allowed manipulations that can be used
to transform them. Some of the main questions are: How to optimize resources? What are the trade-offs
between them? Can a given resource be converted to another one via the allowed manipulations? Because
of their ubiquity, methods used to answer them in one context can be used to tackle corresponding
questions in new contexts. The translation occurs in two stages. Firstly, methods are generalized
to the abstract language. Then, one can determine whether potentially novel contexts can accommodate
them. We focus on the first stage, by introducing two variants of an abstract framework in which existing
and yet unidentified resource theories can be represented. Using these, the task of generalizing
concrete methods is tackled in chapter 4 by studying the ways in which meaningful measures of resources
may be constructed. One construction expresses a notion of cost (or yield) of a resource. Among other
applications, it may be used to extend measures from a subset of resources to a larger domain. Another
construction allows the translation of resource measures from one resource theory to another.
Special cases include resource robustness and weight measures, as well as relative entropy based
measures quantifying minimal distinguishability from freely available resources. We instantiate
some of these ideas in a resource theory of distinguishability in chapter 5. It describes the utility
of systems with probabilistic behavior for the task of distinguishing between hypotheses, which
said behavior may depend on.

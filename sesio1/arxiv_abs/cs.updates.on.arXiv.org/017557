We present a combined scaling method - named BASIC - that achieves 85.7% top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet
ILSVRC-2012 validation set without learning from any labeled ImageNet example. This accuracy
surpasses best published similar models - CLIP and ALIGN - by 9.3%. Our BASIC model also shows significant
improvements in robustness benchmarks. For instance, on 5 test sets with natural distribution
shifts such as ImageNet-{A,R,V2,Sketch} and ObjectNet, our model achieves 84.3% top-1 average
accuracy, only a small drop from its original ImageNet accuracy. To achieve these results, we scale
up the contrastive learning framework of CLIP and ALIGN in three dimensions: data size, model size,
and batch size. Our dataset has 6.6B noisy image-text pairs, which is 4x larger than ALIGN, and 16x
larger than CLIP. Our largest model has 3B weights, which is 3.75x larger in parameters and 8x larger
in FLOPs than ALIGN and CLIP. Finally, our batch size is 65536 which is 2x more than CLIP and 4x more
than ALIGN. We encountered two main challenges with the scaling rules of BASIC. First, the main challenge
with implementing the combined scaling rules of BASIC is the limited memory of accelerators, such
as GPUs and TPUs. To overcome the memory limit, we propose two simple methods which make use of gradient
checkpointing and model parallelism. Second, while increasing the dataset size and the model size
has been the defacto method to improve the performance of deep learning models like BASIC, the effect
of a large contrastive batch size on such contrastive-trained image-text models is not well-understood.
To shed light on the benefits of large contrastive batch sizes, we develop a theoretical framework
which shows that larger contrastive batch sizes lead to smaller generalization gaps for image-text
models such as BASIC.

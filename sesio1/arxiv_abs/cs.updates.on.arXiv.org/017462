Using deep learning models to diagnose cancer from histology data presents several challenges.
Cancer grading and localization of regions of interest (ROIs) in these images normally relies on
both image- and pixel-level labels, the latter requiring a costly annotation process. Deep weakly-supervised
object localization (WSOL) methods provide different strategies for low-cost training of deep
learning models. Using only image-class annotations, these methods can be trained to classify
an image, and yield class activation maps (CAMs) for ROI localization. This paper provides a review
of state-of-art DL methods for WSOL. We propose a taxonomy where these methods are divided into bottom-up
and top-down methods according to the information flow in models. Although the latter have seen
limited progress, recent bottom-up methods are currently driving much progress with deep WSOL
methods. Early works focused on designing different spatial pooling functions. However, these
methods reached limited localization accuracy, and unveiled a major limitation -- the under-activation
of CAMs which leads to high false negative localization. Subsequent works aimed to alleviate this
issue and recover complete object. Representative methods from our taxonomy are evaluated and
compared in terms of classification and localization accuracy on two challenging histology datasets.
Overall, the results indicate poor localization performance, particularly for generic methods
that were initially designed to process natural images. Methods designed to address the challenges
of histology data yielded good results. However, all methods suffer from high false positive/negative
localization. Four key challenges are identified for the application of deep WSOL methods in histology
-- under/over activation of CAMs, sensitivity to thresholding, and model selection.

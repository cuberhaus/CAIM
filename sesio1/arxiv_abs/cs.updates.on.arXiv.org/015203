The process of teaching has been greatly changed by the COVID-19 pandemic. It is possible that studying
will not resemble anymore the process known by the previous generations of students. As the current
generations learn by doing and use their intuition, new platforms need to be involved in the teaching
process. The current paper proposes a new method to keep the students engaged while learning by involving
neuroscience during the classes of Microcontrollers. Arduino and Raspberry Pi boards are studied
at the course of Microcontrollers using online simulation environments. The Emotiv Insight headset
is used by the professor during the theoretical and practical hours of the Microcontrollers course.
The analysis performed on the brainwaves generated by the headset provides numerical values for
the mood, focus, stress, relaxation, engagement, excitement and interest levels of the professor.
The approaches used during teaching were inquiry-based learning, game-based learning and personalized
learning. In this way, professors can determine how to improve the connection with their students
based on the use of technology and virtual simulation platforms. The results of the test show that
the game-based learning was be best approach because students had to become problem solves and start
to use the software skills which they will need as future software engineers. The emphasis is put
on mastering the mindset by having to choose their actions and to experiment along the way. According
to their achievement, students receive experience points in a gamified environment. Professors
need to adjust to a new era of teaching and refine their practices and learning philosophy. They need
to be able to use virtual platforms with ease, as well as to engage with their students in order to determine
and satisfy their needs.

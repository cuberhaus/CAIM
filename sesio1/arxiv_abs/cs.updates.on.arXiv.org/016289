For job scheduling systems, where jobs require some amount of processing and then leave the system,
it is natural for each user to provide an estimate of their job's time requirement in order to aid the
scheduler. However, if there is no incentive mechanism for truthfulness, each user will be motivated
to provide estimates that give their job precedence in the schedule, so that the job completes as
early as possible. We examine how to make such scheduling systems incentive compatible, without
using monetary charges, under a natural queueing theory framework. In our setup, each user has an
estimate of their job's running time, but it is possible for this estimate to be incorrect. We examine
scheduling policies where if a job exceeds its estimate, it is with some probability "punished"
and re-scheduled after other jobs, to disincentivize underestimates of job times. However, because
user estimates may be incorrect (without any malicious intent), excessive punishment may incentivize
users to overestimate their job times, which leads to less efficient scheduling. We describe two
natural scheduling policies, BlindTrust and MeasuredTrust. We show that, for both of these policies,
given the parameters of the system, we can efficiently determine the set of punishment probabilities
that are incentive compatible, in that users are incentivized to provide their actual estimate
of the job time. Moreover, we prove for MeasuredTrust that in the limit as estimates converge to perfect
accuracy, the range of punishment probabilities that are incentive compatible converges to $[0,1]$.
Our formalism establishes a framework for studying further queue-based scheduling problems where
job time estimates from users are utilized, and the system needs to incentivize truthful reporting
of estimates.

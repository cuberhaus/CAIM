The SARS-CoV-2 virus has altered people's lives around the world, not only through the coronavirus
disease (COVID-19) it causes, but also through unprecedented non-pharmaceutical interventions
such as full-scale national lockdowns. Here we document population-wide shifts in dietary interests
in 12 countries in 2020, as revealed through timeseries of Google search volumes. We find that during
the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic there was an overall surge in food interest, larger and longer-lasting
than the surge during typical end-of-year holidays. The changes were strongly associated with
population-wide mobility patterns. Using a quasi-experimental regression discontinuity design,
we estimate that the shock of decreased mobility manifested as a drastic increase in interest in
consuming food at home, with interest in recipes and related entities increasing by 90% on average
across countries, and a corresponding decrease in consuming food outside of home, with the interest
in restaurants decreasing by 54% on average. We find that, in addition to the volume of searched foods,
the nature of searched foods also changed. The most drastic (up to threefold) increases occurred
for calorie-dense carbohydrate-based foods such as pastries, bakery products, bread, pies, and
desserts. In terms of the relative share (rather than absolute volume) of search interest, the most
prominent increases occurred for carbohydrate-based foods, whereas the share of interest in other
food categories on average remained robust. The observed shifts in dietary interests have the potential
to affect food consumption and health outcomes of people worldwide. These findings can inform governmental
and organizational decisions regarding measures to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic
on diet and nutrition, and thus on population health.

We consider point sets in the real projective plane $\mathbb{R}\mathcal{P}^2$ and explore variants
of classical extremal problems about planar point sets in this setting, with a main focus on Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres-type
problems. We provide asymptotically tight bounds for a variant of the Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres theorem
about point sets in convex position in $\mathbb{R}\mathcal{P}^2$, which was initiated by Harborth
and M\"oller in 1994. The notion of convex position in $\mathbb{R}\mathcal{P}^2$ agrees with the
definition of convex sets introduced by Steinitz in 1913. For $k \geq 3$, an (affine) $k$-hole in
a finite set $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ is a set of $k$ points from $S$ in convex position with no point
of $S$ in the interior of their convex hull. After introducing a new notion of $k$-holes for points
sets from $\mathbb{R}\mathcal{P}^2$, called projective $k$-holes, we find arbitrarily large
finite sets of points from $\mathbb{R}\mathcal{P}^2$ with no projective 8-holes, providing an
analogue of a classical result by Horton from 1983. We also prove that they contain only quadratically
many projective $k$-holes for $k \leq 7$. On the other hand, we show that the number of $k$-holes can
be substantially larger in $\mathbb{R}\mathcal{P}^2$ than in $\mathbb{R}^2$ by constructing,
for every $k \in \{3,\dots,6\}$, sets of $n$ points from $\mathbb{R}^2 \subset \mathbb{R}\mathcal{P}^2$
with $\Omega(n^{3-3/5k})$ projective $k$-holes and only $O(n^2)$ affine $k$-holes. Last but
not least, we prove several other results, for example about projective holes in random point sets
in $\mathbb{R}\mathcal{P}^2$ and about some algorithmic aspects. The study of extremal problems
about point sets in $\mathbb{R}\mathcal{P}^2$ opens a new area of research, which we support by
posing several open problems.

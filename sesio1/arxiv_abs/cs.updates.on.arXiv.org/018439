The Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) is an important metering device for smart grid. Like any other
Intelligent Electronic Device (IED), PMUs are prone to various types of cyberattacks. However,
one form of attack is unique to the PMU, the GPS-spoofing attack, where the time and /or the one second
pulse that enables time synchronization are modified and the measurements are computed using the
modified time reference. This article exploits the vulnerability of PMUs in their GPS time synchronization
signal. At first, the paper proposes an undetectable attack scheme which is able to bypass Bad Data
Detection (BDD) algorithms used with PMU data. The attack is applied by solving a convex optimization
criterion at regular time interval, so that after a specific time period the attack vector incurs
a significant change in the angle information delivered by the PMU. Secondly, the impact of phase
angle shift on the power flow calculation between two adjacent nodes of the transmission line is
analyzed with numerical experiment using IEEE 39 bus system. Moreover, the undetectibilities
of the proposed attack scheme against conventional $\chi^2$, Weighted Least Squares (WLS) and
Kalman Filtering test on the estimation residuals are investigated. Finally, the power flow results
with the proposed attack are compared with the results using a random GPS-spoofing attack. It can
be observed that using the proposed method enables the attacker with more control over the impact
against power grid than it is for the random attack. Furthermore, the proposed attack model has demonstrated
a very small probability of detection against each of the common detection methods. For WLS and KF,
the attack is detected only about 1-20$\%$ of the times, whereas for $\chi^2$-test, the attack goes
undetected 100 $\%$ of the times.

Contextual features are important data sources for building spatiotemporal crowd flow prediction
(STCFP) models. However, the difficulty of applying context lies in the unknown generalizability
of both contextual features (e.g., weather, holiday, and points-of-interests) and context modeling
techniques across different scenarios. In this paper, we develop an experimental platform composed
of large-scale spatiotemporal crowd flow data, contextual data, and state-of-the-art spatiotemporal
prediction models to conduct a comprehensive experimental study to quantitatively investigate
the generalizability of different contextual features and modeling techniques in three urban
crowd flow prediction scenarios (bike flow, metro passenger flow, and electric vehicle charging
demand). In particular, we develop a general taxonomy of context modeling techniques based on extensive
investigations in prevailing research. With three real-world datasets including millions of
records and rich context data, we have trained and tested hundreds of different models. Our results
reveal several important observations: (1) Using more contextual features may not always result
in better prediction with existing context modeling techniques; in particular, the contextual
feature combination of holiday and temporal position can provide more generalizable beneficial
information than other contextual feature combinations. (2) In context modeling techniques,
using a gated unit to incorporate raw contextual features into the state-of-the-art prediction
model has good generalizability. Besides, we also offer several suggestions about incorporating
contextual factors for practitioners who want to build STCFP applications. From our findings,
we call for future research efforts devoted to developing new context processing and modeling solutions
to fully exploit the potential of contextual features for STCFP.

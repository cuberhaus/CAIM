Fault diagnosis plays an essential role in reducing the maintenance costs of rotating machinery
manufacturing systems. In many real applications of fault detection and diagnosis, data tend to
be imbalanced, meaning that the number of samples for some fault classes is much less than the normal
data samples. At the same time, in an industrial condition, accelerometers encounter high levels
of disruptive signals and the collected samples turn out to be heavily noisy. As a consequence, many
traditional Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) frameworks get poor classification performances
when dealing with real-world circumstances. Three main solutions have been proposed in the literature
to cope with this problem: (1) the implementation of generative algorithms to increase the amount
of under-represented input samples, (2) the employment of a classifier being powerful to learn
from imbalanced and noisy data, (3) the development of an efficient data pre-processing including
feature extraction and data augmentation. This paper proposes a hybrid framework which uses the
three aforementioned components to achieve an effective signal-based FDD system for imbalanced
conditions. Specifically, it first extracts the fault features, using Fourier and wavelet transforms
to make full use of the signals. Then, it employs Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGAN)
to generate synthetic samples to populate the rare fault class and enhance the training set. Moreover,
to achieve a higher performance a novel combination of Convolutional Long Short-term Memory (CLSTM)
and Weighted Extreme Learning Machine (WELM) is proposed. To verify the effectiveness of the developed
framework, different datasets settings on different imbalance severities and noise degrees were
used. The comparative results demonstrate that in different scenarios GAN-CLSTM-ELM outperforms
the other state-of-the-art FDD frameworks.

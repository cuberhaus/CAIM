Rich interaction with the world requires extensive contact between robots and the objects in their
environment. Most such contacts involve significant compliance between the contacting surfaces
due to rubber pads or inflated grippers, soft objects to be manipulated, and soft surfaces for safe
human-robot interaction. Accurate simulation of these contacts is critical for meaningful sim-to-real
transfer. Compliant contact interactions generate contact surfaces of considerable extent,
over which contact forces are distributed with varying pressure. Finite element methods can capture
these effects but are too slow for most robotics applications. Consequently, in order to enable
real-time simulation rates, most current simulation tools model contact as occurring between
rigid bodies at a point or set of points using ad hoc methods to incorporate localized compliance.
However, point contact is non-smooth, hard to extend to arbitrary geometry, and often introduces
non-physical artifacts. Moreover, point contact misses important area-dependent phenomena
critical for robust manipulation, such as net contact moment and slip control. Pressure Field Contact
(PFC) was recently introduced as a method for detailed modeling of contact interface regions at
rates much faster than elasticity-theory models, while at the same time predicting essential trends
and capturing rich contact behavior. PFC was designed to work with coarsely-meshed objects while
preserving continuity to permit use with error-controlled integrators. Here we introduce a discrete
approximation of PFC suitable for use with velocity-level time steppers that enables execution
at real-time rates. We evaluate the accuracy and performance gains of our approach and demonstrate
its effectiveness in simulation of relevant manipulation tasks. The method is available in open
source as part of Drake's Hydroelastic Contact model.

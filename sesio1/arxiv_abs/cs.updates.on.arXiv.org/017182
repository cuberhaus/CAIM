Stress, anxiety, and nervousness are all high-risk health states in everyday life. Previously,
stress levels were determined by speaking with people and gaining insight into what they had experienced
recently or in the past. Typically, stress is caused by an incidence that occurred a long time ago,
but sometimes it is triggered by unknown factors. This is a challenging and complex task, but recent
research advances have provided numerous opportunities to automate it. The fundamental features
of most of these techniques are electro dermal activity (EDA) and heart rate values (HRV). We utilized
an accelerometer to measure body motions to solve this challenge. The proposed novel method employs
a test that measures a subject's electrocardiogram (ECG), galvanic skin values (GSV), HRV values,
and body movements in order to provide a low-cost and time-saving solution for detecting stress
lifestyle disease in modern times using cyber physical systems. This study provides a new hybrid
model for lifestyle disease classification that decreases execution time while picking the best
collection of characteristics and increases classification accuracy. The developed approach
is capable of dealing with the class imbalance problem by using WESAD (wearable stress and affect
dataset) dataset. The new model uses the Grid search (GS) method to select an optimized set of hyper
parameters, and it uses a combination of the Correlation coefficient based Recursive feature elimination
(CoC-RFE) method for optimal feature selection and gradient boosting as an estimator to classify
the dataset, which achieves high accuracy and helps to provide smart, accurate, and high-quality
healthcare systems. To demonstrate the validity and utility of the proposed methodology, its performance
is compared to those of other well-established machine learning models.

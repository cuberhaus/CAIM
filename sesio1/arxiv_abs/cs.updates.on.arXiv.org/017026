In step with the digitalization of transportation, we are witnessing a growing range of path-based
smart-city applications, e.g., travel-time estimation and travel path ranking. A temporal path~(TP)
that includes temporal information, e.g., departure time, into the path is of fundamental to enable
such applications. In this setting, it is essential to learn generic temporal path representations~(TPRs)
that consider spatial and temporal correlations simultaneously and that can be used in different
applications, i.e., downstream tasks. Existing methods fail to achieve the goal since (i) supervised
methods require large amounts of task-specific labels when training and thus fail to generalize
the obtained TPRs to other tasks; (ii) though unsupervised methods can learn generic representations,
they disregard the temporal aspect, leading to sub-optimal results. To contend with the limitations
of existing solutions, we propose a Weakly-Supervised Contrastive (WSC) learning model. We first
propose a temporal path encoder that encodes both the spatial and temporal information of a temporal
path into a TPR. To train the encoder, we introduce weak labels that are easy and inexpensive to obtain,
and are relevant to different tasks, e.g., temporal labels indicating peak vs. off-peak hour from
departure times. Based on the weak labels, we construct meaningful positive and negative temporal
path samples by considering both spatial and temporal information, which facilities training
the encoder using contrastive learning by pulling closer the positive samples' representations
while pushing away the negative samples' representations. To better guide the contrastive learning,
we propose a learning strategy based on Curriculum Learning such that the learning performs from
easy to hard training instances. Experiments studies verify the effectiveness of the proposed
method.

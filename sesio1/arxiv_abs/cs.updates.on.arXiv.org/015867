In drug discovery, identifying drug-target interactions (DTIs) via experimental approaches
is a tedious and expensive procedure. Computational methods efficiently predict DTIs and recommend
a small part of potential interacting pairs for further experimental confirmation, accelerating
the drug discovery process. Although it has been shown that fusing heterogeneous drug and target
similarities can improve the prediction ability, the existing similarity combination methods
ignore the interaction consistency for neighbour entities which is more crucial for the DTI prediction
model. Furthermore, area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR) that emphasizes the accuracy
of top-ranked pairs and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) that heavily
punishes the existence of low ranked interacting pairs are two widely used evaluation metrics in
DTI prediction. However, the two metrics are seldom considered as losses within existing DTI prediction
methods. This paper first proposes two matrix factorization (MF) methods that optimize AUPR and
AUC using convex surrogate losses respectively, and then develops an ensemble MF approach takes
advantage of the two area under the curve metrics by combining the two single metric based MF models.
Both three proposed approaches incorporate a novel local interaction consistency aware similarity
interaction method to generate fused drug and target similarities that preserve vital information
from the more reliable view. Experimental results over five datasets under different prediction
settings show that the proposed methods outperform various competitors in terms of the metric(s)
they optimize. In addition, the validation on the top ranked novel predictions confirms the ability
of our methods to discover potential new DTIs.

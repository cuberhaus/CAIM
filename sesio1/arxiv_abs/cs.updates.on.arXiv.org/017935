Future wireless systems are trending towards higher carrier frequencies that offer larger communication
bandwidth but necessitate the use of large antenna arrays. Existing signal processing techniques
for channel estimation do not scale well to this "high-dimensional" regime in terms of performance
and pilot overhead. Meanwhile, training deep learning based approaches for channel estimation
requires large labeled datasets mapping pilot measurements to clean channel realizations, which
can only be generated offline using simulated channels. In this paper, we develop a novel unsupervised
over-the-air (OTA) algorithm that utilizes noisy received pilot measurements to train a deep generative
model to output beamspace MIMO channel realizations. Our approach leverages Generative Adversarial
Networks (GAN), while using a conditional input to distinguish between Line-of-Sight (LOS) and
Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) channel realizations. We also present a federated implementation of
the OTA algorithm that distributes the GAN training over multiple users and greatly reduces the
user side computation. We then formulate channel estimation from a limited number of pilot measurements
as an inverse problem and reconstruct the channel by optimizing the input vector of the trained generative
model. Our proposed approach significantly outperforms Orthogonal Matching Pursuit on both LOS
and NLOS channel models, and EM-GM-AMP -- an Approximate Message Passing algorithm -- on LOS channel
models, while achieving comparable performance on NLOS channel models in terms of the normalized
channel reconstruction error. More importantly, our proposed framework has the potential to be
trained online using real noisy pilot measurements, is not restricted to a specific channel model
and can even be utilized for a federated OTA design of a dataset generator from noisy data.

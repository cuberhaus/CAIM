Distributed switched large-scale systems are composed by dynamically coupled subsystems, in
which interactions among subsystems vary over time according to an exogenous input signal named
switching signal. In this paper, we present a distributed robust switched model-based predictive
control (DSwMPC) to control such systems that are subject to local state and input constraints.
The proposed method guarantees stabilizing the origin of the whole closed-loop system and ensures
the constraints satisfaction in the presence of an unknown switching signal. In the distributed
model-based predictive control (DMPC) used in this work, by considering the interactions among
subsystems as an additive disturbance, the effect of the switch is reflected on the dynamic equation,
local, and consistency constraint sets of the nominal subsystems. In the DSwMPC, to compensate
the effect of switching signal which creates a time-varying network topology, a robust tube-based
switched model-based predictive control (RSwMPC) with switched robust control invariant (switchRCI)
set as the target set robust to unknown mode switching is used as local controller. The scheme performance
is assessed using three typical examples. In the first example, the switching times are unknown
in prior, but the next neighborhood sets are assumed to be known in prior. In the second and third cases,
both of them are supposed to be unknown in prior. The simulation results show that the input and state
constraints are satisfied by the proposed DSwMPC at all times. They also validate that the closed-loop
system converges to the origin. Also, a comparison of the DSwMPC with a centralized SwMPC (CSwMPC)
and a decentralized SwMPC (DeSwMPC) shows that the DSwMPC outperforms the DecSwMPC and also the
shapes of response curves under the CSwMPC are very similar to those obtained by the DSwMPC.

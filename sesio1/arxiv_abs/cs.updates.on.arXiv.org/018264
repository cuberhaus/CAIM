Price movement forecasting aims at predicting the future trends of financial assets based on the
current market conditions and other relevant information. Recently, machine learning(ML) methods
have become increasingly popular and achieved promising results for price movement forecasting
in both academia and industry. Most existing ML solutions formulate the forecasting problem as
a classification(to predict the direction) or a regression(to predict the return) problem over
the entire set of training data. However, due to the extremely low signal-to-noise ratio and stochastic
nature of financial data, good trading opportunities are extremely scarce. As a result, without
careful selection of potentially profitable samples, such ML methods are prone to capture the patterns
of noises instead of real signals. To address this issue, we propose a novel price movement forecasting
framework, called Locality-Aware Attention and Iterative Refinement Labeling(LARA), which
consists of two main components: 1)Locality-aware attention automatically extracts the potentially
profitable samples by attending to surrounding class-aware label information. Moreover, equipped
with metric learning techniques, locality-aware attention enjoys task-specific distance metrics
and distributes attention on potentially profitable samples in a more effective way. 2)Iterative
refinement labeling further iteratively refines the labels of noisy samples and then combines
the learned predictors to be robust to the unseen and noisy samples. In a number of experiments on
three real-world financial markets: ETFs, stocks, and cryptocurrencies, LARA achieves superior
performance compared with the traditional time-series analysis methods and a set of machine learning
based competitors on the Qlib platform. Extensive ablation studies and experiments also demonstrate
that LARA indeed captures more reliable trading opportunities.

Multi-task optimization (MTO) studies how to simultaneously solve multiple optimization problems
for the purpose of obtaining better performance on each problem. Over the past few years, evolutionary
MTO (EMTO) was proposed to handle MTO problems via evolutionary algorithms. So far, many EMTO algorithms
have been developed and demonstrated well performance on solving real-world problems. However,
there remain many works to do in adapting knowledge transfer to task relatedness in EMTO. Different
from the existing works, we develop a self-adaptive multi-task particle swarm optimization (SaMTPSO)
through the developed knowledge transfer adaptation strategy, the focus search strategy and the
knowledge incorporation strategy. In the knowledge transfer adaptation strategy, each task has
a knowledge source pool that consists of all knowledge sources. Each source (task) outputs knowledge
to the task. And knowledge transfer adapts to task relatedness via individuals' choice on different
sources of a pool, where the chosen probabilities for different sources are computed respectively
according to task's success rate in generating improved solutions via these sources. In the focus
search strategy, if there is no knowledge source benefit the optimization of a task, then all knowledge
sources in the task's pool are forbidden to be utilized except the task, which helps to improve the
performance of the proposed algorithm. Note that the task itself is as a knowledge source of its own.
In the knowledge incorporation strategy, two different forms are developed to help the SaMTPSO
explore and exploit the transferred knowledge from a chosen source, each leading to a version of
the SaMTPSO. Several experiments are conducted on two test suites. The results of the SaMTPSO are
comparing to that of 3 popular EMTO algorithms and a particle swarm algorithm, which demonstrates
the superiority of the SaMTPSO.

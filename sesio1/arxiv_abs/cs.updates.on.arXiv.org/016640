As a result of the identification of 'identity' and 'indistinguishability' and strong experimental
evidence for the presence of the associated Bose-Einstein statistics in human cognition and language,
we argued in previous work for an extension of the research domain of quantum cognition. In addition
to quantum complex vector spaces and quantum probability models, we showed that quantization itself,
with words as quanta, is relevant and potentially important to human cognition. In the present work,
we build on this result, and introduce a powerful radiation quantization scheme for human cognition.
We show that the lack of independence of the Bose-Einstein statistics compared to the Maxwell-Boltzmann
statistics can be explained by the presence of a 'meaning dynamics', which causes words to be attracted
to the same words. And so words clump together in the same states, a phenomenon well known for photons
in the early years of quantum mechanics, leading to fierce disagreements between Planck and Einstein.
Using a simple example, we introduce all the elements to get a better and detailed view of this 'meaning
dynamics', such as micro and macro states, and Maxwell-Boltzmann, Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac
numbers and weights, and compare this example and its graphs, with the radiation quantization scheme
of a Winnie the Pooh story, also with its graphs. By connecting a concept directly to human experience,
we show that entanglement is a necessity for preserving the 'meaning dynamics' we identified, and
it becomes clear in what way Fermi-Dirac addresses human memory. Within the human mind, as a crucial
aspect of memory, in spaces with internal parameters, identical words can nevertheless be assigned
different states and hence realize locally and contextually the necessary distinctiveness, structured
by a Pauli exclusion principle, for human thought to thrive.

Thin-cap fibroatheroma (TCFA) and plaque rupture have been recognized as the most frequent risk
factor for thrombosis and acute coronary syndrome. Intravascular optical coherence tomography
(IVOCT) can identify TCFA and assess cap thickness, which provides an opportunity to assess plaque
vulnerability. We developed an automated method that can detect lipidous plaque and assess fibrous
cap thickness in IVOCT images. This study analyzed a total of 4,360 IVOCT image frames of 77 lesions
among 41 patients. To improve segmentation performance, preprocessing included lumen segmentation,
pixel-shifting, and noise filtering on the raw polar (r, theta) IVOCT images. We used the DeepLab-v3
plus deep learning model to classify lipidous plaque pixels. After lipid detection, we automatically
detected the outer border of the fibrous cap using a special dynamic programming algorithm and assessed
the cap thickness. Our method provided excellent discriminability of lipid plaque with a sensitivity
of 85.8% and A-line Dice coefficient of 0.837. By comparing lipid angle measurements between two
analysts following editing of our automated software, we found good agreement by Bland-Altman
analysis (difference 6.7+/-17 degree; mean 196 degree). Our method accurately detected the fibrous
cap from the detected lipid plaque. Automated analysis required a significant modification for
only 5.5% frames. Furthermore, our method showed a good agreement of fibrous cap thickness between
two analysts with Bland-Altman analysis (4.2+/-14.6 micron; mean 175 micron), indicating little
bias between users and good reproducibility of the measurement. We developed a fully automated
method for fibrous cap quantification in IVOCT images, resulting in good agreement with determinations
by analysts. The method has great potential to enable highly automated, repeatable, and comprehensive
evaluations of TCFAs.

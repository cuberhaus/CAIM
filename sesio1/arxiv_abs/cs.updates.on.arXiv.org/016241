There remains an open question about the usefulness and the interpretation of Machine learning
(MLE) approaches for discrimination of spatial patterns of brain images between samples or activation
states. In the last few decades, these approaches have limited their operation to feature extraction
and linear classification tasks for between-group inference. In this context, statistical inference
is assessed by randomly permuting image labels or by the use of random effect models that consider
between-subject variability. These multivariate MLE-based statistical pipelines, whilst potentially
more effective for detecting activations than hypotheses-driven methods, have lost their mathematical
elegance, ease of interpretation, and spatial localization of the ubiquitous General linear Model
(GLM). Recently, the estimation of the conventional GLM has been demonstrated to be connected to
an univariate classification task when the design matrix is expressed as a binary indicator matrix.
In this paper we explore the complete connection between the univariate GLM and MLE \emph{regressions}.
To this purpose we derive a refined statistical test with the GLM based on the parameters obtained
by a linear Support Vector Regression (SVR) in the \emph{inverse} problem (SVR-iGLM). Subsequently,
random field theory (RFT) is employed for assessing statistical significance following a conventional
GLM benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate how parameter estimations derived from each
model (mainly GLM and SVR) result in different experimental design estimates that are significantly
related to the predefined functional task. Moreover, using real data from a multisite initiative
the proposed MLE-based inference demonstrates statistical power and the control of false positives,
outperforming the regular GLM.

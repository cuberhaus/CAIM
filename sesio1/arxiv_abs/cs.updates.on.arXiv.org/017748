Current changes in society and the education system, cumulated with the accelerated development
of new technologies, entail inherent changes in the educational process. Numerous studies have
shown that the pandemic has forced a rapid transformation of higher education. Thus, if before the
pandemic digital technologies were used to supplement the learning process, now they are the main
means of learning delivery. In addition, as previous research has shown, new pedagogical strategies
and new ways of teaching and learning are needed for the current generation of students, the so-called
Generation Z, to acquire new knowledge and develop new skills. In this necessary evolution of the
educational process, a possible solution to increase the effectiveness of the learning process
for the Generation Z students is to use microlearning to extend the traditional ways of learning.
Many studies have shown that microlearning, based on how today's students learn and memorize, facilitates
learning. In recent years there has been a growing trend in their use of microlearning in the educational
process. But, in order to be effective, this approach must allow the individual knowledge building,
by indicating a guiding direction of the optimal path to achieve the proposed objectives. We propose
a system for personalized learning using microlearning, which provides support and guidance to
students based on their individual needs, in order to increase their interest in learning, but also
to compensate for various deficiencies in their educational background. We also present a case
study from the higher education sector. Feedback from students and data collected during the semester
as a result of the students' behavioural analysis and their real learning motivations will be used
to improve the proposed system.

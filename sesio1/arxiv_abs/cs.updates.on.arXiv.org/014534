This paper proposes a novel secure live virtual machine migration framework by using a virtual trusted
platform module instance to improve the integrity of the migration process from one virtual machine
to another on the same platform. The proposed framework, called Koror\=a, is designed and developed
on a public infrastructure-as-a-service cloud-computing environment and runs concurrently
on the same hardware components (Input/Output, Central Processing Unit, Memory) and the same hypervisor
(Xen); however, a combination of parameters needs to be evaluated before implementing Koror\=a.
The implementation of Koror\=a is not practically feasible in traditional distributed computing
environments. It requires fixed resources with high-performance capabilities, connected through
a high-speed, reliable network. The following research objectives were determined to identify
the integrity features of live virtual machine migration in the cloud system: To understand the
security issues associated with cloud computing, virtual trusted platform modules, virtualization,
live virtual machine migration, and hypervisors; To identify the requirements for the proposed
framework, including those related to live VM migration among different hypervisors; To design
and validate the model, processes, and architectural features of the proposed framework; To propose
and implement an end-to-end security architectural blueprint for cloud environments, providing
an integrated view of protection mechanisms, and then to validate the proposed framework to improve
the integrity of live VM migration. This is followed by a comprehensive review of the evaluation
system architecture and the proposed framework state machine. The overarching aim of this paper,
therefore, is to present a detailed analysis of the cloud computing security problem, from the perspective
of cloud architectures and the cloud... [Abridged]

We give a proof-theoretic as well as a semantic characterization of a logic in the signature with
conjunction, disjunction, negation, and the universal and existential quantifiers that we suggest
has a certain fundamental status. We present a Fitch-style natural deduction system for the logic
that contains only the introduction and elimination rules for the logical constants. From this
starting point, if one adds the rule that Fitch called Reiteration, one obtains a proof system for
intuitionistic logic in the given signature; if instead of adding Reiteration, one adds the rule
of Reductio ad Absurdum, one obtains a proof system for orthologic; by adding both Reiteration and
Reductio, one obtains a proof system for classical logic. Arguably neither Reiteration nor Reductio
is as intimately related to the meaning of the connectives as the introduction and elimination rules
are, so the base logic we identify serves as a more fundamental starting point and common ground between
proponents of intuitionistic logic, orthologic, and classical logic. The algebraic semantics
for the logic we motivate proof-theoretically is based on bounded lattices equipped with what has
been called a weak pseudocomplementation. We show that such lattice expansions are representable
using a set together with a reflexive binary relation satisfying a simple first-order condition,
which yields an elegant relational semantics for the logic. This builds on our previous study of
representations of lattices with negations, which we extend and specialize for several types of
negation in addition to weak pseudocomplementation; in an appendix, we further extend this representation
to lattices with implications. Finally, we discuss adding to our logic a conditional obeying only
introduction and elimination rules, interpreted as a modality using a family of accessibility
relations.

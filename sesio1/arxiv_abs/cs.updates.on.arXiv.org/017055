In transportation networks, users typically choose routes in a decentralized and self-interested
manner to minimize their individual travel costs, which, in practice, often results in inefficient
overall outcomes for society. As a result, there has been a growing interest in designing road tolling
schemes to cope with these efficiency losses and steer users toward a system-efficient traffic
pattern. However, the efficacy of road tolling schemes often relies on having access to complete
information on users' trip attributes, such as their origin-destination (O-D) travel information
and their values of time, which may not be available in practice. Motivated by this practical consideration,
we propose an online learning approach to set tolls in a traffic network to drive heterogeneous users
with different values of time toward a system-efficient traffic pattern. In particular, we develop
a simple yet effective algorithm that adjusts tolls at each time period solely based on the observed
aggregate flows on the roads of the network without relying on any additional trip attributes of
users, thereby preserving user privacy. In the setting where the O-D pairs and values of time of users
are drawn i.i.d. at each period, we show that our approach obtains an expected regret and road capacity
violation of $O(\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ is the number of periods over which tolls are updated. Our
regret guarantee is relative to an offline oracle that has complete information on users' trip attributes.
We further establish a $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ lower bound on the regret of any algorithm, which establishes
that our algorithm is optimal up to constants. Finally, we demonstrate the superior performance
of our approach relative to several benchmarks on a real-world transportation network, thereby
highlighting its practical applicability.

Extreme pricing anomalies may occur unexpectedly without a trivial cause, and equity traders typically
experience a meticulous process to source disparate information and analyze its reliability before
integrating it into the trusted knowledge base. We introduce DeepTrust, a reliable financial knowledge
retrieval framework on Twitter to explain extreme price moves at speed, while ensuring data veracity
using state-of-the-art NLP techniques. Our proposed framework consists of three modules, specialized
for anomaly detection, information retrieval and reliability assessment. The workflow starts
with identifying anomalous asset price changes using machine learning models trained with historical
pricing data, and retrieving correlated unstructured data from Twitter using enhanced queries
with dynamic search conditions. DeepTrust extrapolates information reliability from tweet features,
traces of generative language model, argumentation structure, subjectivity and sentiment signals,
and refine a concise collection of credible tweets for market insights. The framework is evaluated
on two self-annotated financial anomalies, i.e., Twitter and Facebook stock price on 29 and 30 April
2021. The optimal setup outperforms the baseline classifier by 7.75% and 15.77% on F0.5-scores,
and 10.55% and 18.88% on precision, respectively, proving its capability in screening unreliable
information precisely. At the same time, information retrieval and reliability assessment modules
are analyzed individually on their effectiveness and causes of limitations, with identified subjective
and objective factors that influence the performance. As a collaborative project with Refinitiv,
this framework paves a promising path towards building a scalable commercial solution that assists
traders to reach investment decisions on pricing anomalies with authenticated knowledge from
social media platforms in real-time.

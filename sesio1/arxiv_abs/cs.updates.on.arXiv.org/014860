Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and registers the highest number of deaths for
women with cancer. Recent advancements in diagnostic activities combined with large-scale screening
policies have significantly lowered the mortality rates for breast cancer patients. However,
the manual inspection of tissue slides by the pathologists is cumbersome, time-consuming, and
is subject to significant inter- and intra-observer variability. Recently, the advent of whole-slide
scanning systems have empowered the rapid digitization of pathology slides, and enabled to develop
digital workflows. These advances further enable to leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) to
assist, automate, and augment pathological diagnosis. But the AI techniques, especially Deep
Learning (DL), require a large amount of high-quality annotated data to learn from. Constructing
such task-specific datasets poses several challenges, such as, data-acquisition level constrains,
time-consuming and expensive annotations, and anonymization of private information. In this
paper, we introduce the BReAst Carcinoma Subtyping (BRACS) dataset, a large cohort of annotated
Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E)-stained images to facilitate the characterization of breast lesions.
BRACS contains 547 Whole-Slide Images (WSIs), and 4539 Regions of Interest (ROIs) extracted from
the WSIs. Each WSI, and respective ROIs, are annotated by the consensus of three board-certified
pathologists into different lesion categories. Specifically, BRACS includes three lesion types,
i.e., benign, malignant and atypical, which are further subtyped into seven categories. It is,
to the best of our knowledge, the largest annotated dataset for breast cancer subtyping both at WSI-
and ROI-level. Further, by including the understudied atypical lesions, BRACS offers an unique
opportunity for leveraging AI to better understand their characteristics.

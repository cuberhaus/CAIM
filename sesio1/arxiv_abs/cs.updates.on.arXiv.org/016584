With increasing physical threats in recent years targeted at critical infrastructures, it is crucial
to establish a reliable threat monitoring system integrating video surveillance and digital sensors
based on cutting-edge technologies. A physical threat monitoring solution unifying the floorplan,
cameras, and sensors for smart buildings has been set up in our study. Computer vision and deep learning
models are used for video streams analysis. When a threat is detected by a rule engine based on the
real-time analysis results combining with feedback from related digital sensors, an alert is sent
to the Video Management System so that human operators can take further action. A physical threat
monitoring system typically needs to address complex and even destructive incidents, such as fire,
which is unrealistic to simulate in real life. Restrictions imposed during the Covid-19 pandemic
and privacy concerns have added to the challenges. Our study utilises the Unreal Engine to simulate
some typical suspicious and intrusion scenes with photorealistic qualities in the context of a
virtual building. Add-on programs are implemented to transfer the video stream from virtual PTZ
cameras to the Milestone Video Management System and enable users to control those cameras from
the graphic client application. Virtual sensors such as fire alarms, temperature sensors and door
access controls are implemented similarly, fulfilling the same programmatic VMS interface as
real-life sensors. Thanks to this simulation system's extensibility and repeatability, we have
consolidated this unified physical threat monitoring system and verified its effectiveness and
user-friendliness. Both the simulated Unreal scenes and the software add-ons developed during
this study are highly modulated and thereby are ready for reuse in future projects in this area.

In this paper, we present an algorithm which lies in the domain of task allocation for a set of static
autonomous radars with rotating antennas. It allows a set of radars to allocate in a fully decentralized
way a set of active tracking tasks according to their location, considering that a target can be tracked
by several radars, in order to improve accuracy with which the target is tracked. The allocation
algorithm proceeds through a collaborative and fully decentralized auction protocol, using a
collaborative auction protocol (Consensus Based Bundle Auction algorithm). Our algorithm is
based on a double use of our allocation protocol among the radars. The latter begin by allocating
targets, then launch a second round of allocation if theyhave resources left, in order to improve
accuracy on targets already tracked. Our algorithm is also able to adapt to dynamism, i.e. to take
into account the fact that the targets are moving and that the radar(s) most suitable for Tracking
them changes as the mission progresses. To do this, the algorithm is restarted on a regular basis,
to ensure that a bid made by a radar can decrease when the target moves away from it. Since our algorithm
is based on collaborative auctions, it does not plan the following rounds, assuming that the targets
are not predictable enough for this. Our algorithm is however based on radars capable of anticipating
the positions of short-term targets, thanks to a Kalman filter. The algorithm will be illustrated
based on a multi-radar tracking scenario where the radars, autonomous, must follow a set of targets
in order to reduce the position uncertainty of the targets. Standby aspects will not be considered
in this scenario. It is assumed that the radars can pick up targets in active pursuit, with an area
ofuncertainty corresponding to their distance.

Automated design synthesis has the potential to revolutionize the modern engineering design process
and improve access to highly optimized and customized products across countless industries. Successfully
adapting generative Machine Learning to design engineering may enable such automated design synthesis
and is a research subject of great importance. We present a review and analysis of Deep Generative
Machine Learning models in engineering design. Deep Generative Models (DGMs) typically leverage
deep networks to learn from an input dataset and synthesize new designs. Recently, DGMs such as feedforward
Neural Networks (NNs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs),
and certain Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) frameworks have shown promising results in design
applications like structural optimization, materials design, and shape synthesis. The prevalence
of DGMs in engineering design has skyrocketed since 2016. Anticipating continued growth, we conduct
a review of recent advances to benefit researchers interested in DGMs for design. We structure our
review as an exposition of the algorithms, datasets, representation methods, and applications
commonly used in the current literature. In particular, we discuss key works that have introduced
new techniques and methods in DGMs, successfully applied DGMs to a design-related domain, or directly
supported the development of DGMs through datasets or auxiliary methods. We further identify key
challenges and limitations currently seen in DGMs across design fields, such as design creativity,
handling constraints and objectives, and modeling both form and functional performance simultaneously.
In our discussion, we identify possible solution pathways as key areas on which to target future
work.

Industrial Product-Service Systems (IPSS) denote a service-oriented (SO) way of providing access
to CPS capabilities. The design of such systems bears high risk due to uncertainty in requirements
related to service function and behavior, operation environments, and evolving customer needs.
Such risks and uncertainties are well known in the IT sector, where DevOps principles ensure continuous
system improvement through reliable and frequent delivery processes. A modular and SO system architecture
complements these processes to facilitate IT system adaptation and evolution. This work proposes
a method to use and extend the Digital Twins (DTs) of IPSS assets for enabling the continuous optimization
of CPS service delivery and the latter's adaptation to changing needs and environments. This reduces
uncertainty during design and operations by assuring IPSS integrity and availability, especially
for design and service adaptations at CPS runtime. The method builds on transferring IT DevOps principles
to DT-enabled CPS IPSS. The chosen design approach integrates, reuses, and aligns the DT processing
and communication resources with DevOps requirements derived from literature. We use these requirements
to propose a DT-enabled self-adaptive CPS model, which guides the realization of DT-enabled DevOps
in CPS IPSS. We further propose detailed design models for operation-critical DTs that integrate
CPS closed-loop control and architecture-based CPS adaptation. This integrated approach enables
the implementation of A/B testing as a use case and central concept to enable CPS IPSS service adaptation
and reconfiguration. The self-adaptive CPS model and DT design concept have been validated in an
evaluation environment for operation-critical CPS IPSS. The demonstrator achieved sub-millisecond
cycle times during service A/B testing at runtime without causing CPS operation interferences
and downtime.

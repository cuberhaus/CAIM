To achieve minimum DNA input and tumor purity requirements for next-generation sequencing (NGS),
pathologists visually estimate macrodissection and slide count decisions. Misestimation may
cause tissue waste and increased laboratory costs. We developed an AI-augmented smart pathology
review system (SmartPath) to empower pathologists with quantitative metrics for determining
tissue extraction parameters. Using digitized H&E-stained FFPE slides as inputs, SmartPath segments
tumors, extracts cell-based features, and suggests a macrodissection areas. To predict DNA yield
per slide, the extracted features are correlated with known DNA yields. Then, a pathologist-defined
target yield divided by the predicted DNA yield/slide gives the number of slides to scrape. Following
model development, an internal validation trial was conducted within the Tempus Labs molecular
sequencing laboratory. We evaluated our system on 501 clinical colorectal cancer slides, where
half received SmartPath-augmented review and half traditional pathologist review. The SmartPath
cohort had 25% more DNA yields within a desired target range of 100-2000ng. The SmartPath system
recommended fewer slides to scrape for large tissue sections, saving tissue in these cases. Conversely,
SmartPath recommended more slides to scrape for samples with scant tissue sections, helping prevent
costly re-extraction due to insufficient extraction yield. A statistical analysis was performed
to measure the impact of covariates on the results, offering insights on how to improve future applications
of SmartPath. Overall, the study demonstrated that AI-augmented histopathologic review using
SmartPath could decrease tissue waste, sequencing time, and laboratory costs by optimizing DNA
yields and tumor purity.

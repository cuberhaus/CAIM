Literature and intuition suggest that a developer's intelligence and personality have an impact
on their performance in comprehending source code. Researchers made this suggestion in the past
when discussing threats to validity of their study results. However, the lack of studies investigating
the relationship of intelligence and personality to performance in code comprehension makes scientifically
sound reasoning about their influence difficult. We conduct the first empirical evaluation, a
correlational study with undergraduates, to investigate the correlation of intelligence and
personality with performance in code comprehension, that is with correctness in answering comprehension
questions on code snippets. We found that personality traits are unlikely to impact code comprehension
performance, at least not considered in isolation. Conscientiousness, in combination with other
factors, however, explains some of the variance in code comprehension performance. For intelligence,
significant small to moderate positive effects on code comprehension performance were found for
three of four factors measured, i.e., fluid intelligence, visual perception, and cognitive speed.
Crystallized intelligence has a positive but statistically insignificant effect on code comprehension
performance. According to our results, several intelligence facets as well as the personality
trait conscientiousness are potential confounders that should not be neglected in code comprehension
studies of individual performance and should be controlled for via an appropriate study design.
We call for the conduct of further studies on the relationship between intelligence and personality
with code comprehension, in part because code comprehension involves more facets than we can measure
in a single study and because our regression model explains only a small portion of the variance in
code comprehension performance.

Active volcanoes are globally distributed and pose societal risks at multiple geographic scales,
ranging from local hazards to regional/international disruptions. Many volcanoes do not have
continuous ground monitoring networks; meaning that satellite observations provide the only
record of volcanic behavior and unrest. Among these remote sensing observations, thermal imagery
is inspected daily by volcanic observatories for examining the early signs, onset, and evolution
of eruptive activity. However, thermal scenes are often obstructed by clouds, meaning that forecasts
must be made off image sequences whose scenes are only usable intermittently through time. Here,
we explore forecasting this thermal data stream from a deep learning perspective using existing
architectures that model sequences with varying spatiotemporal considerations. Additionally,
we propose and evaluate new architectures that explicitly model intermittent image sequences.
Using ASTER Kinetic Surface Temperature data for $9$ volcanoes between $1999$ and $2020$, we found
that a proposed architecture (ConvLSTM + Time-LSTM + U-Net) forecasts volcanic temperature imagery
with the lowest RMSE ($4.164^{\circ}$C, other methods: $4.217-5.291^{\circ}$C). Additionally,
we examined performance on multiple time series derived from the thermal imagery and the effect
of training with data from singular volcanoes. Ultimately, we found that models with the lowest
RMSE on forecasting imagery did not possess the lowest RMSE on recreating time series derived from
that imagery and that training with individual volcanoes generally worsened performance relative
to a multi-volcano data set. This work highlights the potential of data-driven deep learning models
for volcanic unrest forecasting while revealing the need for carefully constructed optimization
targets.

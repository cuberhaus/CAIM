Stochastic dynamic matching problems have recently drawn attention in the stochastic-modeling
community due to their numerous applications, ranging from supply-chain management to kidney
exchange programs. In this paper, we consider a matching problem in which items of different classes
arrive according to independent Poisson processes. Unmatched items are stored in a queue, and compatibility
constraints are described by a simple graph on the classes, so that two items can be matched if their
classes are neighbors in the graph. We analyze the efficiency of matching policies, not only in terms
of system stability, but also in terms of matching rates between different classes. Our results
rely on the observation that, under any stable policy, the matching rates satisfy a conservation
equation that equates the arrival and departure rates of each item class. Our main contributions
are threefold. We first introduce a mapping between the dimension of the solution set of this conservation
equation, the structure of the compatibility graph, and the existence of a stable policy. In particular,
this allows us to derive a necessary and sufficient stability condition that is verifiable in polynomial
time. Secondly, we describe the convex polytope of non-negative solutions of the conservation
equation. When this polytope is reduced to a single point, we give a closed-form expression of the
solution; in general, we characterize the vertices of this polytope using again the graph structure.
Lastly, we study the parts of the polytope that can be achieved by a stable policy. We show that greedy
policies are limited to the interior of the polytope, with a strict inclusion in general. In contrast,
non-greedy policies can reach any point of the interior of this polytope, and also reach the boundary
of the polytope depending on a simple condition on the vertices.

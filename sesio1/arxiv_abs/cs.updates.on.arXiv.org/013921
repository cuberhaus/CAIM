This work mainly investigates the mean-square stability and stabilizability for a single-input
single-output networked linear feedback system. The control signal in the networked system is
transmitted over an unreliable channel. In this unreliable channel, the data transmission times,
referred to as channel induced delays, are random values and the transmitted data could also be dropout
with certain probability. The channel induced delays and packet dropout are modeled by an independent
and identically distributed stochastic process with a fixed probability mass function. At the
channel terminal, a linear combination of data received at one sampling time is applied to the plant
of the networked feedback system as a new control signal. To describe the uncertainty in the channel,
a concept so called frequency response of variation is introduced for the unreliable channel. With
the given linear receiving strategy, a mean-square stability criterion is established in terms
of the frequency response of variation of the unreliable channel for the networked feedback system.
It is shown by this criterion that the mean-square stability is determined by the interaction between
the frequency response of variation and the nominal feedback system. The role played by the random
channel induced delays is the same as that played by a colored additive noise in an additive noise
channel with a signal-to-noise ratio constraint. Moreover, the mean-square input-output stabilizability
via output feedback is studied for the networked system. When the plant in the networked feedback
system is minimum phase, an analytic necessary and sufficient condition is presented for its mean-square
input-output stabilizability. It turns out that the stabilizability is only determined by the
interaction between the frequency response of variation of the channel and unstable poles of the
plant.

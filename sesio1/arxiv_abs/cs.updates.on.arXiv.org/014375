The standard ML methodology assumes that the test samples are derived from a set of pre-observed
classes used in the training phase. Where the model extracts and learns useful patterns to detect
new data samples belonging to the same data classes. However, in certain applications such as Network
Intrusion Detection Systems, it is challenging to obtain data samples for all attack classes that
the model will most likely observe in production. ML-based NIDSs face new attack traffic known as
zero-day attacks, that are not used in the training of the learning models due to their non-existence
at the time. In this paper, a zero-shot learning methodology has been proposed to evaluate the ML
model performance in the detection of zero-day attack scenarios. In the attribute learning stage,
the ML models map the network data features to distinguish semantic attributes from known attack
(seen) classes. In the inference stage, the models are evaluated in the detection of zero-day attack
(unseen) classes by constructing the relationships between known attacks and zero-day attacks.
A new metric is defined as Zero-day Detection Rate, which measures the effectiveness of the learning
model in the inference stage. The results demonstrate that while the majority of the attack classes
do not represent significant risks to organisations adopting an ML-based NIDS in a zero-day attack
scenario. However, for certain attack groups identified in this paper, such systems are not effective
in applying the learnt attributes of attack behaviour to detect them as malicious. Further Analysis
was conducted using the Wasserstein Distance technique to measure how different such attacks are
from other attack types used in the training of the ML model. The results demonstrate that sophisticated
attacks with a low zero-day detection rate have a significantly distinct feature distribution
compared to the other attack classes.

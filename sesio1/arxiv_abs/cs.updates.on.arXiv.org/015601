The sense of touch plays a key role in enabling humans to understand and interact with surrounding
environments. For robots, tactile sensing is also irreplaceable. While interacting with objects,
tactile sensing provides useful information for the robot to understand the object, such as distributed
pressure, temperature, vibrations and texture. During robot grasping, vision is often occluded
by its end-effectors, whereas tactile sensing can measure areas that are not accessible by vision.
In the past decades, a number of tactile sensors have been developed for robots and used for different
robotic tasks. In this chapter, we focus on the use of tactile sensing for robotic grasping and investigate
the recent trends in tactile perception of object properties. We first discuss works on tactile
perception of three important object properties in grasping, i.e., shape, pose and material properties.
We then review the recent development in grasping stability prediction with tactile sensing. Among
these works, we identify the requirement for coordinating vision and tactile sensing in the robotic
grasping. To demonstrate the use of tactile sensing to improve the visual perception, our recent
development of vision-guided tactile perception for crack reconstruction is presented. In the
proposed framework, the large receptive field of camera vision is first leveraged to achieve a quick
search of candidate regions containing cracks, a high-resolution optical tactile sensor is then
used to examine these candidate regions and reconstruct a refined crack shape. The experiments
show that our proposed method can achieve a significant reduction of mean distance error from 0.82
mm to 0.24 mm for crack reconstruction. Finally, we conclude this chapter with a discussion of open
issues and future directions for applying tactile sensing in robotic tasks.

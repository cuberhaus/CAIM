We study the allocative challenges that governmental and nonprofit organizations face when tasked
with equitable and efficient rationing of a social good among agents whose needs (demands) realize
sequentially and are possibly correlated. As one example, early in the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal
Emergency Management Agency faced overwhelming, temporally scattered, a priori uncertain, and
correlated demands for medical supplies from different states. In such contexts, social planners
aim to maximize the minimum fill rate across sequentially arriving agents, where each agent's fill
rate is determined by an irrevocable, one-time allocation. For an arbitrarily correlated sequence
of demands, we establish upper bounds on the expected minimum fill rate (ex-post fairness) and the
minimum expected fill rate (ex-ante fairness) achievable by any policy. Our upper bounds are parameterized
by the number of agents and the expected demand-to-supply ratio, yet we design a simple adaptive
policy called projected proportional allocation (PPA) that simultaneously achieves matching
lower bounds for both objectives (ex-post and ex-ante fairness), for any set of parameters. Our
PPA policy is transparent and easy to implement, as it does not rely on distributional information
beyond the first conditional moments. Despite its simplicity, we demonstrate that the PPA policy
provides significant improvement over the canonical class of non-adaptive target-fill-rate
policies. We complement our theoretical developments with a numerical study motivated by the rationing
of COVID-19 medical supplies based on a standard SEIR modeling approach that is commonly used to
forecast pandemic trajectories. In such a setting, our PPA policy significantly outperforms its
theoretical guarantee as well as the optimal target-fill-rate policy.

Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is an emerging technology that is under investigation
for different applications in wireless communications. RISs are often analyzed and optimized
by considering simplified electromagnetic reradiation models. In this chapter, we aim to study
the impact of realistic reradiation models for RISs as a function of the sub-wavelength inter-distance
between nearby elements of the RIS, the quantization levels of the reflection coefficients, the
interplay between the amplitude and phase of the reflection coefficients, and the presence of electromagnetic
interference. We consider both case studies in which the users may be located in the far-field and
near-field regions of an RIS. Our study shows that, due to design constraints, such as the need of
using quantized reflection coefficients or the inherent interplay between the phase and the amplitude
of the reflection coefficients, an RIS may reradiate power towards unwanted directions that depend
on the intended and interfering electromagnetic waves. Therefore, it is in general important to
optimize an RIS by considering the entire reradiation pattern by design to maximize the reradiated
power towards the desired directions of reradiation while keeping the power reradiated towards
other unwanted directions at a low level. Our study shows that a 2-bit digitally controllable RIS
with an almost constant reflection amplitude as a function of the applied phase shift, and whose
scattering elements have a size and an inter-distance between (1/8)th and (1/4)th of the signal
wavelength may be a good tradeoff between performance, implementation complexity and cost. However,
the presented results are preliminary and pave the way for further research into the performance
of RISs based on accurate and realistic electromagnetic reradiation models.

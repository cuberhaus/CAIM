Particle tracking in biological imaging is concerned with reconstructing the trajectories, locations,
or velocities of the targeting particles. The standard approach of particle tracking consists
of two steps: first reconstructing statically the source locations in each time step, and second
applying tracking techniques to obtain the trajectories and velocities. In contrast, the dynamic
reconstruction seeks to simultaneously recover the source locations and velocities from all frames,
which enjoys certain advantages. In this paper, we provide a rigorous mathematical analysis for
the resolution limit of reconstructing source number, locations, and velocities by general dynamical
reconstruction in particle tracking problems, by which we demonstrate the possibility of achieving
super-resolution for the dynamic reconstruction. We show that when the location-velocity pairs
of the particles are separated beyond certain distances (the resolution limits), the number of
particles and the location-velocity pair can be stably recovered. The resolution limits are related
to the cut-off frequency of the imaging system, signal-to-noise ratio, and the sparsity of the source.
By these estimates, we also derive a stability result for a sparsity-promoting dynamic reconstruction.
In addition, we further show that the reconstruction of velocities has a better resolution limit
which improves constantly as the particles moving. This result is derived by an observation that
the inherent cut-off frequency for the velocity recovery can be viewed as the total observation
time multiplies the cut-off frequency of the imaging system, which may lead to a better resolution
limit as compared to the one for each diffraction-limited frame. It is anticipated that this observation
can inspire new reconstruction algorithms that improve the resolution of particle tracking in
practice.

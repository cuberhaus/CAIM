We prove that a random $d$-regular graph, with high probability, is a cut sparsifier of the clique
with approximation error at most $\left(2\sqrt{\frac 2 \pi} + o_{n,d}(1)\right)/\sqrt d$, where
$2\sqrt{\frac 2 \pi} = 1.595\ldots$ and $o_{n,d}(1)$ denotes an error term that depends on $n$ and
$d$ and goes to zero if we first take the limit $n\rightarrow \infty$ and then the limit $d \rightarrow
\infty$. This is established by analyzing linear-size cuts using techniques of Jagannath and Sen
derived from ideas in statistical physics, and analyzing small cuts via martingale inequalities.
We also prove new lower bounds on spectral sparsification of the clique. If $G$ is a spectral sparsifier
of the clique and $G$ has average degree $d$, we prove that the approximation error is at least the
"Ramanujan bound'' $(2-o_{n,d}(1))/\sqrt d$, which is met by $d$-regular Ramanujan graphs, provided
that either the weighted adjacency matrix of $G$ is a (multiple of) a doubly stochastic matrix, or
that $G$ satisfies a certain high "odd pseudo-girth" property. The first case can be seen as an "Alon-Boppana
theorem for symmetric doubly stochastic matrices," showing that a symmetric doubly stochastic
matrix with $dn$ non-zero entries has a non-trivial eigenvalue of magnitude at least $(2-o_{n,d}(1))/\sqrt
d$; the second case generalizes a lower bound of Srivastava and Trevisan, which requires a large
girth assumption. Together, these results imply a separation between spectral sparsification
and cut sparsification. If $G$ is a random $\log n$-regular graph on $n$ vertices, we show that, with
high probability, $G$ admits a (weighted subgraph) cut sparsifier of average degree $d$ and approximation
error at most $(1.595\ldots + o_{n,d}(1))/\sqrt d$, while every (weighted subgraph) spectral
sparsifier of $G$ having average degree $d$ has approximation error at least $(2-o_{n,d}(1))/\sqrt
d$.

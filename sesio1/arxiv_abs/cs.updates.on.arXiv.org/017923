Mobile sensing-based modeling of behavioral changes could predict an oncoming psychotic relapse
in schizophrenia patients for timely interventions. Deep learning models could complement existing
non-deep learning models for relapse prediction by modeling latent behavioral features relevant
to the prediction. However, given the inter-individual behavioral differences, model personalization
might be required for a predictive model. In this work, we propose RelapsePredNet, a Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) neural network-based model for relapse prediction. The model is personalized for
a particular patient by training using data from patients most similar to the given patient. Several
demographics and baseline mental health scores were considered as personalization metrics to
define patient similarity. We investigated the effect of personalization on training dataset
characteristics, learned embeddings, and relapse prediction performance. We compared RelapsePredNet
with a deep learning-based anomaly detection model for relapse prediction. Further, we investigated
if RelapsePredNet could complement ClusterRFModel (a random forest model leveraging clustering
and template features proposed in prior work) in a fusion model, by identifying latent behavioral
features relevant for relapse prediction. The CrossCheck dataset consisting of continuous mobile
sensing data obtained from 63 schizophrenia patients, each monitored for up to a year, was used for
our evaluations. The proposed RelapsePredNet outperformed the deep learning-based anomaly detection
model for relapse prediction. The F2 score for prediction were 0.21 and 0.52 in the full test set and
the Relapse Test Set (consisting of data from patients who have had relapse only), respectively.
These corresponded to a 29.4% and 38.8% improvement compared to the existing deep learning-based
model for relapse prediction.

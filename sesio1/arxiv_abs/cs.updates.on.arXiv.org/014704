Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become very popular for many military and civilian applications
including in agriculture, construction, mining, environmental monitoring, etc. A desirable
feature for UAVs is the ability to navigate and perform tasks autonomously with least human interaction.
This is a very challenging problem due to several factors such as the high complexity of UAV applications,
operation in harsh environments, limited payload and onboard computing power and highly nonlinear
dynamics. The work presented in this report contributes towards the state-of-the-art in UAV control
for safe autonomous navigation and motion coordination of multi-UAV systems. The first part of
this report deals with single-UAV systems. The complex problem of three-dimensional (3D) collision-free
navigation in unknown/dynamic environments is addressed. To that end, advanced 3D reactive control
strategies are developed adopting the sense-and-avoid paradigm to produce quick reactions around
obstacles. A special case of navigation in 3D unknown confined environments (i.e. tunnel-like)
is also addressed. General 3D kinematic models are considered in the design which makes these methods
applicable to different UAV types in addition to underwater vehicles. Moreover, different implementation
methods for these strategies with quadrotor-type UAVs are also investigated considering UAV dynamics
in the control design. Practical experiments and simulations were carried out to analyze the performance
of the developed methods. The second part of this report addresses safe navigation for multi-UAV
systems. Distributed motion coordination methods of multi-UAV systems for flocking and 3D area
coverage are developed. These methods offer good computational cost for large-scale systems.
Simulations were performed to verify the performance of these methods considering systems with
different sizes.

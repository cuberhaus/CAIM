Data-driven constitutive modeling is an emerging field in computational solid mechanics with
the prospect of significantly relieving the computational costs of hierarchical computational
methods. Traditionally, these surrogates have been trained using datasets which map strain inputs
to stress outputs directly. Data-driven constitutive models for elastic and inelastic materials
have commonly been developed based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), which recently enabled
the incorporation of physical laws in the construction of these models. However, ANNs do not offer
convergence guarantees and are reliant on user-specified parameters. In contrast to ANNs, Gaussian
process regression (GPR) is based on nonparametric modeling principles as well as on fundamental
statistical knowledge and hence allows for strict convergence guarantees. GPR however has the
major disadvantage that it scales poorly as datasets get large. In this work we present a physics-informed
data-driven constitutive modeling approach for isostropic and anisotropic materials based on
probabilistic machine learning that can be used in the big data context. The trained GPR surrogates
are able to respect physical principles such as material frame indifference, material symmetry,
thermodynamic consistency, stress-free undeformed configuration, and the local balance of angular
momentum. Furthermore, this paper presents the first sampling approach that directly generates
space-filling points in the invariant space corresponding to bounded domain of the gradient deformation
tensor. Overall, the presented approach is tested on synthetic data from isotropic and anisotropic
constitutive laws and shows surprising accuracy even far beyond the limits of the training domain,
indicating that the resulting surrogates can efficiently generalize as they incorporate knowledge
about the underlying physics.

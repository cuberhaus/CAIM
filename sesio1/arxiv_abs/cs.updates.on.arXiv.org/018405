Recent work has shown the potential of using audio data (eg, cough, breathing, and voice) in the screening
for COVID-19. However, these approaches only focus on one-off detection and detect the infection
given the current audio sample, but do not monitor disease progression in COVID-19. Limited exploration
has been put forward to continuously monitor COVID-19 progression, especially recovery, through
longitudinal audio data. Tracking disease progression characteristics could lead to more timely
treatment. The primary objective of this study is to explore the potential of longitudinal audio
samples over time for COVID-19 progression prediction and, especially, recovery trend prediction
using sequential deep learning techniques. Crowdsourced respiratory audio data, including breathing,
cough, and voice samples, from 212 individuals over 5-385 days were analyzed. We developed a deep
learning-enabled tracking tool using gated recurrent units (GRUs) to detect COVID-19 progression
by exploring the audio dynamics of the individuals' historical audio biomarkers. The investigation
comprised 2 parts: (1) COVID-19 detection in terms of positive and negative (healthy) tests, and
(2) longitudinal disease progression prediction over time in terms of probability of positive
tests. The strong performance for COVID-19 detection, yielding an AUROC of 0.79, a sensitivity
of 0.75, and a specificity of 0.71 supported the effectiveness of the approach compared to methods
that do not leverage longitudinal dynamics. We further examined the predicted disease progression
trajectory, displaying high consistency with test results with a correlation of 0.75 in the test
cohort and 0.86 in a subset of the test cohort who reported recovery. Our findings suggest that monitoring
COVID-19 evolution via longitudinal audio data has potential in the tracking of individuals' disease
progression and recovery.

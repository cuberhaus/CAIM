Nowadays, targeted attacks like Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) has become one of the major
concern of many enterprise networks. As a common approach to counter these attacks, security staff
deploy a variety of security and non-security sensors at different lines of defense (Network, Host,
and Application) to track the attacker's behaviors during their kill chain. However, one of the
drawbacks of this approach is the huge amount of events raised by heterogeneous security and non-security
sensors which makes it difficult to analyze logged events for later processing i.e. event correlation
for timely detection of APT attacks. Till now, some research papers have been published on event
aggregation for reducing the volume of logged low-level events. However, most research works have
been provided a method to aggregate the events of a single-type and homogeneous event source i.e.
NIDS. In addition, their main focus is only on the degree to which the event volume is reduced, while
the amount of security information lost during the event aggregation process is also very important.
In this paper, we propose a three-phase event aggregation method to reduce the volume of logged heterogeneous
events during APT attacks considering the lowest rate of loss of security information. To this aim,
at first, low-level events of the sensors are clustered into some similar event groups and then,
after filtering noisy event clusters, the remained clusters are summarized based on an Attribute-Oriented
Induction (AOI) method in a controllable manner to reduce the unimportant or duplicated events.
The method has been evaluated on the three publicly available datasets: SotM34, Bryant, and LANL.
The experimental results show that the method is efficient enough in event aggregation and can reduce
events volume up to 99.7\% with an acceptable level of information loss ratio (ILR).

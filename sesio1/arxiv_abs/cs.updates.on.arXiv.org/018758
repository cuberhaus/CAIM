Bacterial infections are responsible for high mortality worldwide. Antimicrobial resistance
underlying the infection, and multifaceted patient's clinical status can hamper the correct choice
of antibiotic treatment. Randomized clinical trials provide average treatment effect estimates
but are not ideal for risk stratification and optimization of therapeutic choice, i.e., individualized
treatment effects (ITE). Here, we leverage large-scale electronic health record data, collected
from Southern US academic clinics, to emulate a clinical trial, i.e., 'target trial', and develop
a machine learning model of mortality prediction and ITE estimation for patients diagnosed with
acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection (ABSSSI) due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA). ABSSSI-MRSA is a challenging condition with reduced treatment options - vancomycin
is the preferred choice, but it has non-negligible side effects. First, we use propensity score
matching to emulate the trial and create a treatment randomized (vancomycin vs. other antibiotics)
dataset. Next, we use this data to train various machine learning methods (including boosted/LASSO
logistic regression, support vector machines, and random forest) and choose the best model in terms
of area under the receiver characteristic (AUC) through bootstrap validation. Lastly, we use the
models to calculate ITE and identify possible averted deaths by therapy change. The out-of-bag
tests indicate that SVM and RF are the most accurate, with AUC of 81% and 78%, respectively, but BLR/LASSO
is not far behind (76%). By calculating the counterfactuals using the BLR/LASSO, vancomycin increases
the risk of death, but it shows a large variation (odds ratio 1.2, 95% range 0.4-3.8) and the contribution
to outcome probability is modest. Instead, the RF exhibits stronger changes in ITE, suggesting
more complex treatment heterogeneity.

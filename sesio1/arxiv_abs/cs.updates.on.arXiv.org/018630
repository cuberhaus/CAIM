Self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition with contrastive learning has attracted
much attention. Recent literature shows that data augmentation and large sets of contrastive pairs
are crucial in learning such representations. In this paper, we found that directly extending contrastive
pairs based on normal augmentations brings limited returns in terms of performance, because the
contribution of contrastive pairs from the normal data augmentation to the loss get smaller as training
progresses. Therefore, we delve into hard contrastive pairs for contrastive learning. Motivated
by the success of mixing augmentation strategy which improves the performance of many tasks by synthesizing
novel samples, we propose SkeleMixCLR: a contrastive learning framework with a spatio-temporal
skeleton mixing augmentation (SkeleMix) to complement current contrastive learning approaches
by providing hard contrastive samples. First, SkeleMix utilizes the topological information
of skeleton data to mix two skeleton sequences by randomly combing the cropped skeleton fragments
(the trimmed view) with the remaining skeleton sequences (the truncated view). Second, a spatio-temporal
mask pooling is applied to separate these two views at the feature level. Third, we extend contrastive
pairs with these two views. SkeleMixCLR leverages the trimmed and truncated views to provide abundant
hard contrastive pairs since they involve some context information from each other due to the graph
convolution operations, which allows the model to learn better motion representations for action
recognition. Extensive experiments on NTU-RGB+D, NTU120-RGB+D, and PKU-MMD datasets show that
SkeleMixCLR achieves state-of-the-art performance. Codes are available at https://github.com/czhaneva/SkeleMixCLR.

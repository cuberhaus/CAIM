Motivated by the rise of quantum computers, existing public-key cryptosystems are expected to
be replaced by post-quantum schemes in the next decade in billions of devices. To facilitate the
transition, NIST is running a standardization process which is currently in its final Round. Only
three digital signature schemes are left in the competition, among which Dilithium and Falcon are
the ones based on lattices. Classical fault attacks on signature schemes make use of pairs of faulty
and correct signatures to recover the secret key which only works on deterministic schemes. To counter
such attacks, Dilithium offers a randomized version which makes each signature unique, even when
signing identical messages. In this work, we introduce a novel Signature Correction Attack which
not only applies to the deterministic version but also to the randomized version of Dilithium and
is effective even on constant-time implementations using AVX2 instructions. The Signature Correction
Attack exploits the mathematical structure of Dilithium to recover the secret key bits by using
faulty signatures and the public-key. It can work for any fault mechanism which can induce single
bit-flips. For demonstration, we are using Rowhammer induced faults. Thus, our attack does not
require any physical access or special privileges, and hence could be also implemented on shared
cloud servers. We perform a thorough classical and quantum security analysis of Dilithium and successfully
recover 1,851 bits out of 3,072 bits of secret key $s_1$ for security level 2. The lattice strength
against quantum attackers is reduced from $2^{128}$ to $2^{81}$ while the strength against classical
attackers is reduced from $2^{141}$ to $2^{89}$. Hence, the Signature Correction Attack may be
employed to achieve a practical attack on Dilithium (security level 2) as proposed in Round 3 of the
NIST post-quantum standardization process.

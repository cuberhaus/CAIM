We propose a new way of analyzing musical pieces by using the exceptional musical icosahedra where
all the major/minor triads are represented by golden triangles or golden gnomons. First, we introduce
a concept of the golden neighborhood that characterizes golden triangles/gnomons that neighbor
a given golden triangle or gnomon. Then, we investigate a relation between the exceptional musical
icosahedra and the neo-Riemannian theory, and find that the golden neighborhoods and the icosahedron
symmetry relate any major/minor triad with any major/minor triad. Second, we show how the exceptional
musical icosahedra are applied to analyzing harmonies constructed by four or more tones. We introduce
two concepts, golden decomposition and golden singular. The golden decomposition is a decomposition
of a given harmony into the minimum number of harmonies constructing the given harmony and represented
by the golden figure (a golden triangle, a golden gnomon, or a golden rectangle). A harmony is golden
singular if and only if the harmony does not have golden decompositions. We show results of the golden
analysis (analysis by the golden decomposition) of the tertian seventh chords and the mystic chord.
While the dominant seventh chord is the only tertian seventh chord that is golden singular in the
type 1[star] and the type 4[star] exceptional musical icosahedron, the half-diminished seventh
chord is the only tertian seventh chord that is golden singular in the type 2 [star] and the type 3[star]
exceptional musical icosahedron. Last, we apply the golden analysis to the famous prelude in C major
composed by Johann Sebastian Bach (BWV 846). We found 7 combinations of the golden figures on the
type 2 [star] or the type 3 [star] exceptional musical icosahedron dually represent all the measures
of the BWV 846.

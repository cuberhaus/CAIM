Cloud applications have reshaped the model of services and infrastructure of the Internet. Search
engines, social networks, content delivery and retail and e-commerce sites belong to this group
of applications. An important element in the architecture of data centers where these applications
run is the communication infrastructure, commonly known as data center networks (DCNs). A critical
challenge DCNs have to address is the processing of the traffic of cloud applications, which due
to its properties is essentially different to the traffic of other Internet applications. In order
to improve the responsiveness and throughput of applications, DCNs should be able to prioritize
short flows (a few KB) over long flows (several MB). However, given the time and space variations
the traffic presents, the information about flow sizes is not available in advance in order to plan
the flow scheduling. In this paper, we present an adaptable mechanism called Adaptable Workload-Agnostic
Flow Scheduling (AWAFS). It is an adaptable approach that can adjust in an agnostic way the scheduling
configuration of DCN forwarding devices. This agnostic adjustment contributes to reduce the Flow
Completion Time (FCT) of those short flows, representing around 85% of the traffic handled by cloud
applications. Our evaluation results based on simulation show that AWAFS can reduce the average
FCT of short flows between 16.9% and 45.2% when compared to the best existing agnostic non-adaptable
solution, without inducing starvation on long flows. Indeed, it can provide improvements as high
as 39% for long flows. Additionally, AWAFS can improve the FCT for short flows in scenarios with high
heterogeneity in the traffic present in the network, with a reduction up to 5% for the average FCT
and 15% for the tail FCT.

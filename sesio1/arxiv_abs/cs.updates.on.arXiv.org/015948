Fixed-point fast sweeping methods are a class of explicit iterative methods developed in the literature
to efficiently solve steady state solutions of hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs).
As other types of fast sweeping schemes, fixed-point fast sweeping methods use the Gauss-Seidel
iterations and alternating sweeping strategy to cover characteristics of hyperbolic PDEs in a
certain direction simultaneously in each sweeping order. The resulting iterative schemes have
fast convergence rate to steady state solutions. Moreover, an advantage of fixed-point fast sweeping
methods over other types of fast sweeping methods is that they are explicit and do not involve inverse
operation of any nonlinear local system. Hence they are robust and flexible, and have been combined
with high order accurate weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes to solve various
hyperbolic PDEs in the literature. For multidimensional nonlinear problems, high order fixed-point
fast sweeping WENO methods still require quite large amount of computational costs. In this technical
note, we apply sparse-grid techniques, an effective approximation tool for multidimensional
problems, to fixed-point fast sweeping WENO method for reducing its computational costs. Here
we focus on a robust Runge-Kutta (RK) type fixed-point fast sweeping WENO scheme with third order
accuracy (Zhang et al. 2006 [33]), for solving Eikonal equations, an important class of static Hamilton-Jacobi
(H-J) equations. Numerical experiments on solving multidimensional Eikonal equations and a more
general static H-J equation are performed to show that the sparse grid computations of the fixed-point
fast sweeping WENO scheme achieve large savings of CPU times on refined meshes, and at the same time
maintain comparable accuracy and resolution with those on corresponding regular single grids.

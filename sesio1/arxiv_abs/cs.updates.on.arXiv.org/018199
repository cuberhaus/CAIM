Considering the multimodal nature of transport systems and potential cross-modal correlations,
there is a growing trend of enhancing demand forecasting accuracy by learning from multimodal data.
These multimodal forecasting models can improve accuracy but be less practical when different
parts of multimodal datasets are owned by different institutions who cannot directly share data
among them. While various institutions may can not share their data with each other directly, they
may share forecasting models trained by their data, where such models cannot be used to identify
the exact information from their datasets. This study proposes an Unsupervised Knowledge Adaptation
Demand Forecasting framework to forecast the demand of the target mode by utilizing a pre-trained
model based on data of another mode, which does not require direct data sharing of the source mode.
The proposed framework utilizes the potential shared patterns among multiple transport modes
to improve forecasting performance while avoiding the direct sharing of data among different institutions.
Specifically, a pre-trained forecasting model is first learned based on the data of a source mode,
which can capture and memorize the source travel patterns. Then, the demand data of the target dataset
is encoded into an individual knowledge part and a sharing knowledge part which will extract travel
patterns by individual extraction network and sharing extraction network, respectively. The
unsupervised knowledge adaptation strategy is utilized to form the sharing features for further
forecasting by making the pre-trained network and the sharing extraction network analogous. Our
findings illustrate that unsupervised knowledge adaptation by sharing the pre-trained model
to the target mode can improve the forecasting performance without the dependence on direct data
sharing.

Insufficient steel quality in mass production can cause extremely costly damage to tooling, production
downtimes and low quality products. Automatic, fast and cheap strategies to estimate essential
material properties for quality control, risk mitigation and the prediction of faults are highly
desirable. In this work we analyse a high throughput production line of steel-based products. Currently,
the material quality is checked using manual destructive testing, which is slow, wasteful and covers
only a tiny fraction of the material. To achieve complete testing coverage our industrial collaborator
developed a contactless, non-invasive, electromagnetic sensor to measure all material during
production in real-time. Our contribution is three-fold: 1) We show in a controlled experiment
that the sensor can distinguish steel with deliberately altered properties. 2) 48 steel coils were
fully measured non-invasively and additional destructive tests were conducted on samples to serve
as ground truth. A linear model is fitted to predict from the non-invasive measurements two key material
properties (yield strength and tensile strength) that normally are obtained by destructive tests.
The performance is evaluated in leave-one-coil-out cross-validation. 3) The resulting model
is used to analyse the material properties and the relationship with logged product faults on real
production data of ~108 km of processed material measured with the non-invasive sensor. The model
achieves an excellent performance (F3-score of 0.95) predicting material running out of specifications
for the tensile strength. The combination of model predictions and logged product faults shows
that if a significant percentage of estimated yield stress values is out of specification, the risk
of product faults is high. Our analysis demonstrates promising directions for real-time quality
control, risk monitoring and fault detection.

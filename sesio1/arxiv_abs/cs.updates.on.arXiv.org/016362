We study algorithmic applications of a natural discretization for the hard-sphere model and the
Widom-Rowlinson model in a region $\mathbb{V}\subset\mathbb{R}^d$. These models are used in
statistical physics to describe mixtures of one or multiple particle types subjected to hard-core
interactions. For each type, particles follow a Poisson point process with a type specific activity
parameter (fugacity). The Gibbs distribution is characterized by the mixture of these point processes
conditioned that no two particles are closer than a type-dependent distance threshold. A key part
in better understanding the Gibbs distribution is its normalizing constant, called partition
function. We give sufficient conditions that the partition function of a discrete hard-core model
on a geometric graph based on a point set $X \subset \mathbb{V}$ closely approximates those of such
continuous models. Previously, this was only shown for the hard-sphere model on cubic regions $\mathbb{V}=[0,
\ell)^d$ when $X$ is exponential in the volume of the region $\nu(\mathbb{V})$, limiting algorithmic
applications. In the same setting, our refined analysis only requires a quadratic number of points,
which we argue to be tight. We use our improved discretization results to approximate the partition
functions of the hard-sphere model and the Widom-Rowlinson efficiently in $\nu(\mathbb{V})$.
For the hard-sphere model, we obtain the first quasi-polynomial deterministic approximation
algorithm for the entire fugacity regime for which, so far, only randomized approximations are
known. Furthermore, we simplify a recently introduced fully polynomial randomized approximation
algorithm. Similarly, we obtain the best known deterministic and randomized approximation bounds
for the Widom-Rowlinson model. Moreover, we obtain approximate sampling algorithms for the respective
spin systems within the same fugacity regimes.

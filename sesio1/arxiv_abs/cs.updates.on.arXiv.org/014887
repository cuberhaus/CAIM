Recommender systems are software applications that help users find items of interest in situations
of information overload in a personalized way, using knowledge about the needs and preferences
of individual users. In conversational recommendation approaches, these needs and preferences
are acquired by the system in an interactive, multi-turn dialog. A common approach in the literature
to drive such dialogs is to incrementally ask users about their preferences regarding desired and
undesired item features or regarding individual items. A central research goal in this context
is efficiency, evaluated with respect to the number of required interactions until a satisfying
item is found. This is usually accomplished by making inferences about the best next question to
ask to the user. Today, research on dialog efficiency is almost entirely empirical, aiming to demonstrate,
for example, that one strategy for selecting questions is better than another one in a given application.
With this work, we complement empirical research with a theoretical, domain-independent model
of conversational recommendation. This model, which is designed to cover a range of application
scenarios, allows us to investigate the efficiency of conversational approaches in a formal way,
in particular with respect to the computational complexity of devising optimal interaction strategies.
Through such a theoretical analysis we show that finding an efficient conversational strategy
is NP-hard, and in PSPACE in general, but for particular kinds of catalogs the upper bound lowers
to POLYLOGSPACE. From a practical point of view, this result implies that catalog characteristics
can strongly influence the efficiency of individual conversational strategies and should therefore
be considered when designing new strategies. A preliminary empirical analysis on datasets derived
from a real-world one aligns with our findings.

Due to the current horizontal business model that promotes increasing reliance on untrusted third-party
Intellectual Properties (IPs), CAD tools, and design facilities, hardware Trojan attacks have
become a serious threat to the semiconductor industry. Development of effective countermeasures
against hardware Trojan attacks requires: (1) fast and reliable exploration of the viable Trojan
attack space for a given design and (2) a suite of high-quality Trojan-inserted benchmarks that
meet specific standards. The latter has become essential for the development and evaluation of
design/verification solutions to achieve quantifiable assurance against Trojan attacks. While
existing static benchmarks provide a baseline for comparing different countermeasures, they
only enumerate a limited number of handcrafted Trojans from the complete Trojan design space. To
accomplish these dual objectives, in this paper, we present MIMIC, a novel AI-guided framework
for automatic Trojan insertion, which can create a large population of valid Trojans for a given
design by mimicking the properties of a small set of known Trojans. While there exist tools to automatically
insert Trojan instances using fixed Trojan templates, they cannot analyze known Trojan attacks
for creating new instances that accurately capture the threat model. MIMIC works in two major steps:
(1) it analyzes structural and functional features of existing Trojan populations in a multi-dimensional
space to train machine learning models and generate a large number of "virtual Trojans" of the given
design, (2) next, it binds them into the design by matching their functional/structural properties
with suitable nets of the internal logic structure. We have developed a complete tool flow for MIMIC,
extensively evaluated the framework by exploring several use-cases, and quantified its effectiveness
to demonstrate highly promising results.

In this paper, we present a decision support framework for optimizing multiple aspects of vaccine
distribution across a multitier cold chain network. We propose two multi-period optimization
formulations within this framework: first to minimize inventory, ordering, transportation,
personnel and shortage costs associated with a single vaccine; the second being an extension of
the first for the case when multiple vaccines with differing efficacies and costs are available
for the same disease. Vaccine transportation and administration lead times are also incorporated
within the models. We also develop robust optimization versions of the single vaccine model to account
for the impact of uncertainty in model parameters on the optimal vaccine distribution solution.
We use the case of the Indian state of Bihar and COVID-19 vaccines to illustrate the implementation
of the framework. We present computational experiments to demonstrate: (a) the organization of
the model outputs; (b) how the models can be used to assess the impact of cold chain point storage capacities,
transportation vehicle capacities, and manufacturer capacities on the optimal vaccine distribution
pattern; and (c) the impact of vaccine efficacies and associated costs such as ordering and transportation
costs on the vaccine selection decision informed by the model. We then consider the computational
expense of the framework for realistic problem instances, and suggest multiple preprocessing
techniques to reduce their computational burden. Finally, we also demonstrate how the robust versions
of the single vaccine model outperform the deterministic version under multiple levels of uncertainty
in key model parameters. Our study presents public health authorities and other stakeholders with
a vaccine distribution and capacity planning tool for multi-tier cold chain networks.

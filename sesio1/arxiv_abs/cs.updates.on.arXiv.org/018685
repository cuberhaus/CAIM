Accurate segmentation of organs or lesions from medical images is crucial for reliable diagnosis
of diseases and organ morphometry. In recent years, convolutional encoder-decoder solutions
have achieved substantial progress in the field of automatic medical image segmentation. Due to
the inherent bias in the convolution operations, prior models mainly focus on local visual cues
formed by the neighboring pixels, but fail to fully model the long-range contextual dependencies.
In this paper, we propose a novel Transformer-based Attention Guided Network called TransAttUnet,
in which the multi-level guided attention and multi-scale skip connection are designed to jointly
enhance the performance of the semantical segmentation architecture. Inspired by Transformer,
the self-aware attention (SAA) module with Transformer Self Attention (TSA) and Global Spatial
Attention (GSA) is incorporated into TransAttUnet to effectively learn the non-local interactions
among encoder features. Moreover, we also use additional multi-scale skip connections between
decoder blocks to aggregate the upsampled features with different semantic scales. In this way,
the representation ability of multi-scale context information is strengthened to generate discriminative
features. Benefitting from these complementary components, the proposed TransAttUnet can effectively
alleviate the loss of fine details caused by the stacking of convolution layers and the consecutive
sampling operations, finally improving the segmentation quality of medical images. Extensive
experiments on multiple medical image segmentation datasets from different imaging modalities
demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.

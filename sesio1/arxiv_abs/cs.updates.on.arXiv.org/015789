Sink mobility is seen as a successful strategy to resolve the hotspot problem in Wireless Sensor
Network (WSN). Mobile sinks roam in the network and collect data from special nodes such as Cluster
Heads (CH) by means of short-range communications which improves the energy efficiency. Numerous
mobile sink based routing protocols have been proposed, however, they incur high delays especially
in large scale networks where the mobile sink has to travel for a long distance to collect data from
CHs and consequently they failed to ensure a tradeoff between energy efficiency and delay. To resolve
this issue, we propose in this paper an Effective Hybrid Routing Protocol termed as EHRP. The main
aim of this protocol is to combine between single-hop and multi-hop routing. Indeed, when the mobile
sink arrives at a cluster it collects its data while the other distant CHs continue to send their data
using our proposed improved Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm to avoid the waiting-time.
The existing ACO algorithms use in the distance heuristic which is not practical in real world and
fail to consider relevant statistic information of energy (e.g., minimum energy, average energy)
in path selection which leads to unbalanced energy consumption in the network. To address these
issues, the proposed routing algorithm employs the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)
and statistic information of energy to consume energy efficiently and decrease the probability
of sending failure. The performance of the proposed routing protocol is tested and compared with
those of the relevant routing protocols. The simulation results show that, in comparison with its
counterparts, EHRP succeeds to minimize energy consumption and delay as well as enhancing the packet
delivery ratio.

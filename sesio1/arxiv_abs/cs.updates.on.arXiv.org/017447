Recently, the popularity and wide use of the last-generation video conferencing technologies
created an exponential growth in its market size. Such technology allows participants in different
geographic regions to have a virtual face-to-face meeting. Additionally, it enables users to employ
a virtual background to conceal their own environment due to privacy concerns or to reduce distractions,
particularly in professional settings. Nevertheless, in scenarios where the users should not
hide their actual locations, they may mislead other participants by claiming their virtual background
as a real one. Therefore, it is crucial to develop tools and strategies to detect the authenticity
of the considered virtual background. In this paper, we present a detection strategy to distinguish
between real and virtual video conferencing user backgrounds. We demonstrate that our detector
is robust against two attack scenarios. The first scenario considers the case where the detector
is unaware about the attacks and inn the second scenario, we make the detector aware of the adversarial
attacks, which we refer to Adversarial Multimedia Forensics (i.e, the forensically-edited frames
are included in the training set). Given the lack of publicly available dataset of virtual and real
backgrounds for video conferencing, we created our own dataset and made them publicly available
[1]. Then, we demonstrate the robustness of our detector against different adversarial attacks
that the adversary considers. Ultimately, our detector's performance is significant against
the CRSPAM1372 [2] features, and post-processing operations such as geometric transformations
with different quality factors that the attacker may choose. Moreover, our performance results
shows that we can perfectly identify a real from a virtual background with an accuracy of 99.80%.

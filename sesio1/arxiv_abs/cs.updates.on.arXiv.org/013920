We consider the multidimensional space-fractional diffusion equations with spatially varying
diffusivity and fractional order. Significant computational challenges are encountered when
solving these equations due both to the kernel singularity in the fractional integral operator
and to the resulting dense discretized operators, which quickly become prohibitively expensive
to handle because of their memory and arithmetic complexities. In this work, we present a singularity-aware
discretization scheme that regularizes the singular integrals through a singularity subtraction
technique adapted to the spatial variability of diffusivity and fractional order. This regularization
strategy is conveniently formulated as a sparse matrix correction that is added to the dense operator,
and is applicable to different formulations of fractional diffusion equations. We also present
a block low rank representation to handle the dense matrix representations, by exploiting the ability
to approximate blocks of the resulting formally dense matrix by low rank factorizations. A Cholesky
factorization solver operates directly on this representation using the low rank blocks as its
atomic computational tiles, and achieves high performance on multicore hardware. Numerical results
show that the singularity treatment is robust, substantially reduces discretization errors,
and attains the first-order convergence rate allowed by the regularity of the solutions. They also
show that considerable savings are obtained in storage ($O(N^{1.5})$) and computational cost
($O(N^2)$) compared to dense factorizations. This translates to orders-of-magnitude savings
in memory and time on multi-dimensional problems, and shows that the proposed methods offer practical
tools for tackling large nonlocal fractional diffusion simulations.

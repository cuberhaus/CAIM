The outcome of a collective decision-making process, such as crowdsourcing, often relies on the
procedure through which the perspectives of its individual members are aggregated. Popular aggregation
methods, such as the majority rule, often fail to produce the optimal result, especially in high-complexity
tasks. Methods that rely on meta-cognitive information, such as confidence-based methods and
the Surprisingly Popular Option, had shown an improvement in various tasks. However, there is still
a significant number of cases with no optimal solution. Our aim is to exploit meta-cognitive information
and to learn from it, for the purpose of enhancing the ability of the group to produce a correct answer.
Specifically, we propose two different feature-representation approaches: (1) Response-Centered
feature Representation (RCR), which focuses on the characteristics of the individual response
instances, and (2) Answer-Centered feature Representation (ACR), which focuses on the characteristics
of each of the potential answers. Using these two feature-representation approaches, we train
Machine-Learning (ML) models, for the purpose of predicting the correctness of a response and of
an answer. The trained models are used as the basis of an ML-based aggregation methodology that,
contrary to other ML-based techniques, has the advantage of being a "one-shot" technique, independent
from the crowd-specific composition and personal record, and adaptive to various types of situations.
To evaluate our methodology, we collected 2490 responses for different tasks, which we used for
feature engineering and for the training of ML models. We tested our feature-representation approaches
through the performance of our proposed ML-based aggregation methods. The results show an increase
of 20% to 35% in the success rate, compared to the use of standard rule-based aggregation methods.

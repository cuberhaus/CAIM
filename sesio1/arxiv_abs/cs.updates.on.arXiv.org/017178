The paper analyzes the results of the introduction of the distance learning form (DLF) using electronic
educational resources (EER) and the teacher's virtual classroom in primary school. The experiment
took place within the framework of the "Smart Kids" All-Ukrainian project during the long quarantine
caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The educational process took place both synchronously and asynchronously.
The present paper substantiates the model of organization of distance learning of primary school
students using EER and outlines its three main components: the organization of learning, conducting
online classes (explaining new material or practicing skills by students) and monitoring the quality
of students' independent performance of tasks. The results of the experiment prove that it is necessary
to provide teachers and students with computer equipment, Internet access, digital resources
for teaching and assessment to implement DLF. It has been established that EER in distance learning
can be used both on a regular basis - in each class, and periodically - to explain new material or train
skills, the quality of tasks performed by students can be monitored in the virtual office of the teacher
and shape an individual trajectory of students' development. The teachers identified the following
main problems of DLF implementation: internet interruptions, problems with providing new computer
equipment to students and some teachers; lack of state aid in providing EER to all participants in
the educational process; limited access to students' computers during complete isolation due
to online work of parents. Despite the outlined problems, the quality of distance learning of primary
school students during the pandemic using EER was positively and highly assessed by teachers.

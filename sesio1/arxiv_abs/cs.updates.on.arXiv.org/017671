Missing data is a recurrent problem in remote sensing, mainly due to cloud coverage for multispectral
images and acquisition problems. This can be a critical issue for crop monitoring, especially for
applications relying on machine learning techniques, which generally assume that the feature
matrix does not have missing values. This paper proposes a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for the reconstruction
of parcel-level features extracted from multispectral images. A robust version of the GMM is also
investigated, since datasets can be contaminated by inaccurate samples or features (e.g., wrong
crop type reported, inaccurate boundaries, undetected clouds, etc). Additional features extracted
from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images using Sentinel-1 data are also used to provide complementary
information and improve the imputations. The robust GMM investigated in this work assigns reduced
weights to the outliers during the estimation of the GMM parameters, which improves the final reconstruction.
These weights are computed at each step of an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm by using
outlier scores provided by the isolation forest algorithm. Experimental validation is conducted
on rapeseed and wheat parcels located in the Beauce region (France). Overall, we show that the GMM
imputation method outperforms other reconstruction strategies. A mean absolute error (MAE) of
0.013 (resp. 0.019) is obtained for the imputation of the median Normalized Difference Index (NDVI)
of the rapeseed (resp. wheat) parcels. Other indicators (e.g., Normalized Difference Water Index)
and statistics (for instance the interquartile range, which captures heterogeneity among the
parcel indicator) are reconstructed at the same time with good accuracy. In a dataset contaminated
by irrelevant samples, using the robust GMM is recommended since the standard GMM imputation can
lead to inaccurate imputed values.

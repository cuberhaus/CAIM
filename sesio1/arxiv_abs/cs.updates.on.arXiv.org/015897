This paper proposes a novel mission planning platform, capable of efficiently deploying a team
of UAVs to cover complex-shaped areas, in various remote sensing applications. Under the hood lies
a novel optimization scheme for grid-based methods, utilizing Simulated Annealing algorithm,
that significantly increases the achieved percentage of coverage and improves the qualitative
features of the generated paths. Extensive simulated evaluation in comparison with a state-of-the-art
alternative methodology, for coverage path planning (CPP) operations, establishes the performance
gains in terms of achieved coverage and overall duration of the generated missions. On top of that,
DARP algorithm is employed to allocate sub-tasks to each member of the swarm, taking into account
each UAV's sensing and operational capabilities, their initial positions and any no-fly-zones
possibly defined inside the operational area. This feature is of paramount importance in real-life
applications, as it has the potential to achieve tremendous performance improvements in terms
of time demanded to complete a mission, while at the same time it unlocks a wide new range of applications,
that was previously not feasible due to the limited battery life of UAVs. In order to investigate
the actual efficiency gains that are introduced by the multi-UAV utilization, a simulated study
is performed as well. All of these capabilities are packed inside an end-to-end platform that eases
the utilization of UAVs' swarms in remote sensing applications. Its versatility is demonstrated
via two different real-life applications: (i) a photogrametry for precision agriculture and (ii)
an indicative search and rescue for first responders missions, that were performed utilizing a
swarm of commercial UAVs. The source code can be found at: https://github.com/savvas-ap/mCPP-optimized-DARP

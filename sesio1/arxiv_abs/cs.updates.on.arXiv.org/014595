In the present work, we describe a framework for modeling how models can be built that integrates
concepts and methods from a wide range of fields. The information schism between the real-world
and that which can be gathered and considered by any individual information processing agent is
characterized and discussed, followed by the presentation of a series of the adopted requisites
while developing the modeling approach. The issue of mapping from datasets into models is subsequently
addressed, as well as some of the respectively implied difficulties and limitations. Based on these
considerations, an approach to meta modeling how models are built is then progressively developed.
First, the reference M* meta model framework is presented, which relies critically in associating
whole datasets and respective models in terms of a strict equivalence relation. Among the interesting
features of this model are its ability to bridge the gap between data and modeling, as well as paving
the way to an algebra of both data and models which can be employed to combine models into hierarchical
manner. After illustrating the M* model in terms of patterns derived from regular lattices, the
reported modeling approach continues by discussing how sampling issues, error and overlooked
data can be addressed, leading to the $M^{<\epsilon>}$ variant, illustrated respectively to number
theory. The situation in which the data needs to be represented in terms of respective probability
densities is treated next, yielding the $M^{<\sigma>}$ meta model, which is then illustrated respectively
to a real-world dataset (iris flowers data). Several considerations about how the developed framework
can provide insights about data clustering, complexity, collaborative research, deep learning,
and creativity are then presented, followed by overall conclusions.

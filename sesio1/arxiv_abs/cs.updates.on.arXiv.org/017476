As one of the most well-known programmer Q&A websites, Stack Overflow (i.e., SO) is serving tens
of thousands of developers every day. Previous work has shown that many developers reuse the code
snippets on SO when they find an answer (from SO) that functionally matches the programming problem
they encounter in their development activities. To study how programmers reuse code on SO during
project development, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study. First, to capture the development
activities of programmers, we collect 342,148 modified code snippets in commits from 793 open-source
Java projects, and these modified code can reflect the programming problems encountered during
development. We also collect the code snippets from 1,355,617 posts on SO. Then, we employ CCFinder
to detect the code clone between the modified code from commits and the code from SO, and further analyze
the code reuse when programmer solves a programming problem during development. We count the code
reuse ratios of the modified code snippets in the commits of each project in different years, the
results show that the average code reuse ratio is 6.32%, and the maximum is 8.38%. The code reuse ratio
in project commits has increased year by year, and the proportion of code reuse in the newly established
project is higher than that of old projects. We also find that some projects reuse the code snippets
from many years ago. Additionally, we find that experienced developers seem to be more likely to
reuse the knowledge on SO. Moreover, we find that the code reuse ratio in bug-related commits (6.67%)
is slightly higher than that of in non-bug-related commits (6.59%). Furthermore, we also find that
the code reuse ratio (14.44%) in Java class files that have undergone multiple modifications is
more than double the overall code reuse ratio (6.32%).

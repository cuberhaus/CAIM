In this paper we present ADOP, a novel point-based, differentiable neural rendering pipeline.
Like other neural renderers, our system takes as input calibrated camera images and a proxy geometry
of the scene, in our case a point cloud. To generate a novel view, the point cloud is rasterized with
learned feature vectors as colors and a deep neural network fills the remaining holes and shades
each output pixel. The rasterizer renders points as one-pixel splats, which makes it very fast and
allows us to compute gradients with respect to all relevant input parameters efficiently. Furthermore,
our pipeline contains a fully differentiable physically-based photometric camera model, including
exposure, white balance, and a camera response function. Following the idea of inverse rendering,
we use our renderer to refine its input in order to reduce inconsistencies and optimize the quality
of its output. In particular, we can optimize structural parameters like the camera pose, lens distortions,
point positions and features, and a neural environment map, but also photometric parameters like
camera response function, vignetting, and per-image exposure and white balance. Because our pipeline
includes photometric parameters, e.g.~exposure and camera response function, our system can
smoothly handle input images with varying exposure and white balance, and generates high-dynamic
range output. We show that due to the improved input, we can achieve high render quality, also for
difficult input, e.g. with imperfect camera calibrations, inaccurate proxy geometry, or varying
exposure. As a result, a simpler and thus faster deep neural network is sufficient for reconstruction.
In combination with the fast point rasterization, ADOP achieves real-time rendering rates even
for models with well over 100M points. https://github.com/darglein/ADOP

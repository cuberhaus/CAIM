Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a severe genetic hemoglobin disorder that results in premature destruction
of red blood cells. Assessment of the severity of the disease is a challenging task in clinical routine
since the causes of broad variance in SCD manifestation despite the common genetic cause remain
unclear. Identification of the biomarkers that would predict the severity grade is of importance
for prognosis and assessment of responsiveness of patients to therapy. Detection of the changes
in red blood cell (RBC) density through separation of Percoll density gradient could be such marker
as it allows to resolve intercellular differences and follow the most damaged dense cells prone
to destruction and vaso-occlusion. Quantification of the images obtained from the distribution
of RBCs in Percoll gradient and interpretation of the obtained is an important prerequisite for
establishment of this approach. Here, we propose a novel approach combining a graph convolutional
network, a convolutional neural network, fast Fourier transform, and recursive feature elimination
to predict the severity of SCD directly from a Percoll image. Two important but expensive laboratory
blood test parameters measurements are used for training the graph convolutional network. To make
the model independent from such tests during prediction, the two parameters are estimated by a neural
network from the Percoll image directly. On a cohort of 216 subjects, we achieve a prediction performance
that is only slightly below an approach where the groundtruth laboratory measurements are used.
Our proposed method is the first computational approach for the difficult task of SCD severity prediction.
The two-step approach relies solely on inexpensive and simple blood analysis tools and can have
a significant impact on the patients' survival in underdeveloped countries where access to medical
instruments and doctors is limited

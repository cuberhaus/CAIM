Simulation models, in particular agent-based models, are gaining popularity in economics. The
considerable flexibility they offer, as well as their capacity to reproduce a variety of empirically
observed behaviours of complex systems, give them broad appeal, and the increasing availability
of cheap computing power has made their use feasible. Yet a widespread adoption in real-world modelling
and decision-making scenarios has been hindered by the difficulty of performing parameter estimation
for such models. In general, simulation models lack a tractable likelihood function, which precludes
a straightforward application of standard statistical inference techniques. Several recent
works have sought to address this problem through the application of likelihood-free inference
techniques, in which parameter estimates are determined by performing some form of comparison
between the observed data and simulation output. However, these approaches are (a) founded on restrictive
assumptions, and/or (b) typically require many hundreds of thousands of simulations. These qualities
make them unsuitable for large-scale simulations in economics and can cast doubt on the validity
of these inference methods in such scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of two classes
of black-box approximate Bayesian inference methods that have recently drawn significant attention
within the probabilistic machine learning community: neural posterior estimation and neural
density ratio estimation. We present benchmarking experiments in which we demonstrate that neural
network based black-box methods provide state of the art parameter inference for economic simulation
models, and crucially are compatible with generic multivariate time-series data. In addition,
we suggest appropriate assessment criteria for future benchmarking of approximate Bayesian inference
procedures for economic simulation models.

In this study we investigated the effect of body ownership illusion-based body scaling on physics
plausibility in Virtual Reality (VR). Our interest was in examining whether body ownership illusion-based
body scaling could affect the plausibility of rigid body dynamics similarly to altering VR users'
scale by manipulating their virtual interpupillary distance and viewpoint height. The procedure
involved the conceptual replication of two previous studies. We investigated physics plausibility
with 40 participants under two conditions. In our synchronous condition, we used visuo-tactile
stimuli to elicit a body ownership illusion of inhabiting an invisible doll-sized body on participants
reclining on an exam table. Our asynchronous condition was otherwise similar, but the visuo-tactile
stimuli were provided asynchronously to prevent the onset of the body ownership illusion. We were
interested in whether the correct approximation of physics (true physics) or physics that are incorrect
and appearing as if the environment is five times larger instead (movie physics) appear more realistic
to participants as a function of body scale. We found that movie physics did appear more realistic
to participants under the body ownership illusion condition. However, our hypothesis that true
physics would appear more realistic in the asynchronous condition was unsupported. Our exploratory
analyses revealed that movie physics were perceived as plausible under both conditions. Moreover,
we were not able to replicate previous findings from literature concerning object size estimations
while inhabiting a small invisible body. However, we found a significant opposite effect regarding
size estimations; the object sizes were on average underestimated during the synchronous visuo-tactile
condition when compared to the asynchronous condition.

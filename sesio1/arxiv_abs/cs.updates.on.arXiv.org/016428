People affected by machine learning model decisions may benefit greatly from access to recourses,
i.e. suggestions about what features they could change to receive a more favorable decision from
the model. Current approaches try to optimize for the cost incurred by users when adopting a recourse,
but they assume that all users share the same cost function. This is an unrealistic assumption because
users might have diverse preferences about their willingness to change certain features. In this
work, we introduce a new method for identifying recourse sets for users which does not assume that
users' preferences are known in advance. We propose an objective function, Expected Minimum Cost
(EMC), based on two key ideas: (1) when presenting a set of options to a user, there only needs to be
one low-cost solution that the user could adopt; (2) when we do not know the user's true cost function,
we can approximately optimize for user satisfaction by first sampling plausible cost functions
from a distribution, then finding a recourse set that achieves a good cost for these samples. We optimize
EMC with a novel discrete optimization algorithm, Cost Optimized Local Search (COLS), which is
guaranteed to improve the recourse set quality over iterations. Experimental evaluation on popular
real-world datasets with simulated users demonstrates that our method satisfies up to 25.89 percentage
points more users compared to strong baseline methods, while, the human evaluation shows that our
recourses are preferred more than twice as often as the strongest baseline recourses. Finally,
using standard fairness metrics we show that our method can provide more fair solutions across demographic
groups than baselines. We provide our source code at: https://github.com/prateeky2806/EMC-COLS-recourse

This study aimed to evaluate the performance of a novel unsupervised deep learning-based framework
for automated infections lesion segmentation from CT images of Covid patients. In the first step,
two residual networks were independently trained to identify the lung tissue for normal and Covid
patients in a supervised manner. These two models, referred to as DL-Covid and DL-Norm for Covid-19
and normal patients, respectively, generate the voxel-wise probability maps for lung tissue identification.
To detect Covid lesions, the CT image of the Covid patient is processed by the DL-Covid and DL-Norm
models to obtain two lung probability maps. Since the DL-Norm model is not familiar with Covid infections
within the lung, this model would assign lower probabilities to the lesions than the DL-Covid. Hence,
the probability maps of the Covid infections could be generated through the subtraction of the two
lung probability maps obtained from the DL-Covid and DL-Norm models. Manual lesion segmentation
of 50 Covid-19 CT images was used to assess the accuracy of the unsupervised lesion segmentation
approach. The Dice coefficients of 0.985 and 0.978 were achieved for the lung segmentation of normal
and Covid patients in the external validation dataset, respectively. Quantitative results of
infection segmentation by the proposed unsupervised method showed the Dice coefficient and Jaccard
index of 0.67 and 0.60, respectively. Quantitative evaluation of the proposed unsupervised approach
for Covid-19 infectious lesion segmentation showed relatively satisfactory results. Since this
framework does not require any annotated dataset, it could be used to generate very large training
samples for the supervised machine learning algorithms dedicated to noisy and/or weakly annotated
datasets.

An entity mention in text such as "Washington" may correspond to many different named entities such
as the city "Washington D.C." or the newspaper "Washington Post." The goal of named entity disambiguation
is to identify the mentioned named entity correctly among all possible candidates. If the type (e.g.
location or person) of a mentioned entity can be correctly predicted from the context, it may increase
the chance of selecting the right candidate by assigning low probability to the unlikely ones. This
paper proposes cluster-based mention typing for named entity disambiguation. The aim of mention
typing is to predict the type of a given mention based on its context. Generally, manually curated
type taxonomies such as Wikipedia categories are used. We introduce cluster-based mention typing,
where named entities are clustered based on their contextual similarities and the cluster ids are
assigned as types. The hyperlinked mentions and their context in Wikipedia are used in order to obtain
these cluster-based types. Then, mention typing models are trained on these mentions, which have
been labeled with their cluster-based types through distant supervision. At the named entity disambiguation
phase, first the cluster-based types of a given mention are predicted and then, these types are used
as features in a ranking model to select the best entity among the candidates. We represent entities
at multiple contextual levels and obtain different clusterings (and thus typing models) based
on each level. As each clustering breaks the entity space differently, mention typing based on each
clustering discriminates the mention differently. When predictions from all typing models are
used together, our system achieves better or comparable results based on randomization tests with
respect to the state-of-the-art levels on four defacto test sets.

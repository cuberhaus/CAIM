Machine learning methods exploiting multi-parametric biomarkers, especially based on neuroimaging,
have huge potential to improve early diagnosis of dementia and to predict which individuals are
at-risk of developing dementia. To benchmark algorithms in the field of machine learning and neuroimaging
in dementia and assess their potential for use in clinical practice and clinical trials, seven grand
challenges have been organized in the last decade. The seven grand challenges addressed questions
related to screening, clinical status estimation, prediction and monitoring in (pre-clinical)
dementia. There was little overlap in clinical questions, tasks and performance metrics. Whereas
this aids providing insight on a broad range of questions, it also limits the validation of results
across challenges. The validation process itself was mostly comparable between challenges, using
similar methods for ensuring objective comparison, uncertainty estimation and statistical testing.
In general, winning algorithms performed rigorous data preprocessing and combined a wide range
of input features. Despite high state-of-the-art performances, most of the methods evaluated
by the challenges are not clinically used. To increase impact, future challenges could pay more
attention to statistical analysis of which factors relate to higher performance, to clinical questions
beyond Alzheimer's disease, and to using testing data beyond the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
Initiative. Grand challenges would be an ideal venue for assessing the generalizability of algorithm
performance to unseen data of other cohorts. Key for increasing impact in this way are larger testing
data sizes, which could be reached by sharing algorithms rather than data to exploit data that cannot
be shared.

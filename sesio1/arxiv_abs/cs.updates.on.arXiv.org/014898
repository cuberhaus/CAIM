Humans are naturally endowed with the ability to write in a particular style. They can, for instance,
rephrase a formal letter in an informal way, convey a literal message with the use of figures of speech,
edit a novel mimicking the style of some well-known authors. Automating this form of creativity
constitutes the goal of style transfer. As a natural language generation task, style transfer aims
at re-writing existing texts, and specifically, it creates paraphrases that exhibit some desired
stylistic attributes. From a practical perspective, it envisions beneficial applications, like
chat-bots that modulate their communicative style to appear empathetic, or systems that automatically
simplify technical articles for a non-expert audience. Style transfer has been dedicated several
style-aware paraphrasing methods. A handful of surveys give a methodological overview of the field,
but they do not support researchers to focus on specific styles. With this paper, we aim at providing
a comprehensive discussion of the styles that have received attention in the transfer task. We organize
them into a hierarchy, highlighting the challenges for the definition of each of them, and pointing
out gaps in the current research landscape. The hierarchy comprises two main groups. One encompasses
styles that people modulate arbitrarily, along the lines of registers and genres. The other group
corresponds to unintentionally expressed styles, due to an author's personal characteristics.
Hence, our review shows how the groups relate to one another, and where specific styles, including
some that have never been explored, belong in the hierarchy. Moreover, we summarize the methods
employed for different stylistic families, hinting researchers towards those that would be the
most fitting for future research.

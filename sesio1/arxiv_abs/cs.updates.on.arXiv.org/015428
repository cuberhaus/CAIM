Recently, intelligent scheduling approaches using surrogate models have been proposed to efficiently
allocate volatile tasks in heterogeneous fog environments. Advances like deterministic surrogate
models, deep neural networks (DNN) and gradient-based optimization allow low energy consumption
and response times to be reached. However, deterministic surrogate models, which estimate objective
values for optimization, do not consider the uncertainties in the distribution of the Quality of
Service (QoS) objective function that can lead to high Service Level Agreement (SLA) violation
rates. Moreover, the brittle nature of DNN training and prevent such models from reaching minimal
energy or response times. To overcome these difficulties, we present a novel scheduler: GOSH i.e.
Gradient Based Optimization using Second Order derivatives and Heteroscedastic Deep Surrogate
Models. GOSH uses a second-order gradient based optimization approach to obtain better QoS and
reduce the number of iterations to converge to a scheduling decision, subsequently lowering the
scheduling time. Instead of a vanilla DNN, GOSH uses a Natural Parameter Network to approximate
objective scores. Further, a Lower Confidence Bound optimization approach allows GOSH to find
an optimal trade-off between greedy minimization of the mean latency and uncertainty reduction
by employing error-based exploration. Thus, GOSH and its co-simulation based extension GOSH*,
can adapt quickly and reach better objective scores than baseline methods. We show that GOSH* reaches
better objective scores than GOSH, but it is suitable only for high resource availability settings,
whereas GOSH is apt for limited resource settings. Real system experiments for both GOSH and GOSH*
show significant improvements against the state-of-the-art in terms of energy consumption, response
time and SLA violations by up to 18, 27 and 82 percent, respectively.

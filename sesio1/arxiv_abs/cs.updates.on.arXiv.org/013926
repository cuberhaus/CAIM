Triggered by the COVID-19 crisis, Israel's Ministry of Health (MoH) held a virtual Datathon based
on deidentified governmental data. Organized by a multidisciplinary committee, Israel's research
community was invited to offer insights to COVID-19 policy challenges. The Datathon was designed
to (1) develop operationalizable data-driven models to address COVID-19 health-policy challenges
and (2) build a community of researchers from academia, industry, and government and rebuild their
trust in the government. Three specific challenges were defined based on their relevance (significance,
data availability, and potential to anonymize the data): immunization policies, special needs
of the young population, and populations whose rate of compliance with COVID-19 testing is low.
The MoH team extracted diverse, reliable, up-to-date, and deidentified governmental datasets
for each challenge. Secure remote-access research environments with relevant data science tools
were set on Amazon Web. The MoH screened the applicants and accepted around 80 participants, teaming
them to balance areas of expertise as well as represent all sectors of the community. One week following
the event, anonymous surveys for participants and mentors were distributed to assess overall usefulness
and points for improvement. The 48-hour Datathon and pre-event sessions included 18 multidisciplinary
teams, mentored by 20 data scientists, 6 epidemiologists, 5 presentation mentors, and 12 judges.
The insights developed by the 3 winning teams are currently considered by the MoH as potential data
science methods relevant for national policies. The most positive results were increased trust
in the MoH and greater readiness to work with the government on these or future projects. Detailed
feedback offered concrete lessons for improving the structure and organization of future government-led
datathons.

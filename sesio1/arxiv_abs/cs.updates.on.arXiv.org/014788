The thesis focuses on various techniques to find an alternate approximation method that could be
universally used for a wide range of CFD problems but with low computational cost and low runtime.
Various techniques have been explored within the field of machine learning to gauge the utility
in fulfilling the core ambition. Steady advection diffusion problem has been used as the test case
to understand the level of complexity up to which a method can provide solution. Ultimately, the
focus stays over physics informed machine learning techniques where solving differential equations
is possible without any training with computed data. The prevalent methods by I.E. Lagaris et.al.
and M. Raissi et.al are explored thoroughly. The prevalent methods cannot solve advection dominant
problems. A physics informed method, called as Distributed Physics Informed Neural Network (DPINN),
is proposed to solve advection dominant problems. It increases the lexibility and capability of
older methods by splitting the domain and introducing other physics-based constraints as mean
squared loss terms. Various experiments are done to explore the end to end possibilities with the
method. Parametric study is also done to understand the behavior of the method to different tunable
parameters. The method is tested over steady advection-diffusion problems and unsteady square
pulse problems. Very accurate results are recorded. Extreme learning machine (ELM) is a very fast
neural network algorithm at the cost of tunable parameters. The ELM based variant of the proposed
model is tested over the advection-diffusion problem. ELM makes the complex optimization simpler
and Since the method is non-iterative, the solution is recorded in a single shot. The ELM based variant
seems to work better than the simple DPINN method. Simultaneously scope for various development
in future are hinted throughout the thesis.

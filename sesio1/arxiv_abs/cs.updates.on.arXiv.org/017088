With the rising prevalence of autism diagnoses, it is essential for research to understand how to
leverage technology to support the diverse nature of autistic traits. While traditional interventions
focused on technology for medical cure and rehabilitation, recent research aims to understand
how technology can accommodate each unique situation in an efficient and engaging way. Extended
reality (XR) technology has been shown to be effective in improving attention in autistic users
given that it is more engaging and motivating than other traditional mediums. Here, we conducted
a systematic review of 59 research articles that explored the role of attention in XR interventions
for autistic users. We systematically analyzed demographics, study design and findings, including
autism screening and attention measurement methods. Furthermore, given methodological inconsistencies
in the literature, we systematically synthesize methods and protocols including screening tools,
physiological and behavioral cues of autism and XR tasks. While there is substantial evidence for
the effectiveness of using XR in attention-based interventions for autism to support autistic
traits, we have identified three principal research gaps that provide promising research directions
to examine how autistic populations interact with XR. First, our findings highlight the disproportionate
geographic locations of autism studies and underrepresentation of autistic adults, evidence
of gender disparity, and presence of individuals diagnosed with co-occurring conditions across
studies. Second, many studies used an assortment of standardized and novel tasks and self-report
assessments with limited tested reliability. Lastly, the research lacks evidence of performance
maintenance and transferability.

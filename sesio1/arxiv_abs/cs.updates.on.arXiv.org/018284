Clustering-based methods, which alternate between the generation of pseudo labels and the optimization
of the feature extraction network, play a dominant role in both unsupervised learning (USL) and
unsupervised domain adaptive (UDA) person re-identification (Re-ID). To alleviate the adverse
effect of noisy pseudo labels, the existing methods either abandon unreliable labels or refine
the pseudo labels via mutual learning or label propagation. However, a great many erroneous labels
are still accumulated because these methods mostly adopt traditional unsupervised clustering
algorithms which rely on certain assumptions on data distribution and fail to capture the distribution
of complex real-world data. In this paper, we propose the plug-and-play graph-based pseudo label
correction network (GLC) to refine the pseudo labels in the manner of supervised clustering. GLC
is trained to perceive the varying data distribution at each epoch of the self-training with the
supervision of initial pseudo labels generated by any clustering method. It can learn to rectify
the initial noisy labels by means of the relationship constraints between samples on the k Nearest
Neighbor (kNN) graph and early-stop training strategy. Specifically, GLC learns to aggregate
node features from neighbors and predict whether the nodes should be linked on the graph. Besides,
GLC is optimized with 'early stop' before the noisy labels are severely memorized to prevent overfitting
to noisy pseudo labels. Consequently, GLC improves the quality of pseudo labels though the supervision
signals contain some noise, leading to better Re-ID performance. Extensive experiments in USL
and UDA person Re-ID on Market-1501 and MSMT17 show that our method is widely compatible with various
clustering-based methods and promotes the state-of-the-art performance consistently.

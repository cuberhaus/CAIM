In the past decade, we have witnessed the rise of deep learning to dominate the field of artificial
intelligence. Advances in artificial neural networks alongside corresponding advances in hardware
accelerators with large memory capacity, together with the availability of large datasets enabled
researchers and practitioners alike to train and deploy sophisticated neural network models that
achieve state-of-the-art performance on tasks across several fields spanning computer vision,
natural language processing, and reinforcement learning. However, as these neural networks become
bigger, more complex, and more widely used, fundamental problems with current deep learning models
become more apparent. State-of-the-art deep learning models are known to suffer from issues that
range from poor robustness, inability to adapt to novel task settings, to requiring rigid and inflexible
configuration assumptions. Ideas from collective intelligence, in particular concepts from
complex systems such as self-organization, emergent behavior, swarm optimization, and cellular
systems tend to produce solutions that are robust, adaptable, and have less rigid assumptions about
the environment configuration. It is therefore natural to see these ideas incorporated into newer
deep learning methods. In this review, we will provide a historical context of neural network research's
involvement with complex systems, and highlight several active areas in modern deep learning research
that incorporate the principles of collective intelligence to advance its current capabilities.
To facilitate a bi-directional flow of ideas, we also discuss work that utilize modern deep learning
models to help advance complex systems research. We hope this review can serve as a bridge between
complex systems and deep learning communities to facilitate the cross pollination of ideas and
foster new collaborations across disciplines.

Heat transfer characteristics of nanofluids have been extensively studied since the 1990s. Research
investigations show that the suspended nanoparticles significantly alter the suspension's thermal
properties. The thermal conductivity of nanofluids is one of the properties that is generally found
to be greater than that of the base fluid. This increase in thermal conductivity is found to depend
on several parameters. Several theories have been proposed to model the thermal conductivities
of nanofluids, but there is no reliable universal theory yet to model the anomalous thermal conductivity
of nanofluids. In recent years, supervised data-driven methods have been successfully employed
to create surrogate models across various scientific disciplines, especially for modeling difficult-to-understand
phenomena. These supervised learning methods allow the models to capture highly non-linear phenomena.
In this work, we have taken advantage of existing correlations and used them concurrently with available
experimental results to develop more robust surrogate models for predicting the thermal conductivity
of nanofluids. Artificial neural networks are trained using the transfer learning approach to
predict the thermal conductivity enhancement of nanofluids with spherical particles for 32 different
particle-fluid combinations (8 particles materials and 4 fluids). The large amount of lower accuracy
data generated from correlations is used to coarse-tune the model parameters, and the limited amount
of more trustworthy experimental data is used to fine-tune the model parameters. The transfer learning-based
models' results are compared with those from baseline models which are trained only on experimental
data using a goodness of fit metric. It is found that the transfer learning models perform better
with goodness of fit values of 0.93 as opposed to 0.83 from the baseline models.

Purpose: To develop an algorithm for robust partial Fourier (PF) reconstruction applicable to
diffusion-weighted (DW) images with non-smooth phase variations. Methods: Based on an unrolled
proximal splitting algorithm, a neural network architecture is derived which alternates between
data consistency operations and regularization implemented by recurrent convolutions. In order
to exploit correlations, multiple repetitions of the same slice are jointly reconstructed under
consideration of permutation-equivariance. The algorithm is trained on DW liver data of 60 volunteers
and evaluated on retrospectively and prospectively sub-sampled data of different anatomies and
resolutions. Results: The proposed method is able to significantly outperform conventional PF
techniques on retrospectively sub-sampled data in terms of quantitative measures as well as perceptual
image quality. In this context, joint reconstruction of repetitions as well as the particular type
of recurrent network unrolling are found to be beneficial with respect to reconstruction quality.
On prospectively PF-sampled data, the proposed method enables DW imaging with higher signal without
sacrificing image resolution or introducing additional artifacts. Alternatively, it can be used
to counter the TE increase in acquisitions with higher resolution. Further, generalizability
can be shown to prospective brain data exhibiting anatomies and contrasts not present in the training
set. Conclusion: This work demonstrates that robust PF reconstruction of DW data is feasible even
at strong PF factors in anatomies prone to phase variations. Since the proposed method does not rely
on smoothness priors of the phase but uses learned recurrent convolutions instead, artifacts of
conventional PF methods can be avoided.

Due to the critical importance of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) to the operations of cities and
countries, research into the security of critical infrastructure has become increasingly relevant
and necessary. As a component of both the research and application sides of smart city development,
accurate and precise modeling, simulation, and verification are key parts of a robust design and
development tools that provide critical assistance in the prevention, detection, and recovery
from abnormal behavior in the sensors, controllers, and actuators which make up a modern ICS system.
However, while these tools have potential, there is currently a need for helper-tools to assist
with their setup and configuration, if they are to be utilized widely. Existing state-of-the-art
tools are often technically complex and difficult to customize for any given IoT/ICS processes.
This is a serious barrier to entry for most technicians, engineers, researchers, and smart city
planners, while slowing down the critical aspects of safety and security verification. To remedy
this issue, we take a case study of existing simulation toolkits within the field of water management
and expand on existing tools and algorithms with simplistic automated retrieval functionality
using a much more in-depth and usable customization interface to accelerate simulation scenario
design and implementation, allowing for customization of the cyber-physical network infrastructure
and cyber attack scenarios. We additionally provide a novel in-tool-assessment of network's resilience
according to graph theory path diversity. Further, we lay out a roadmap for future development and
application of the proposed tool, including expansions on resiliency and potential vulnerability
model checking, and discuss applications of our work to other fields relevant to the design and operation
of smart cities.

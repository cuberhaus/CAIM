Starting from 2021, the International Maritime Organization significantly tightened the $\text{NO}_\text{x}$
emission requirements for ships entering the Baltic and the North Sea waters. Since all methods
currently used for the ships' compliance monitoring are costly and require proximity to the ship,
the performance of global and continuous monitoring of the emission standards' fulfillment has
been impossible up to now. A promising approach is the use of remote sensing with the recently launched
TROPOMI/S5P satellite. Due to its unprecedentedly high spatial resolution, it allows for the visual
distinction of $\text{NO}_\text{2}$ plumes of individual ships. To successfully deploy a compliance
monitoring system that is based on TROPOMI data, an automated procedure for the attribution of $\text{NO}_\text{2}$
to individual ships has to be developed. However, due to the extremely low signal-to-noise ratio,
interference with the signal from other - often stronger - sources, and the absence of ground truth,
the task is very challenging. This is the first study proposing an application of supervised learning
for the segmentation of emission plumes produced by individual ships. As such, it is the first step
towards an automated procedure for global ship compliance monitoring using remote sensing data.
To this end, we developed a feature construction method allowing the application of multivariate
models on spatial data. We applied several supervised-learning models and benchmark them towards
existing unsupervised solutions of ship-plume segmentation with TROPOMI satellite data. We showed
that the proposed approach leads to significant plume segmentation improvement and a high correlation
with the theoretically derived measure of the ship's emission potential.

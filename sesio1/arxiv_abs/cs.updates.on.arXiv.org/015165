Nowadays, malware and malware incidents are increasing daily, even with various anti-viruses
systems and malware detection or classification methodologies. Many static, dynamic, and hybrid
techniques have been presented to detect malware and classify them into malware families. Dynamic
and hybrid malware classification methods have advantages over static malware classification
methods by being highly efficient. Since it is difficult to mask malware behavior while executing
than its underlying code in static malware classification, machine learning techniques have been
the main focus of the security experts to detect malware and determine their families dynamically.
The rapid increase of malware also brings the necessity of recent and updated datasets of malicious
software. We introduce two new, updated datasets in this work: One with 9,795 samples obtained and
compiled from VirusSamples and the one with 14,616 samples from VirusShare. This paper also analyzes
multi-class malware classification performance of the balanced and imbalanced version of these
two datasets by using Histogram-based gradient boosting, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine,
and XGBoost models with API call-based dynamic malware classification. Results show that Support
Vector Machine, achieves the highest score of 94% in the imbalanced VirusSample dataset, whereas
the same model has 91% accuracy in the balanced VirusSample dataset. While XGBoost, one of the most
common gradient boosting-based models, achieves the highest score of 90% and 80%.in both versions
of the VirusShare dataset. This paper also presents the baseline results of VirusShare and VirusSample
datasets by using the four most widely known machine learning techniques in dynamic malware classification
literature. We believe that these two datasets and baseline results enable researchers in this
field to test and validate their methods and approaches.

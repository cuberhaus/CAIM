Binary analysis of software is a critical step in cyber forensics applications such as program vulnerability
assessment and malware detection. This involves interpreting instructions executed by software
and often necessitates converting the software's binary file data to assembly language. The conversion
process requires information about the binary file's target instruction set architecture (ISA).
However, ISA information might not be included in binary files due to compilation errors, partial
downloads, or adversarial corruption of file metadata. Machine learning (ML) is a promising methodology
that can be used to identify the target ISA using binary data in the object code section of binary files.
In this paper we propose a binary code feature extraction model to improve the accuracy and scalability
of ML-based ISA identification methods. Our feature extraction model can be used in the absence
of domain knowledge about the ISAs. Specifically, we adapt models from natural language processing
(NLP) to i) identify successive byte patterns commonly observed in binary codes, ii) estimate the
significance of each byte pattern to a binary file, and iii) estimate the relevance of each byte pattern
in distinguishing between ISAs. We introduce character-level features of encoded binaries to
identify fine-grained bit patterns inherent to each ISA. We use a dataset with binaries from 12 different
ISAs to evaluate our approach. Empirical evaluations show that using our byte-level features in
ML-based ISA identification results in an 8% higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art features
based on byte-histograms and byte pattern signatures. We observe that character-level features
allow reducing the size of the feature set by up to 16x while maintaining accuracy above 97%.

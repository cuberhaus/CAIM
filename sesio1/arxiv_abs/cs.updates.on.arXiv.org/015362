Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are broadly applied in engineering and physics.
A standard description of fluid dynamics requires solving the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations in
different flow regimes. However, applications of CFD simulations are computationally-limited
by the availability, speed, and parallelism of high-performance computing. To improve computational
efficiency, machine learning techniques have been used to create accelerated data-driven approximations
for CFD. A majority of such approaches rely on large labeled CFD datasets that are expensive to obtain
at the scale necessary to build robust data-driven models. We develop a weakly-supervised approach
to solve the steady-state N-S equations under various boundary conditions, using a multi-channel
input with boundary and geometric conditions. We achieve state-of-the-art results without any
labeled simulation data, but using a custom data-driven and physics-informed loss function by
using and small-scale solutions to prime the model to solve the N-S equations. To improve the resolution
and predictability, we train stacked models of increasing complexity generating the numerical
solutions for N-S equations. Without expensive computations, our model achieves high predictability
with a variety of obstacles and boundary conditions. Given its high flexibility, the model can generate
a solution on a 64 x 64 domain within 5 ms on a regular desktop computer which is 1000 times faster than
a regular CFD solver. Translation of interactive CFD simulation on local consumer computing hardware
enables new applications in real-time predictions on the internet of things devices where data
transfer is prohibitive and can increase the scale, speed, and computational cost of boundary-value
fluid problems.

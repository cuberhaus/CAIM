Mobile robot autonomy has made significant advances in recent years, with navigation algorithms
well developed and used commercially in certain well-defined environments, such as warehouses.
The common link in usage scenarios is that the environments in which the robots are utilized have
a high degree of certainty. Operating environments are often designed to be robot friendly, for
example augmented reality markers are strategically placed and the ground is typically smooth,
level, and clear of debris. For robots to be useful in a wider range of environments, especially environments
that are not sanitized for their use, robots must be able to handle uncertainty. This requires a robot
to incorporate new sensors and sources of information, and to be able to use this information to make
decisions regarding navigation and the overall mission. When using autonomous mobile robots in
unstructured and poorly defined environments, such as a natural disaster site or in a rural environment,
ground condition is of critical importance and is a common cause of failure. Examples include loss
of traction due to high levels of ground water, hidden cavities, or material boundary failures.
To evaluate a non-contact sensing method to mitigate these risks, Frequency Modulated Continuous
Wave (FMCW) radar is integrated with an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV), representing a novel application
of FMCW to detect new measurands for Robotic Autonomous Systems (RAS) navigation, informing on
terrain integrity and adding to the state-of-the-art in sensing for optimized autonomous path
planning. In this paper, the FMCW is first evaluated in a desktop setting to determine its performance
in anticipated ground conditions. The FMCW is then fixed to a UGV and the sensor system is tested and
validated in a representative environment containing regions with significant levels of ground
water saturation.

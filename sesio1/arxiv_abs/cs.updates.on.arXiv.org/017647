With the explosive growth of data and wireless devices, federated learning (FL) over wireless medium
has emerged as a promising technology for large-scale distributed intelligent systems. Yet, the
urgent demand for ubiquitous intelligence will generate a large number of concurrent FL tasks,
which may seriously aggravate the scarcity of communication resources. By exploiting the analog
superposition of electromagnetic waves, over-the-air computation (AirComp) is an appealing
solution to alleviate the burden of communication required by FL. However, sharing frequency-time
resources in over-the-air computation inevitably brings about the problem of inter-task interference,
which poses a new challenge that needs to be appropriately addressed. In this paper, we study over-the-air
federated multi-task learning (OA-FMTL) over the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multiple
access (MAC) channel. We propose a novel model aggregation method for the alignment of local gradients
of different devices, which alleviates the straggler problem in over-the-air computation due
to the channel heterogeneity. We establish a communication-learning analysis framework for the
proposed OA-FMTL scheme by considering the spatial correlation between devices, and formulate
an optimization problem for the design of transceiver beamforming and device selection. To solve
this problem, we develop an algorithm by using alternating optimization (AO) and fractional programming
(FP), which effectively mitigates the impact of inter-task interference on the FL learning performance.
We show that due to the use of the new model aggregation method, device selection is no longer essential,
thereby avoiding the heavy computational burden involved in selecting active devices. Numerical
results demonstrate the validity of the analysis and the superb performance of the proposed scheme.

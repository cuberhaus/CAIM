Graph structured data often possess dynamic characters in nature, e.g., the addition of links and
nodes, in many real-world applications. Recent years have witnessed the increasing attentions
paid to dynamic graph neural networks for modelling such graph data, where almost all the existing
approaches assume that when a new link is built, the embeddings of the neighbor nodes should be updated
by learning the temporal dynamics to propagate new information. However, such approaches suffer
from the limitation that if the node introduced by a new connection contains noisy information,
propagating its knowledge to other nodes is not reliable and even leads to the collapse of the model.
In this paper, we propose AdaNet: a robust knowledge Adaptation framework via reinforcement learning
for dynamic graph neural Networks. In contrast to previous approaches immediately updating the
embeddings of the neighbor nodes once adding a new link, AdaNet attempts to adaptively determine
which nodes should be updated because of the new link involved. Considering that the decision whether
to update the embedding of one neighbor node will have great impact on other neighbor nodes, we thus
formulate the selection of node update as a sequence decision problem, and address this problem
via reinforcement learning. By this means, we can adaptively propagate knowledge to other nodes
for learning robust node embedding representations. To the best of our knowledge, our approach
constitutes the first attempt to explore robust knowledge adaptation via reinforcement learning
for dynamic graph neural networks. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate
that AdaNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance. In addition, we perform the experiments
by adding different degrees of noise into the dataset, quantitatively and qualitatively illustrating
the robustness of AdaNet.

The introduction of electronic trading platforms effectively changed the organisation of traditional
systemic trading from quote-driven markets into order-driven markets. Its convenience led to
an exponentially increasing amount of financial data, which is however hard to use for the prediction
of future prices, due to the low signal-to-noise ratio and the non-stationarity of financial time
series. Simpler classification tasks -- where the goal is to predict the directions of future price
movement -- via supervised learning algorithms, need sufficiently reliable labels to generalise
well. Labelling financial data is however less well defined than other domains: did the price go
up because of noise or because of signal? The existing labelling methods have limited countermeasures
against noise and limited effects in improving learning algorithms. This work takes inspiration
from image classification in trading and success in self-supervised learning. We investigate
the idea of applying computer vision techniques to financial time-series to reduce the noise exposure
and hence generate correct labels. We look at the label generation as the pretext task of a self-supervised
learning approach and compare the naive (and noisy) labels, commonly used in the literature, with
the labels generated by a denoising autoencoder for the same downstream classification task. Our
results show that our denoised labels improve the performances of the downstream learning algorithm,
for both small and large datasets. We further show that the signals we obtain can be used to effectively
trade with binary strategies. We suggest that with proposed techniques, self-supervised learning
constitutes a powerful framework for generating "better" financial labels that are useful for
studying the underlying patterns of the market.

In bridge inspection, engineers should diagnose the observed bridge defects by identifying the
factors underlying those defects. Traditionally, engineers search and organize structural condition-related
information based on visual inspections. Even following the same qualitative inspection standards,
experienced engineers tend to find the critical defects and predict the underlying reasons more
reliably than less experienced ones. Unique bridge and site conditions, quality of available data,
and personal skills and knowledge collectively influence such a subjective nature of data-driven
bridge diagnosis. Unfortunately, the lack of detailed data about how experienced engineers observe
bridge defects and identify failure modes makes it hard to comprehend what engineers' behaviors
form the best practice of producing reliable bridge inspection. Besides, even experienced engineers
could sometimes fail to notice critical defects, thereby producing inconsistent, conflicting
condition assessments. Therefore, a detailed cognitive behavior analysis of bridge inspectors
is critical for enabling a proactive inspector coaching system that uses inspectors' behavior
histories to complement personal limitations. This paper presents a computational framework
for revealing engineers' observation and cognitive-behavioral processes to identify bridge
defects and produce diagnosis conclusions. The authors designed a bridge inspection game consisting
of FEM simulation data and inspection reports to capture and analyze experienced and inexperienced
engineers' diagnosis behaviors. Mining these behavioral logs have revealed reusable behavioral
process patterns that map critical bridge defects and diagnosis conclusions. The results indicate
that the proposed method can proactively share inspection experiences and improve inspection
processes' explainability and reliability.

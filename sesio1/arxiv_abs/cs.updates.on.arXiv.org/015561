Cell-free massive MIMO is one of the key technologies for future wireless communications, in which
users are simultaneously and jointly served by all access points (APs). In this paper, we investigate
the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation of effective channel coefficients in cell-free
massive MIMO systems with massive connectivity. To facilitate the theoretical analysis, only
single measurement vector (SMV) based MMSE estimation is considered in this paper, i.e., the MMSE
estimation is performed based on the received pilot signals at each AP separately. Inspired by the
decoupling principle of replica symmetric postulated MMSE estimation of sparse signal vectors
with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) non-zero components, we develop the corresponding
decoupling principle for the SMV based MMSE estimation of sparse signal vectors with independent
and non-identically distributed (i.n.i.d.) non-zero components, which plays a key role in the
theoretical analysis of SMV based MMSE estimation of the effective channel coefficients in cell-free
massive MIMO systems with massive connectivity. Subsequently, based on the obtained decoupling
principle of MMSE estimation, likelihood ratio test and the optimal fusion rule, we perform user
activity detection based on the received pilot signals at only one AP, or cooperation among the entire
set of APs for centralized or distributed detection. Via theoretical analysis, we show that the
error probabilities of both centralized and distributed detection tend to zero when the number
of APs tends to infinity while the asymptotic ratio between the number of users and pilots is kept
constant. We also investigate the asymptotic behavior of oracle estimation in cell-free massive
MIMO systems with massive connectivity via random matrix theory.

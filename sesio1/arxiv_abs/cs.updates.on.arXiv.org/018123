We consider an ultra-low-complexity multi-group multicast beamforming design for large-scale
systems. For the quality-of-service (QoS) problem, by utilizing the optimal multicast beamforming
structure obtained recently in [2], we convert the original problem into a non-convex weight optimization
problem of a lower dimension and propose two fast first-order algorithms to solve it. Both algorithms
are based on successive convex approximation (SCA) and provide fast iterative updates to solve
each SCA subproblem. The first algorithm uses a saddle point reformulation in the dual domain and
applies the extragradient method with an adaptive step-size procedure to find the saddle point
with simple closed-form updates. The second algorithm adopts the alternating direction method
of multipliers (ADMM) method by converting each SCA subproblem into a favorable ADMM structure.
The structure leads to simple closed-form ADMM updates, where the problem in each update block can
be further decomposed into parallel subproblems of small sizes, for which closed-form solutions
are obtained. We also propose efficient initialization methods to obtain favorable initial points
that facilitate fast convergence. Furthermore, taking advantage of the proposed fast algorithms,
for the max-min fair (MMF) problem, we propose a simple closed-form scaling scheme that directly
uses the solution obtained from the QoS problem, avoiding the conventional computationally expensive
method that iteratively solves the inverse QoS problem. We further develop lower and upper bounds
on the performance of this scaling scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms
offer near-optimal performance with substantially lower computational complexity than the state-of-the-art
algorithms for large-scale systems.

Clinicians may rely on medical coding systems such as International Classification of Diseases
(ICD) to identify patients with diseases from Electronic Health Records (EHRs). However, due to
the lack of detail and specificity as well as a probability of miscoding, recent studies suggest
the ICD codes often cannot characterise patients accurately for specific diseases in real clinical
practice, and as a result, using them to find patients for studies or trials can result in high failure
rates and missing out on uncoded patients. Manual inspection of all patients at scale is not feasible
as it is highly costly and slow. This paper proposes a scalable workflow which leverages both structured
data and unstructured textual notes from EHRs with techniques including NLP, AutoML and Clinician-in-the-Loop
mechanism to build machine learning classifiers to identify patients at scale with given diseases,
especially those who might currently be miscoded or missed by ICD codes. Case studies in the MIMIC-III
dataset were conducted where the proposed workflow demonstrates a higher classification performance
in terms of F1 scores compared to simply using ICD codes on gold testing subset to identify patients
with Ovarian Cancer (0.901 vs 0.814), Lung Cancer (0.859 vs 0.828), Cancer Cachexia (0.862 vs 0.650),
and Lupus Nephritis (0.959 vs 0.855). Also, the proposed workflow that leverages unstructured
notes consistently outperforms the baseline that uses structured data only with an increase of
F1 (Ovarian Cancer 0.901 vs 0.719, Lung Cancer 0.859 vs 0.787, Cancer Cachexia 0.862 vs 0.838 and
Lupus Nephritis 0.959 vs 0.785). Experiments on the large testing set also demonstrate the proposed
workflow can find more patients who are miscoded or missed by ICD codes. Moreover, interpretability
studies are also conducted to clinically validate the top impact features of the classifiers.

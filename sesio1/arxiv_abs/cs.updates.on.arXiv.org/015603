Data processing and analysis pipelines in cosmological survey experiments introduce data perturbations
that can significantly degrade the performance of deep learning-based models. Given the increased
adoption of supervised deep learning methods for processing and analysis of cosmological survey
data, the assessment of data perturbation effects and the development of methods that increase
model robustness are increasingly important. In the context of morphological classification
of galaxies, we study the effects of perturbations in imaging data. In particular, we examine the
consequences of using neural networks when training on baseline data and testing on perturbed data.
We consider perturbations associated with two primary sources: 1) increased observational noise
as represented by higher levels of Poisson noise and 2) data processing noise incurred by steps such
as image compression or telescope errors as represented by one-pixel adversarial attacks. We also
test the efficacy of domain adaptation techniques in mitigating the perturbation-driven errors.
We use classification accuracy, latent space visualizations, and latent space distance to assess
model robustness. Without domain adaptation, we find that processing pixel-level errors easily
flip the classification into an incorrect class and that higher observational noise makes the model
trained on low-noise data unable to classify galaxy morphologies. On the other hand, we show that
training with domain adaptation improves model robustness and mitigates the effects of these perturbations,
improving the classification accuracy by 23% on data with higher observational noise. Domain adaptation
also increases by a factor of ~2.3 the latent space distance between the baseline and the incorrectly
classified one-pixel perturbed image, making the model more robust to inadvertent perturbations.

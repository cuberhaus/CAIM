We study a bilevel optimization problem which is a zero-sum Stackelberg game. In this problem, there
are two players, a leader and a follower, who pick items from a common set. Both the leader and the follower
have their own (multi-dimensional) budgets, respectively. Each item is associated with a profit,
which is the same to the leader and the follower, and will consume the leader's (follower's) budget
if it is selected by the leader (follower). The leader and the follower will select items in a sequential
way: First, the leader selects items within the leader's budget. Then the follower selects items
from the remaining items within the follower's budget. The goal of the leader is to minimize the maximum
profit that the follower can obtain. Let $s_A$ and $s_B$ be the dimension of the leader's and follower's
budget, respectively. A special case of our problem is the bilevel knapsack problem studied by Caprara
et al. [SIAM Journal on Optimization, 2014], where $s_A=s_B=1$. We consider the general problem
and obtain an $(s_B+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm when $s_A$ and $s_B$ are both constant.
In particular, if $s_B=1$, our algorithm implies a PTAS for the bilevel knapsack problem, which
is the first O(1)-approximation algorithm. We also complement our result by showing that there
does not exist any $(4/3-\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm even if $s_A=1$ and $s_B=2$. We also
consider a variant of our problem with resource augmentation when $s_A$ and $s_B$ are both part of
the input. We obtain an O(1)-approximation algorithm with O(1)-resource augmentation, that is,
we give an algorithm that returns a solution which exceeds the given leader's budget by O(1) times,
and the objective value achieved by the solution is O(1) times the optimal objective value that respects
the leader's budget.

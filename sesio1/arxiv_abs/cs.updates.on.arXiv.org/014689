Mobile network is evolving from a communication-only network towards one with joint communication
and radar/radio sensing (JCAS) capabilities, that we call perceptive mobile network (PMN). In
PMNs, JCAS integrates sensing into communications, sharing a majority of system modules and the
same transmitted signals. The PMN is expected to provide a ubiquitous radio sensing platform and
enable a vast number of novel smart applications, whilst providing non-compromised communications.
In this paper, we present a broad picture of the motivation, methodologies, challenges, and research
opportunities of realizing PMN, by providing a comprehensive survey for systems and technologies
developed mainly in the last ten years. Beginning by reviewing the work on coexisting communication
and radar systems, we highlight their limits on addressing the interference problem, and then introduce
the JCAS technology. We then set up JCAS in the mobile network context and envisage its potential
applications. We continue to provide a brief review of three types of JCAS systems, with particular
attention to their differences in design philosophy. We then introduce a framework of PMN, including
the system platform and infrastructure, three types of sensing operations, and signals usable
for sensing. Subsequently, we discuss required system modifications to enable sensing on current
communication-only infrastructure. Within the context of PMN, we review stimulating research
problems and potential solutions, organized under nine topics: performance bounds, waveform
optimization, antenna array design, clutter suppression, sensing parameter estimation, resolution
of sensing ambiguity, pattern analysis, networked sensing under cellular topology, and sensing-assisted
communications. We conclude the paper by listing key open research problems for the aforementioned
topics and sharing some lessons that we have learned.

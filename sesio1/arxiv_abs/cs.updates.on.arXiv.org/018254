Deep neural network (DNN) and its variants have been extensively used for a wide spectrum of real
applications such as image classification, face/speech recognition, fraud detection, and so
on. In addition to many important machine learning tasks, as artificial networks emulating the
way brain cells function, DNNs also show the capability of storing non-linear relationships between
input and output data, which exhibits the potential of storing data via DNNs. We envision a new paradigm
of data storage, "DNN-as-a-Database", where data are encoded in well-trained machine learning
models. Compared with conventional data storage that directly records data in raw formats, learning-based
structures (e.g., DNN) can implicitly encode data pairs of inputs and outputs and compute/materialize
actual output data of different resolutions only if input data are provided. This new paradigm can
greatly enhance the data security by allowing flexible data privacy settings on different levels,
achieve low space consumption and fast computation with the acceleration of new hardware (e.g.,
Diffractive Neural Network and AI chips), and can be generalized to distributed DNN-based storage/computing.
In this paper, we propose this novel concept of learning-based data storage, which utilizes a learning
structure called learning-based memory unit (LMU), to store, organize, and retrieve data. As a
case study, we use DNNs as the engine in the LMU, and study the data capacity and accuracy of the DNN-based
data storage. Our preliminary experimental results show the feasibility of the learning-based
data storage by achieving high (100%) accuracy of the DNN storage. We explore and design effective
solutions to utilize the DNN-based data storage to manage and query relational tables. We discuss
how to generalize our solutions to other data types (e.g., graphs) and environments such as distributed
DNN storage/computing.

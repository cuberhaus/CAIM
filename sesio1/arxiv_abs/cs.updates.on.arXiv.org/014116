We propose three constructions of classically verifiable non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs
and arguments (CV-NIZK) for QMA in various preprocessing models. - We construct a CV-NIZK for QMA
in the quantum secret parameter model where a trusted setup sends a quantum proving key to the prover
and a classical verification key to the verifier. It is information theoretically sound and zero-knowledge.
- Assuming the quantum hardness of the learning with errors problem, we construct a CV-NIZK for QMA
in a model where a trusted party generates a CRS and the verifier sends an instance-independent quantum
message to the prover as preprocessing. This model is the same as one considered in the recent work
by Coladangelo, Vidick, and Zhang (CRYPTO '20). Our construction has the so-called dual-mode property,
which means that there are two computationally indistinguishable modes of generating CRS, and
we have information theoretical soundness in one mode and information theoretical zero-knowledge
property in the other. This answers an open problem left by Coladangelo et al, which is to achieve
either of soundness or zero-knowledge information theoretically. To the best of our knowledge,
ours is the first dual-mode NIZK for QMA in any kind of model. - We construct a CV-NIZK for QMA with quantum
preprocessing in the quantum random oracle model. This quantum preprocessing is the one where the
verifier sends a random Pauli-basis states to the prover. Our construction uses the Fiat-Shamir
transformation. The quantum preprocessing can be replaced with the setup that distributes Bell
pairs among the prover and the verifier, and therefore we solve the open problem by Broadbent and
Grilo (FOCS '20) about the possibility of NIZK for QMA in the shared Bell pair model via the Fiat-Shamir
transformation.

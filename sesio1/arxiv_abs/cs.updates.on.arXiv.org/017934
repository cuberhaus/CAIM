Among the different types of skin cancer, melanoma is considered to be the deadliest and is difficult
to treat at advanced stages. Detection of melanoma at earlier stages can lead to reduced mortality
rates. Desktop-based computer-aided systems have been developed to assist dermatologists with
early diagnosis. However, there is significant interest in developing portable, at-home melanoma
diagnostic systems which can assess the risk of cancerous skin lesions. Here, we present a smartphone
application that combines image capture capabilities with preprocessing and segmentation to
extract the Asymmetry, Border irregularity, Color variegation, and Diameter (ABCD) features
of a skin lesion. Using the feature sets, classification of malignancy is achieved through support
vector machine classifiers. By using adaptive algorithms in the individual data-processing stages,
our approach is made computationally light, user friendly, and reliable in discriminating melanoma
cases from benign ones. Images of skin lesions are either captured with the smartphone camera or
imported from public datasets. The entire process from image capture to classification runs on
an Android smartphone equipped with a detachable 10x lens, and processes an image in less than a second.
The overall performance metrics are evaluated on a public database of 200 images with Synthetic
Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) (80% sensitivity, 90% specificity, 88% accuracy, and
0.85 area under curve (AUC)) and without SMOTE (55% sensitivity, 95% specificity, 90% accuracy,
and 0.75 AUC). The evaluated performance metrics and computation times are comparable or better
than previous methods. This all-inclusive smartphone application is designed to be easy-to-download
and easy-to-navigate for the end user, which is imperative for the eventual democratization of
such medical diagnostic systems.

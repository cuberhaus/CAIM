In light of the finite nature of the wireless spectrum and the increasing demand for spectrum use
arising from recent technological breakthroughs in wireless communication, the problem of interference
continues to persist. Despite recent advancements in resolving interference issues, interference
still presents a difficult challenge to effective usage of the spectrum. This is partly due to the
rise in the use of license-free and managed shared bands for Wi-Fi, long term evolution (LTE) unlicensed
(LTE-U), LTE licensed assisted access (LAA), 5G NR, and other opportunistic spectrum access solutions.
As a result of this, the need for efficient spectrum usage schemes that are robust against interference
has never been more important. In the past, most solutions to interference have addressed the problem
by using avoidance techniques as well as non-AI mitigation approaches (for example, adaptive filters).
The key downside to non-AI techniques is the need for domain expertise in the extraction or exploitation
of signal features such as cyclostationarity, bandwidth and modulation of the interfering signals.
More recently, researchers have successfully explored AI/ML enabled physical (PHY) layer techniques,
especially deep learning which reduces or compensates for the interfering signal instead of simply
avoiding it. The underlying idea of ML based approaches is to learn the interference or the interference
characteristics from the data, thereby sidelining the need for domain expertise in suppressing
the interference. In this paper, we review a wide range of techniques that have used deep learning
to suppress interference. We provide comparison and guidelines for many different types of deep
learning techniques in interference suppression. In addition, we highlight challenges and potential
future research directions for the successful adoption of deep learning in interference suppression.

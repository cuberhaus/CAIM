[Purpose] The pathology is decisive for disease diagnosis, but relies heavily on the experienced
pathologists. Recently, pathological artificial intelligence (PAI) is thought to improve diagnostic
accuracy and efficiency. However, the high performance of PAI based on deep learning in the laboratory
generally cannot be reproduced in the clinic. [Methods] Because the data preparation is important
for PAI, the paper has reviewed PAI-related studies in the PubMed database published from January
2017 to February 2022, and 118 studies were included. The in-depth analysis of methods for preparing
data is performed, including obtaining slides of pathological tissue, cleaning, screening, and
then digitizing. Expert review, image annotation, dataset division for model training and validation
are also discussed. We further discuss the reasons why the high performance of PAI is not reproducible
in the clinical practices and show some effective ways to improve clinical performances of PAI.
[Results] The robustness of PAI depend on randomized collection of representative disease slides,
including rigorous quality control and screening, correction of digital discrepancies, reasonable
annotation, and the amount of data. The digital pathology is fundamental of clinical-grade PAI,
and the techniques of data standardization and weakly supervised learning methods based on whole
slide image (WSI) are effective ways to overcome obstacles of performance reproduction. [Conclusion]
The representative data, the amount of labeling and consistency from multi-centers is the key to
performance reproduction. The digital pathology for clinical diagnosis, data standardization
and technique of WSI-based weakly supervised learning hopefully build clinical-grade PAI. Keywords:

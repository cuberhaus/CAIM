Mining processes of Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies are currently incentivized with voluntary
transaction fees and fixed block rewards which will halve gradually to zero. In the setting where
optional and arbitrary transaction fee becomes the prominent/remaining incentive, Carlsten
et al. [CCS 2016] find that an undercutting attack can become the equilibrium strategy for miners.
In undercutting, the attacker deliberately forks an existing chain by leaving wealthy transactions
unclaimed to attract petty complaint miners to its fork. We observe that two simplifying assumptions
in [CCS 2016] of fees arriving at fixed rates and miners collecting all accumulated fees regardless
of block size limit are often infeasible in practice, thus inaccurately inflating its profitability.
The intuition is that the fees deliberately left out by an undercutter may not be attractive to other
miners (hence to the attacker itself): the left-out transactions may not fit into a block without
"squeezing out" other to-be transactions, and thus claimable fees in the next round cannot be raised
arbitrarily. This work views undercutting and shifting among chains as mining strategies of rational
miners. We model profitability of undercutting strategy with block size limit present, which bounds
the claimable fees in a round and gives rise to a pending transaction set. In the proposed model, we
first identify conditions necessary to make undercutting profitable. We then present an easy-to-deploy
defense against undercutting by selectively assembling transactions into a new block to invalidate
the identified conditions. Indeed, in a typical setting with undercutters present, applying the
avoidance technique is a Nash Equilibrium. Finally, we complement the analytical results with
an experimental analysis using both artificial data of normally distributed fee rates and actual
transactions in Bitcoin and Monero.

Glioblastomas are the most common malignant brain tumors in adults. Approximately 200000 people
die each year from Glioblastoma in the world. Glioblastoma patients have a median survival of 12
months with optimal therapy and about 4 months without treatment. Glioblastomas appear as heterogeneous
necrotic masses with irregular peripheral enhancement, surrounded by vasogenic edema. The current
standard of care includes surgical resection, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, which require accurate
segmentation of brain tumor subregions. For effective treatment planning, it is vital to identify
the methylation status of the promoter of Methylguanine Methyltransferase (MGMT), a positive
prognostic factor for chemotherapy. However, current methods for brain tumor segmentation are
tedious, subjective and not scalable, and current techniques to determine the methylation status
of MGMT promoter involve surgically invasive procedures, which are expensive and time consuming.
Hence there is a pressing need to develop automated tools to segment brain tumors and non-invasive
methods to predict methylation status of MGMT promoter, to facilitate better treatment planning
and improve survival rate. I created an integrated diagnostics solution powered by Artificial
Intelligence to automatically segment brain tumor subregions and predict MGMT promoter methylation
status, using brain MRI scans. My AI solution is proven on large datasets with performance exceeding
current standards and field tested with data from teaching files of local neuroradiologists. With
my solution, physicians can submit brain MRI images, and get segmentation and methylation predictions
in minutes, and guide brain tumor patients with effective treatment planning and ultimately improve
survival time.

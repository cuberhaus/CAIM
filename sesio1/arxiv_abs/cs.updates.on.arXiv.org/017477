Radio-frequency portion of the electromagnetic spectrum is a scarce resource. Cognitive radio
technology has emerged as a promising solution to overcome the spectrum scarcity bottleneck. Through
this technology, secondary users (SUs) sense the spectrum opportunities free from primary users
(PUs), and opportunistically take advantage of these (temporarily) idle portions, known as spectrum
holes. In this correspondence, we consider a variant of the cognitive radio resource allocation
problem posed by Martinovic et al. in 2017. The distinguishing feature of this version of the problem
is that each SU, due to its hardware limitations, imposes the requirement that the to-be-aggregated
spectrum holes cannot be arbitrarily far from each other. We call this restriction as the Maximal
Aggregation Range (MAR) constraint, and refer to this variant of the problem as the MAR-constrained
hole assignment problem. The problem can be formalized as an NP-hard combinatorial optimization
problem. We propose a novel binary integer linear programming (ILP) formulation to the problem.
The number of constraints in this formulation is the number of spectrum holes plus the number of SUs.
On the other hand, the number of binary decision variables in the formulation can be prohibitively
large, as for each legitimate spectrum allocation to each SU, one variable is needed. We propose
a branch-and-price (B&P) framework to tackle this challenge. This framework is in fact a branch-and-bound
procedure in which at each node of the search tree, we utilize the so-called (delayed) column generation
technique for solving the LP relaxation of the corresponding subproblem. As evidenced by the numerical
results, the LP relaxation bounds are very tight. This allows for a very effective pruning of the
search space. Compared to the previously suggested formulations, the proposed technique can require
much less computational effort.

This paper proposes a low-cost and highly accurate ECG-monitoring system intended for personalized
early arrhythmia detection for wearable mobile sensors. Earlier supervised approaches for personalized
ECG monitoring require both abnormal and normal heartbeats for the training of the dedicated classifier.
However, in a real-world scenario where the personalized algorithm is embedded in a wearable device,
such training data is not available for healthy people with no cardiac disorder history. In this
study, (i) we propose a null space analysis on the healthy signal space obtained via sparse dictionary
learning, and investigate how a simple null space projection or alternatively regularized least
squares-based classification methods can reduce the computational complexity, without sacrificing
the detection accuracy, when compared to sparse representation-based classification. (ii) Then
we introduce a sparse representation-based domain adaptation technique in order to project other
existing users' abnormal and normal signals onto the new user's signal space, enabling us to train
the dedicated classifier without having any abnormal heartbeat of the new user. Therefore, zero-shot
learning can be achieved without the need for synthetic abnormal heartbeat generation. An extensive
set of experiments performed on the benchmark MIT-BIH ECG dataset shows that when this domain adaptation-based
training data generator is used with a simple 1-D CNN classifier, the method outperforms the prior
work by a significant margin. (iii) Then, by combining (i) and (ii), we propose an ensemble classifier
that further improves the performance. This approach for zero-shot arrhythmia detection achieves
an average accuracy level of 98.2% and an F1-Score of 92.8%. Finally, a personalized energy-efficient
ECG monitoring scheme is proposed using the above-mentioned innovations.

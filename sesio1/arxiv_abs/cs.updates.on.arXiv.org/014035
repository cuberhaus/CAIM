Given the ubiquity of memory in commodity electronic devices, fingerprinting memory is a compelling
proposition, especially for low-end Internet of Things (IoT) devices where cryptographic modules
are often unavailable. However, the use of fingerprints in security functions is challenged by
the inexact reproductions of fingerprints from the same device at different time instances due
to various noise sources causing, small, but unpredictable variations in fingerprint measurements.
Our study formulates a novel and \textit{pragmatic} approach to achieve the elusive goal of affording
highly reliable fingerprints from device memories. We investigate the transformation of raw fingerprints
into a noise-tolerant space where the generation of fingerprints from memory biometrics is intrinsically
highly reliable. Further, we derive formal performance bounds to support practitioners to adopt
our methods for practical applications. Subsequently, we demonstrate the expressive power of
our formalization by using it to investigate the practicability of extracting noise-tolerant
fingerprints from commodity devices. We have employed a set of 38 memory chips including SRAM (69,206,016
cells), Flash (3,902,976 cells) and EEPROM (32,768 cells) ubiquitously embedded in low-end commodity
devices from 6 different manufacturers for extensive experimental validations. Our results demonstrate
that noise-tolerant fingerprints -- achieving a key failure rate less than $10^{-6}$ -- can always
be efficiently afforded from tested memories with a solely fingerprint snap-shot enrollment.
Further, we employ a low-cost wearable Bluetooth inertial sensor and demonstrate a practical,
end-to-end implementation of a remote attestation security function built upon a root key from
noise-tolerant SRAM fingerprints generated on demand and at run-time.

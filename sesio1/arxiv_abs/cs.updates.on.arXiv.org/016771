Recent advances in 5G wireless technology and socioeconomic transformation have brought a paradigm
shift in sensor applications. Wi-Fi signal demonstrates a strong correlation between its temporal
variation and body movements, which can be leveraged to recognize human activity. In this article,
we demonstrate the cognitive ability of device free mutual human-to-human interaction recognition
method based on the time scale Wi-Fi channel state information. The mutual activities examined
are steady-state, approaching, departing, handshaking, high-five, hugging, kicking (left-leg),
kicking (right-leg), pointing (left-hand), pointing (right-hand), punching(left-hand), punching
(right-hand), and pushing. We explore and propose a Self-Attention furnished Bidirectional Gated
Recurrent Neural Network model to classify the 13 interaction types from the time-series data through
automated temporal feature extraction. Our proposed model can recognize a two subject pair mutual
interaction with a maximum benchmark accuracy of 94%. This has been expanded for ten subject pairs,
which secured a benchmark accuracy of 88% with improved classification around the interaction-transition
region. Also, an executable graphical user interface (GUI) is developed, using the PyQt5 python
module, to subsequently display the overall mutual human-interaction recognition procedure
in real-time. Finally, we conclude with a brief discourse regarding the possible solutions to the
handicaps that resulted in curtailments observed during the study. Such, Wi-Fi channel perturbation
pattern analysis is believed to be an efficient, economical & privacy-friendly approach to be potentially
utilized in mutual human-interaction recognition for indoor activity monitoring, surveillance
system, smart health monitoring systems & independent assisted living.

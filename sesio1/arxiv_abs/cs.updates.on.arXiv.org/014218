The Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) codes are a well-studied subclass of cyclic codes that have
found numerous applications in error correction and notably in quantum information processing.
A subclass of attractive BCH codes is the narrow-sense BCH codes over the Galois field $\mathrm{GF}(q)$
with length $q+1$, which are closely related to the action of the projective general linear group
of degree two on the projective line. This paper aims to study some of the codes within this class and
specifically narrow-sense antiprimitive BCH codes (these codes are also linear complementary
duals (LCD) codes that have interesting practical recent applications in cryptography, among
other benefits). We shall use tools and combine arguments from algebraic coding theory, combinatorial
designs, and group theory (group actions, representation theory of finite groups, etc.) to investigate
narrow-sense antiprimitive BCH Codes and extend results from the recent literature. Notably,
the dimension, the minimum distance of some $q$-ary BCH codes with length $q+1$, and their duals
are determined in this paper. The dual codes of the narrow-sense antiprimitive BCH codes derived
in this paper include almost MDS codes. Furthermore, the classification of $\mathrm{PGL} (2, p^m)$-invariant
codes over $\mathrm{GF} (p^h)$ is completed. As an application of this result, the $p$-ranks of
all incidence structures invariant under the projective general linear group $\mathrm{ PGL }(2,
p^m)$ are determined. Furthermore, infinite families of narrow-sense BCH codes admitting a $3$-transitive
automorphism group are obtained. Via these BCH codes, a coding-theory approach to constructing
the Witt spherical geometry designs is presented. The BCH codes proposed in this paper are good candidates
for permutation decoding, as they have a relatively large group of automorphisms.

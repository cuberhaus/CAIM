This paper presents a convex optimization-based solution to the design of state-feedback controllers
for solving the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem of uncertain discrete-time systems with
multiplicative noise. To synthesize a tractable solution, the recently developed system level
synthesis (SLS) framework is leveraged. It is shown that SLS shifts the controller synthesis task
from the design of a robust controller to the design of the entire set-valued closed-loop system
responses. To this end, the closed-loop system response is entirely characterized by probabilistic
set-valued maps from the additive noise to control actions and states. A bi-level convex optimization
over the achievable set-valued closed-loop responses is then developed to optimize the expected
value of the LQR cost against the worst-case closed-loop system response. The solution to this robust
optimization problem may be too conservative since it aims at enforcing the design constraints
for all possible system realizations. To deal with this issue, the presented optimization problem
is next reformulated as a chance-constrained program (CCP) in which the guarantees are not intended
in a deterministic sense of satisfaction against all possible closed-loop system responses, but
are instead intended in a probabilistic sense of satisfaction against all but a small fraction of
the system responses. To approximately solve the CCP without the requirement of knowing the probabilistic
description of the uncertainty in the system matrices, the so-called scenario optimization approach
is employed, which provides probabilistic guarantees based on a finite number of system realizations
and results in a convex optimization program with moderate computational complexity. Finally,
numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the theoretical findings.

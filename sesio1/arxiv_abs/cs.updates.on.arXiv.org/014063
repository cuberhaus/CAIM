Although supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) often outperform conventional alternatives
for denoising positron emission tomography (PET) images, they require many low- and high-quality
reference PET image pairs. Herein, we propose an unsupervised 3D PET image denoising method based
on an anatomical information-guided attention mechanism. The proposed magnetic resonance-guided
deep decoder (MR-GDD) utilizes the spatial details and semantic features of MR-guidance image
more effectively by introducing encoder-decoder and deep decoder subnetworks. Moreover, the
specific shapes and patterns of the guidance image do not affect the denoised PET image, because
the guidance image is input to the network through an attention gate. In a Monte Carlo simulation
of [$^{18}$F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG), the proposed method achieved the highest peak
signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity (27.92 $\pm$ 0.44 dB/0.886 $\pm$ 0.007), as compared
with Gaussian filtering (26.68 $\pm$ 0.10 dB/0.807 $\pm$ 0.004), image guided filtering (27.40
$\pm$ 0.11 dB/0.849 $\pm$ 0.003), deep image prior (DIP) (24.22 $\pm$ 0.43 dB/0.737 $\pm$ 0.017),
and MR-DIP (27.65 $\pm$ 0.42 dB/0.879 $\pm$ 0.007). Furthermore, we experimentally visualized
the behavior of the optimization process, which is often unknown in unsupervised CNN-based restoration
problems. For preclinical (using [$^{18}$F]FDG and [$^{11}$C]raclopride) and clinical (using
[$^{18}$F]florbetapir) studies, the proposed method demonstrates state-of-the-art denoising
performance while retaining spatial resolution and quantitative accuracy, despite using a common
network architecture for various noisy PET images with 1/10th of the full counts. These results
suggest that the proposed MR-GDD can reduce PET scan times and PET tracer doses considerably without
impacting patients.

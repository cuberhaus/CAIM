Robots are increasingly used in a wide range of applications. We, as humans, still find it challenging
to work in proximity to robots due to safety concerns. In recent years, roboticists have been seeking
a solution to this challenge through soft robots. Unfortunately, it is often challenging to find
the optimal model to fully investigate and analyze the behavior of a soft robot. This paper seeks
to address this challenge by proposing two complementary modeling techniques for a particular
type of soft robotic actuator known as Fiber Reinforced Elastomeric Enclosures (FREEs). We propose
that designers can leverage multiple models to fill the gaps in the understanding of soft robots.
We develop and test both a dynamic lumped-parameter model and a finite element model in an attempt
to understand the practicability of FREEs for use in a soft robotic arm. The resulting insights enabled
us to investigate the controllability of FREEs using the dynamic model, and its design parameters
and workspace via the finite element model. The results from the lumped-parameter model allowed
us to make simplifying assumptions that led to the development of a model-driven controller for
a single FREE, although extending this model for a module of multiple FREEs can be challenging. This
provided motivation for the development of a finite element model for single and multiple FREE configurations.
Our findings indicate that the material properties and winding angles greatly influence FREEs'
extension, rotation, and force and moment generation. Overall, both models efficiently predict
the behavior of FREEs. Employing two modeling approaches enabled us to fully investigate behavior,
whereas neither model individually significantly demonstrates the complete range of FREE capabilities.

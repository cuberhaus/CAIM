Autonomous Cyber-Physical Systems must often operate under uncertainties like sensor degradation
and shifts in the operating conditions, which increases its operational risk. Dynamic Assurance
of these systems requires designing runtime safety components like Out-of-Distribution detectors
and risk estimators, which require labeled data from different operating modes of the system that
belong to scenes with adverse operating conditions, sensors, and actuator faults. Collecting
real-world data of these scenes can be expensive and sometimes not feasible. So, scenario description
languages with samplers like random and grid search are available to generate synthetic data from
simulators, replicating these real-world scenes. However, we point out three limitations in using
these conventional samplers. First, they are passive samplers, which do not use the feedback of
previous results in the sampling process. Second, the variables to be sampled may have constraints
that are often not included. Third, they do not balance the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation,
which we hypothesize is necessary for better search space coverage. We present a scene generation
approach with two samplers called Random Neighborhood Search (RNS) and Guided Bayesian Optimization
(GBO), which extend the conventional random search and Bayesian Optimization search to include
the limitations. Also, to facilitate the samplers, we use a risk-based metric that evaluates how
risky the scene was for the system. We demonstrate our approach using an Autonomous Vehicle example
in CARLA simulation. To evaluate our samplers, we compared them against the baselines of random
search, grid search, and Halton sequence search. Our samplers of RNS and GBO sampled a higher percentage
of high-risk scenes of 83% and 92%, compared to 56%, 66% and 71% of the grid, random and Halton samplers,
respectively.

Proteins perform critical processes in all living systems: converting solar energy into chemical
energy, replicating DNA, as the basis of highly performant materials, sensing and much more. While
an incredible range of functionality has been sampled in nature, it accounts for a tiny fraction
of the possible protein universe. If we could tap into this pool of unexplored protein structures,
we could search for novel proteins with useful properties that we could apply to tackle the environmental
and medical challenges facing humanity. This is the purpose of protein design. Sequence design
is an important aspect of protein design, and many successful methods to do this have been developed.
Recently, deep-learning methods that frame it as a classification problem have emerged as a powerful
approach. Beyond their reported improvement in performance, their primary advantage over physics-based
methods is that the computational burden is shifted from the user to the developers, thereby increasing
accessibility to the design method. Despite this trend, the tools for assessment and comparison
of such models remain quite generic. The goal of this paper is to both address the timely problem of
evaluation and to shine a spotlight, within the Machine Learning community, on specific assessment
criteria that will accelerate impact. We present a carefully curated benchmark set of proteins
and propose a number of standard tests to assess the performance of deep learning based methods.
Our robust benchmark provides biological insight into the behaviour of design methods, which is
essential for evaluating their performance and utility. We compare five existing models with two
novel models for sequence prediction. Finally, we test the designs produced by these models with
AlphaFold2, a state-of-the-art structure-prediction algorithm, to determine if they are likely
to fold into the intended 3D shapes.

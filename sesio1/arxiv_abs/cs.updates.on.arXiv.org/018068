Few-shot learning has recently attracted wide interest in image classification, but almost all
the current public benchmarks are focused on natural images. The few-shot paradigm is highly relevant
in medical-imaging applications due to the scarcity of labeled data, as annotations are expensive
and require specialized expertise. However, in medical imaging, few-shot learning research is
sparse, limited to private data sets and is at its early stage. In particular, the few-shot setting
is of high interest in histology due to the diversity and fine granularity of cancer related tissue
classification tasks, and the variety of data-preparation techniques. This paper introduces
a highly diversified public benchmark, gathered from various public datasets, for few-shot histology
data classification. We build few-shot tasks and base-training data with various tissue types,
different levels of domain shifts stemming from various cancer sites, and different class-granularity
levels, thereby reflecting realistic scenarios. We evaluate the performances of state-of-the-art
few-shot learning methods on our benchmark, and observe that simple fine-tuning and regularization
methods achieve better results than the popular meta-learning and episodic-training paradigm.
Furthermore, we introduce three scenarios based on the domain shifts between the source and target
histology data: near-domain, middle-domain and out-domain. Our experiments display the potential
of few-shot learning in histology classification, with state-of-art few shot learning methods
approaching the supervised-learning baselines in the near-domain setting. In our out-domain
setting, for 5-way 5-shot, the best performing method reaches 60% accuracy. We believe that our
work could help in building realistic evaluations and fair comparisons of few-shot learning methods
and will further encourage research in the few-shot paradigm.

Background: Research software is software developed by and/or used by researchers, across a wide
variety of domains, to perform their research. Because of the complexity of research software,
developers cannot conduct exhaustive testing. As a result, researchers have lower confidence
in the correctness of the output of the software. Peer code review, a standard software engineering
practice, has helped address this problem in other types of software. Aims: Peer code review is less
prevalent in research software than it is in other types of software. In addition, the literature
does not contain any studies about the use of peer code review in research software. Therefore, through
analyzing developers perceptions, the goal of this work is to understand the current practice of
peer code review in the development of research software, identify challenges and barriers associated
with peer code review in research software, and present approaches to improve the peer code review
in research software. Method: We conducted interviews and a community survey of research software
developers to collect information about their current peer code review practices, difficulties
they face, and how they address those difficulties. Results: We received 84 unique responses from
the interviews and surveys. The results show that while research software teams review a large amount
of their code, they lack formal process, proper organization, and adequate people to perform the
reviews. Conclusions: Use of peer code review is promising for improving the quality of research
software and thereby improving the trustworthiness of the underlying research results. In addition,
by using peer code review, research software developers produce more readable and understandable
code, which will be easier to maintain.

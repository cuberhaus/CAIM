Processing cores and the accompanying main memory working in tandem enable the modern processors.
Dissipating heat produced from computation, memory access remains a significant problem for processors.
Therefore, processor thermal management continues to be an active research topic. Most thermal
management research takes place using simulations, given the challenges of measuring temperature
in real processors. Since core and memory are fabricated on separate packages in most existing processors,
with the memory having lower power densities, thermal management research in processors has primarily
focused on the cores. Memory bandwidth limitations associated with 2D processors lead to high-density
2.5D and 3D packaging technology. 2.5D packaging places cores and memory on the same package. 3D
packaging technology takes it further by stacking layers of memory on the top of cores themselves.
Such packagings significantly increase the power density, making processors prone to heating.
Therefore, mitigating thermal issues in high-density processors (packaged with stacked memory)
becomes an even more pressing problem. However, given the lack of thermal modeling for memories
in existing interval thermal simulation toolchains, they are unsuitable for studying thermal
management for high-density processors. To address this issue, we present CoMeT, the first integrated
Core and Memory interval Thermal simulation toolchain. CoMeT comprehensively supports thermal
simulation of high- and low-density processors corresponding to four different core-memory configurations
- off-chip DDR memory, off-chip 3D memory, 2.5D, and 3D. CoMeT supports several novel features that
facilitate overlying system research. Compared to an equivalent state-of-the-art core-only
toolchain, CoMeT adds only a ~5% simulation-time overhead. The source code of CoMeT has been made
open for public use under the MIT license.

This paper uses two commercial datasets of IP addresses from smartphones, geolocated through the
Global Positioning System (GPS), to characterize the geography of IP address subnets from mobile
and broadband ISPs. Datasets that ge olocate IP addresses based on GPS offer superlative accuracy
and precision for IP geolocation and thus provide an unprecedented opportunity to understand both
the accuracy of existing geolocation databases as well as other properties of IP addresses, such
as mobility and churn. We focus our analysis on large cities in the United States. After evaluating
the accuracy of existing geolocation databases, we analyze the circumstances under which IP geolocation
databases may be more or less accurate. We find that geolocation databases are more accurate on fixed-line
than mobile networks, that IP addresses on university networks can be more accurately located than
those from consumer or business networks, and that often the paid versions of these databases are
not significantly more accurate than the free versions. We then characterize how quickly subnets
associated with fixed-line networks change geographic locations, and how long residential broadband
ISP subscribers retain individual IP addresses. We find, generally, that most IP address assignments
are stable over two months, although stability does vary across ISPs. Finally, we evaluate the suitability
of existing IP geolocation databases for understanding Internet access and performance in human
populations within specific geographies and demographics. Although the median accuracy of IP
geolocation is better than 3 km in some contexts, we conclude that relying on IP geolocation databases
to understand Internet access in densely populated regions such as cities is premature.

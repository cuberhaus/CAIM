Many high end and next generation computing systems to incorporated alternative memory technologies
to meet performance goals. Since these technologies present distinct advantages and tradeoffs
compared to conventional DDR* SDRAM, such as higher bandwidth with lower capacity or vice versa,
they are typically packaged alongside conventional SDRAM in a heterogeneous memory architecture.
To utilize the different types of memory efficiently, new data management strategies are needed
to match application usage to the best available memory technology. However, current proposals
for managing heterogeneous memories are limited because they either: 1) do not consider high-level
application behavior when assigning data to different types of memory, or 2) require separate program
execution (with a representative input) to collect information about how the application uses
memory resources. This work presents a toolset for addressing the limitations of existing approaches
for managing complex memories. It extends the application runtime layer with automated monitoring
and management routines that assign application data to the best tier of memory based on previous
usage, without any need for source code modification or a separate profiling run. It evaluates this
approach on a state-of-the-art server platform with both conventional DDR4 SDRAM and non-volatile
Intel Optane DC memory, using both memory-intensive high performance computing (HPC) applications
as well as standard benchmarks. Overall, the results show that this approach improves program performance
significantly compared to a standard unguided approach across a variety of workloads and system
configurations. Additionally, we show that this approach achieves similar performance as a comparable
offline profiling-based approach after a short startup period, without requiring separate program
execution or offline analysis steps.

Predictor importance is a crucial part of data preprocessing pipelines in classical and quantum
machine learning (QML). This work presents the first study of its kind in which feature importance
for QML models has been explored and contrasted against their classical machine learning (CML)
equivalents. We developed a hybrid quantum-classical architecture where QML models are trained
and feature importance values are calculated from classical algorithms on a real-world dataset.
This architecture has been implemented on ESPN Fantasy Football data using Qiskit statevector
simulators and IBM quantum hardware such as the IBMQ Mumbai and IBMQ Montreal systems. Even though
we are in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, the physical quantum computing results
are promising. To facilitate current quantum scale, we created a data tiering, model aggregation,
and novel validation methods. Notably, the feature importance magnitudes from the quantum models
had a much higher variation when contrasted to classical models. We can show that equivalent QML
and CML models are complementary through diversity measurements. The diversity between QML and
CML demonstrates that both approaches can contribute to a solution in different ways. Within this
paper we focus on Quantum Support Vector Classifiers (QSVC), Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC),
and their classical counterparts. The ESPN and IBM fantasy football Trade Assistant combines advanced
statistical analysis with the natural language processing of Watson Discovery to serve up personalized
trade recommendations that are fair. Here, player valuation data of each player has been considered
and this work can be extended to calculate the feature importance of other QML models such as Quantum
Boltzmann machines.

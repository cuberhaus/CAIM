Holonomic functions play an essential role in Computer Algebra since they allow the application
of many symbolic algorithms. Among all algorithmic attempts to find formulas for power series,
the holonomic property remains the most important requirement to be satisfied by the function under
consideration. The targeted functions mainly summarize that of meromorphic functions. However,
expressions like $\tan(z)$, $z/(\exp(z)-1)$, $\sec(z)$, etc. are not holonomic, therefore their
power series are inaccessible by non-pattern matching implementations like the current Maple
\texttt{convert/FormalPowerSeries}. From the mathematical dictionaries, one can observe that
most of the known closed-form formulas of non-holonomic power series involve another sequence
whose evaluation depends on some finite summations. In the case of $\tan(z)$ and $\sec(z)$ the corresponding
sequences are the Bernoulli and Euler numbers, respectively. Thus providing a symbolic approach
that yields complete representations when linear summations for power series coefficients of
non-holonomic functions appear, might be seen as a step forward towards the representation of non-holonomic
power series. By adapting the method of ansatz with undetermined coefficients, we build an algorithm
that computes least-order quadratic differential equations with polynomial coefficients for
a large class of non-holonomic functions. A differential equation resulting from this procedure
is converted into a recurrence equation by applying the Cauchy product formula and rewriting powers
into polynomials and derivatives into shifts. Finally, using enough initial values we are able
to give normal form representations to characterize several non-holonomic power series and prove
non-trivial identities. We discuss this algorithm and its implementation for Maple 2022.

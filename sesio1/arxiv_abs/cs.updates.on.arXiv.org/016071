Analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) allow physical signals to be processed using digital hardware.
Their conversion consists of two stages: Sampling, which maps a continuous-time signal into discrete-time,
and quantization, i.e., representing the continuous-amplitude quantities using a finite number
of bits. ADCs typically implement generic uniform conversion mappings that are ignorant of the
task for which the signal is acquired, and can be costly when operating in high rates and fine resolutions.
In this work we design task-oriented ADCs which learn from data how to map an analog signal into a digital
representation such that the system task can be efficiently carried out. We propose a model for sampling
and quantization that facilitates the learning of non-uniform mappings from data. Based on this
learnable ADC mapping, we present a mechanism for optimizing a hybrid acquisition system comprised
of analog combining, tunable ADCs with fixed rates, and digital processing, by jointly learning
its components end-to-end. Then, we show how one can exploit the representation of hybrid acquisition
systems as deep network to optimize the sampling rate and quantization rate given the task by utilizing
Bayesian meta-learning techniques. We evaluate the proposed deep task-based ADC in two case studies:
the first considers symbol detection in multi-antenna digital receivers, where multiple analog
signals are simultaneously acquired in order to recover a set of discrete information symbols.
The second application is the beamforming of analog channel data acquired in ultrasound imaging.
Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves performance which is comparable
to operating with high sampling rates and fine resolution quantization, while operating with reduced
overall bit rate.

CS is an efficient method to accelerate the acquisition of MR images from under-sampled k-space
data. Although existing deep learning CS-MRI methods have achieved considerably impressive performance,
explainability and generalizability continue to be challenging for such methods since most of
them are not flexible enough to handle multi-sampling-ratio reconstruction assignments, often
the transition from mathematical analysis to network design not always natural enough. In this
work, to tackle explainability and generalizability, we propose a unifying deep unfolding multi-sampling-ratio
CS-MRI framework, by merging advantages of model-based and deep learning-based methods. The combined
approach offers more generalizability than previous works whereas deep learning gains explainability
through a geometric prior module. Inspired by multigrid algorithm, we first embed the CS-MRI-based
optimization algorithm into correction-distillation scheme that consists of three ingredients:
pre-relaxation module, correction module and geometric prior distillation module. Furthermore,
we employ a condition module to learn adaptively step-length and noise level from compressive sampling
ratio in every stage, which enables the proposed framework to jointly train multi-ratio tasks through
a single model. The proposed model can not only compensate the lost contextual information of reconstructed
image which is refined from low frequency error in geometric characteristic k-space, but also integrate
the theoretical guarantee of model-based methods and the superior reconstruction performances
of deep learning-based methods. All physical-model parameters are learnable, and numerical experiments
show that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of qualitative and quantitative
evaluations.

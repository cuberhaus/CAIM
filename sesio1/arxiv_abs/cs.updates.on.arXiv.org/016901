Architecture reverse engineering has become an emerging attack against deep neural network (DNN)
implementations. Several prior works have utilized side-channel leakage to recover the model
architecture while the target is executing on a hardware acceleration platform. In this work, we
target an open-source deep-learning accelerator, Versatile Tensor Accelerator (VTA), and utilize
electromagnetic (EM) side-channel leakage to comprehensively learn the association between
DNN architecture configurations and EM emanations. We also consider the holistic system -- including
the low-level tensor program code of the VTA accelerator on a Xilinx FPGA and explore the effect of
such low-level configurations on the EM leakage. Our study demonstrates that both the optimization
and configuration of tensor programs will affect the EM side-channel leakage. Gaining knowledge
of the association between the low-level tensor program and the EM emanations, we propose NNReArch,
a lightweight tensor program scheduling framework against side-channel-based DNN model architecture
reverse engineering. Specifically, NNReArch targets reshaping the EM traces of different DNN
operators, through scheduling the tensor program execution of the DNN model so as to confuse the
adversary. NNReArch is a comprehensive protection framework supporting two modes, a balanced
mode that strikes a balance between the DNN model confidentiality and execution performance, and
a secure mode where the most secure setting is chosen. We implement and evaluate the proposed framework
on the open-source VTA with state-of-the-art DNN architectures. The experimental results demonstrate
that NNReArch can efficiently enhance the model architecture security with a small performance
overhead. In addition, the proposed obfuscation technique makes reverse engineering of the DNN
architecture significantly harder.

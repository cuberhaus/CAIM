Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is a problem of finding a sequence of movements for agents to reach
their assigned location without collision. Centralized algorithms usually give optimal solutions,
but have difficulties to scale without employing various techniques - usually with a sacrifice
of optimality; but solving MAPF problems with the number of agents greater than a thousand remains
a challenge nevertheless. To tackle the scalability issue, we present DMAPF - a decentralized and
distributed MAPF solver, which is a continuation of our recently published work, ros-dmapf. We
address the issues of ros-dmapf where it (i) only works in maps without obstacles; and (ii) has a low
success rate with dense maps. Given a MAPF problem, both ros-dmapf and DMAPF divide the map spatially
into subproblems, but the latter further divides each subproblem into disconnected regions called
areas. Each subproblem is assigned to a distributed solver, which then individually creates an
abstract plan - a sequence of areas that an agent needs to visit - for each agent in it, and interleaves
agent migration with movement planning. Answer Set Programming, which is known for its performance
in small but complex problems, is used in many parts including problem division, abstract planning,
border assignment for the migration, and movement planning. Robot Operating System is used to facilitate
communication between the solvers and to enable the opportunity to integrate with robotic systems.
DMAPF introduces a new interaction protocol between the solvers, and mechanisms that together
result in a higher success rate and better solution quality without sacrificing much of the performance.
We implement and experimentally validate DMAPF by comparing it with other state-of-the-art MAPF
solvers and the results show that our system achieves better scalability.

Safety in human-robot interaction can be divided into physical safety and perceived safety, where
the latter is still under-addressed in the literature. Investigating perceived safety in human-robot
interaction requires a multidisciplinary perspective. Indeed, perceived safety is often considered
as being associated with several common factors studied in other disciplines, i.e., comfort, predictability,
sense of control, and trust. In this paper, we investigated the relationship between these factors
and perceived safety in human-robot interaction using subjective and objective measures. We conducted
a two-by-five mixed-subjects design experiment. The five within-subjects conditions correspond
to (1) baseline, and the manipulations of robot behaviors to stimulate: (2) discomfort, (3) decreased
perceived safety, (4) decreased sense of control and (5) distrust. Twenty-seven young adult participants
took part in the experiments. Participants were asked to answer questionnaires that measure the
manipulated factors after within-subjects conditions. Besides questionnaire data, we collected
objective measures such as videos and physiological data. The questionnaire results show a correlation
between comfort, sense of control, trust, and perceived safety. We also discuss the effect of individual
human characteristics (such as personality and gender) that they could be predictors of perceived
safety. We used the physiological signal data and facial affect from videos for estimating perceived
safety where participants' subjective ratings were utilized as labels. The data from objective
measures revealed that the prediction rate was higher from physiological signal data. This paper
can play an important role in the goal of better understanding perceived safety in human-robot interaction.

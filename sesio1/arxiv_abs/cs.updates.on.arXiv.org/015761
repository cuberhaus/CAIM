Mobile banking applications have gained popularity and have significantly revolutionised the
banking industry. Despite the convenience offered by M-Banking Apps, users are often distrustful
of the security of the applications due to an increasing trend of cyber security compromises, cyber-attacks,
and data breaches. Considering the upsurge in cyber security vulnerabilities of M-Banking Apps
and the paucity of research in this domain, this study was conducted to empirically measure user-perceived
security of M-Banking Apps. A total of 315 responses from study participants were analysed using
covariance-based structural equation modelling (CB-SEM). The results indicated that most constructs
of the baseline Extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) structure
were validated. Perceived security, institutional trust and technology trust were confirmed
as factors that affect user's intention to adopt and use M-Banking Apps. However, perceived risk
was not confirmed as a significant predictor. The current study further revealed that in the context
of M-Banking Apps, the effects of security and trust are complex. The impact of perceived security
and institutional trust on behavioural intention was moderated by age, gender, experience, income,
and education, while perceived security on use behaviour was moderated by age, gender, and experience.
The effect of technology trust on behavioural intention was moderated by age, education, and experience.
Overall, the proposed conceptual model achieved acceptable fit and explained 79% of the variance
in behavioural intention and 54.7% in use behaviour of M-Banking Apps, higher than that obtained
in the original UTAUT2. The guarantee of enhanced security, advanced privacy mechanisms and trust
should be considered paramount in future strategies aimed at promoting M-Banking Apps adoption
and use.

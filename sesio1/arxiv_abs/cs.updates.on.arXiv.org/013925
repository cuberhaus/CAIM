We propose predictive models that estimate GBM patients' health status of one-year after treatments
(Classification task), predict the long-term prognosis of GBM patients at an individual level
(Survival task). We used total of 467 GBM patients' clinical profile consists of 13 features and
two follow-up dates. For baseline models of random forest classifier(RFC) and random survival
forest model (RSF), we introduced generalized linear model (GLM), support vector machine (SVM)
and Cox proportional hazardous model (COX), accelerated failure time model (AFT) respectively.
After preprocessing and prefixing stratified 5-fold data set, we generated best performing models
for model types using recursive feature elimination process. Total 10, 4, and 13 features were extracted
for best performing one-year survival/progression status RFC models and RSF model via the recursive
feature elimination process. In classification task, AUROC of best performing RFC recorded 0.6990
(for one-year survival status classification) and 0.7076 (for one-year progression classification)
while that of second best baseline models (GLM in both cases) recorded 0.6691 and 0.6997 respectively.
About survival task, the highest C-index of 0.7157 and the lowest IBS of 0.1038 came from the best
performing RSF model while that of second best baseline models were 0.6556 and 0.1139 respectively.
A simplified linear correlation (extracted from LIME and virtual patient group analysis) between
each feature and prognosis of GBM patient were consistent with proven medical knowledge. Our machine
learning models suggest that the top three prognostic factors for GBM patient survival were MGMT
gene promoter, the extent of resection, and age. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the very
first study introducing a interpretable and medical knowledge consistent GBM prognosis predictive
models.

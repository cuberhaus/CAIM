A probabilistic approach to phase-field brittle and ductile fracture with random material and
geometric properties is proposed within this work. In the macroscopic failure mechanics, materials
properties and exactness of spatial quantities (of different phases in the geometrical domain)
are assumed to be homogeneous and deterministic. This is unlike the lower-scale with strong fluctuation
in the material and geometrical properties. Such a response is approximated through some uncertainty
in the model problem. The presented contribution is devoted to providing a mathematical framework
for modeling uncertainty through stochastic analysis of a microstructure undergoing brittle/ductile
failure. Hereby, the proposed model employs various representative volume elements with random
distribution of stiff-inclusions and voids within the composite structure. We develop an allocating
strategy to allocate the heterogeneities and generate the corresponding meshes in two- and three-dimensional
cases. Then the Monte Carlo finite element technique is employed for solving the stochastic PDE-based
model and approximate the expectation and the variance of the solution field of brittle/ductile
failure by evaluating a large number of samples. For the prediction of failure mechanisms, we rely
on the phase-field approach which is a widely adopted framework for modeling and computing the fracture
phenomena in solids. Incremental perturbed minimization principles for a class of gradient-type
dissipative materials are used to derive the perturbed governing equations. This analysis enables
us to study the highly heterogeneous microstructure and monitor the uncertainty in failure mechanics.
Several numerical examples are given to examine the efficiency of the proposed method.

Many democratic societies use district-based elections, where the region under consideration
is geographically divided into districts and a representative is chosen for each district based
on the preferences of the electors who reside there. These representatives belong to political
parties, and the executive powers are acquired by that party which has a majority of the elected district
representatives. In most systems, each elector can express preference for one candidate, though
they may have a complete or partial ranking of the candidates/parties. We show that this can lead
to situations where many electors are dissatisfied with the election results, which is not desirable
in a democracy. The results may be biased towards the supporters of a particular party, and against
others. Inspired by current literature on fairness of Machine Learning algorithms, we define measures
of fairness to quantify the satisfaction of electors, irrespective of their political choices.
We also consider alternative election policies using concepts of voting rules and rank aggregation,
to enable voters to express their detailed preferences without making the electoral process cumbersome
or opaque. We then evaluate these policies using the aforementioned fairness measures with the
help of Monte Carlo simulations. Such simulations are obtained using a proposed stochastic model
for election simulation, that takes into account community identities of electors and its role
in influencing their residence and political preferences. We show that this model can simulate
actual multi-party elections in India. Through extensive simulations, we find that allowing voters
to provide 2 preferences reduces the disparity between supporters of different parties in terms
of the election result.

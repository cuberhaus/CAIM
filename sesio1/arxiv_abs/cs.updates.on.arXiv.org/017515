Evolutionary algorithms are effective general-purpose techniques for solving optimization
problems. Understanding how each component of an evolutionary algorithm influences its problem-solving
success improves our ability to target particular problem domains. Our work focuses on evaluating
selection schemes, which choose individuals to contribute genetic material to the next generation.
We introduce four diagnostic search spaces for testing the strengths and weaknesses of selection
schemes: the exploitation rate diagnostic, ordered exploitation rate diagnostic, contradictory
objectives diagnostic, and the multi-path exploration diagnostic. Each diagnostic is handcrafted
to isolate and measure the relative exploitation and exploration characteristics of selection
schemes. In this study, we use our diagnostics to evaluate six population selection methods: truncation
selection, tournament selection, fitness sharing, lexicase selection, nondominated sorting,
and novelty search. Expectedly, tournament and truncation selection excelled in gradient exploitation
but poorly explored search spaces, and novelty search excelled at exploration but failed to exploit
fitness gradients. Fitness sharing performed poorly across all diagnostics, suggesting poor
overall exploitation and exploration abilities. Nondominated sorting was best for maintaining
populations comprised of individuals with different trade-offs of multiple objectives, but struggled
to effectively exploit fitness gradients. Lexicase selection balanced search space exploration
with exploitation, generally performing well across diagnostics. Our work demonstrates the value
of diagnostic search spaces for building a deeper understanding of selection schemes, which can
then be used to improve or develop new selection methods.

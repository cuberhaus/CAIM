Image registration, the process of defining meaningful correspondences between images, is essential
for various image analysis tasks, especially medical imaging. Numerous learning-based methods,
notably convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for deformable image registration proposed in
recent years have demonstrated the feasibility and superiority of deep learning techniques for
registration problems. Besides, compared to traditional algorithms' optimization scheme of
the objective function for each image pair, learning-based algorithms are several orders of magnitude
faster. However, these data-driven methods without proper constraint on the deformation field
will easily lead to topological foldings. To tackle this problem, We propose the quasi-conformal
registration network (QCRegNet), an unsupervised learning framework, to obtain diffeomorphic
2D image registrations with large deformations based on quasi-conformal (QC) map, an orientation-preserving
homeomorphism between two manifolds. The basic idea is to design a CNN mapping image pairs to deformation
fields. QCRegNet consists of the estimator network and the Beltrami solver network (BSNet). The
estimator network takes image pair as input and outputs the Beltrami coefficient (BC). The BC, which
captures conformal distortion of a QC map and guarantees the bijectivity, will then be input to the
BSNet, a task-independent network which reconstructs the desired QC map. Furthermore, we reduce
the number of network parameters and computational complexity by utilizing Fourier approximation
to compress BC. Experiments have been carried out on different data such as underwater and medical
images. Registration results show that the registration accuracy is comparable to state-of-the-art
methods and diffeomorphism is to a great extent guaranteed compared to other diffeomorphic registration
algorithms.

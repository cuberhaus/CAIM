The fifth-generation mobile evolution enables transformations on Next-Generation Radio Access
Networks (NG-RAN). The RAN protocol stack is split into eight disaggregated options combined in
three network units, i.e., Central, Distributed, and Radio. Besides that, further advances allow
the RAN functions to be virtualized on top of general-purpose hardware, using the concept of virtualized
RAN (vRAN). The Combination of NG-RAN and vRAN results in vNG-RAN, which enables the management
of the disaggregated units and protocols as a set of radio functions. However, the orchestration-based
placement of these radio functions is a challenging issue since the best decision can be determined
by multiple constraints involving RAN disaggregation, crosshaul networks requirements, availability
of computational resources, etc. This article proposes OPlaceRAN, a vNG-RAN deployment orchestrator
framed within the NFV reference architecture and aligned with the Open RAN initiative. OPlaceRAN
supports the dynamic placement of radio functions focusing on vNG-RAN planning and is designed
to be agnostic to the placement optimization model. To validate OPlaceRAN, we developed a prototype
based on up-to-date cloud-native tools to deploy RAN using containerized virtualization using
the OpenAirInterface emulator and considering two distinct functional splits (options 2 and 6).
The evaluation is tested as proofs-of-concept in a real computing infrastructure using two different
placement solutions. Our results reveal that OPlaceRAN is an effective cloud-native solution
for containerized network functions placement and agnostic to the optimization model. Additionally,
OPlaceRAN is up-to-date with the most advanced vNG-RAN design and development approaches, contributing
to the evolution of the fifth-generation of mobile networks.

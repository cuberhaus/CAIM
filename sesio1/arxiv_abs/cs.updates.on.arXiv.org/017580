Given a degraded input image, image restoration aims to recover the missing high-quality image
content. Numerous applications demand effective image restoration, e.g., computational photography,
surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and remote sensing. Significant advances in image restoration
have been made in recent years, dominated by convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The widely-used
CNN-based methods typically operate either on full-resolution or on progressively low-resolution
representations. In the former case, spatial details are preserved but the contextual information
cannot be precisely encoded. In the latter case, generated outputs are semantically reliable but
spatially less accurate. This paper presents a new architecture with a holistic goal of maintaining
spatially-precise high-resolution representations through the entire network, and receiving
complementary contextual information from the low-resolution representations. The core of our
approach is a multi-scale residual block containing the following key elements: (a) parallel multi-resolution
convolution streams for extracting multi-scale features, (b) information exchange across the
multi-resolution streams, (c) non-local attention mechanism for capturing contextual information,
and (d) attention based multi-scale feature aggregation. Our approach learns an enriched set of
features that combines contextual information from multiple scales, while simultaneously preserving
the high-resolution spatial details. Extensive experiments on six real image benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method, named as MIRNet-v2 , achieves state-of-the-art results for a variety
of image processing tasks, including defocus deblurring, image denoising, super-resolution,
and image enhancement. The source code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/swz30/MIRNetv2

Here we present a structural similarity index measure (SSIM) guided conditional Generative Adversarial
Network (cGAN) that generatively performs image-to-image (i2i) synthesis to generate photo-accurate
protein channels in multiplexed spatial proteomics images. This approach can be utilized to accurately
generate missing spatial proteomics channels that were not included during experimental data
collection either at the bench or the clinic. Experimental spatial proteomic data from the Human
BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP) was used to generate spatial representations of missing proteins
through a U-Net based image synthesis pipeline. HuBMAP channels were hierarchically clustered
by the (SSIM) as a heuristic to obtain the minimal set needed to recapitulate the underlying biology
represented by the spatial landscape of proteins. We subsequently prove that our SSIM based architecture
allows for scaling of generative image synthesis to slides with up to 100 channels, which is better
than current state of the art algorithms which are limited to data with 11 channels. We validate these
claims by generating a new experimental spatial proteomics data set from human lung adenocarcinoma
tissue sections and show that a model trained on HuBMAP can accurately synthesize channels from
our new data set. The ability to recapitulate experimental data from sparsely stained multiplexed
histological slides containing spatial proteomic will have tremendous impact on medical diagnostics
and drug development, and also raises important questions on the medical ethics of utilizing data
produced by generative image synthesis in the clinical setting. The algorithm that we present in
this paper will allow researchers and clinicians to save time and costs in proteomics based histological
staining while also increasing the amount of data that they can generate through their experiments.

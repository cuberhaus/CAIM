Deraining is a significant and fundamental computer vision task, aiming to remove the rain streaks
and accumulations in an image or video captured under a rainy day. Existing deraining methods usually
make heuristic assumptions of the rain model, which compels them to employ complex optimization
or iterative refinement for high recovery quality. This, however, leads to time-consuming methods
and affects the effectiveness for addressing rain patterns deviated from from the assumptions.
In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient deraining method by formulating deraining as a predictive
filtering problem without complex rain model assumptions. Specifically, we identify spatially-variant
predictive filtering (SPFilt) that adaptively predicts proper kernels via a deep network to filter
different individual pixels. Since the filtering can be implemented via well-accelerated convolution,
our method can be significantly efficient. We further propose the EfDeRain+ that contains three
main contributions to address residual rain traces, multi-scale, and diverse rain patterns without
harming the efficiency. First, we propose the uncertainty-aware cascaded predictive filtering
(UC-PFilt) that can identify the difficulties of reconstructing clean pixels via predicted kernels
and remove the residual rain traces effectively. Second, we design the weight-sharing multi-scale
dilated filtering (WS-MS-DFilt) to handle multi-scale rain streaks without harming the efficiency.
Third, to eliminate the gap across diverse rain patterns, we propose a novel data augmentation method
(i.e., RainMix) to train our deep models. By combining all contributions with sophisticated analysis
on different variants, our final method outperforms baseline methods on four single-image deraining
datasets and one video deraining dataset in terms of both recovery quality and speed.

This paper is concerned with the real structured controllability, stabilizability, and stability
radii (RSCR, RSSZR, and RSSR, respectively) of linear time invariant systems, i.e., the problems
of determining the distance (in terms of matrix norms) between a system to its nearest uncontrollable,
unstabilizable, and unstable systems with a prescribed {\emph{affine}} structure. The main contributions
of this paper lie in two aspects. First, assuming that the involved real perturbations have a general
affine parameterization, we prove that determining the RSCR and RSSZR are NP-hard by showing that
even checking their feasibilities are NP-hard. This means the hardness results are irrespective
of what matrix norm is utilized. The NP-hardness of the $2$-norm based RSSR can be obtained from an
existing result in robust stability analysis. Second, we develop {\emph{unified}} rank-relaxation
based algorithms towards these problems, which share two notable features: they are valid both
for the Frobenius norm and the $2$-norm based problems, and they share the same framework for the
RSCR, RSSZR, and RSSR problems. These algorithms exploit the low-rank structure of the original
problems and relax the corresponding rank constraints with a regularized truncated nuclear norm
term. This leads to problems of difference of convex programs (DC), which can be solved via the sequential
convex relaxations with guaranteed convergence to stationary points of the relaxed problems.
Moreover, under suitable conditions, a modified version of those algorithms is given to find local
optima with performance specification on the corresponding perturbations. Finally, simulations
suggest that, our proposed methods, though in a simple framework, may find local optima as good as
several existing methods.

We consider a matching problem in a bipartite graph $G=(A\cup B,E)$ where each node in $A$ is an agent
having preferences in partial order over her neighbors, while nodes in $B$ are objects with no preferences.
The size of our matching is more important than node preferences; thus, we are interested in maximum
matchings only. Any pair of maximum matchings in $G$ (equivalently, perfect matchings or assignments)
can be compared by holding a head-to-head election between them where agents are voters. The goal
is to compute an assignment $M$ such that there is no better or "more popular" assignment. This is
the popular assignment problem and it generalizes the well-studied popular matching problem.
Popular assignments need not always exist. We show a polynomial-time algorithm that decides if
the given instance admits one or not, and computes one, if so. In instances with no popular assignment,
we consider the problem of finding an almost popular assignment, i.e., an assignment with minimum
unpopularity margin. We show an $O^*(|E|^k)$ time algorithm for deciding if there exists an assignment
with unpopularity margin at most $k$. We show that this algorithm is essentially optimal by proving
that the problem is $\mathsf{W}_l[1]$-hard with parameter $k$. We also consider the minimum-cost
popular assignment problem when there are edge costs, and show its $\mathsf{NP}$-hardness even
when all edge costs are in $\{0,1\}$ and agents have strict preferences. By contrast, we propose
a polynomial-time algorithm to the problem of deciding if there exists a popular assignment with
a given set of forced/forbidden edges (this tractability holds even for partially ordered preferences).
Our algorithms are combinatorial and based on LP duality. They search for an appropriate witness
or dual certificate, and when a certificate cannot be found, we prove that the desired assignment
does not exist in $G$.

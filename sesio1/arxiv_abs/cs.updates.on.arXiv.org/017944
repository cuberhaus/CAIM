Automatic question generation is one of the most challenging tasks of Natural Language Processing.
It requires "bidirectional" language processing: firstly, the system has to understand the input
text (Natural Language Understanding) and it then has to generate questions also in the form of text
(Natural Language Generation). In this article, we introduce our framework for generating the
factual questions from unstructured text in the English language. It uses a combination of traditional
linguistic approaches based on sentence patterns with several machine learning methods. We firstly
obtain lexical, syntactic and semantic information from an input text and we then construct a hierarchical
set of patterns for each sentence. The set of features is extracted from the patterns and it is then
used for automated learning of new transformation rules. Our learning process is totally data-driven
because the transformation rules are obtained from a set of initial sentence-question pairs. The
advantages of this approach lie in a simple expansion of new transformation rules which allows us
to generate various types of questions and also in the continuous improvement of the system by reinforcement
learning. The framework also includes a question evaluation module which estimates the quality
of generated questions. It serves as a filter for selecting the best questions and eliminating incorrect
ones or duplicates. We have performed several experiments to evaluate the correctness of generated
questions and we have also compared our system with several state-of-the-art systems. Our results
indicate that the quality of generated questions outperforms the state-of-the-art systems and
our questions are also comparable to questions created by humans. We have also created and published
an interface with all created datasets and evaluated questions, so it is possible to follow up on
our work.

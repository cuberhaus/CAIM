In this paper, we study an active IRS-aided simultaneous wireless information and power transfer
(SWIPT) system. Specifically, an active IRS is deployed to assist a multi-antenna access point
(AP) to convey information and energy simultaneously to multiple single-antenna information
users (IUs) and energy users (EUs). Two joint transmit and reflect beamforming optimization problems
are investigated with different practical objectives. The first problem maximizes the weighted
sum-power harvested by the EUs subject to individual signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio
(SINR) constraints at the IUs, while the second problem maximizes the weighted sum-rate of the IUs
subject to individual energy harvesting (EH) constraints at the EUs. The optimization problems
are non-convex and difficult to solve optimally. To tackle these two problems, we first rigorously
prove that dedicated energy beams are not required for their corresponding semidefinite relaxation
(SDR) reformulations and the SDR is tight for the first problem, thus greatly simplifying the AP
precoding design. Then, by capitalizing on the techniques of alternating optimization (AO), SDR,
and successive convex approximation (SCA), computationally efficient algorithms are developed
to obtain suboptimal solutions of the resulting optimization problems. Simulation results demonstrate
that, given the same total system power budget, significant performance gains in terms of operating
range of wireless power transfer (WPT), total harvested energy, as well as achievable rate can be
obtained by our proposed designs over benchmark schemes (especially the one adopting a passive
IRS). Moreover, it is advisable to deploy an active IRS in the proximity of the users for the effective
operation of WPT/SWIPT.

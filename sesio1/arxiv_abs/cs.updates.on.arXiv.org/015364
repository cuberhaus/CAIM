The pandemic of novel SARS-CoV-2 also known as COVID-19 has been spreading worldwide, causing rampant
loss of lives. Medical imaging such as CT, X-ray, etc., plays a significant role in diagnosing the
patients by presenting the visual representation of the functioning of the organs. However, for
any radiologist analyzing such scans is a tedious and time-consuming task. The emerging deep learning
technologies have displayed its strength in analyzing such scans to aid in the faster diagnosis
of the diseases and viruses such as COVID-19. In the present article, an automated deep learning
based model, COVID-19 hierarchical segmentation network (CHS-Net) is proposed that functions
as a semantic hierarchical segmenter to identify the COVID-19 infected regions from lungs contour
via CT medical imaging using two cascaded residual attention inception U-Net (RAIU-Net) models.
RAIU-Net comprises of a residual inception U-Net model with spectral spatial and depth attention
network (SSD) that is developed with the contraction and expansion phases of depthwise separable
convolutions and hybrid pooling (max and spectral pooling) to efficiently encode and decode the
semantic and varying resolution information. The CHS-Net is trained with the segmentation loss
function that is the defined as the average of binary cross entropy loss and dice loss to penalize
false negative and false positive predictions. The approach is compared with the recently proposed
approaches and evaluated using the standard metrics like accuracy, precision, specificity, recall,
dice coefficient and Jaccard similarity along with the visualized interpretation of the model
prediction with GradCam++ and uncertainty maps. With extensive trials, it is observed that the
proposed approach outperformed the recently proposed approaches and effectively segments the
COVID-19 infected regions in the lungs.

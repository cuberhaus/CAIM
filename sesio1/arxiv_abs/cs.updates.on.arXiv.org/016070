A family of sets is $(p,q)$-intersecting if every nonempty subfamily of $p$ or fewer sets has at least
$q$ elements in its total intersection. A family of sets has the $(p,q)$-Helly property if every
nonempty $(p,q)$-intersecting subfamily has total intersection of cardinality at least $q$.
The $(2,1)$-Helly property is the usual Helly property. A hypergraph is $(p,q)$-Helly if its edge
family has the $(p,q)$-Helly property and hereditary $(p,q)$-Helly if each of its subhypergraphs
has the $(p,q)$-Helly property. A graph is $(p,q)$-clique-Helly if the family of its maximal cliques
has the $(p,q)$-the Helly property and hereditary $(p,q)$-clique-Helly if each of its induced
subgraphs is $(p,q)$-clique-Helly. The classes of $(p,q)$-biclique-Helly and hereditary $(p,q)$-biclique-Helly
graphs are defined analogously. We prove several characterizations of hereditary $(p,q)$-Helly
hypergraphs, including one by minimal forbidden partial subhypergraphs. We give an improved time
bound for the recognition of $(p,q)$-Helly hypergraphs for each fixed $q$ and show that the recognition
of hereditary $(p,q)$-Helly hypergraphs can be solved in polynomial time if $p$ and $q$ are fixed
but co-NP-complete if $p$ is part of the input. In addition, we generalize to $(p,q)$-clique-Helly
graphs the characterization of $p$-clique-Helly graphs in terms of expansions and give different
characterizations of hereditary $(p,q)$-clique-Helly graphs, including one by forbidden induced
subgraphs. We give an improvement on the time bound for the recognition of $(p,q)$-clique-Helly
graphs and prove that the recognition problem of hereditary $(p,q)$-clique-Helly graphs is polynomial-time
solvable for $p$ and $q$ fixed but NP-hard if $p$ or $q$ is part of the input. Finally, we provide different
characterizations, give recognition algorithms, and prove hardness results for (hereditary)
$(p,q)$-biclique-Helly graphs.

Adherence to the non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) put in place to mitigate the spreading
of infectious diseases is a multifaceted problem. Socio-demographic, socio-economic, and epidemiological
factors can influence the perceived susceptibility and risk which are known to affect behavior.
Furthermore, the adoption of NPIs is dependent upon the barriers, real or perceived, associated
with their implementation. We study the determinants of NPIs adherence during the first wave of
the COVID-19 Pandemic in Colombia, Ecuador, and El Salvador. Analyses are performed at the level
of municipalities and include socio-economic, socio-demographic, and epidemiological indicators.
Furthermore, by leveraging a unique dataset comprising tens of millions of internet Speedtest
measurements from Ookla, we investigate the quality of the digital infrastructure as a possible
barrier to adoption. We use publicly available data provided by Meta capturing aggregated mobility
changes as a proxy of adherence to NPIs. Across the three countries considered, we find a significant
correlation between mobility drops and digital infrastructure quality. The relationship remains
significant after controlling for several factors including socio-economic status, population
size, and reported COVID-19 cases. This finding suggests that municipalities with better connectivity
were able to afford higher mobility reductions. The link between mobility drops and digital infrastructure
quality is stronger at the peak of NPIs stringency. We also find that mobility reductions were more
pronounced in larger, denser, and wealthier municipalities. Our work provides new insights on
the significance of access to digital tools as an additional factor influencing the ability to follow
social distancing guidelines during a health emergency

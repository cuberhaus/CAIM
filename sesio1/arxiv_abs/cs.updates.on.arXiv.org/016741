Selfie images enjoy huge popularity in social media. The same platforms centered around sharing
this type of images offer filters to beautify them or incorporate augmented reality effects. Studies
suggests that filtered images attract more views and engagement. Selfie images are also in increasing
use in security applications due to mobiles becoming data hubs for many transactions. Also, video
conference applications, boomed during the pandemic, include such filters. Such filters may destroy
biometric features that would allow person recognition or even detection of the face itself, even
if such commodity applications are not necessarily used to compromise facial systems. This could
also affect subsequent investigations like crimes in social media, where automatic analysis is
usually necessary given the amount of information posted in social sites or stored in devices or
cloud repositories. To help in counteracting such issues, we contribute with a database of facial
images that includes several manipulations. It includes image enhancement filters (which mostly
modify contrast and lightning) and augmented reality filters that incorporate items like animal
noses or glasses. Additionally, images with sunglasses are processed with a reconstruction network
trained to learn to reverse such modifications. This is because obfuscating the eye region has been
observed in the literature to have the highest impact on the accuracy of face detection or recognition.
We start from the popular Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) database, to which we apply different modifications,
generating 8 datasets. Each dataset contains 4,324 images of size 64 x 64, with a total of 34,592 images.
The use of a public and widely employed face dataset allows for replication and comparison. The created
database is available at https://github.com/HalmstadUniversityBiometrics/LFW-Beautified

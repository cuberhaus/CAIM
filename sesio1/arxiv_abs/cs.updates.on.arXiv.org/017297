Recommender systems aim to recommend new items to users by learning user and item representations.
In practice, these representations are highly entangled as they consist of information about multiple
factors, including user's interests, item attributes along with confounding factors such as user
conformity, and item popularity. Considering these entangled representations for inferring
user preference may lead to biased recommendations (e.g., when the recommender model recommends
popular items even if they do not align with the user's interests). Recent research proposes to debias
by modeling a recommender system from a causal perspective. The exposure and the ratings are analogous
to the treatment and the outcome in the causal inference framework, respectively. The critical
challenge in this setting is accounting for the hidden confounders. These confounders are unobserved,
making it hard to measure them. On the other hand, since these confounders affect both the exposure
and the ratings, it is essential to account for them in generating debiased recommendations. To
better approximate hidden confounders, we propose to leverage network information (i.e., user-social
and user-item networks), which are shown to influence how users discover and interact with an item.
Aside from the user conformity, aspects of confounding such as item popularity present in the network
information is also captured in our method with the aid of \textit{causal disentanglement} which
unravels the learned representations into independent factors that are responsible for (a) modeling
the exposure of an item to the user, (b) predicting the ratings, and (c) controlling the hidden confounders.
Experiments on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed model for debiasing
recommender systems.

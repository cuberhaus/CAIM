System design tools are often only available as input-output blackboxes: for a given design as input
they compute an output representing system behavior. Blackboxes are intended to be run in the forward
direction. This paper presents a new method of solving the inverse design problem namely, given
requirements or constraints on output, find an input that also optimizes an objective function.
This problem is challenging for several reasons. First, blackboxes are not designed to be run in
reverse. Second, inputs and outputs can be discrete and continuous. Third, finding designs concurrently
satisfying a set of requirements is hard because designs satisfying individual requirements may
conflict with each other. Fourth, blackbox evaluations can be expensive. Finally, blackboxes
can sometimes fail to produce an output. This paper presents CNMA, a new method of solving the inverse
problem that overcomes these challenges. CNMA tries to sample only the part of the design space relevant
to solving the problem, leveraging the power of neural networks, Mixed Integer Linear Programs,
and a new learning-from-failure feedback loop. The paper also presents a parallel version of CNMA
that improves the efficiency and quality of solutions over the sequential version, and tries to
steer it away from local optima. CNMA's performance is evaluated against conventional optimization
methods for seven nonlinear design problems of 8 (two problems), 10, 15, 36 and 60 real-valued dimensions
and one with 186 binary dimensions. Conventional methods evaluated are off-the-shelf implementations
of Bayesian Optimization with Gaussian Processes, Nelder Mead and Random Search. The first two
do not solve problems that are high-dimensional, have discrete and continuous variables or whose
blackboxes can fail to return values. CNMA solves all problems, and surpasses the performance of
conventional methods by 1%-87%.

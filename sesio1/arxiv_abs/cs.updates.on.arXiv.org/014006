Glioma is a common malignant brain tumor that shows distinct survival among patients. The isocitrate
dehydrogenase (IDH) gene mutation status provides critical diagnostic and prognostic value for
glioma and is now accepted as the standard of care. A non-invasive prediction of IDH mutation based
on the pre-treatment MRI has crucial clinical significance. Machine learning and deep learning
models show reasonable performance in predicting IDH mutation status. However, most models neglect
the systematic brain alterations caused by tumor invasion, where the infiltration along white
matter tracts throughout the brain is identified as a hallmark of glioma. Structural brain network
provides an effective tool to characterise brain organisation, which could be captured by the graph
neural networks (GNN) for a more accurate prediction of IDH mutation status. Here we propose a method
to predict the IDH mutation using GNN, based on the structural brain network of patients. Specifically,
we firstly construct a network template of healthy subjects, which consists of atlases of edges
(white matter tracts) and nodes (cortical and subcortical brain regions) to provide regions of
interest (ROI). Next, we employ autoencoders to extract the latent multi-modal MRI features from
the ROIs of the edge and node in patients. These features of edge and node of brain networks are used
to train a GNN architecture in predicting IDH mutation status. The results show that the proposed
method outperforms the baseline models using 3D-CNN and 3D-DenseNet. In addition, the model interpretation
suggests its ability to identify the tracts infiltrated by tumor and corresponds to clinical prior
knowledge. In conclusion, integrating brain networks with GNN offers a new avenue to study brain
lesions using computational neuroscience and computer vision approaches.

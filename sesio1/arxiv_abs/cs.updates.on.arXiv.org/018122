Multilayer networks describe the rich ways in which nodes are related through different types of
connections in separate layers. These multiple relationships are naturally represented by an
adjacency tensor that can be interpreted using techniques from multilinear algebra. In this work
we propose the use of the nonnegative Tucker decomposition (NNTuck) with KL-divergence as an expressive
factor model for multilayer networks that naturally generalizes existing methods for stochastic
block models of multilayer networks. We show how the NNTuck provides an intuitive factor-based
perspective on layer dependence and enables linear-algebraic techniques for analyzing dependence
with respect to specific layers. Algorithmically, we show that using expectation maximization
(EM) to maximize this log-likelihood under the NNTuck model is step-by-step equivalent to tensorial
multiplicative updates for the nonnegative Tucker decomposition under a KL loss, extending a previously
known equivalence from nonnegative matrices to nonnegative tensors. Using both synthetic and
real-world data, we evaluate the use and interpretation of the NNTuck as a model of multilayer networks.
The ability to quantify dependencies between layers has the potential to inform survey instruments
for collecting social network data, identify redundancies in the structure of a network, and indicate
relationships between disparate layers. Therefore, we propose a definition of layer dependence
based on using a likelihood ratio test to evaluate three nested models: the layer independent, layer
dependent, and layer redundant NNTucks. We show how these definitions, paired with analysis of
the factor matrices in the NNTuck, can be used to understand and interpret layer dependence in different
contexts.

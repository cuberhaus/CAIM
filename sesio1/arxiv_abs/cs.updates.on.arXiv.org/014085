There exist huge chunk of academic items receiving no citation years after years and remaining beyond
the veil of ignorance of the academic audience. These are known as uncited items. Now, the question
is, why a paper fails to get citation? The attribute of incapability of receiving citation may be
termed as Uncitedness. This paper traces brief history of the concept of uncitedness sprouted first
in 1964 in an article entitled Cybernetics, homeostasis and a model of disease by Gerson Jacobs.
The concept of uncitedness was scientometrically first explained by Garfield in 1970. The uncitedness
of twelve esteemed Indian physics and astronomy journals over a twelve years' (2009-2020) time
span is analysed here. Besides Uncitedness Factor (UF), three other indicators are introduced
here, viz. Citation per paper per Year (CY), h-core Density (HD) and Time-normalised h-index (TH).
The journal-wise variational patterns of these four indicators, i.e. UF, CY, HD and TH and the relationships
of UF with other three indicators are analysed. The calculated numerical values of these indicators
are observed to formulate seven hypotheses, which are tested by F-Test method. The average annual
rate of change of uncited paper is found 67% of total number of papers. The indicator CY is found temporally
constant. The indicator HD is found nearly constant journal-wise over the entire time span, while
the indicator TH is found nearly constant for all journals. The UF inversely varies with CY and TH
for the journals and directly varies with TH over the years. Except few highly reputed Indian journals
in physics and astronomy, majority other journals face the situation of uncitedness. The uncitedness
of Indian journals in this field outshines the same for global journals by 12%, which indicates lack
of circulation and timely reach of research communication to the relevant audience.

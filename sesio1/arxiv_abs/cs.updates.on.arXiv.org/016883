DeepFakes are raising significant social concerns. Although various DeepFake detectors have
been developed as forensic countermeasures, these detectors are still vulnerable to attacks.
Recently, a few attacks, principally adversarial attacks, have succeeded in cloaking DeepFake
images to evade detection. However, these attacks have typical detector-specific designs, which
require prior knowledge about the detector, leading to poor transferability. Moreover, these
attacks only consider simple security scenarios. Less is known about how effective they are in high-level
scenarios where either the detectors or the attacker's knowledge varies. In this paper, we solve
the above challenges with presenting a novel detector-agnostic trace removal attack for DeepFake
anti-forensics. Instead of investigating the detector side, our attack looks into the original
DeepFake creation pipeline, attempting to remove all detectable natural DeepFake traces to render
the fake images more "authentic". To implement this attack, first, we perform a DeepFake trace discovery,
identifying three discernible traces. Then a trace removal network (TR-Net) is proposed based
on an adversarial learning framework involving one generator and multiple discriminators. Each
discriminator is responsible for one individual trace representation to avoid cross-trace interference.
These discriminators are arranged in parallel, which prompts the generator to remove various traces
simultaneously. To evaluate the attack efficacy, we crafted heterogeneous security scenarios
where the detectors were embedded with different levels of defense and the attackers' background
knowledge of data varies. The experimental results show that the proposed attack can significantly
compromise the detection accuracy of six state-of-the-art DeepFake detectors while causing only
a negligible loss in visual quality to the original DeepFake samples.

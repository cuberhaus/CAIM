Ridesplitting, which is a form of pooled ridesourcing service, has great potential to alleviate
the negative impacts of ridesourcing on the environment. However, most existing studies only explored
its theoretical environmental benefits based on optimization models and simulations. To put into
practice, this study aims to reveal the real-world emission reduction of ridesplitting and its
determinants based on the observed data of ridesourcing in Chengdu, China. Integrating the trip
data with the COPERT model, this study calculates the CO2 emissions of shared rides (ridesplitting)
and their substituted single rides (regular ridesourcing) to estimate the CO2 emission reduction
of each ridesplitting trip. The results show that not all ridesplitting trips reduce emissions
from ridesourcing in the real world. The CO2 emission reduction rate of ridesplitting varies from
trip to trip, averaging at 43.15g/km. Then, the interpretable machine learning models, gradient
boosting machines, are applied to explore the relationship between the CO2 emission reduction
rate of ridesplitting and its determinants. Based on the SHapley Additive exPlanations method,
the overlap rate and detour rate of shared rides are identified to be the most important factors that
determine the CO2 emission reduction rate of ridesplitting. Increasing the overlap rate, the number
of shared rides, average speed, and ride distance ratio and decreasing the detour rate, actual trip
distance, ride distance gap can increase the CO2 emission reduction rate of ridesplitting. In addition,
nonlinear effects and interactions of several key factors are examined through the partial dependence
plots. This study provides a scientific method for the government and ridesourcing companies to
better assess and optimize the environmental benefits of ridesplitting.

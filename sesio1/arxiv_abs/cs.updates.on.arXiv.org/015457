Using the data from loop detector sensors for near-real-time detection of traffic incidents in
highways is crucial to averting major traffic congestion. While recent supervised machine learning
methods offer solutions to incident detection by leveraging human-labeled incident data, the
false alarm rate is often too high to be used in practice. Specifically, the inconsistency in the
human labeling of the incidents significantly affects the performance of supervised learning
models. To that end, we focus on a data-centric approach to improve the accuracy and reduce the false
alarm rate of traffic incident detection on highways. We develop a weak supervised learning workflow
to generate high-quality training labels for the incident data without the ground truth labels,
and we use those generated labels in the supervised learning setup for final detection. This approach
comprises three stages. First, we introduce a data preprocessing and curation pipeline that processes
traffic sensor data to generate high-quality training data through leveraging labeling functions,
which can be domain knowledge-related or simple heuristic rules. Second, we evaluate the training
data generated by weak supervision using three supervised learning models -- random forest, k-nearest
neighbors, and a support vector machine ensemble -- and long short-term memory classifiers. The
results show that the accuracy of all of the models improves significantly after using the training
data generated by weak supervision. Third, we develop an online real-time incident detection approach
that leverages the model ensemble and the uncertainty quantification while detecting incidents.
Overall, we show that our proposed weak supervised learning workflow achieves a high incident detection
rate (0.90) and low false alarm rate (0.08).

Image harmonization task aims at harmonizing different composite foreground regions according
to specific background image. Previous methods would rather focus on improving the reconstruction
ability of the generator by some internal enhancements such as attention, adaptive normalization
and light adjustment, $etc.$. However, they pay less attention to discriminating the foreground
and background appearance features within a restricted generator, which becomes a new challenge
in image harmonization task. In this paper, we propose a novel image harmonization framework with
external style fusion and region-wise contrastive learning scheme. For the external style fusion,
we leverage the external background appearance from the encoder as the style reference to generate
harmonized foreground in the decoder. This approach enhances the harmonization ability of the
decoder by external background guidance. Moreover, for the contrastive learning scheme, we design
a region-wise contrastive loss function for image harmonization task. Specifically, we first
introduce a straight-forward samples generation method that selects negative samples from the
output harmonized foreground region and selects positive samples from the ground-truth background
region. Our method attempts to bring together corresponding positive and negative samples by maximizing
the mutual information between the foreground and background styles, which desirably makes our
harmonization network more robust to discriminate the foreground and background style features
when harmonizing composite images. Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets show that
our method can achieve a clear improvement in harmonization quality and demonstrate the good generalization
capability in real-scenario applications.

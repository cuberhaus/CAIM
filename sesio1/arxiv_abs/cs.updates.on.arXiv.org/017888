Deep transfer learning techniques try to tackle the limitations of deep learning, the dependency
on extensive training data and the training costs, by reusing obtained knowledge. However, the
current DTL techniques suffer from either catastrophic forgetting dilemma (losing the previously
obtained knowledge) or overly biased pre-trained models (harder to adapt to target data) in finetuning
pre-trained models or freezing a part of the pre-trained model, respectively. Progressive learning,
a sub-category of DTL, reduces the effect of the overly biased model in the case of freezing earlier
layers by adding a new layer to the end of a frozen pre-trained model. Even though it has been successful
in many cases, it cannot yet handle distant source and target data. We propose a new continual/progressive
learning approach for deep transfer learning to tackle these limitations. To avoid both catastrophic
forgetting and overly biased-model problems, we expand the pre-trained model by expanding pre-trained
layers (adding new nodes to each layer) in the model instead of only adding new layers. Hence the method
is named EXPANSE. Our experimental results confirm that we can tackle distant source and target
data using this technique. At the same time, the final model is still valid on the source data, achieving
a promising deep continual learning approach. Moreover, we offer a new way of training deep learning
models inspired by the human education system. We termed this two-step training: learning basics
first, then adding complexities and uncertainties. The evaluation implies that the two-step training
extracts more meaningful features and a finer basin on the error surface since it can achieve better
accuracy in comparison to regular training. EXPANSE (model expansion and two-step training) is
a systematic continual learning approach applicable to different problems and DL models.

Semi-supervised learning provides great significance in left atrium (LA) segmentation model
learning with insufficient labelled data. Generalising semi-supervised learning to cross-domain
data is of high importance to further improve model robustness. However, the widely existing distribution
difference and sample mismatch between different data domains hinder the generalisation of semi-supervised
learning. In this study, we alleviate these problems by proposing an Adaptive Hierarchical Dual
Consistency (AHDC) for the semi-supervised LA segmentation on cross-domain data. The AHDC mainly
consists of a Bidirectional Adversarial Inference module (BAI) and a Hierarchical Dual Consistency
learning module (HDC). The BAI overcomes the difference of distributions and the sample mismatch
between two different domains. It mainly learns two mapping networks adversarially to obtain two
matched domains through mutual adaptation. The HDC investigates a hierarchical dual learning
paradigm for cross-domain semi-supervised segmentation based on the obtained matched domains.
It mainly builds two dual-modelling networks for mining the complementary information in both
intra-domain and inter-domain. For the intra-domain learning, a consistency constraint is applied
to the dual-modelling targets to exploit the complementary modelling information. For the inter-domain
learning, a consistency constraint is applied to the LAs modelled by two dual-modelling networks
to exploit the complementary knowledge among different data domains. We demonstrated the performance
of our proposed AHDC on four 3D late gadolinium enhancement cardiac MR (LGE-CMR) datasets from different
centres and a 3D CT dataset. Compared to other state-of-the-art methods, our proposed AHDC achieved
higher segmentation accuracy, which indicated its capability in the cross-domain semi-supervised
LA segmentation.

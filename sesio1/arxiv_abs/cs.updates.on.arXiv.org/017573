Recent advances in machine learning technologies and sensing have paved the way for the belief that
safe, accessible, and convenient autonomous vehicles may be realized in the near future. Despite
tremendous advances within this context, fundamental challenges around safety and reliability
are limiting their arrival and comprehensive adoption. Autonomous vehicles are often tasked with
operating in dynamic and uncertain environments. As a result, they often make use of highly complex
components, such as machine learning approaches, to handle the nuances of sensing, actuation,
and control. While these methods are highly effective, they are notoriously difficult to assure.
Moreover, within uncertain and dynamic environments, design time assurance analyses may not be
sufficient to guarantee safety. Thus, it is critical to monitor the correctness of these systems
at runtime. One approach for providing runtime assurance of systems with components that may not
be amenable to formal analysis is the simplex architecture, where an unverified component is wrapped
with a safety controller and a switching logic designed to prevent dangerous behavior. In this paper,
we propose using a real-time reachability algorithm for the implementation of the simplex architecture
to assure the safety of a 1/10 scale open source autonomous vehicle platform known as F1/10. The reachability
algorithm that we leverage (a) provides provable guarantees of safety, and (b) is used to detect
potentially unsafe scenarios. In our approach, the need to analyze an underlying controller is
abstracted away, instead focusing on the effects of the controller's decisions on the system's
future states. We demonstrate the efficacy of our architecture through a vast set of experiments
conducted both in simulation and on an embedded hardware platform.

It is commonly agreed that data will be one of the cornerstones of Future Internet systems. In this
context, mobile Opportunistic Networks (ONs) are one of the key paradigms to support, in a self-organising
and decentralised manner, the growth of data generated by localized interactions between users
mobile devices, and between them and nearby devices such as IoT nodes. In ONs, the spontaneous collaboration
among mobile devices is exploited to disseminate data toward interested users. However, the limited
resources and knowledge available at each node, and the vast amount of data available, make it difficult
to devise efficient schemes to accomplish this task. Recent solutions propose to equip each device
with data filtering methods derived from human data processing schemes, known as Cognitive Heuristics,
i.e. very effective methods used by the brain to quickly drop useless information, while keeping
the most relevant one. These solutions can become less effective when facing dynamic scenarios
or situations where nodes cannot fully collaborate. One of the reasons is that the solutions proposed
so far do not take take into account the social structure of the environment where the nodes move in.
To be more effective, the selection of information performed by each node should take into consideration
this dimension of the environment. In this paper we propose a social-based data dissemination scheme,
based on the cognitive Social Circle Heuristic. This evaluation method exploits the structure
of the social environment to make inferences about the relevance of discovered information. We
show how the Social Circle Heuristic, coupled with a cognitive-based community detection scheme,
can be exploited to design an effective data dissemination algorithm for ONs. We provide a detailed
analysis of the performance of the proposed solution via simulation.

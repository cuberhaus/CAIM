Recently, leveraging different channels to model social semantic information and using self-supervised
learning tasks to boost recommendation performance has been proven to be a very promising work.
However, how to deeply dig out the relationship between different channels and make full use of it
while maintaining the uniqueness of each channel is a problem that has not been well studied and resolved
in this field. Under such circumstances, this paper explores and verifies the deficiency of directly
constructing contrastive learning tasks on different channels with practical experiments and
proposes the scheme of interactive modeling and matching representation across different channels.
This is the first attempt in the field of recommender systems, we believe the insight of this paper
is inspirational to future self-supervised learning research based on multi-channel information.
To solve this problem, we propose a cross-channel matching representation model based on attentive
interaction, which realizes efficient modeling of the relationship between cross-channel information.
Based on this, we also propose a hierarchical self-supervised learning model, which realizes two
levels of self-supervised learning within and between channels, which improves the ability of
self-supervised tasks to autonomously mine different levels of potential information. We have
conducted abundant experiments, and various metrics on multiple public datasets show that the
method proposed in this paper has a significant improvement compared with the state-of-the-art
methods, no matter in the general or cold-start scenario. And in the experiment of model variant
analysis, the benefits of the cross-channel matching representation model and the hierarchical
self-supervised model proposed in this paper are also fully verified.

Quantum computing is one of the most promising technology advances of the latest years. Once only
a conceptual idea to solve physics simulations, quantum computation is today a reality, with numerous
machines able to execute quantum algorithms. One of the hardest challenges in quantum computing
is reliability. Qubits are highly sensitive to noise, which can make the output useless. Moreover,
lately it has been shown that superconducting qubits are extremely susceptible to external sources
of faults, such as ionizing radiation. When adopted in large scale, radiation-induced errors are
expected to become a serious challenge for qubits reliability. In this paper, we propose an evaluation
of the impact of transient faults in the execution of quantum circuits. Inspired by the Architectural
and Program Vulnerability Factors, widely adopted to characterize the reliability of classical
computing architectures and algorithms, we propose the Quantum Vulnerability Factor (QVF) as
a metric to measure the impact that the corruption of a qubit has on the circuit output probability
distribution. First, we model faults based on the latest studies on real machines and recently performed
radiation experiments. Then, we design a quantum fault injector, built over Qiskit, and characterize
the propagation of faults in quantum circuits. We report the finding of more than 15,000,000 fault
injections, evaluating the reliability of three quantum circuits and identifying the faults and
qubits that are more likely than others to impact the output. With our results, we give guidelines
on how to map the qubits in the real quantum computer to reduce the output error and to reduce the probability
of having a radiation-induced corruption to modify the output. Finally, we compare the simulation
results with experiments on physical quantum computers.

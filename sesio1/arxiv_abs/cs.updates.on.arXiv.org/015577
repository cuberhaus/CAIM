Advancements in surface haptics technology have given rise to the development of interactive applications
displaying tactile content on touch surfaces such as images, signs, diagrams, plots, charts, graphs,
maps, networks, and tables. In those applications, users manually explore the touch surface to
interact with the tactile data using some intuitive strategies. The user's exploration strategy,
tactile data's complexity, and tactile rendering method all affect the user's haptic perception,
which plays a critical role in design and prototyping of those applications. In this study, we conducted
experiments with human participants to investigate the recognition rate and time of five tactile
shapes rendered by electrovibration on a touchscreen using three different methods and displayed
in prototypical orientation and non-prototypical orientations. The results showed that the correct
recognition rate of the shapes was higher when the haptically active area was larger. However, as
the number of edges increased, the recognition time increased and the recognition rate dropped
significantly, arriving to a value slightly higher than the chance rate of 20% for non-prototypical
octagon. We also recorded the participants' finger movements on the touchscreen to examine their
haptic exploration strategies. Our analyses revealed that the participants first used global
scanning to extract the coarse features of the displayed shapes, and then they applied local scanning
to identify finer details, but needed another global scan for final confirmation in the case of non-prototypical
shapes, possibly due to the current limitations of electrovibration technology in displaying
tactile stimuli to a user. We observed that it was highly difficult to follow the edges of shapes and
recognize shapes with more than five edges under electrovibration when a single finger was used
for exploration.

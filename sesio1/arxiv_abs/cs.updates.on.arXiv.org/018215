Hackathons are time-bounded collaborative events of intense teamwork to build prototypes usually
in the form of software, aiming to specific challenges proposed by the organizers. These events
became a widespread practice in the IT industry, universities and many other scenarios, as a result
of a growing open-innovation trend in the last decade. Since the main deliverable of these events
is a demonstrable version of an idea, such as early hardware or software prototypes, the short time
frame requires participants to quickly understand the proposed challenge or even identify issues
related to a given domain. To create solutions, teams follow an ad-hoc but effective design approach,
that many times seems informal since the background of the participants is rather centered on technical
aspects (e.g., web and mobile programming) and does not involve any training in Design Thinking.
To understand this creative process, we conducted 37 interviews (32 hackathons winners and 5 hackathon
organizers) with people from 16 countries. We aimed to identify the design processes and recurring
design methods applied by winners in these events. Also, we conducted a focus group with 8 people
experienced in hackathons (participants and organizers) to discuss our findings. Our analysis
revealed that although hackathon winners with IT background have no formal training on Design Thinking,
they are aware of many design methods, typically following a sequence of phases that involve divergent
and convergent thinking to explore the problem space and propose alternatives in a solution space,
which is the rationale behind Design Thinking. We derived a set of recommendations based on design
strategies that seem to lead to successful hackathon participation. These recommendations can
also be useful to organizers who intend to enhance the experience of newcomers in hackathons.

A wide variety of Cyber Threat Information (CTI) is used by Security Operation Centres (SOCs) to
perform validation of security incidents and alerts. Security experts manually define different
types of rules and scripts based on CTI to perform validation tasks. These rules and scripts need
to be updated continuously due to evolving threats, changing SOCs' requirements and dynamic nature
of CTI. The manual process of updating rules and scripts delays the response to attacks. To reduce
the burden of human experts and accelerate response, we propose a novel Artificial Intelligence
(AI) based framework, SmartValidator. SmartValidator leverages Machine Learning (ML) techniques
to enable automated validation of alerts. It consists of three layers to perform the tasks of data
collection, model building and alert validation. It projects the validation task as a classification
problem. Instead of building and saving models for all possible requirements, we propose to automatically
construct the validation models based on SOC's requirements and CTI. We built a Proof of Concept
(PoC) system with eight ML algorithms, two feature engineering techniques and 18 requirements
to investigate the effectiveness and efficiency of SmartValidator. The evaluation results showed
that when prediction models were built automatically for classifying cyber threat data, the F1-score
of 75\% of the models were above 0.8, which indicates adequate performance of the PoC for use in a real-world
organization. The results further showed that dynamic construction of prediction models required
99\% less models to be built than pre-building models for all possible requirements. The framework
can be followed by various industries to accelerate and automate the validation of alerts and incidents
based on their CTI and SOC's preferences.

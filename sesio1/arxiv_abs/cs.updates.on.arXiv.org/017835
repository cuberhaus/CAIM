Deep learning (DL) has remarkably impacted several different scientific disciplines over the
last few years. E.g., in image processing and analysis, DL algorithms were able to outperform other
cutting-edge methods. Additionally, DL has delivered state-of-the-art results in tasks like
autonomous driving, outclassing previous attempts. There are even instances where DL outperformed
humans, for example with object recognition and gaming. DL is also showing vast potential in the
medical domain. With the collection of large quantities of patient records and data, and a trend
towards personalized treatments, there is a great need for automated and reliable processing and
analysis of health information. Patient data is not only collected in clinical centers, like hospitals
and private practices, but also by mobile healthcare apps or online websites. The abundance of collected
patient data and the recent growth in the DL field has resulted in a large increase in research efforts.
In Q2/2020, the search engine PubMed returned already over 11,000 results for the search term 'deep
learning', and around 90% of these publications are from the last three years. However, even though
PubMed represents the largest search engine in the medical field, it does not cover all medical-related
publications. Hence, a complete overview of the field of 'medical deep learning' is almost impossible
to obtain and acquiring a full overview of medical sub-fields is becoming increasingly more difficult.
Nevertheless, several review and survey articles about medical DL have been published within the
last few years. They focus, in general, on specific medical scenarios, like the analysis of medical
images containing specific pathologies. With these surveys as a foundation, the aim of this article
is to provide the first high-level, systematic meta-review of medical DL surveys.

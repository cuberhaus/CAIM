Deformable image registration is fundamental for many medical image analyses. A key obstacle for
accurate image registration lies in image appearance variations such as the variations in texture,
intensities, and noise. These variations are readily apparent in medical images, especially in
brain images where registration is frequently used. Recently, deep learning-based registration
methods (DLRs), using deep neural networks, have shown computational efficiency that is several
orders of magnitude faster than traditional optimization-based registration methods (ORs).
DLRs rely on a globally optimized network that is trained with a set of training samples to achieve
faster registration. DLRs tend, however, to disregard the target-pair-specific optimization
inherent in ORs and thus have degraded adaptability to variations in testing samples. This limitation
is severe for registering medical images with large appearance variations, especially since few
existing DLRs explicitly take into account appearance variations. In this study, we propose an
Appearance Adjustment Network (AAN) to enhance the adaptability of DLRs to appearance variations.
Our AAN, when integrated into a DLR, provides appearance transformations to reduce the appearance
variations during registration. In addition, we propose an anatomy-constrained loss function
through which our AAN generates anatomy-preserving transformations. Our AAN has been purposely
designed to be readily inserted into a wide range of DLRs and can be trained cooperatively in an unsupervised
and end-to-end manner. We evaluated our AAN with three state-of-the-art DLRs on three well-established
public datasets of 3D brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The results show that our AAN consistently
improved existing DLRs and outperformed state-of-the-art ORs on registration accuracy, while
adding a fractional computational load to existing DLRs.

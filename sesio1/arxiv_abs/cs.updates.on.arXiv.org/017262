Text-based communication is highly favoured as a communication method, especially in business
environments. As a result, it is often abused by sending malicious messages, e.g., spam emails,
to deceive users into relaying personal information, including online accounts credentials or
banking details. For this reason, many machine learning methods for text classification have been
proposed and incorporated into the services of most email providers. However, optimising text
classification algorithms and finding the right tradeoff on their aggressiveness is still a major
research problem. We present an updated survey of 12 machine learning text classifiers applied
to a public spam corpus. A new pipeline is proposed to optimise hyperparameter selection and improve
the models' performance by applying specific methods (based on natural language processing) in
the preprocessing stage. Our study aims to provide a new methodology to investigate and optimise
the effect of different feature sizes and hyperparameters in machine learning classifiers that
are widely used in text classification problems. The classifiers are tested and evaluated on different
metrics including F-score (accuracy), precision, recall, and run time. By analysing all these
aspects, we show how the proposed pipeline can be used to achieve a good accuracy towards spam filtering
on the Enron dataset, a widely used public email corpus. Statistical tests and explainability techniques
are applied to provide a robust analysis of the proposed pipeline and interpret the classification
outcomes of the 12 machine learning models, also identifying words that drive the classification
results. Our analysis shows that it is possible to identify an effective machine learning model
to classify the Enron dataset with an F-score of 94%.

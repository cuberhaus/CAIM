Profile hidden Markov models (pHMMs) are widely used in many bioinformatics applications to accurately
identify similarities between biological sequences (e.g., DNA or protein sequences). PHMMs use
a commonly-adopted and highly-accurate method, called the Baum-Welch algorithm, to calculate
these similarities. However, the Baum-Welch algorithm is computationally expensive, and existing
works provide either software- or hardware-only solutions for a fixed pHMM design. When we analyze
the state-of-the-art works, we find that there is a pressing need for a flexible, high-performant,
and energy-efficient hardware-software co-design to efficiently and effectively solve all the
major inefficiencies in the Baum-Welch algorithm for pHMMs. We propose ApHMM, the first flexible
acceleration framework that can significantly reduce computational and energy overheads of the
Baum-Welch algorithm for pHMMs. ApHMM leverages hardware-software co-design to solve the major
inefficiencies in the Baum-Welch algorithm by 1) designing a flexible hardware to support different
pHMMs designs, 2) exploiting the predictable data dependency pattern in an on-chip memory with
memoization techniques, 3) quickly eliminating negligible computations with a hardware-based
filter, and 4) minimizing the redundant computations. We implement our 1) hardware-software optimizations
on a specialized hardware and 2) software optimizations for GPUs to provide the first flexible Baum-Welch
accelerator for pHMMs. ApHMM provides significant speedups of 15.55x-260.03x, 1.83x-5.34x,
and 27.97x compared to CPU, GPU, and FPGA implementations of the Baum-Welch algorithm, respectively.
ApHMM outperforms the state-of-the-art CPU implementations of three important bioinformatics
applications, 1) error correction, 2) protein family search, and 3) multiple sequence alignment,
by 1.29x-59.94x, 1.03x-1.75x, and 1.03x-1.95x, respectively.

In the F-minor-free deletion problem we want to find a minimum vertex set in a given graph that intersects
all minor models of graphs from the family F. The Vertex planarization problem is a special case of
F-minor-free deletion for the family F = {K_5, K_{3,3}}. Whenever the family F contains at least
one planar graph, then F-minor-free deletion is known to admit a constant-factor approximation
algorithm and a polynomial kernelization [Fomin, Lokshtanov, Misra, and Saurabh, FOCS'12]. The
Vertex planarization problem is arguably the simplest setting for which F does not contain a planar
graph and the existence of a constant-factor approximation or a polynomial kernelization remains
a major open problem. In this work we show that Vertex planarization admits an algorithm which is
a combination of both approaches. Namely, we present a polynomial A-approximate kernelization,
for some constant A > 1, based on the framework of lossy kernelization [Lokshtanov, Panolan, Ramanujan,
and Saurabh, STOC'17]. Simply speaking, when given a graph G and integer k, we show how to compute
a graph G' on poly(k) vertices so that any B-approximate solution to G' can be lifted to an (A*B)-approximate
solution to G, as long as A*B*OPT(G) <= k. In order to achieve this, we develop a framework for sparsification
of planar graphs which approximately preserves all separators and near-separators between subsets
of the given terminal set. Our result yields an improvement over the state-of-art approximation
algorithms for Vertex planarization. The problem admits a polynomial-time O(n^eps)-approximation
algorithm, for any eps > 0, and a quasi-polynomial-time (log n)^O(1) approximation algorithm,
both randomized [Kawarabayashi and Sidiropoulos, FOCS'17]. By pipelining these algorithms with
our approximate kernelization, we improve the approximation factors to respectively O(OPT^eps)
and (log OPT)^O(1).

Synthetic biology and bioengineering provide the opportunity to create novel embodied cognitive
systems (otherwise known as minds) in a very wide variety of chimeric architectures combining evolved
and designed material and software. These advances are disrupting familiar concepts in the philosophy
of mind, and require new ways of thinking about and comparing truly diverse intelligences, whose
composition and origin are not like any of the available natural model species. In this Perspective,
I introduce TAME - Technological Approach to Mind Everywhere - a framework for understanding and
manipulating cognition in unconventional substrates. TAME formalizes a non-binary (continuous),
empirically-based approach to strongly embodied agency. When applied to regenerating/developmental
systems, TAME suggests a perspective on morphogenesis as an example of basal cognition. The deep
symmetry between problem-solving in anatomical, physiological, transcriptional, and 3D (traditional
behavioral) spaces drives specific hypotheses by which cognitive capacities can scale during
evolution. An important medium exploited by evolution for joining active subunits into greater
agents is developmental bioelectricity, implemented by pre-neural use of ion channels and gap
junctions to scale cell-level feedback loops into anatomical homeostasis. This architecture
of multi-scale competency of biological systems has important implications for plasticity of
bodies and minds, greatly potentiating evolvability. Considering classical and recent data from
the perspectives of computational science, evolutionary biology, and basal cognition, reveals
a rich research program with many implications for cognitive science, evolutionary biology, regenerative
medicine, and artificial intelligence.

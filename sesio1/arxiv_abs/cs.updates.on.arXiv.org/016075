Unlike the conventional facial expressions, micro-expressions are involuntary and transient
facial expressions capable of revealing the genuine emotions that people attempt to hide. Therefore,
they can provide important information in a broad range of applications such as lie detection, criminal
detection, etc. Since micro-expressions are transient and of low intensity, however, their detection
and recognition is difficult and relies heavily on expert experiences. Due to its intrinsic particularity
and complexity, video-based micro-expression analysis is attractive but challenging, and has
recently become an active area of research. Although there have been numerous developments in this
area, thus far there has been no comprehensive survey that provides researchers with a systematic
overview of these developments with a unified evaluation. Accordingly, in this survey paper, we
first highlight the key differences between macro- and micro-expressions, then use these differences
to guide our research survey of video-based micro-expression analysis in a cascaded structure,
encompassing the neuropsychological basis, datasets, features, spotting algorithms, recognition
algorithms, applications and evaluation of state-of-the-art approaches. For each aspect, the
basic techniques, advanced developments and major challenges are addressed and discussed. Furthermore,
after considering the limitations of existing micro-expression datasets, we present and release
a new dataset - called micro-and-macro expression warehouse (MMEW) - containing more video samples
and more labeled emotion types. We then perform a unified comparison of representative methods
on CAS(ME)2 for spotting, and on MMEW and SAMM for recognition, respectively. Finally, some potential
future research directions are explored and outlined.

Adversarial learning is a widely used technique in fair representation learning to remove the biases
on sensitive attributes from data representations. It usually requires to incorporate the sensitive
attribute labels as prediction targets. However, in many scenarios the sensitive attribute labels
of many samples can be unknown, and it is difficult to train a strong discriminator based on the scarce
data with observed attribute labels, which may lead to generate unfair representations. In this
paper, we propose a semi-supervised fair representation learning approach based on adversarial
variational autoencoder, which can reduce the dependency of adversarial fair models on data with
labeled sensitive attributes. More specifically, we use a bias-aware model to capture inherent
bias information on sensitive attribute by accurately predicting sensitive attributes from input
data, and we use a bias-free model to learn debiased fair representations by using adversarial learning
to remove bias information from them. The hidden representations learned by the two models are regularized
to be orthogonal. In addition, the soft labels predicted by the two models are further integrated
into a semi-supervised variational autoencoder to reconstruct the input data, and we apply an additional
entropy regularization to encourage the attribute labels inferred from the bias-free model to
be high-entropy. In this way, the bias-aware model can better capture attribute information while
the bias-free model is less discriminative on sensitive attributes if the input data is well reconstructed.
Extensive experiments on two datasets for different tasks validate that our approach can achieve
good representation learning fairness under limited data with sensitive attribute labels.

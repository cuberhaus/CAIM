We address the problem of mechanism design for two-stage repeated stochastic games -- a novel setting
using which many emerging problems in next-generation electricity markets can be readily modeled.
Repeated playing affords the players a large class of strategies that adapt a player's actions to
all past observations and inferences obtained therefrom. In other settings such as iterative auctions
or dynamic games where a large strategy space of this sort manifests, it typically has an important
implication for mechanism design: It may be impossible to obtain truth-telling as a dominant strategy
equilibrium. Consequently, in such scenarios, it is common to settle for mechanisms that render
truth-telling only a Nash equilibrium, or variants thereof, even though Nash equilibria are known
to be poor models of real-world behavior owing to each player having to make overly specific assumptions
about the behaviors of the other players in order for them to employ their Nash equilibrium strategy.
In general, the lesser the burden of speculation in an equilibrium, the more plausible it is that
it models real-world behavior. Guided by this maxim, we introduce a new notion of equilibrium called
Dominant Strategy Non-Bankrupting Equilibrium (DNBE) which requires the players to make very
little assumptions about the behavior of the other players to employ their equilibrium strategy.
Consequently, a mechanism that renders truth-telling a DNBE as opposed to only a Nash equilibrium
could be quite effective in molding real-world behavior along the desired lines. Finally, we present
a mechanism for two-stage repeated stochastic games that renders truth-telling a Dominant Strategy
Non-Bankrupting Equilibrium. The mechanism also guarantees individual rationality and maximizes
social welfare.

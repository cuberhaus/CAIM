Immersive displays such as VR headsets, AR glasses, Multiview displays, Free point televisions
have emerged as a new class of display technologies in recent years, offering a better visual experience
and viewer engagement as compared to conventional displays. With the evolution of 3D video and display
technologies, the consumer market for High Dynamic Range (HDR) cameras and displays is quickly
growing. The lack of appropriate experimental data is a critical hindrance for the development
of primary research efforts in the field of 3D HDR video technology. Also, the unavailability of
sufficient real world multi-exposure experimental dataset is a major bottleneck for HDR imaging
research, thereby limiting the quality of experience (QoE) for the viewers. In this paper, we introduce
a diversified stereoscopic multi-exposure dataset captured within the campus of Indian Institute
of Technology Madras, which is home to a diverse flora and fauna. The dataset is captured using ZED
stereoscopic camera and provides intricate scenes of outdoor locations such as gardens, roadside
views, festival venues, buildings and indoor locations such as academic and residential areas.
The proposed dataset accommodates wide depth range, complex depth structure, complicate object
movement, illumination variations, rich color dynamics, texture discrepancy in addition to significant
randomness introduced by moving camera and background motion. The proposed dataset is made publicly
available to the research community. Furthermore, the procedure for capturing, aligning and calibrating
multi-exposure stereo videos and images is described in detail. Finally, we have discussed the
progress, challenges, potential use cases and future research opportunities with respect to HDR
imaging, depth estimation, consistent tone mapping and 3D HDR coding.

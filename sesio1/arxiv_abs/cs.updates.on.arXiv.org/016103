In today's world, computer networks have become vulnerable to numerous attacks. In both wireless
and wired networks, one of the most common attacks is man-in-the-middle attacks, within which session
hijacking, context confusion attacks have been the most attempted. A potential attacker may have
enough time to launch an attack targeting these vulnerabilities (such as rerouting the target request
to a malicious server or hijacking the traffic). A viable strategy to solve this problem is, by dynamically
changing the system properties, configurations and create unique fingerprints to identify the
source. However, the existing work of fingerprinting mainly focuses on lower-level properties
(e.g IP address), and only these types of properties are restricted for mutation. We develop a novel
system, called Verify-Pro, to provide server authentication using communication protocol dialects,
that uses a client-server architecture based on network protocols for customizing the communication
transactions. For each session, a particular sequence of handshakes will be used as dialects. So,
given the context, with the establishment of a one-time username and password, we use the dialects
as an authentication mechanism for each request (e.g get filename in FTP) throughout the session,
which enforces continuous authentication. Specifically, we leverage a machine learning approach
on both client and server machines to trigger a specific dialect that dynamically changes for each
request. We implement a prototype of Verify-Pro and evaluate its practicality on standard communication
protocols FTP, HTTP & internet of things protocol MQTT. Our experimental results show that by sending
misleading information through message packets from an attacker at the application layer, it is
possible for the recipient to identify if the sender is genuine or a spoofed one, with a negligible
overhead of 0.536%.

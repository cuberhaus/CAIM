Accurate delineation of the left ventricular boundaries in late gadolinium-enhanced magnetic
resonance imaging (LGE-MRI) is an essential step for scar tissue quantification and patient-specific
assessment of myocardial infarction. Many deep-learning techniques have been proposed to perform
automatic segmentations of the left ventricle (LV) in LGE-MRI showing segmentations as accurate
as those obtained by expert cardiologists. Thus far, the existing models have been overwhelmingly
developed and evaluated with LGE-MRI datasets from single clinical centers. However, in practice,
LGE-MRI images vary significantly between clinical centers within and across countries, in particular
due to differences in the MRI scanners, imaging conditions, contrast injection protocols and local
clinical practise. This work investigates for the first time multi-center and multi-vendor LV
segmentation in LGE-MRI, by proposing, implementing and evaluating in detail several strategies
to enhance model generalizability across clinical cites. These include data augmentation to artificially
augment the image variability in the training sample, image harmonization to align the distributions
of LGE-MRI images across centers, and transfer learning to adjust existing single-center models
to unseen images from new clinical sites. The results obtained based on a new multi-center LGE-MRI
dataset acquired in four clinical centers in Spain, France and China, show that the combination
of data augmentation and transfer learning can lead to single-center models that generalize well
to new clinical centers not included in the original training. The proposed framework shows the
potential for developing clinical tools for automated LV segmentation in LGE-MRI that can be deployed
in multiple clinical centers across distinct geographical locations.

We investigate various online packing problems in which convex polygons arrive one by one and have
to be placed irrevocably into a container before the next piece is revealed; the pieces must not be
rotated, but only translated. The aim is to minimize the used space depending on the specific problem
at hand, e.g., the strip length in strip packing, the number of bins in bin packing, etc. We draw interesting
connections to the following online sorting problem \OnlineSorting{}$[\gamma,n]$: We receive
a stream of real numbers $s_1,\ldots,s_n$, $s_i\in[0,1]$, one by one. Each real must be placed in
an array~$A$ with $\gamma n$ initially empty cells without knowing the subsequent reals. The goal
is to minimize the sum of differences of consecutive reals in $A$. The offline optimum is to place
the reals in sorted order so the cost is at most $1$. We show that for any $\Delta$-competitive online
algorithm of \OnlineSorting{}$[\gamma,n]$, it holds that $\gamma \Delta \in\Omega(\log n/\log
\log n)$. We use this lower bound to prove the non-existence of competitive algorithms for various
online translational packing problems of convex polygons, among them strip packing, bin packing
and perimeter packing. This also implies that there exists no online algorithm that can pack all
streams of pieces of diameter and total area at most $\delta$ into the unit square. These results
are in contrast to the case when the pieces are restricted to rectangles, for which competitive algorithms
are known. Likewise, the offline versions of packing convex polygons have constant factor approximation
algorithms. On the positive side, we present an algorithm with competitive ratio $O(n^{0.59})$
for online translational strip packing of convex polygons. In the case of \OnlineSorting{}$[C,n]$
for any constant $C>1$, we present an $O(2^{O(\sqrt{\log n\log\log n})})$-competitive algorithm.

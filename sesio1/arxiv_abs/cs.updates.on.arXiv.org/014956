In recent years, neural network has shown its strong power in various fields, and it also brings increasing
security threats. The stegomalware based on neural network model is a representative one. Previous
research preliminary proves the feasibility of launching malicious attacks by triggering malware
embedded in the neural network model. However, the existing works have not shown that this emerging
threat is practical in real-world attacks because of the low malware embedding rate, the high model
performance degradation and the extra efforts. Therefore, we predict an improved stegomalware
called EvilModel. We embed binary formed malware into neural network model as its parameters on
the basis of analyzing the structure of the neural network model, and propose three new malware embedding
technologies, namely MSB reservation, fast substitution and half substitution. By marrying 19
malware samples and 10 popular neural network models, we build 550 malware-embedded models, and
analyze these models' performance on ImageNet dataset. The experimental results show that the
half substitution almost performs perfectly, with a malware embedding rate of 48.52% and no model
performance degradation or extra effort. Considering a series of factors, we propose a quantitative
algorithm to evaluate the different embedding methods. The evaluation result indicates that EvilModel
is much superior to the classic Stegonet. Additionally, we conduct a case study to trigger EvilModel
in a real-world scenario. To understand the proposed malware embedding technology deeply, we also
investigate the impact of neural network structures, layer and parameter size on malware embedding
capacity and embedded model accuracy. We also give some possible countermeasures to defend EvilModel.
We hope this work can provide a comprehensive understanding of such a novel AI-powered threat, and
recommend to defense it in advance.

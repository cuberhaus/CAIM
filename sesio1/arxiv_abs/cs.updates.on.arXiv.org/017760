Advances in artificial intelligence often stem from the development of new environments that abstract
real-world situations into a form where research can be done conveniently. This paper contributes
such an environment based on ideas inspired by elementary Microeconomics. Agents learn to produce
resources in a spatially complex world, trade them with one another, and consume those that they
prefer. We show that the emergent production, consumption, and pricing behaviors respond to environmental
conditions in the directions predicted by supply and demand shifts in Microeconomics. We also demonstrate
settings where the agents' emergent prices for goods vary over space, reflecting the local abundance
of goods. After the price disparities emerge, some agents then discover a niche of transporting
goods between regions with different prevailing prices -- a profitable strategy because they can
buy goods where they are cheap and sell them where they are expensive. Finally, in a series of ablation
experiments, we investigate how choices in the environmental rewards, bartering actions, agent
architecture, and ability to consume tradable goods can either aid or inhibit the emergence of this
economic behavior. This work is part of the environment development branch of a research program
that aims to build human-like artificial general intelligence through multi-agent interactions
in simulated societies. By exploring which environment features are needed for the basic phenomena
of elementary microeconomics to emerge automatically from learning, we arrive at an environment
that differs from those studied in prior multi-agent reinforcement learning work along several
dimensions. For example, the model incorporates heterogeneous tastes and physical abilities,
and agents negotiate with one another as a grounded form of communication.

Context: DevOps and microservices are acknowledged to be important new paradigms to tackle contemporary
software demands and provide capabilities for rapid and reliable software development. Industrial
reports show that they are quickly adopted together in massive software companies. However, because
of the technical and organizational requirements, many difficulties against efficient implementation
of the both emerge in real software teams. Objectives: This study aims to discover the organization,
benefits and issues of software teams using DevOps & microservices from an immersive perspective.
Method: An ethnographic study was carried out in three companies with different business, size,
products, customers, and degree of globalization. All the three companies claimed their adoption
of DevOps and microservices. Seven months (cumulative) of participant observations and nine interviews
with practitioners were conducted to collect the data of software teams related to DevOps and microservices.
A cross-company empirical investigation using grounded theory was done by analyzing the archive
data. Results: The adoption of DevOps and microservices brings benefits to rapid delivery, ability
improvements and burden reduction, whilst the high cost and lack of practical guidance were emerged.
Moreover, our observations and interviews reflect that in software teams, the relationship between
DevOps and microservices is not significant, which differs from the relationship described in
the previous studies. Four lessons for practitioners and four implications for researchers were
discussed based on our findings. Conclusion: Our findings contribute to the understanding of the
organization, benefits and issues of adopting DevOps and microservices from an immersive perspective
of software teams.

Machine Learning (ML) alleviates the challenges of high-dimensional data analysis and improves
decision making in critical applications like healthcare. Effective cancer type from high-dimensional
genetic mutation data can be useful for cancer diagnosis and treatment, if the distinguishable
patterns between cancer types are identified. At the same time, analysis of high-dimensional data
is computationally expensive and is often outsourced to cloud services. Privacy concerns in outsourced
ML, especially in the field of genetics, motivate the use of encrypted computation, like Homomorphic
Encryption (HE). But restrictive overheads of encrypted computation deter its usage. In this work,
we explore the challenges of privacy preserving cancer detection using a real-world dataset consisting
of more than 2 million genetic information for several cancer types. Since the data is inherently
high-dimensional, we explore smaller ML models for cancer prediction to enable fast inference
in the privacy preserving domain. We develop a solution for privacy preserving cancer inference
which first leverages the domain knowledge on somatic mutations to efficiently encode genetic
mutations and then uses statistical tests for feature selection. Our logistic regression model,
built using our novel encoding scheme, achieves 0.98 micro-average area under curve with 13% higher
test accuracy than similar studies. We exhaustively test our model's predictive capabilities
by analyzing the genes used by the model. Furthermore, we propose a fast matrix multiplication algorithm
that can efficiently handle high-dimensional data. Experimental results show that, even with
40,000 features, our proposed matrix multiplication algorithm can speed up concurrent inference
of multiple individuals by approximately 10x and inference of a single individual by approximately
550x, in comparison to standard matrix multiplication.

Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) underpin the concept of Mobility as a Service (MaaS),
which requires universal and seamless users' access across multiple public and private transportation
systems while allowing operators' proportional revenue sharing. Current user sensing technologies
such as Walk-in/Walk-out (WIWO) and Check-in/Check-out (CICO) have limited scalability for large-scale
deployments. These limitations prevent ITS from supporting analysis, optimization, calculation
of revenue sharing, and control of MaaS comfort, safety, and efficiency. We focus on the concept
of implicit Be-in/Be-out (BIBO) smartphone-sensing and classification. To close the gap and enhance
smartphones towards MaaS, we developed a proprietary smartphone-sensing platform collecting
contemporary Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signals from BLE devices installed on buses and Global
Positioning System (GPS) locations of both buses and smartphones. To enable the training of a model
based on GPS features against the BLE pseudo-label, we propose the Cause-Effect Multitask Wasserstein
Autoencoder (CEMWA). CEMWA combines and extends several frameworks around Wasserstein autoencoders
and neural networks. As a dimensionality reduction tool, CEMWA obtains an auto-validated representation
of a latent space describing users' smartphones within the transport system. This representation
allows BIBO clustering via DBSCAN. We perform an ablation study of CEMWA's alternative architectures
and benchmark against the best available supervised methods. We analyze performance's sensitivity
to label quality. Under the na\"ive assumption of accurate ground truth, XGBoost outperforms CEMWA.
Although XGBoost and Random Forest prove to be tolerant to label noise, CEMWA is agnostic to label
noise by design and provides the best performance with an 88\% F1 score.

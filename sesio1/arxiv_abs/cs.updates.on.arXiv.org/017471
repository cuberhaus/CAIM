The increasing amount of data and the growing complexity of problems has resulted in an ever-growing
reliance on cloud computing. However, many applications, most notably in healthcare, finance
or defense, demand security and privacy which today's solutions cannot fully address. Fully homomorphic
encryption (FHE) elevates the bar of today's solutions by adding confidentiality of data during
processing. It allows computation on fully encrypted data without the need for decryption, thus
fully preserving privacy. To enable processing encrypted data at usable levels of classic security,
e.g., 128-bit, the encryption procedure introduces noticeable data size expansion - the ciphertext
is much bigger than the native aggregate of native data types. In this paper, we present MemFHE which
is the first accelerator of both client and server for the latest Ring-GSW (Gentry, Sahai, and Waters)
based homomorphic encryption schemes using Processing In Memory (PIM). PIM alleviates the data
movement issues with large FHE encrypted data, while providing in-situ execution and extensive
parallelism needed for FHE's polynomial operations. While the client-PIM can homomorphically
encrypt and decrypt data, the server-PIM can process homomorphically encrypted data without decryption.
MemFHE's server-PIM is pipelined and is designed to provide flexible bootstrapping, allowing
two encryption techniques and various FHE security-levels based on the application requirements.
We evaluate MemFHE for various security-levels and compare it with state-of-the-art CPU implementations
for Ring-GSW based FHE. MemFHE is up to 20kx (265x) faster than CPU (GPU) for FHE arithmetic operations
and provides on average 2007x higher throughput than the state-of-the-art while implementing
neural networks with FHE.

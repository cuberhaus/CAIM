Automated monitoring of dark web (DW) platforms on a large scale is the first step toward developing
proactive Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI). While there are efficient methods for collecting data
from the surface web, large-scale dark web data collection is often hindered by anti-crawling measures.
In particular, text-based CAPTCHA serves as the most prevalent and prohibiting type of these measures
in the dark web. Text-based CAPTCHA identifies and blocks automated crawlers by forcing the user
to enter a combination of hard-to-recognize alphanumeric characters. In the dark web, CAPTCHA
images are meticulously designed with additional background noise and variable character length
to prevent automated CAPTCHA breaking. Existing automated CAPTCHA breaking methods have difficulties
in overcoming these dark web challenges. As such, solving dark web text-based CAPTCHA has been relying
heavily on human involvement, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this study, we propose
a novel framework for automated breaking of dark web CAPTCHA to facilitate dark web data collection.
This framework encompasses a novel generative method to recognize dark web text-based CAPTCHA
with noisy background and variable character length. To eliminate the need for human involvement,
the proposed framework utilizes Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to counteract dark web background
noise and leverages an enhanced character segmentation algorithm to handle CAPTCHA images with
variable character length. Our proposed framework, DW-GAN, was systematically evaluated on multiple
dark web CAPTCHA testbeds. DW-GAN significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art benchmark
methods on all datasets, achieving over 94.4% success rate on a carefully collected real-world
dark web dataset...

Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of image storage and transmission systems, in
which image compression plays an important role. Generally speaking, image compression algorithms
are developed to ensure good visual quality at limited bit rates. However, due to the different compression
optimization methods, the compressed images may have different levels of quality, which needs
to be evaluated quantificationally. Nowadays, the mainstream full-reference (FR) metrics are
effective to predict the quality of compressed images at coarse-grained levels (the bit rates differences
of compressed images are obvious), however, they may perform poorly for fine-grained compressed
images whose bit rates differences are quite subtle. Therefore, to better improve the Quality of
Experience (QoE) and provide useful guidance for compression algorithms, we propose a full-reference
image quality assessment (FR-IQA) method for compressed images of fine-grained levels. Specifically,
the reference images and compressed images are first converted to $YCbCr$ color space. The gradient
features are extracted from regions that are sensitive to compression artifacts. Then we employ
the Log-Gabor transformation to further analyze the texture difference. Finally, the obtained
features are fused into a quality score. The proposed method is validated on the fine-grained compression
image quality assessment (FGIQA) database, which is especially constructed for assessing the
quality of compressed images with close bit rates. The experimental results show that our metric
outperforms mainstream FR-IQA metrics on the FGIQA database. We also test our method on other commonly
used compression IQA databases and the results show that our method obtains competitive performance
on the coarse-grained compression IQA databases as well.

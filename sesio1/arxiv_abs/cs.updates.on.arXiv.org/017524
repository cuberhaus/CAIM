This study presents an autonomous orbit determination system based on crosslink radiometric measurements
applied to a future lunar CubeSat mission to clearly highlight its advantages with respect to existing
ground-based navigation strategies. This work is based on the Linked Autonomous Interplanetary
Satellite Orbit Navigation (LiAISON) method which provides an autonomous navigation solution
solely using satellite-to-satellite measurements, such as range and/or range-rate, to estimate
absolute spacecraft states when at least one of the involved spacecraft has an orbit with a unique
size, shape, and orientation. The lunar vicinity is a perfect candidate for this type of application
due to the asymmetrical gravity field: the selected lunar mission, an Earth-Moon L2 (EML2) Halo
orbiter, has an inter-satellite link between a lunar elliptical frozen orbiter. Simulation results
show that, even in case of high-measurement errors (in the order of 100 m, 1 sigma, the navigation
filter estimates the true states of spacecraft at EML2 with an error in the order of 500 m for position,
and 2 mm/s for velocity, respectively and the elliptical lunar frozen orbiter states can be estimated
in the order of 100 m for position and 1 cm/s for velocity, respectively. This study shows that range-only
measurements provide better state estimation than range-rate-only measurements for this specific
situation. Different bias handling strategies are also investigated. It has been found that even
a less accurate ranging method, such as data-aided ranging, provides a sufficient orbit determination
solution. This would simplify the communication system design for the selected CubeSat mission.
The most observable states are found to be position states of the lunar orbiter via the observability
analysis. In addition, the best tracking windows are also investigated for the selected mission
scenario.

In spite of extended recent interest in System Reliability-Based Design Optimization (System
RBDO) and life-cycle cost or Risk Optimization (RO), there is a lack of published studies on optimal
design of redundant hyperstatic systems with objective consideration of (a) progressive collapse
and (b) the impact of epistemic uncertainties. This paper investigates the fundamental aspects
of the problem, by addressing the optimal design of simple two-bar active and passive redundant
systems. Progressive collapse is objectively addressed, differentiating consequences of direct
collapse of statically determinate structures, and progressive collapse of redundant, statically
indeterminate structures. It is well known that reliability of a structural system also depends
on nonstructural factors, or factors beyond structural design, such as unanticipated loading,
manufacturing quality, quality of workmanship and human errors. These factors can be taken into
account in an encompassing risk analysis, which accounts for physical and epistemic uncertainties,
and which contributes a fixed latent failure probability to the structural optimization problem.
Results presented herein show that the latent failure probability is the single most important
parameter in determining optimal solutions, in System RBDO and in RO solutions. When the latent
failure probability is smaller than target (System RBDO) or optimal (RO) failure probabilities,
there is an equivalence between redundant and non-redundant (hyperstatic and isostatic) designs.
However, when the latent reliability is smaller than target or optimal reliabilities, optimal
designs become necessarily redundant (hyperstatic); as the only way to make system reliability
larger than the latent reliability is by making structural systems redundant.

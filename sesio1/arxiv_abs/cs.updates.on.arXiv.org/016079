We study the matching problem of regular tree languages, that is, "$\exists \sigma:\sigma(L)\subseteq
R$?" where $L,R$ are regular tree languages over the union of finite ranked alphabets $\Sigma$ and
$\mathcal{X}$ where $\mathcal{X}$ is an alphabet of variables and $\sigma$ is a substitution such
that $\sigma(x)$ is a set of trees in $T(\Sigma\cup H)\setminus H$ for all $x\in \mathcal{X}$. Here,
$H$ denotes a set of "holes" which are used to define a "sorted" concatenation of trees. Conway studied
this problem in the special case for languages of finite words in his classical textbook "Regular
algebra and finite machines" published in 1971. He showed that if $L$ and $R$ are regular, then the
problem "$\exists \sigma \forall x\in \mathcal{X}: \sigma(x)\neq \emptyset\wedge \sigma(L)\subseteq
R$?" is decidable. Moreover, there are only finitely many maximal solutions, the maximal solutions
are regular substitutions, and they are effectively computable. We extend Conway's results when
$L,R$ are regular languages of finite and infinite trees, and language substitution is applied
inside-out, in the sense of Engelfriet and Schmidt (1977/78). More precisely, we show that if $L\subseteq
T(\Sigma\cup\mathcal{X})$ and $R\subseteq T(\Sigma)$ are regular tree languages over finite
or infinite trees, then the problem "$\exists \sigma \forall x\in \mathcal{X}: \sigma(x)\neq
\emptyset\wedge \sigma_{\mathrm{io}}(L)\subseteq R$?" is decidable. Here, the subscript "$\mathrm{io}$"
in $\sigma_{\mathrm{io}}(L)$ refers to "inside-out". Moreover, there are only finitely many
maximal solutions $\sigma$, the maximal solutions are regular substitutions and effectively
computable. The corresponding question for the outside-in extension $\sigma_{\mathrm{oi}}$
remains open, even in the restricted setting of finite trees.

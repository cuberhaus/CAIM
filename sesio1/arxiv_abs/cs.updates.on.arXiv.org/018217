Given a bipartite graph $G$, the graphical matrix space $\mathcal{S}_G$ consists of matrices whose
non-zero entries can only be at those positions corresponding to edges in $G$. Tutte (J. London Math.
Soc., 1947), Edmonds (J. Res. Nat. Bur. Standards Sect. B, 1967) and Lov\'asz (FCT, 1979) observed
connections between perfect matchings in $G$ and full-rank matrices in $\mathcal{S}_G$. Dieudonn\'e
({Arch. Math., 1948) proved a tight upper bound on the dimensions of those matrix spaces containing
only singular matrices. The starting point of this paper is a simultaneous generalization of these
two classical results: we show that the largest dimension over subspaces of $\mathcal{S}_G$ containing
only singular matrices is equal to the maximum size over subgraphs of $G$ without perfect matchings,
based on Meshulam's proof of Dieudonn\'e's result (Quart. J. Math., 1985). Starting from this result,
we go on to establish more connections between properties of graphs and matrix spaces. For example,
we establish connections between acyclicity and nilpotency, between strong connectivity and
irreducibility, and between isomorphism and conjugacy/congruence. For each connection, we study
three types of correspondences, namely the basic correspondence, the inherited correspondence
(for subgraphs and subspaces), and the induced correspondence (for induced subgraphs and restrictions).
Some correspondences lead to intriguing generalizations of classical results, such as for Dieudonn\'e's
result mentioned above, and for a celebrated theorem of Gerstenhaber regarding the largest dimension
of nil matrix spaces (Amer. J. Math., 1958). Finally, we show some implications of our results to
quantum information and present open problems in computational complexity motivated by these
results.

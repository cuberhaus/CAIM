Over the past few years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved tremendous success and have been
continuously applied in many application domains. However, during the practical deployment in
the industrial tasks, DNNs are found to be erroneous-prone due to various reasons such as overfitting,
lacking robustness to real-world corruptions during practical usage. To address these challenges,
many recent attempts have been made to repair DNNs for version updates under practical operational
contexts by updating weights (i.e., network parameters) through retraining, fine-tuning, or
direct weight fixing at a neural level. In this work, as the first attempt, we initiate to repair DNNs
by jointly optimizing the architecture and weights at a higher (i.e., block) level. We first perform
empirical studies to investigate the limitation of whole network-level and layer-level repairing,
which motivates us to explore a novel repairing direction for DNN repair at the block level. To this
end, we first propose adversarial-aware spectrum analysis for vulnerable block localization
that considers the neurons' status and weights' gradients in blocks during the forward and backward
processes, which enables more accurate candidate block localization for repairing even under
a few examples. Then, we further propose the architecture-oriented search-based repairing that
relaxes the targeted block to a continuous repairing search space at higher deep feature levels.
By jointly optimizing the architecture and weights in that space, we can identify a much better block
architecture. We implement our proposed repairing techniques as a tool, named ArchRepair, and
conduct extensive experiments to validate the proposed method. The results show that our method
can not only repair but also enhance accuracy & robustness, outperforming the state-of-the-art
DNN repair techniques.

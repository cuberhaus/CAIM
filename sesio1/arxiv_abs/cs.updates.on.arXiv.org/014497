Visible light communication (VLC) technology was introduced as a key enabler for the next generation
of wireless networks, mainly thanks to its simple and low-cost implementation. However, several
challenges prohibit the realization of the full potentials of VLC, namely, limited modulation
bandwidth, ambient light interference, optical diffuse reflection effects, devices non-linearity,
and random receiver orientation. On the contrary, centralized machine learning (ML) techniques
have demonstrated a significant potential in handling different challenges relating to wireless
communication systems. Specifically, it was shown that ML algorithms exhibit superior capabilities
in handling complicated network tasks, such as channel equalization, estimation and modeling,
resources allocation, and opportunistic spectrum access control, to name a few. Nevertheless,
concerns pertaining to privacy and communication overhead when sharing raw data of the involved
clients with a server constitute major bottlenecks in the implementation of centralized ML techniques.
This has motivated the emergence of a new distributed ML paradigm, namely federated learning (FL),
which can reduce the cost associated with transferring raw data, and preserve privacy by training
ML models locally and collaboratively at the clients' side. Hence, it becomes evident that integrating
FL into VLC networks can provide ubiquitous and reliable implementation of VLC systems. With this
motivation, this is the first in-depth review in the literature on the application of FL in VLC networks.
To that end, besides the different architectures and related characteristics of FL, we provide
a thorough overview on the main design aspects of FL based VLC systems. Finally, we also highlight
some potential future research directions of FL that are envisioned to substantially enhance the
performance and robustness of VLC systems.

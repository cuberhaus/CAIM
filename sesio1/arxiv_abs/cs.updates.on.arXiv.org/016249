Computational analysis methods including machine learning have a significant impact in the fields
of genomics and medicine. High-throughput gene expression analysis methods such as microarray
technology and RNA sequencing produce enormous amounts of data. Traditionally, statistical methods
are used for comparative analysis of the gene expression data. However, more complex analysis for
classification and discovery of feature genes or sample observations requires sophisticated
computational approaches. In this review, we compile various statistical and computational tools
used in analysis of expression microarray data. Even though, the methods are discussed in the context
of expression microarray data, they can also be applied for the analysis of RNA sequencing or quantitative
proteomics datasets. We specifically discuss methods for missing value (gene expression) imputation,
feature gene scaling, selection and extraction of features for dimensionality reduction, and
learning and analysis of expression data. We discuss the types of missing values and the methods
and approaches usually employed in their imputation. We also discuss methods of data transformation
and feature scaling viz. normalization and standardization. Various approaches used in feature
selection and extraction are also reviewed. Lastly, learning and analysis methods including class
comparison, class prediction, and class discovery along with their evaluation parameters are
described in detail. We have described the process of generation of a microarray gene expression
data along with advantages and limitations of the above-mentioned techniques. We believe that
this detailed review will help the users to select appropriate methods based on the type of data and
the expected outcome.

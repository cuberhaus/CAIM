In 2021, Influencer Marketing generated more than $13 billion. Companies and major brands advertise
their products on Social Media, especially Instagram, through Influencers, i.e., people with
high popularity and the ability to influence the mass. Usually, more popular and visible influencers
are paid more for their collaborations. As a result, many services were born to boost profiles' popularity,
engagement, or visibility, mainly through bots or fake accounts. Researchers have focused on recognizing
such unnatural activities in different social networks with high success. However, real people
recently started participating in such boosting activities using their real accounts for monetary
rewards, generating ungenuine content that is very difficult to detect. Currently, on Instagram,
no works have tried to detect this new phenomenon, known as crowdturfing (CT). In this work, we are
the first to propose a CT engagement detector on Instagram. Our algorithm leverages profiles' characteristics
through semi-supervised learning to spot accounts involved in CT activities. In contrast to the
supervised methods employed so far to detect fake accounts, a semi-supervised approach takes advantage
of the vast quantities of unlabeled data on social media to yield better results. We purchased and
studied 1293 CT profiles from 11 providers to build our self-training classifier, which reached
95% accuracy. Finally, we ran our model in the wild to detect and analyze the CT engagement of 20 mega-influencers
(i.e., with more than one million followers), discovering that more than 20% of their engagement
was artificial. We analyzed the profiles and comments of people involved in CT engagement, showing
how difficult it is to spot these activities using only the generated content.

Efficient contact tracing and isolation is an effective strategy to control epidemics. It was used
effectively during the Ebola epidemic and successfully implemented in several parts of the world
during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. An important consideration while implementing manual contact
tracing is the number of contact tracers available -- the number of such individuals is limited for
socioeconomic reasons. In this paper, we present a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework to formulate
the problem of efficient contact tracing that reduces the size of the outbreak while using a limited
number of contact tracers. We formulate each step of the MDP as a combinatorial problem, MinExposed.
We demonstrate that MinExposed is NP-Hard, so we develop an LP-based approximation algorithm.
Though this algorithm directly solves MinExposed, it is often impractical in the real world due
to information constraints. To this end, we develop a greedy approach based on insights from the
analysis of the previous algorithm, which we show is more interpretable. A key feature of the greedy
algorithm is that it does not need complete information of the underlying social contact network.
This makes the heuristic implementable in practice and is an important consideration. Finally,
we carry out experiments on simulations of the MDP run on real-world networks, and show how the algorithms
can help in bending the epidemic curve while limiting the number of isolated individuals. Our experimental
results demonstrate that the greedy algorithm and its variants are especially effective, robust,
and practical in a variety of realistic scenarios, such as when the contact graph and specific transmission
probabilities are not known. All code can be found in our GitHub repository: https://github.com/gzli929/ContactTracing.

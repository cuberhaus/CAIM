Cryo-Electron Tomography (cryo-ET) is a 3D imaging technology that enables the visualization
of subcellular structures in situ at near-atomic resolution. Cellular cryo-ET images help in resolving
the structures of macromolecules and determining their spatial relationship in a single cell,
which has broad significance in cell and structural biology. Subtomogram classification and recognition
constitute a primary step in the systematic recovery of these macromolecular structures. Supervised
deep learning methods have been proven to be highly accurate and efficient for subtomogram classification,
but suffer from limited applicability due to scarcity of annotated data. While generating simulated
data for training supervised models is a potential solution, a sizeable difference in the image
intensity distribution in generated data as compared to real experimental data will cause the trained
models to perform poorly in predicting classes on real subtomograms. In this work, we present Cryo-Shift,
a fully unsupervised domain adaptation and randomization framework for deep learning-based cross-domain
subtomogram classification. We use unsupervised multi-adversarial domain adaption to reduce
the domain shift between features of simulated and experimental data. We develop a network-driven
domain randomization procedure with `warp' modules to alter the simulated data and help the classifier
generalize better on experimental data. We do not use any labeled experimental data to train our
model, whereas some of the existing alternative approaches require labeled experimental samples
for cross-domain classification. Nevertheless, Cryo-Shift outperforms the existing alternative
approaches in cross-domain subtomogram classification in extensive evaluation studies demonstrated
herein using both simulated and experimental data.

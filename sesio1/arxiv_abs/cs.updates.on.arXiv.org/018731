Recently, automatically extracting information from visually rich documents (e.g., tickets
and resumes) has become a hot and vital research topic due to its widespread commercial value. Most
existing methods divide this task into two subparts: the text reading part for obtaining the plain
text from the original document images and the information extraction part for extracting key contents.
These methods mainly focus on improving the second, while neglecting that the two parts are highly
correlated. This paper proposes a unified end-to-end information extraction framework from visually
rich documents, where text reading and information extraction can reinforce each other via a well-designed
multi-modal context block. Specifically, the text reading part provides multi-modal features
like visual, textual and layout features. The multi-modal context block is developed to fuse the
generated multi-modal features and even the prior knowledge from the pre-trained language model
for better semantic representation. The information extraction part is responsible for generating
key contents with the fused context features. The framework can be trained in an end-to-end trainable
manner, achieving global optimization. What is more, we define and group visually rich documents
into four categories across two dimensions, the layout and text type. For each document category,
we provide or recommend the corresponding benchmarks, experimental settings and strong baselines
for remedying the problem that this research area lacks the uniform evaluation standard. Extensive
experiments on four kinds of benchmarks (from fixed layout to variable layout, from full-structured
text to semi-unstructured text) are reported, demonstrating the proposed method's effectiveness.

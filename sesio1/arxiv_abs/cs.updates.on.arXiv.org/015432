Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attack usually refers to the form of long-term, covert and sustained
attack on specific targets, with an adversary using advanced attack techniques to destroy the key
facilities of an organization. APT attacks have caused serious security threats and massive financial
loss worldwide. Academics and industry thereby have proposed a series of solutions to detect APT
attacks, such as dynamic/static code analysis, traffic detection, sandbox technology, endpoint
detection and response (EDR), etc. However, existing defenses are failed to accurately and effectively
defend against the current APT attacks that exhibit strong persistent, stealthy, diverse and dynamic
characteristics due to the weak data source integrity, large data processing overhead and poor
real-time performance in the process of real-world scenarios. To overcome these difficulties,
in this paper we propose \sn{}, a stable, efficient and real-time APT detection system for Linux
hosts. In the aspect of data collection, audit is selected to stably collect kernel data of the operating
system so as to carry out a complete portrait of the attack based on comprehensive analysis and comparison
of existing logging tools; In the aspect of data processing, redundant semantics skipping and non-viable
node pruning are adopted to reduce the amount of data, so as to reduce the overhead of the detection
system; In the aspect of attack detection, an APT attack detection framework based on ATT\&CK model
is designed to carry out real-time attack response and alarm through the transfer and aggregation
of labels. Experimental results on both laboratory and Darpa Engagement show that our system can
effectively detect web vulnerability attacks, file-less attacks and remote access trojan attacks,
and has a low false positive rate, which adds far more value than the existing frontier work.

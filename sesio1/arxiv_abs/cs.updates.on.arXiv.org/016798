In the whole aircraft structural optimization loop, thermal analysis plays a very important role.
But it faces a severe computational burden when directly applying traditional numerical analysis
tools, especially when each optimization involves repetitive parameter modification and thermal
analysis followed. Recently, with the fast development of deep learning, several Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) surrogate models have been introduced to overcome this obstacle. However,
for temperature field prediction on irregular geometric domains (TFP-IGD), CNN can hardly be competent
since most of them stem from processing for regular images. To alleviate this difficulty, we propose
a novel physics and data co-driven surrogate modeling method. First, after adapting the Bezier
curve in geometric parameterization, a body-fitted coordinate mapping is introduced to generate
coordinate transforms between the irregular physical plane and regular computational plane.
Second, a physics-driven CNN surrogate with partial differential equation (PDE) residuals as
a loss function is utilized for fast meshing (meshing surrogate); then, we present a data-driven
surrogate model based on the multi-level reduced-order method, aiming to learn solutions of temperature
field in the above regular computational plane (thermal surrogate). Finally, combining the grid
position information provided by the meshing surrogate with the scalar temperature field information
provided by the thermal surrogate (combined model), we reach an end-to-end surrogate model from
geometric parameters to temperature field prediction on an irregular geometric domain. Numerical
results demonstrate that our method can significantly improve accuracy prediction on a smaller
dataset while reducing the training time when compared with other CNN methods.

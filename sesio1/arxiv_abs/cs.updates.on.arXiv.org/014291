The introduction of major innovations in industry requires a collaboration across the whole value
chain. A common way to organize such a collaboration is the use of technology roadmaps, which act
as an industry-wide long-term planning tool. Technology roadmaps are used to identify industry
needs, estimate the availability of technological solutions, and identify the need for innovation
in the future. Roadmaps are inherently both time-dependent and based on uncertain values, i.e.,
properties and structural components can change over time. Furthermore, roadmaps have to reason
about alternative solutions as well as their key performance indicators. Current approaches for
model-based engineering do not inherently support these aspects. We present a novel model-based
approach treating those aspects as first-class citizens. To address the problem of missing support
for time in the context of roadmap modeling, we introduce the concepts of a common global time, time-dependent
properties, and time-dependent availability. This includes requirements, properties, and the
structure of the model or its components as well. Furthermore, we support the specification and
analysis of key performance indicators for alternative solutions. These concepts result in a continuous
range of various valid models over time instead of a single valid model at a certain point of time.
We present a graphical user interface to enable the user to efficiently create and analyze those
models. We further show the semantics of the resulting model by a translation into a set of global
constraints as well as how we solve the resulting constraint system. We report on the evaluation
of these concepts and the Iris tool with domain experts from different companies in the automotive
value chain based on the industrial case of a smart sensing electrical fuse.

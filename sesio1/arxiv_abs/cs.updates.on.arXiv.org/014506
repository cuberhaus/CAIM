During the Coronavirus 2019 (the covid-19) pandemic, schools continuously strive to provide consistent
education to their students. Teachers and education policymakers are seeking ways to re-open schools,
as it is necessary for community and economic development. However, in light of the pandemic, schools
require customized schedules that can address the health concerns and safety of the students considering
classroom sizes, air conditioning equipment, classroom systems, e.g., self-contained or compartmentalized.
To solve this issue, we developed the School-Virus-Infection-Simulator (SVIS) for teachers and
education policymakers. SVIS simulates the spread of infection at a school considering the students'
lesson schedules, classroom volume, air circulation rates in classrooms, and infectability of
the students. Thus, teachers and education policymakers can simulate how their school schedules
can impact current health concerns. We then demonstrate the impact of several school schedules
in self-contained and departmentalized classrooms and evaluate them in terms of the maximum number
of students infected simultaneously and the percentage of face-to-face lessons. The results show
that increasing classroom ventilation rate is effective, however, the impact is not stable compared
to customizing school schedules, in addition, school schedules can differently impact the maximum
number of students infected depending on whether classrooms are self-contained or compartmentalized.
It was found that one of school schedules had a higher maximum number of students infected, compared
to schedules with a higher percentage of face-to-face lessons. SVIS and the simulation results
can help teachers and education policymakers plan school schedules appropriately in order to reduce
the maximum number of students infected, while also maintaining a certain percentage of face-to-face
lessons.

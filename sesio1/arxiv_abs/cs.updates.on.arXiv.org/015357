We present an accelerated and hardware parallelized integral-equation solver for the problem
of acoustic scattering by a two-dimensional surface in three-dimensional space. The approach
is based, in part, on the novel Interpolated Factored Green Function acceleration method (IFGF)
that, without recourse to the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), evaluates the action of Green function-based
integral operators for an $N$-point surface discretization at a complexity of $\Ord(N\log N)$
operations instead of the $\Ord(N^2)$ cost associated with nonaccelerated methods. The IFGF algorithm
exploits the slow variations of factored Green functions to enable the fast evaluation of fields
generated by groups of sources on the basis of a recursive interpolation scheme. In the proposed
approach, the IFGF method is used to account for the vast majority of the computations, while, for
the relatively few singular, nearly-singular and neighboring non-singular integral operator
evaluations, a high-order rectangular-polar quadrature approach is employed instead. Since
the overall approach does not rely on the FFT, it is amenable to efficient shared- and distributed-memory
parallelization; this paper demonstrates such a capability by means of an OpenMP parallel implementation
of the method. A variety of numerical examples presented in this paper demonstrate that the proposed
methods enable the efficient solution of large problems over complex geometries on small parallel
hardware infrastructures. Numerical examples include acoustic scattering by a sphere of up to
$128$ wavelengths, an $80$-wavelength submarine, and a turbofan nacelle that is more than $80$
wavelengths in size, requiring, on a 28-core computer, computing times of the order of a few minutes
per iteration and a few tens of iterations of the GMRES iterative solver.

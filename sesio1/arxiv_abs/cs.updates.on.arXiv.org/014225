Convergence bidding, a.k.a., virtual bidding, has been widely adopted in wholesale electricity
markets in recent years. It provides opportunities for market participants to arbitrage on the
difference between the day-ahead market locational marginal prices and the real-time market locational
marginal prices. Given the fact that convergence bids (CBs) have a significant impact on the operation
of electricity markets, it is important to understand how market participants strategically select
their CBs in real-world. We address this open problem with focus on the electricity market that is
operated by the California ISO. In this regard, we use the publicly available electricity market
data to learn, characterize, and evaluate different types of convergence bidding strategies that
are currently used by market participants. Our analysis includes developing a data-driven reverse
engineering method that we apply to three years of real-world data. Our analysis involves feature
selection and density-based data clustering. It results in identifying three main clusters of
CB strategies in the California ISO market. Different characteristics and the performance of each
cluster of strategies are analyzed. Interestingly, we unmask a common real-world strategy that
does not match any of the existing strategic convergence bidding methods in the literature. Next,
we build upon the lessons learned from the existing real-world strategies to propose a new CB strategy
that can significantly outperform them. Our analysis includes developing a new strategy for convergence
bidding. The new strategy has three steps: net profit maximization by capturing price spikes, dynamic
node labeling, and strategy selection algorithm. We show through case studies that the annual net
profit for the most lucrative market participants can increase by over 40% if the proposed convergence
bidding strategy is used.

Wide-scale electrification of the transportation sector will require careful planning and coordination
with the power grid. Left unmanaged, uncoordinated charging of electric vehicles (EVs) at increased
levels of penetration will amplify existing peak loads, potentially outstripping the grid's capacity
to reliably meet demand. In this paper, we report findings from the OptimizEV Project - a real-world
pilot study in Upstate New York exploring a novel approach to coordinated residential EV charging.
The proposed coordination mechanism seeks to harness the latent flexibility in EV charging by offering
EV owners monetary incentives to delay the time required to charge their EVs. Each time an EV owner
initiates a charging session, they specify how long they intend to leave their vehicle plugged in
by selecting from a menu of deadlines that offers lower electricity prices the longer they're willing
to delay the time required to charge their EV. Given a collection of active charging requests, a smart
charging system dynamically optimizes the power being drawn by each EV in real time to minimize strain
on the grid, while ensuring that each customer's car is fully charged by its deadline. Under the proposed
incentive mechanism, we find that customers are frequently willing to engage in optimized charging
sessions, allowing the system to delay the completion of their charging requests by more than eight
hours on average. Using the flexibility provided by customers, the smart charging system was shown
to be highly effective in shifting the majority of EV charging loads off-peak to fill the night-time
valley of the aggregate load curve. Customer opt-in rates remained stable over the span of the study,
providing empirical evidence in support of the proposed coordination mechanism as a potentially
viable "non-wires alternative" to meet the increased demand for electricity driven growing EV
adoption.

In 2015, the United Nations adopted 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with 169 targets for
transformation toward a more sustainable future by 2030. This study seeks to evaluate and analyze
SDG target interactions in the Philippines to resolve conflicting targets, and prioritize targets
that reinforce others and have no conflicts. To evaluate all 14196 target interactions, two methods
are employed. First, experts with over five years of SDG-related experience evaluated interactions
using a 7-point scale. Second, a non-parametric Spearman rank correlation is used on official indicator
data with resulting coefficients serving as interaction scores. Interaction scores are then coded
as synergies (interact positively), trade-offs (negatively) or non-classified (neutrally).
Targets are also modelled as nodes and interactions as edges in graphs presented in sdginteractions.herokuapp.com.
Results from the two methods were synthesized to formulate recommendations for concerned parties.
This includes resolving negative intra-goal target interactions involving targets 3.1 'Reduce
maternal mortality', 3.6 'Reduce road injuries and deaths', and 3.7 'Universal access to sexual
and reproductive care, family planning, and education'. Ugly targets (at least one negative interaction)
including target 3.6, 3.7, and 8.2 'Diversify, innovate, and upgrade for economic productivity'
need to be resolved. Targets that reinforce their corresponding SDGs should be prioritized, including
1.1 'Eradicate extreme poverty', 4.2 'Equal access to quality pre-primary education', 6.2 'End
open defecation and provide access to sanitation and hygiene', 8.1 'Sustainable economic growth',
and 9.4 'Upgrade all industries and infrastructures for sustainability'. Beautiful targets (no
negative interactions) should also be prioritized, including target 8.5 and 17.5 'Invest in least
developed countries'.

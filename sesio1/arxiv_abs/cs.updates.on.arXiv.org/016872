Composite visualization is a popular design strategy that represents complex datasets by integrating
multiple visualizations in a meaningful and aesthetic layout, such as juxtaposition, overlay,
and nesting. With this strategy, numerous novel designs have been proposed in visualization publications
to accomplish various visual analytic tasks. These well-crafted composite visualizations have
formed a valuable collection for designers and researchers to address real-world problems and
inspire new research topics and designs. However, there is a lack of understanding of design patterns
of composite visualization, thus failing to provide holistic design space and concrete examples
for practical use. In this paper, we opted to revisit the composite visualizations in VIS publications
and answered what and how visualizations of different types are composed together. To achieve this,
we first constructed a corpus of composite visualizations from IEEE VIS publications and decomposed
them into a series of basic visualization types (e.g., bar chart, map, and matrix). With this corpus,
we studied the spatial (e.g., separated or overlaying) and semantic relationships (e.g., with
same types or shared axis) between visualizations and proposed a taxonomy consisting of eight different
design patterns (e.g., repeated, stacked, accompanied, and nested). Furthermore, we analyzed
and discussed common practices of composite visualizations, such as the distribution of different
patterns and correlations between visualization types. From the analysis and examples, we obtained
insights into different design patterns on the utilities, advantages, and disadvantages. Finally,
we developed an interactive system to help visualization developers and researchers conveniently
explore collected examples and design patterns.

Many activities related to cybercrime operations do not require much secrecy, such as developing
websites or translating texts. This research provides indications that many users of a popular
public internet marketing forum have connections to cybercrime. It does so by investigating the
involvement in cybercrime of a population of users interested in internet marketing, both at a micro
and macro scale. The research starts with a case study of three users confirmed to be involved in cybercrime
and their use of the public forum where users share information about online advertising. It provides
a first glimpse that some business with cybercrime connection is being conducted in the clear. The
study then pans out to investigate the forum population's ties with cybercrime by finding crossover
users, who are users from the public forum who also comment on cybercrime forums. The cybercrime
forums on which they discuss are analyzed and crossover users' strength of participation is reported.
Also, to assess if they represent a sub-group of the forum population, their posting behavior on
the public forum is compared with that of non-crossover users. This blend of analyses shows that
(i) a minimum of 7.2% of the public forum population are crossover users that have ties with cybercrime
forums; (ii) their participation in cybercrime forums is limited; and (iii) their posting behavior
is relatively indistinguishable from that of non-crossover users. This is the first study to formally
quantify how users of an internet marketing public forum, a space for informal exchanges, have ties
to cybercrime activities. We conclude that crossover users are a substantial part of the population
in the public forum, and, even though they have thus far been overlooked, their aggregated effect
in the ecosystem must be considered.

In arXiv:2107.05714 the concept of the Voronoi diagram was investigated closely from a theoretical
point of view. Then, a physics-driven kinematical method was introduced to produce an improved
model for dominance space in soccer. Remaining faithful to the deterministic approach, we extend
the original work by the introduction of (a) an asymmetric influence of the players in their surrounding
area, (b) the frictional forces to the players' motion, and (c) the simultaneous combination of
both effects. The asymmetric influence is fairly intuitive; players have more control in the direction
they are running than any other direction. The sharper the turn they must make to reach a point on the
pitch, the weaker their control of that point will be. From simple kinematical laws, this effect
can be quantified explicitly. For the frictional force, a portion comes from air resistance, and
so will be proportional to the square of the player's speed, as is well known from fluid dynamics.
There are no other external frictional forces, but, at the suggestion of biokinematics, there is
an internal frictional force, relating to the consumption of energy by the muscles, which is proportional
to the player's speed. Although these additions are intuitively understood, mathematically they
introduce many analytical complexities. We establish exact analytical solutions of the dominance
areas of the pitch by introducing a few reasonable simplifying assumptions. Given these solutions
the new Voronoi diagrams are drawn for the publicly available data by Metrica Sports. In general,
it is not necessary anymore for the dominance regions to be convex, they might contain holes, and
may be disconnected. The fastest player may dominate points far away from the rest of the players.

Recent advances have shown that SNN-based systems can efficiently perform unsupervised continual
learning due to their bio-plausible learning rule, e.g., Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity
(STDP). Such learning capabilities are especially beneficial for use cases like autonomous agents
(e.g., robots and UAVs) that need to continuously adapt to dynamically changing scenarios/environments,
where new data gathered directly from the environment may have novel features that should be learned
online. Current state-of-the-art works employ high-precision weights (i.e., 32 bit) for both
training and inference phases, which pose high memory and energy costs thereby hindering efficient
embedded implementations of such systems for battery-driven mobile autonomous systems. On the
other hand, precision reduction may jeopardize the quality of unsupervised continual learning
due to information loss. Towards this, we propose lpSpikeCon, a novel methodology to enable low-precision
SNN processing for efficient unsupervised continual learning on resource-constrained autonomous
agents/systems. Our lpSpikeCon methodology employs the following key steps: (1) analyzing the
impacts of training the SNN model under unsupervised continual learning settings with reduced
weight precision on the inference accuracy; (2) leveraging this study to identify SNN parameters
that have a significant impact on the inference accuracy; and (3) developing an algorithm for searching
the respective SNN parameter values that improve the quality of unsupervised continual learning.
The experimental results show that our lpSpikeCon can reduce weight memory of the SNN model by 8x
(i.e., by judiciously employing 4-bit weights) for performing online training with unsupervised
continual learning and achieve no accuracy loss in the inference phase, as compared to the baseline
model with 32-bit weights across different network sizes.

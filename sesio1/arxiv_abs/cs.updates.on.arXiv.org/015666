Artificial Intelligence & Nanotechnology are promising areas for the future of humanity. While
Deep Learning based Computer Vision has found applications in many fields from medicine to automotive,
its application in nanotechnology can open doors for new scientific discoveries. Can we apply AI
to explore objects that our eyes can't see such as nano scale sized objects? An AI platform to visualize
nanoscale patterns learnt by a Deep Learning neural network can open new frontiers for nanotechnology.
The objective of this paper is to develop a Deep Learning based visualization system on images of
nanomaterials obtained by scanning electron microscope. This paper contributes an AI platform
to enable any nanoscience researcher to use AI in visual exploration of nanoscale morphologies
of nanomaterials. This AI is developed by a technique of visualizing intermediate activations
of a Convolutional AutoEncoder. In this method, a nano scale specimen image is transformed into
its feature representations by a Convolution Neural Network. The Convolutional AutoEncoder is
trained on 100% SEM dataset, and then CNN visualization is applied. This AI generates various conceptual
feature representations of the nanomaterial. While Deep Learning based image classification
of SEM images are widely published in literature, there are not much publications that have visualized
Deep neural networks of nanomaterials. There is a significant opportunity to gain insights from
the learnings extracted by machine learning. This paper unlocks the potential of applying Deep
Learning based Visualization on electron microscopy to offer AI extracted features and architectural
patterns of various nanomaterials. This is a contribution in Explainable AI in nano scale objects.

Prediction of Overall Survival (OS) of brain cancer patients from multi-modal MRI is a challenging
field of research. Most of the existing literature on survival prediction is based on Radiomic features,
which does not consider either non-biological factors or the functional neurological status of
the patient(s). Besides, the selection of an appropriate cut-off for survival and the presence
of censored data create further problems. Application of deep learning models for OS prediction
is also limited due to the lack of large annotated publicly available datasets. In this scenario
we analyse the potential of two novel neuroimaging feature families, extracted from brain parcellation
atlases and spatial habitats, along with classical radiomic and geometric features; to study their
combined predictive power for analysing overall survival. A cross validation strategy with grid
search is proposed to simultaneously select and evaluate the most predictive feature subset based
on its predictive power. A Cox Proportional Hazard (CoxPH) model is employed for univariate feature
selection, followed by the prediction of patient-specific survival functions by three multivariate
parsimonious models viz. Coxnet, Random survival forests (RSF) and Survival SVM (SSVM). The brain
cancer MRI data used for this research was taken from two open-access collections TCGA-GBM and TCGA-LGG
available from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). Corresponding survival data for each patient
was downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). A high cross validation $C-index$ score of $0.82\pm.10$
was achieved using RSF with the best $24$ selected features. Age was found to be the most important
biological predictor. There were $9$, $6$, $6$ and $2$ features selected from the parcellation,
habitat, radiomic and region-based feature groups respectively.

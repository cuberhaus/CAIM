Patient-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) that contains a complex biological cargo is a valuable
source of liquid biopsy diagnostics to aid in early detection, cancer screening, and precision
nanotherapeutics. In this study, we predicted that coupling cancer patient blood-derived EVs
to time-resolved spectroscopy and artificial intelligence (AI) could provide a robust cancer
screening and follow-up tools. Methods: Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) measurements
were performed on 24 blood samples-derived EVs. Blood samples were obtained from 15 cancer patients
(presenting 5 different types of cancers), and 9 healthy controls (including patients with benign
lesions). The obtained FCS autocorrelation spectra were processed into power spectra using the
Fast-Fourier Transform algorithm and subjected to various machine learning algorithms to distinguish
cancer spectra from healthy control spectra. Results and Applications: The performance of AdaBoost
Random Forest (RF) classifier, support vector machine, and multilayer perceptron, were tested
on selected frequencies in the N=118 power spectra. The RF classifier exhibited a 90% classification
accuracy and high sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing the FCS power spectra of cancer
patients from those of healthy controls. Further, an image convolutional neural network (CNN),
ResNet network, and a quantum CNN were assessed on the power spectral images as additional validation
tools. All image-based CNNs exhibited a nearly equal classification performance with an accuracy
of roughly 82% and reasonably high sensitivity and specificity scores. Our pilot study demonstrates
that AI-algorithms coupled to time-resolved FCS power spectra can accurately and differentially
classify the complex patient-derived EVs from different cancer samples of distinct tissue subtypes.

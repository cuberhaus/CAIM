The huge amount of data generated by the Internet of things (IoT) devices needs the computational
power and storage capacity provided by cloud, edge, and fog computing paradigms. Each of these computing
paradigms has its own pros and cons. Cloud computing provides enhanced data storage and computing
power but causes high communication latency. Edge and fog computing provide similar services with
lower latency but with limited capacity, capability, and coverage. A single computing paradigm
cannot fulfil all the requirements of IoT devices and a federation between them is needed to extend
their capacity, capability, and services. This federation is beneficial to both subscribers and
providers and also reveals research issues in traffic offloading between clouds, edges, and fogs.
Optimization has traditionally been used to solve the problem of traffic offloading. However,
in such a complex federated system, traditional optimization cannot keep up with the strict latency
requirements of decision making, ranging from milliseconds to sub-seconds. Machine learning
approaches, especially reinforcement learning, are consequently becoming popular because they
can quickly solve offloading problems in dynamic environments with large amounts of unknown information.
This study provides a novel federal classification between cloud, edge, and fog and presents a comprehensive
research roadmap on offloading for different federated scenarios. We survey the relevant literature
on the various optimization approaches used to solve this offloading problem, and compare their
salient features. We then provide a comprehensive survey on offloading in federated systems with
machine learning approaches and the lessons learned as a result of these surveys. Finally, we outline
several directions for future research and challenges that have to be faced in order to achieve such
a federation.

In this work we study orbit recovery over $SO(3)$, where the goal is to recover a function on the sphere
from noisy, randomly rotated copies of it. We assume that the function is a linear combination of
low-degree spherical harmonics. This is a natural abstraction for the problem of recovering the
three-dimensional structure of a molecule through cryo-electron tomography. For provably learning
the parameters of a generative model, the method of moments is the standard workhorse of theoretical
machine learning. It turns out that there is a natural incarnation of the method of moments for orbit
recovery based on invariant theory. Bandeira et al. [BBSK+18] used invariant theory to give tight
bounds on the sample complexity in terms of the noise level. However many of the key challenges remain:
Can we prove bounds on the sample complexity that are polynomial in $n$, the dimension of the signal?
The bounds in [BBSK+18] hide constants that have an unspecified dependence on $n$ and only hold in
the limit as $\sigma^2 \rightarrow \infty$ where $\sigma^2$ is the variance of the noise. Moreover
can we give efficient algorithms? We revisit these challenges from the perspective of smoothed
analysis, where we assume that the coefficients of the signal, in the basis of spherical harmonics,
are subject to small random perturbations. Our main result is a quasi-polynomial time algorithm
for orbit recovery over $SO(3)$ in this model. Our approach is based on frequency marching, which
sequentially solves linear systems to find higher degree coefficients. Our main technical contribution
is to show that these linear systems have unique solutions, are well-conditioned, and that the error
can be made to compound over at most a logarithmic number of rounds. We believe that our work takes
an important first step towards uncovering the algorithmic implications of invariant theory.

In this paper we develop FaceQgen, a No-Reference Quality Assessment approach for face images based
on a Generative Adversarial Network that generates a scalar quality measure related with the face
recognition accuracy. FaceQgen does not require labelled quality measures for training. It is
trained from scratch using the SCface database. FaceQgen applies image restoration to a face image
of unknown quality, transforming it into a canonical high quality image, i.e., frontal pose, homogeneous
background, etc. The quality estimation is built as the similarity between the original and the
restored images, since low quality images experience bigger changes due to restoration. We compare
three different numerical quality measures: a) the MSE between the original and the restored images,
b) their SSIM, and c) the output score of the Discriminator of the GAN. The results demonstrate that
FaceQgen's quality measures are good estimators of face recognition accuracy. Our experiments
include a comparison with other quality assessment methods designed for faces and for general images,
in order to position FaceQgen in the state of the art. This comparison shows that, even though FaceQgen
does not surpass the best existing face quality assessment methods in terms of face recognition
accuracy prediction, it achieves good enough results to demonstrate the potential of semi-supervised
learning approaches for quality estimation (in particular, data-driven learning based on a single
high quality image per subject), having the capacity to improve its performance in the future with
adequate refinement of the model and the significant advantage over competing methods of not needing
quality labels for its development. This makes FaceQgen flexible and scalable without expensive
data curation.

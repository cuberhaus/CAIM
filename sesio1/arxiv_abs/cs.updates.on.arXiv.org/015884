The importance of workflows is highlighted by the fact that they have underpinned some of the most
significant discoveries of the past decades. Many of these workflows have significant computational,
storage, and communication demands, and thus must execute on a range of large-scale computer systems,
from local clusters to public clouds and upcoming exascale HPC platforms. Historically, infrastructures
for workflow execution consisted of complex, integrated systems, developed in-house by workflow
practitioners with strong dependencies on a range of legacy technologies. Due to the increasing
need to support workflows, dedicated workflow systems were developed to provide abstractions
for creating, executing, and adapting workflows conveniently and efficiently while ensuring
portability. While these efforts are all worthwhile individually, there are now hundreds of independent
workflow systems. The resulting workflow system technology landscape is fragmented, which may
present significant barriers for future workflow users due to many seemingly comparable, yet usually
mutually incompatible, systems that exist. In order to tackle some of these challenges, the DOE-funded
ExaWorks and NSF-funded WorkflowsRI projects have organized in 2021 a series of events entitled
the "Workflows Community Summit". The third edition of the ``Workflows Community Summit" explored
workflows challenges and opportunities from the perspective of computing centers and facilities.
The third summit brought together a small group of facilities representatives with the aim to understand
how workflows are currently being used at each facility, how facilities would like to interact with
workflow developers and users, how workflows fit with facility roadmaps, and what opportunities
there are for tighter integration between facilities and workflows. More information at: https://workflowsri.org/summits/facilities/

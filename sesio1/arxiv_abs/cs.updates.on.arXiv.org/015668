Despite the fact that architectural administration information in Korea has been providing high-quality
information for a long period of time, the level of utility of the information is not high because
it focuses on administrative information. While this is the case, a three-dimensional (3D) map
with higher resolution has emerged along with the technological development. However, it cannot
function better than visual transmission, as it includes only image information focusing on the
exterior of the building. If information related to the exterior of the building can be extracted
or identified from a 3D map, it is expected that the utility of the information will be more valuable
as the national architectural administration information can then potentially be extended to
include such information regarding the building exteriors to the level of BIM(Building Information
Modeling). This study aims to present and assess a basic method of extracting information related
to the appearance of the exterior of a building for the purpose of 3D mapping using deep learning and
digital image processing. After extracting and preprocessing images from the map, information
was identified using the Fast R-CNN(Regions with Convolutional Neuron Networks) model. The information
was identified using the Faster R-CNN model after extracting and preprocessing images from the
map. As a result, it showed approximately 93% and 91% accuracy in terms of detecting the elevation
and window parts of the building, respectively, as well as excellent performance in an experiment
aimed at extracting the elevation information of the building. Nonetheless, it is expected that
improved results will be obtained by supplementing the probability of mixing the false detection
rate or noise data caused by the misunderstanding of experimenters in relation to the unclear boundaries
of windows.

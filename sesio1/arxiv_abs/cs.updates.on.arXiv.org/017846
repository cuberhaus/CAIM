Directed evolution is a versatile technique in protein engineering that mimics the process of natural
selection by iteratively alternating between mutagenesis and screening in order to search for
sequences that optimize a given property of interest, such as catalytic activity and binding affinity
to a specified target. However, the space of possible proteins is too large to search exhaustively
in the laboratory, and functional proteins are scarce in the vast sequence space. Machine learning
(ML) approaches can accelerate directed evolution by learning to map protein sequences to functions
without building a detailed model of the underlying physics, chemistry and biological pathways.
Despite the great potentials held by these ML methods, they encounter severe challenges in identifying
the most suitable sequences for a targeted function. These failures can be attributed to the common
practice of adopting a high-dimensional feature representation for protein sequences and inefficient
search methods. To address these issues, we propose an efficient, experimental design-oriented
closed-loop optimization framework for protein directed evolution, termed ODBO, which employs
a combination of novel low-dimensional protein encoding strategy and Bayesian optimization enhanced
with search space prescreening via outlier detection. We further design an initial sample selection
strategy to minimize the number of experimental samples for training ML models. We conduct and report
four protein directed evolution experiments that substantiate the capability of the proposed
framework for finding of the variants with properties of interest. We expect the ODBO framework
to greatly reduce the experimental cost and time cost of directed evolution, and can be further generalized
as a powerful tool for adaptive experimental design in a broader context.

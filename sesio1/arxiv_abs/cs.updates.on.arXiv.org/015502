When learning cybersecurity, operating systems, or networking, students perform practical tasks
using a broad range of command-line tools. Collecting and analyzing data about the command usage
can reveal valuable insights into how students progress and where they make mistakes. However,
few learning environments support recording and inspecting command-line inputs, and setting
up an efficient infrastructure for this purpose is challenging. To aid engineering and computing
educators, we share the design and implementation of an open-source toolset for logging commands
that students execute on Linux machines. Compared to basic solutions, such as shell history files,
the toolset's added value is threefold. 1) Its configuration is automated so that it can be easily
used in classes on different topics. 2) It collects metadata about the command execution, such as
a timestamp, hostname, and IP address. 3) Data are instantly forwarded to central storage in a unified,
semi-structured format. This enables automated processing, both in real-time and post hoc, to
enhance the instructors' understanding of student actions. The toolset works independently of
the teaching content, the training network's topology, or the number of students working in parallel.
We demonstrated the toolset's value in two learning environments at four training sessions. Over
two semesters, 50 students played educational cybersecurity games using a Linux command-line
interface. Each training session lasted approximately two hours, during which we recorded 4439
shell commands. The semi-automated data analysis revealed solution patterns, used tools, and
misconceptions of students. Our insights from creating the toolset and applying it in teaching
practice are relevant for instructors, researchers, and developers of learning environments.
We provide the software and data resulting from this work so that others can use them.

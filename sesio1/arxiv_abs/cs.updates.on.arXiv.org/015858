Action recognition is a key algorithmic part of emerging on-the-edge smart video surveillance
and security systems. Skeleton-based action recognition is an attractive approach which, instead
of using RGB pixel data, relies on human pose information to classify appropriate actions. However,
existing algorithms often assume ideal conditions that are not representative of real-world limitations,
such as noisy input, latency requirements, and edge resource constraints. To address the limitations
of existing approaches, this paper presents Real-World Graph Convolution Networks (RW-GCNs),
an architecture-level solution for meeting the domain constraints of Real World Skeleton-based
Action Recognition. Inspired by the presence of feedback connections in the human visual cortex,
RW-GCNs leverage attentive feedback augmentation on existing near state-of-the-art (SotA) Spatial-Temporal
Graph Convolution Networks (ST-GCNs). The ST-GCNs' design choices are derived from information
theory-centric principles to address both the spatial and temporal noise typically encountered
in end-to-end real-time and on-the-edge smart video systems. Our results demonstrate RW-GCNs'
ability to serve these applications by achieving a new SotA accuracy on the NTU-RGB-D-120 dataset
at 94.1%, and achieving 32X less latency than baseline ST-GCN applications while still achieving
90.4% accuracy on the Northwestern UCLA dataset in the presence of spatial keypoint noise. RW-GCNs
further show system scalability by running on the 10X cost effective NVIDIA Jetson Nano (as opposed
to NVIDIA Xavier NX), while still maintaining a respectful range of throughput (15.6 to 5.5 Actions
per Second) on the resource constrained device. The code is available here: https://github.com/TeCSAR-UNCC/RW-GCN.

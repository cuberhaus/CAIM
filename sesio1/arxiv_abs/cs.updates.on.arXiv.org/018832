Navier-Stokes equations are significant partial differential equations that describe the motion
of fluids such as liquids and air. Due to the importance of Navier-Stokes equations, the development
on efficient numerical schemes is important for both science and engineer. Recently, with the development
of AI techniques, several approaches have been designed to integrate deep neural networks in simulating
and inferring the fluid dynamics governed by incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, which can
accelerate the simulation or inferring process in a mesh-free and differentiable way. In this paper,
we point out that the capability of existing deep Navier-Stokes informed methods is limited to handle
non-smooth or fractional equations, which are two critical situations in reality. To this end,
we propose the \emph{Deep Random Vortex Method} (DRVM), which combines the neural network with
a random vortex dynamics system equivalent to the Navier-Stokes equation. Specifically, the random
vortex dynamics motivates a Monte Carlo based loss function for training the neural network, which
avoids the calculation of derivatives through auto-differentiation. Therefore, DRVM not only
can efficiently solve Navier-Stokes equations involving rough path, non-differentiable initial
conditions and fractional operators, but also inherits the mesh-free and differentiable benefits
of the deep-learning-based solver. We conduct experiments on the Cauchy problem, parametric solver
learning, and the inverse problem of both 2-d and 3-d incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.
The proposed method achieves accurate results for simulation and inference of Navier-Stokes equations.
Especially for the cases that include singular initial conditions, DRVM significantly outperforms
existing PINN method.

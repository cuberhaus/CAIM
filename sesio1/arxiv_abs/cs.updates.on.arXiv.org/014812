Biometric technologies, especially face recognition, have become an essential part of identity
management systems worldwide. In deployments of biometrics, secure storage of biometric information
is necessary in order to protect the users' privacy. In this context, biometric cryptosystems are
designed to meet key requirements of biometric information protection enabling a privacy-preserving
storage and comparison of biometric data. This work investigates the application of a well-known
biometric cryptosystem, i.e. the improved fuzzy vault scheme, to facial feature vectors extracted
through deep convolutional neural networks. To this end, a feature transformation method is introduced
which maps fixed-length real-valued deep feature vectors to integer-valued feature sets. As part
of said feature transformation, a detailed analysis of different feature quantisation and binarisation
techniques is conducted. At key binding, obtained feature sets are locked in an unlinkable improved
fuzzy vault. For key retrieval, the efficiency of different polynomial reconstruction techniques
is investigated. The proposed feature transformation method and template protection scheme are
agnostic of the biometric characteristic. In experiments, an unlinkable improved deep face fuzzy
vault-based template protection scheme is constructed employing features extracted with a state-of-the-art
deep convolutional neural network trained with the additive angular margin loss (ArcFace). For
the best configuration, a false non-match rate below 1% at a false match rate of 0.01%, is achieved
in cross-database experiments on the FERET and FRGCv2 face databases. On average, a security level
of up to approximately 28 bits is obtained. This work presents an effective face-based fuzzy vault
scheme providing privacy protection of facial reference data as well as digital key derivation
from face.

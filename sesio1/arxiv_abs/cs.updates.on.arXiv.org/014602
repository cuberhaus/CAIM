Nowadays, using vibration data in conjunction with pattern recognition methods is one of the most
common fault detection strategies for structures. However, their performances depend on the features
extracted from vibration data, the features selected to train the classifier, and the classifier
used for pattern recognition. Deep learning facilitates the fault detection procedure by automating
the feature extraction and selection, and classification procedure. Though, deep learning approaches
have challenges in designing its structure and tuning its hyperparameters, which may result in
a low generalization capability. Therefore, this study proposes an ensemble deep learning framework
based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) and Dempster-Shafer theory (DST), called CNN-DST.
In this framework, several CNNs with the proposed structure are first trained, and then, the outputs
of the CNNs selected by the proposed technique are combined by using an improved DST-based method.
To validate the proposed CNN-DST framework, it is applied to an experimental dataset created by
the broadband vibrational responses of polycrystalline Nickel alloy first-stage turbine blades
with different types and severities of damage. Through statistical analysis, it is shown that the
proposed CNN-DST framework classifies the turbine blades with an average prediction accuracy
of 97.19%. The proposed CNN-DST framework is benchmarked with other state-of-the-art classification
methods, demonstrating its high performance. The robustness of the proposed CNN-DST framework
with respect to measurement noise is investigated, showing its high noise-resistance. Further,
bandwidth analysis reveals that most of the required information for detecting faulty samples
is available in a small frequency range.

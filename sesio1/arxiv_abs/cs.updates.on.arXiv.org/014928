Cyber attacks are becoming more sophisticated and diverse, making detection increasingly challenging.
To combat these attacks, security practitioners actively summarize and exchange their knowledge
about attacks across organizations in the form of cyber threat intelligence (CTI) reports. However,
as CTI reports written in natural language texts are not structured for automatic analysis, the
report usage requires tedious efforts of manual cyber intelligence recovery. Additionally, individual
reports typically cover only a limited aspect of attack patterns (techniques) and thus are insufficient
to provide a comprehensive view of attacks with multiple variants. To take advantage of threat intelligence
delivered by CTI reports, we propose AttacKG to automatically extract structured attack behavior
graphs from CTI reports and identify the adopted attack techniques. We then aggregate cyber intelligence
across reports to collect different aspects of techniques and enhance attack behavior graphs as
technique knowledge graphs (TKGs). Such TKGs with technique-level intelligence directly benefit
downstream security tasks that rely on technique specifications, e.g., Advanced Persistent Threat
(APT) detection. In our evaluation against 1,515 real-world CTI reports from diverse intelligence
sources, AttacKG effectively identifies 28,262 attack techniques with 8,393 unique Indicators
of Compromises (IoCs). Further, to verify AttacKG's accuracy in extracting threat intelligence,
we run AttacKG on eight manually labeled CTI reports. Empirical results show that AttacKG accurately
identifies attack-relevant entities, dependencies, and techniques with F1-scores of 0.895,
0.911, and 0.819, which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches like EXTRACTOR
and TTPDrill.

Investigating the causal relationships between characteristics and expressions plays a critical
role in healthcare analytics. Effective synthesis for expressions using given characteristics
can make great contributions to health risk management and medical decision-making. For example,
predicting the resulting physiological symptoms on patients from given treatment characteristics
is helpful for the disease prevention and personalized treatment strategy design. Therefore,
the objective of this study is to effectively synthesize the expressions based on given characteristics.
However, the mapping from characteristics to expressions is usually from a relatively low dimension
space to a high dimension space, but most of the existing methods such as regression models could
not effectively handle such mapping. Besides, the relationship between characteristics and expressions
may contain not only deterministic patterns, but also stochastic patterns. To address these challenges,
this paper proposed a novel selective ensemble characteristic-to-expression synthesis (SE-CTES)
approach inspired by generative adversarial network (GAN). The novelty of the proposed method
can be summarized into three aspects: (1) GAN-based architecture for deep neural networks are incorporated
to learn the relatively low dimensional mapping to high dimensional mapping containing both deterministic
and stochastic patterns; (2) the weights of the two mismatching errors in the GAN-based architecture
are proposed to be different to reduce the learning bias in the training process; and (3) a selective
ensemble learning framework is proposed to reduce the prediction bias and improve the synthesis
stability. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, extensive numerical simulation
studies and a real-world healthcare case study were applied and the results demonstrated that the
proposed method is very promising.

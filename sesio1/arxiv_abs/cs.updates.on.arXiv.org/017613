Reconstruction of a continuous surface of two-dimensional manifold from its raw, discrete point
cloud observation is a long-standing problem. The problem is technically ill-posed, and becomes
more difficult considering that various sensing imperfections would appear in the point clouds
obtained by practical depth scanning. In literature, a rich set of methods has been proposed, and
reviews of existing methods are also provided. However, existing reviews are short of thorough
investigations on a common benchmark. The present paper aims to review and benchmark existing methods
in the new era of deep learning surface reconstruction. To this end, we contribute a large-scale
benchmarking dataset consisting of both synthetic and real-scanned data; the benchmark includes
object- and scene-level surfaces and takes into account various sensing imperfections that are
commonly encountered in practical depth scanning. We conduct thorough empirical studies by comparing
existing methods on the constructed benchmark, and pay special attention on robustness of existing
methods against various scanning imperfections; we also study how different methods generalize
in terms of reconstructing complex surface shapes. Our studies help identify the best conditions
under which different methods work, and suggest some empirical findings. For example, while deep
learning methods are increasingly popular, our systematic studies suggest that, surprisingly,
a few classical methods perform even better in terms of both robustness and generalization; our
studies also suggest that the practical challenges of misalignment of point sets from multi-view
scanning, missing of surface points, and point outliers remain unsolved by all the existing surface
reconstruction methods. We expect that the benchmark and our studies would be valuable both for
practitioners and as a guidance for new innovations in future research.

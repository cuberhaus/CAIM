The expansive globalization of the semiconductor supply chain has introduced numerous untrusted
entities into different stages of a device's lifecycle. To make matters worse, the increase complexity
in the design as well as aggressive time to market requirements of the newer generation of integrated
circuits can lead either designers to unintentionally introduce security vulnerabilities or
verification engineers to fail in detecting them earlier in the design lifecycle. These overlooked
or undetected vulnerabilities can be exploited by malicious entities in subsequent stages of the
lifecycle through an ever widening variety of hardware attacks. The ability to ascertain the provenance
of these vulnerabilities, therefore, becomes a pressing issue when the security assurance across
the whole lifecycle is required to be ensured. We posit that if there is a malicious or unintentional
breach of security policies of a device, it will be reflected in the form of anomalies in the traditional
design, verification and testing activities throughout the lifecycle. With that, a digital simulacrum
of a device's lifecycle, called a digital twin (DT), can be formed by the data gathered from different
stages to secure the lifecycle of the device. In this paper, we put forward a realization of intertwined
relationships of security vulnerabilities with data available from the silicon lifecycle and
formulate different components of an AI driven DT framework. The proposed DT framework leverages
these relationships and relational learning to achieve Forward and Backward Trust Analysis functionalities
enabling security aware management of the entire lifecycle. Finally, we provide potential future
research avenues and challenges for realization of the digital twin framework to enable secure
semiconductor lifecycle management.

The demanding objectives for the future sixth generation (6G) of wireless communication networks
have spurred recent research efforts on novel materials and radio-frequency front-end architectures
for wireless connectivity, as well as revolutionary communication and computing paradigms. Among
the pioneering candidate technologies for 6G belong the reconfigurable intelligent surfaces
(RISs), which are artificial planar structures with integrated electronic circuits that can be
programmed to manipulate the incoming electromagnetic field in a wide variety of functionalities.
Incorporating RISs in wireless networks has been recently advocated as a revolutionary means to
transform any wireless signal propagation environment to a dynamically programmable one, intended
for various networking objectives, such as coverage extension and capacity boosting, spatiotemporal
focusing with benefits in energy efficiency and secrecy, and low electromagnetic field exposure.
Motivated by the recent increasing interests in the field of RISs and the consequent pioneering
concept of the RIS-enabled smart wireless environments, in this paper, we overview and taxonomize
the latest advances in RIS hardware architectures as well as the most recent developments in the
modeling of RIS unit elements and RIS-empowered wireless signal propagation. We also present a
thorough overview of the channel estimation approaches for RIS-empowered communications systems,
which constitute a prerequisite step for the optimized incorporation of RISs in future wireless
networks. Finally, we discuss the relevance of the RIS technology in the latest wireless communication
standards, and highlight the current and future standardization activities for the RIS technology
and the consequent RIS-empowered wireless networking approaches.

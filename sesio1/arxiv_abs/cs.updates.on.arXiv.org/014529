Supervised methods for object delineation in remote sensing require labeled ground-truth data.
Gathering sufficient high quality ground-truth data is difficult, especially when targets are
of irregular shape or difficult to distinguish from background or neighboring objects. Tree crown
delineation provides key information from remote sensing images for forestry, ecology, and management.
However, tree crowns in remote sensing imagery are often difficult to label and annotate due to irregular
shape, overlapping canopies, shadowing, and indistinct edges. There are also multiple approaches
to annotation in this field (e.g., rectangular boxes vs. convex polygons) that further contribute
to annotation imprecision. However, current evaluation methods do not account for this uncertainty
in annotations, and quantitative metrics for evaluation can vary across multiple annotators.
In this paper, we address these limitations by developing an adaptation of the Rand index for weakly-labeled
crown delineation that we call RandCrowns. Our new RandCrowns evaluation metric provides a method
to appropriately evaluate delineated tree crowns while taking into account imprecision in the
ground-truth delineations. The RandCrowns metric reformulates the Rand index by adjusting the
areas over which each term of the index is computed to account for uncertain and imprecise object
delineation labels. Quantitative comparisons to the commonly used intersection over union method
shows a decrease in the variance generated by differences among multiple annotators. Combined
with qualitative examples, our results suggest that the RandCrowns metric is more robust for scoring
target delineations in the presence of uncertainty and imprecision in annotations that are inherent
to tree crown delineation.

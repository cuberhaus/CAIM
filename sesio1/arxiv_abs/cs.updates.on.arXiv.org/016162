Location fingerprinting based on RSSI becomes a mainstream indoor localization technique due
to its advantage of not requiring the installation of new infrastructure and the modification of
existing devices, especially given the prevalence of Wi-Fi-enabled devices and the ubiquitous
Wi-Fi access in modern buildings. The use of AI/ML technologies like DNNs makes location fingerprinting
more accurate and reliable, especially for large-scale multi-building and multi-floor indoor
localization. The application of DNNs for indoor localization, however, depends on a large amount
of preprocessed and deliberately-labeled data for their training. Considering the difficulty
of the data collection in an indoor environment, especially under the current epidemic situation
of COVID-19, we investigate three different methods of RSSI data augmentation based on Multi-Output
Gaussian Process (MOGP), i.e., by a single floor, by neighboring floors, and by a single building;
unlike Single-Output Gaussian Process (SOGP), MOGP can take into account the correlation among
RSSI observations from multiple Access Points (APs) deployed closely to each other (e.g., APs on
the same floor of a building) by collectively handling them. The feasibility of the MOGP-based RSSI
data augmentation is demonstrated through experiments based on the state-of-the-art RNN indoor
localization model and the UJIIndoorLoc, i.e., the most popular publicly-available multi-building
and multi-floor indoor localization database, where the RNN model trained with the UJIIndoorLoc
database augmented by using the whole RSSI data of a building in fitting an MOGP model (i.e., by a single
building) outperforms the other two augmentation methods as well as the RNN model trained with the
original UJIIndoorLoc database, resulting in the mean three-dimensional positioning error of
8.42 m.

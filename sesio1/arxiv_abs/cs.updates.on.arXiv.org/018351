The neural underpinning of the biological visual system is challenging to study experimentally,
in particular as the neuronal activity becomes increasingly nonlinear with respect to visual input.
Artificial neural networks (ANNs) can serve a variety of goals for improving our understanding
of this complex system, not only serving as predictive digital twins of sensory cortex for novel
hypothesis generation in silico, but also incorporating bio-inspired architectural motifs to
progressively bridge the gap between biological and machine vision. The mouse has recently emerged
as a popular model system to study visual information processing, but no standardized large-scale
benchmark to identify state-of-the-art models of the mouse visual system has been established.
To fill this gap, we propose the Sensorium benchmark competition. We collected a large-scale dataset
from mouse primary visual cortex containing the responses of more than 28,000 neurons across seven
mice stimulated with thousands of natural images, together with simultaneous behavioral measurements
that include running speed, pupil dilation, and eye movements. The benchmark challenge will rank
models based on predictive performance for neuronal responses on a held-out test set, and includes
two tracks for model input limited to either stimulus only (Sensorium) or stimulus plus behavior
(Sensorium+). We provide a starting kit to lower the barrier for entry, including tutorials, pre-trained
baseline models, and APIs with one line commands for data loading and submission. We would like to
see this as a starting point for regular challenges and data releases, and as a standard tool for measuring
progress in large-scale neural system identification models of the mouse visual system and beyond.

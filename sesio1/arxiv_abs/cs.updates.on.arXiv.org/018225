The farming industry constantly seeks the automation of different processes involved in agricultural
production, such as sowing, harvesting and weed control. The use of mobile autonomous robots to
perform those tasks is of great interest. Arable lands present hard challenges for Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems, key for mobile robotics, given the visual difficulty
due to the highly repetitive scene and the crop leaves movement caused by the wind. In recent years,
several Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) and SLAM systems have been developed. They have proved
to be robust and capable of achieving high accuracy in indoor and outdoor urban environments. However,
they were not properly assessed in agricultural fields. In this work we assess the most relevant
state-of-the-art VIO systems in terms of accuracy and processing time on arable lands in order to
better understand how they behave on these environments. In particular, the evaluation is carried
out on a collection of sensor data recorded by our wheeled robot in a soybean field, which was publicly
released as the Rosario Dataset. The evaluation shows that the highly repetitive appearance of
the environment, the strong vibration produced by the rough terrain and the movement of the leaves
caused by the wind, expose the limitations of the current state-of-the-art VIO and SLAM systems.
We analyze the systems failures and highlight the observed drawbacks, including initialization
failures, tracking loss and sensitivity to IMU saturation. Finally, we conclude that even though
certain systems like ORB-SLAM3 and S-MSCKF show good results with respect to others, more improvements
should be done to make them reliable in agricultural fields for certain applications such as soil
tillage of crop rows and pesticide spraying.

Information technology system (ITS), informally, consists of hardware and software infrastructure
(e.g., workstations, servers, laptops, installed software packages, databases, LANs, firewalls,
etc.), along with physical and logical connections and inter-dependencies between various items.
Nowadays, every company owns and operates an ITS, but detailed information about the system is rarely
publicly available. However, there are many situations where the availability of such data would
be beneficial. For example, cyber ranges need descriptions of complex realistic IT systems in order
to provide an effective training and education platform. Furthermore, various algorithms in cybersecurity,
in particular attack tree generation, need to be validated on realistic models of IT systems. In
this paper, we describe a system we call the Generator that, based on the high-level requirements
such as the number of employees and the business area the target company belongs to, generates a model
of an ITS that satisfies the given requirements. We put special emphasis on the following two criteria:
the generated ITS models a large amount of details, and ideally resembles a real system. Our survey
of related literature found no sufficiently similar prior works, so we believe that this is the first
attempt of building something like this. We created a proof-of-concept implementation of the Generator,
validated it by generating ITS models for a simplified fictional financial institution, and analyzed
the Generators performance with respect to the problem size. The research was done in an iterative
manner, with coauthors continuously providing feedback on intermediate results. (...) We intend
to extend this prototype to allow probabilistic generation of IT systems when only a subset of parameters
is explicitly defined, and further develop and validate our approach with the help of domain experts.

A path-following control algorithm enables a system's trajectories under its guidance to converge
to and evolve along a given geometric desired path. There exist various such algorithms, but many
of them can only guarantee local convergence to the desired path in its neighborhood. In contrast,
the control algorithms using a well-designed guiding vector field can ensure almost global convergence
of trajectories to the desired path; here, "almost" means that in some cases, a measure-zero set
of trajectories converge to the singular set where the vector field becomes zero (with all other
trajectories converging to the desired path). In this paper, we first generalize the guiding vector
field from the Euclidean space to a general smooth Riemannian manifold. This generalization can
deal with path-following in some abstract configuration space (such as robot arm joint space).
Then we show several theoretical results from a topological viewpoint. Specifically, we are motivated
by the observation that singular points of the guiding vector field exist in many examples where
the desired path is homeomorphic to the unit circle, but it is unknown whether the existence of singular
points always holds in general (i.e., is inherent in the topology of the desired path). In the $n$-dimensional
Euclidean space, we provide an affirmative answer, and conclude that it is not possible to guarantee
global convergence to desired paths that are homeomorphic to the unit circle. Furthermore, we show
that there always exist \emph{non-path-converging trajectories} (i.e., trajectories that do
not converge to the desired path) starting from the boundary of a ball containing the desired path
in an $n$-dimensional Euclidean space where $n \ge 3$. Examples are provided to illustrate the theoretical
results.

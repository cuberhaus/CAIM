Organizations often collect private data and release aggregate statistics for the public's benefit.
If no steps toward preserving privacy are taken, adversaries may use released statistics to deduce
unauthorized information about the individuals described in the private dataset. Differentially
private algorithms address this challenge by slightly perturbing underlying statistics with
noise, thereby mathematically limiting the amount of information that may be deduced from each
data release. Properly calibrating these algorithms -- and in turn the disclosure risk for people
described in the dataset -- requires a data curator to choose a value for a privacy budget parameter,
$\epsilon$. However, there is little formal guidance for choosing $\epsilon$, a task that requires
reasoning about the probabilistic privacy-utility trade-off. Furthermore, choosing $\epsilon$
in the context of statistical inference requires reasoning about accuracy trade-offs in the presence
of both measurement error and differential privacy (DP) noise. We present Visualizing Privacy
(ViP), an interactive interface that visualizes relationships between $\epsilon$, accuracy,
and disclosure risk to support setting and splitting $\epsilon$ among queries. As a user adjusts
$\epsilon$, ViP dynamically updates visualizations depicting expected accuracy and risk. ViP
also has an inference setting, allowing a user to reason about the impact of DP noise on statistical
inferences. Finally, we present results of a study where 16 research practitioners with little
to no DP background completed a set of tasks related to setting $\epsilon$ using both ViP and a control.
We find that ViP helps participants more correctly answer questions related to judging the probability
of where a DP-noised release is likely to fall and comparing between DP-noised and non-private confidence
intervals.

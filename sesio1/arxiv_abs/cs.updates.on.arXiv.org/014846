Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), as a recently emerging technology, enabled a new breed of unprecedented
applications in different domains. This technology's ongoing trend is departing from large remotely-controlled
drones to networks of small autonomous drones to collectively complete intricate tasks time and
cost-effectively. An important challenge is developing efficient sensing, communication, and
control algorithms that can accommodate the requirements of highly dynamic UAV networks with heterogeneous
mobility levels. Recently, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in learning-based networking
has gained momentum to harness the learning power of cognizant nodes to make more intelligent networking
decisions by integrating computational intelligence into UAV networks. An important example
of this trend is developing learning-powered routing protocols, where machine learning methods
are used to model and predict topology evolution, channel status, traffic mobility, and environmental
factors for enhanced routing. This paper reviews AI-enabled routing protocols designed primarily
for aerial networks, including topology-predictive and self-adaptive learning-based routing
algorithms, with an emphasis on accommodating highly-dynamic network topology. To this end, we
justify the importance and adaptation of AI into UAV network communications. We also address, with
an AI emphasis, the closely related topics of mobility and networking models for UAV networks, simulation
tools and public datasets, and relations to UAV swarming, which serve to choose the right algorithm
for each scenario. We conclude by presenting future trends, and the remaining challenges in AI-based
UAV networking, for different aspects of routing, connectivity, topology control, security and
privacy, energy efficiency, and spectrum sharing.

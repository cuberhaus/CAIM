Medical image segmentation, which aims to automatically extract anatomical or pathological structures,
plays a key role in computer-aided diagnosis and disease analysis. Despite the problem has been
widely studied, existing methods are prone to topological errors. In medical imaging, the topology
of the structure, such as the kidney or lung, is usually known. Preserving the topology of the structure
in the segmentation process is of utmost importance for accurate image analysis. In this work, a
novel learning-based segmentation model is proposed. A {\it topology-preserving segmentation
network (TPSN)} is trained to give an accurate segmentation result of an input image that preserves
the prescribed topology. TPSN is a deformation-based model that yields a deformation map through
a UNet, which takes the medical image and a template mask as inputs. The main idea is to deform a template
mask describing the prescribed topology by a diffeomorphism to segment the object in the image.
The topology of the shape in the template mask is well preserved under the diffeomorphic map. The
diffeomorphic property of the map is controlled by introducing a regularization term related to
the Jacobian in the loss function. As such, a topology-preserving segmentation result can be guaranteed.
Furthermore, a multi-scale TPSN is developed in this paper that incorporates multi-level information
of images to produce more precise segmentation results. To evaluate our method, we applied the 2D
TPSN on Ham10000 and 3D TPSN on KiTS21. Experimental results illustrate our method outperforms
the baseline UNet segmentation model with/without connected-component analysis (CCA) by both
the dice score and IoU score. Besides, results show that our method can produce reliable results
even in challenging cases, where pixel-wise segmentation models by UNet and CCA fail to obtain accurate
results.

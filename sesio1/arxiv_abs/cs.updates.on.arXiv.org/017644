We present a new method for assessing and measuring homophily in networks whose nodes have categorical
attributes, namely when the nodes of networks come partitioned into classes (colors). We probe
this method in two different classes of networks: i) protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks,
where nodes correspond to proteins, partitioned according to their functional role, and edges
represent functional interactions between proteins ii) Pokec on-line social network, where nodes
correspond to users, partitioned according to their age, and edges respresent friendship between
users. Similarly to other classical and well consolidated approaches, our method compares the
relative edge density of the subgraphs induced by each class with the corresponding expected relative
edge density under a null model. The novelty of our approach consists in prescribing an endogenous
null model, namely, the sample space of the null model is built on the input network itself. This allows
us to give exact explicit expression for the z-score of the relative edge density of each class as
well as other related statistics. The z-scores directly quantify the statistical significance
of the observed homophily via Tchebycheff inequality. The expression of each z-score is entered
by the network structure through basic combinatorial invariant such as the number of subgraphs
with two spanning edges. Each z-score is computed in O(n + m) time for a network with n nodes and m edges.
This leads to an overall efficient computational method for assesing homophily. We complement
the analysis of homophily/heterophily by considering z-scores of the number of isolated nodes
in the subgraphs induced by each class, that are computed in O(nm) time. Theoretical results are
then exploited to show that, as expected, both the analyzed network classes are significantly homophilic
with respect to the considered node properties.

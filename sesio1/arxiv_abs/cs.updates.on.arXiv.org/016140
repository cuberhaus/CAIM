Biomechanical models often need to describe very complex systems, organs or diseases, and hence
also include a large number of parameters. One of the attractive features of physics-based models
is that in those models (most) parameters have a clear physical meaning. Nevertheless, the determination
of these parameters is often very elaborate and costly and shows a large scatter within the population.
Hence, it is essential to identify the most important parameter for a particular problem at hand.
In order to distinguish parameters which have a significant influence on a specific model output
from non-influential parameters, we use sensitivity analysis, in particular the Sobol method
as a global variance-based method. However, the Sobol method requires a large number of model evaluations,
which is prohibitive for computationally expensive models. We therefore employ Gaussian processes
as a metamodel for the underlying full model. Metamodelling introduces further uncertainty, which
we also quantify. We demonstrate the approach by applying it to two different problems: nanoparticle-mediated
drug delivery in a multiphase tumour-growth model, and arterial growth and remodelling. Even relatively
small numbers of evaluations of the full model suffice to identify the influential parameters in
both cases and to separate them from non-influential parameters. The approach also allows the quantification
of higher-order interaction effects. We thus show that a variance-based global sensitivity analysis
is feasible for computationally expensive biomechanical models. Different aspects of sensitivity
analysis are covered including a transparent declaration of the uncertainties involved in the
estimation process. Such a global sensitivity analysis not only helps to massively reduce costs
for experimental determination of parameters but is also highly beneficial for inverse analysis
of such complex models.

For patients suffering from brain tumor, prognosis estimation and treatment decisions are made
by a multidisciplinary team based on a set of preoperative MR scans. Currently, the lack of standardized
and automatic methods for tumor detection and generation of clinical reports represents a major
hurdle. In this study, we investigate glioblastomas, lower grade gliomas, meningiomas, and metastases,
through four cohorts of up to 4000 patients. Tumor segmentation models were trained using the AGU-Net
architecture with different preprocessing steps and protocols. Segmentation performances were
assessed in-depth using a wide-range of voxel and patient-wise metrics covering volume, distance,
and probabilistic aspects. Finally, two software solutions have been developed, enabling an easy
use of the trained models and standardized generation of clinical reports: Raidionics and Raidionics-Slicer.
Segmentation performances were quite homogeneous across the four different brain tumor types,
with an average true positive Dice ranging between 80% and 90%, patient-wise recall between 88%
and 98%, and patient-wise precision around 95%. With our Raidionics software, running on a desktop
computer with CPU support, tumor segmentation can be performed in 16 to 54 seconds depending on the
dimensions of the MRI volume. For the generation of a standardized clinical report, including the
tumor segmentation and features computation, 5 to 15 minutes are necessary. All trained models
have been made open-access together with the source code for both software solutions and validation
metrics computation. In the future, an automatic classification of the brain tumor type would be
necessary to replace manual user input. Finally, the inclusion of post-operative segmentation
in both software solutions will be key for generating complete post-operative standardized clinical
reports.

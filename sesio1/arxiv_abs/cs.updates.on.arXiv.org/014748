Classifiers are often utilized in time-constrained settings where labels must be assigned to inputs
quickly. To address these scenarios, budgeted multi-stage classifiers (MSC) process inputs through
a sequence of partial feature acquisition and evaluation steps with early-exit options until a
confident prediction can be made. This allows for fast evaluation that can prevent expensive, unnecessary
feature acquisition in time-critical instances. However, performance of MSCs is highly sensitive
to several design aspects -- making optimization of these systems an important but difficult problem.
To approximate an initially intractable combinatorial problem, current approaches to MSC configuration
rely on well-behaved surrogate loss functions accounting for two primary objectives (processing
cost, error). These approaches have proven useful in many scenarios but are limited by analytic
constraints (convexity, smoothness, etc.) and do not manage additional performance objectives.
Notably, such methods do not explicitly account for an important aspect of real-time detection
systems -- the ratio of "accepted" predictions satisfying some confidence criterion imposed by
a risk-averse monitor. This paper proposes a problem-specific genetic algorithm, EMSCO, that
incorporates a terminal reject option for indecisive predictions and treats MSC design as an evolutionary
optimization problem with distinct objectives (accuracy, cost, coverage). The algorithm's design
emphasizes Pareto efficiency while respecting a notion of aggregated performance via a unique
scalarization. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate EMSCO's ability to find global optima
in a variety of Theta(k^n) solution spaces, and multiple experiments show EMSCO is competitive
with alternative budgeted approaches.

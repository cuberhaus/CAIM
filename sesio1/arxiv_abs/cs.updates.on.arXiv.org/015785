In this paper, we contribute a multi-faceted study into Pavlovian signalling -- a process by which
learned, temporally extended predictions made by one agent inform decision-making by another
agent. Signalling is intimately connected to time and timing. In service of generating and receiving
signals, humans and other animals are known to represent time, determine time since past events,
predict the time until a future stimulus, and both recognize and generate patterns that unfold in
time. We investigate how different temporal processes impact coordination and signalling between
learning agents by introducing a partially observable decision-making domain we call the Frost
Hollow. In this domain, a prediction learning agent and a reinforcement learning agent are coupled
into a two-part decision-making system that works to acquire sparse reward while avoiding time-conditional
hazards. We evaluate two domain variations: machine agents interacting in a seven-state linear
walk, and human-machine interaction in a virtual-reality environment. Our results showcase the
speed of learning for Pavlovian signalling, the impact that different temporal representations
do (and do not) have on agent-agent coordination, and how temporal aliasing impacts agent-agent
and human-agent interactions differently. As a main contribution, we establish Pavlovian signalling
as a natural bridge between fixed signalling paradigms and fully adaptive communication learning
between two agents. We further show how to computationally build this adaptive signalling process
out of a fixed signalling process, characterized by fast continual prediction learning and minimal
constraints on the nature of the agent receiving signals. Our results therefore suggest an actionable,
constructivist path towards communication learning between reinforcement learning agents.

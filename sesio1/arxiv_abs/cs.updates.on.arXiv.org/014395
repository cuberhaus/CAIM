The Kalman filter computes the optimal variable-gain using prior knowledge of the initial state
and random (process and measurement) noise distributions, which are assumed to be Gaussian with
known variance. However, when these distributions are unknown, the Kalman filter is not necessarily
optimal and other simpler state-estimators, such as fixed-gain ({\alpha}, {\alpha}-\b{eta}
or {\alpha}-\b{eta}-{\gamma} etc.) filters may be sufficient. When such filters are used as low-complexity
state-estimators in embedded tracking systems, the fixed gain parameters are usually set equal
to the steady-state gains of the corresponding Kalman filter. An alternative procedure, that does
not rely prior distributions, based on Luenberger observers, is presented here. It is suggested
that the arbitrary placement of closed-loop state-observer poles is a simple and intuitive way
of tuning the transient and steady-state response of a fixed-gain tracking filter when prior distributions
are unknown. All poles are placed inside the unit circle on the positive real axis of the complex z-plane
at p for a well damped response and a configurable bandwidth. Transient bias errors, e.g. due to target
manoeuvres or process modelling errors, decrease as p=0 is approached for a wider bandwidth. Steady-state
random errors, e.g. due to sensor noise, decrease as p=1 is approached for a narrower bandwidth.
Thus the p parameter (with 0<p<1) may be interpreted as a dimensionless smoothing factor. This tutorial-style
report examines state-observer design by pole placement, which is a standard procedure for feedback
controls but unusual for tracking filters, due to the success and popularity of the Kalman filter.
As Bayesian trackers are designed via statistical modelling, not by pole-zero placement in the
complex plane, the underlying principles of linear time-invariant signals and systems are also
reviewed.

Dye experimentation is a widely used method in experimental fluid mechanics for flow analysis or
for the study of the transport of particles within a fluid. This technique is particularly useful
in biomedical diagnostic applications ranging from hemodynamic analysis of cardiovascular systems
to ocular circulation. However, simulating dyes governed by convection-diffusion partial differential
equations (PDEs) can also be a useful post-processing analysis approach for computational fluid
dynamics (CFD) applications. Such simulations can be used to identify the relative significance
of different spatial subregions in particular time intervals of interest in an unsteady flow field.
Additionally, dye evolution is closely related to non-discrete particle residence time (PRT)
calculations that are governed by similar PDEs. PRT is a widely used metric for various fluid dynamics
applications (e.g., environmental fluids, biological flows) and is a well-accepted biomarker
for cardiovascular diseases since it is linked to thrombus formation. This contribution introduces
a pseudo-spectral method based on Fourier continuation (FC) for conducting dye simulations and
non-discrete particle residence time calculations without numerical diffusion errors. Convergence
and error analyses are performed with both manufactured and analytical solutions. The methodology
is applied to three distinct physical/physiological cases: 1) flow over a two-dimensional (2D)
cavity; 2) pulsatile flow in a simplified partially-grafted aortic dissection model; and 3) non-Newtonian
blood flow in a Fontan graft. Although velocity data is provided in this work by numerical simulation,
the proposed approach can also be applied to velocity data collected through experimental techniques
such as from particle image velocimetry.

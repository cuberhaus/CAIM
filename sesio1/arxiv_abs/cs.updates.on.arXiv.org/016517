Formal methods are mathematically-based techniques for the rigorous development of software-intensive
systems. The railway signaling domain is a field in which formal methods have traditionally been
applied, with several success stories. This article reports on a mapping study that surveys the
landscape of research on applications of formal methods to the development of railway systems.
Our main results are as follows: (i) we identify a total of 328 primary studies relevant to our scope
published between 1989 and 2020, of which 44% published during the last 5 years and 24% involving
industry; (ii) the majority of studies are evaluated through Examples (41%) and Experience Reports
(38%), while full-fledged Case Studies are limited (1.5%); (iii) Model checking is the most commonly
adopted technique (47%), followed by simulation (27%) and theorem proving (19.5%); (iv) the dominant
languages are UML (18%) and B (15%), while frequently used tools are ProB (9%), NuSMV (8%) and UPPAAL
(7%); however, a diverse landscape of languages and tools is employed; (v) the majority of systems
are interlocking products (40%), followed by models of high-level control logic (27%); (vi) most
of the studies focus on the Architecture (66%) and Detailed Design (45%) development phases. Based
on these findings, we highlight current research gaps and expected actions. In particular, the
need to focus on more empirically sound research methods, such as Case Studies and Controlled Experiments,
and to lower the degree of abstraction, by applying formal methods and tools to development phases
that are closer to software development. Our study contributes with an empirically based perspective
on the future of research and practice in formal methods applications for railways.

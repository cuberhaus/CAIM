Merge Resolution (MRes [Beyersdorff et al. J. Autom. Reason.'2021]) is a recently introduced proof
system for false QBFs. It stores the countermodels as merge maps. Merge maps are deterministic branching
programs in which isomorphism checking is efficient making MRes a polynomial time verifiable proof
system. In this paper, we introduce a family of proof systems MRes-R in which, the countermodels
are stored in any pre-fixed complete representation R, instead of merge maps. Hence corresponding
to each such R, we have a sound and refutationally complete QBF-proof system in MRes-R. To handle
arbitrary representations for the strategies, we introduce consistency checking rules in MRes-R
instead of isomorphism checking. As a result these proof systems are not polynomial time verifiable.
Consequently, the paper shows that using merge maps is too restrictive and can be replaced with arbitrary
representations leading to several interesting proof systems. Exploring proof theoretic properties
of MRes-R, we show that eFrege+$\forall$red simulates all valid refutations from proof systems
in MRes-R. In order to simulate arbitrary representations in MRes-R, we first represent the steps
used by the proof systems as a new complete structure. Consequently, the corresponding proof system
belonging to MRes-R is able to simulate all proof systems in MRes-R. Finally, we simulate this proof
system via eFrege+$\forall$red using the ideas from [Chew et al. ECCC.'2021]. On the lower bound
side, we show that the completion principle formulas from [Jonata et al. Theor. Comput. Sci.'2015]
which are shown to be hard for regular MRes in [Beyersdorff et al. FSTTCS.'2020], are also hard for
any regular proof system in MRes-R. Thereby, the paper lifts the lower bound of regular MRes to an
entire class of proof systems, which use some complete representation, including those undiscovered,
instead of merge maps.

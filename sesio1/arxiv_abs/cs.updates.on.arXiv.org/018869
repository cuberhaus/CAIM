Traditionally, traffic incident management (TIM) programs coordinate the deployment of emergency
resources to immediate incident requests without accommodating the interdependencies on incident
evolutions in the environment. However, ignoring inherent interdependencies on the evolution
of incidents in the environment while making current deployment decisions is shortsighted, and
the resulting naive deployment strategy can significantly worsen the overall incident delay impact
on the network. The interdependencies on incident evolution in the environment, including those
between incident occurrences, and those between resource availability in near-future requests
and the anticipated duration of the immediate incident request, should be considered through a
look-ahead model when making current-stage deployment decisions. This study develops a new proactive
framework based on the distributed constraint optimization problem (DCOP) to address the above
limitations, overcoming conventional TIM models that cannot accommodate the dependencies in
the TIM problem. Furthermore, the optimization objective is formulated to incorporate Unmanned
Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The UAVs' role in TIM includes exploring uncertain traffic conditions,
detecting unexpected events, and augmenting information from roadway traffic sensors. Robustness
analysis of our model for multiple TIM scenarios shows satisfactory performance using local search
exploration heuristics. Overall, our model reports a significant reduction in total incident
delay compared to conventional TIM models. With UAV support, we demonstrate a further decrease
in the overall incident delay through the shorter response time of emergency vehicles, and a reduction
in uncertainties associated with the estimated incident delay impact.

While the concept of Artificial Intelligent Internet of Things\ (AIoT) is booming, computation
and/or communication-intensive tasks accompanied by several sub-tasks are slowly moving from
centralized deployment to edge-side deployment. The idea of edge computing also makes intelligent
services sink locally. But in actual scenarios like dynamic edge computing networks (DECN), due
to fluctuations in available computing resources of intermediate servers and changes in bandwidth
during data transmission, service reliability becomes difficult to guarantee. Coupled with changes
in the amount of data in a service, the above three problems all make the existing reliability evaluation
methods no longer accurate. To study the effect of distributed service deployment strategies under
such a background, this paper proposes a reliability evaluation method (REMR) based on lower boundary
rule under time constraint to study the degree of the rationality of a service deployment plan combined
with DECN. In this scenario, time delay is the main concern which would be affected by three quantitative
factors: data packet storing and sending time, data transmission time and the calculation time
of executing sub-tasks on the node devices, specially while the last two are in dynamic scenarios.
In actual calculation, based on the idea of the minimal paths, the solution set would to be found that
can meet requirements in the current deployment. Then the reliability of the service supported
by the solution sets would be found out based on the principle of inclusion-exclusion combined with
the distribution of available data transmission bandwidth and the distribution of node available
computing resources. Besides a illustrative example was provided, to verify the calculated reliability
of the designed service deployment plan, the NS3 is utilized along with Google cluster data set for
simulation.

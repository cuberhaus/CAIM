Phase retrieval (PR) is an important component in modern computational imaging systems. Many algorithms
have been developed over the past half-century. Recent advances in deep learning have introduced
new possibilities for a robust and fast PR. An emerging technique called deep unfolding provides
a systematic connection between conventional model-based iterative algorithms and modern data-based
deep learning. Unfolded algorithms, which are powered by data learning, have shown remarkable
performance and convergence speed improvement over original algorithms. Despite their potential,
most existing unfolded algorithms are strictly confined to a fixed number of iterations when layer-dependent
parameters are used. In this study, we develop a novel framework for deep unfolding to overcome existing
limitations. Our development is based on an unfolded generalized expectation consistent signal
recovery (GEC-SR) algorithm, wherein damping factors are left for data-driven learning. In particular,
we introduce a hypernetwork to generate the damping factors for GEC-SR. Instead of learning a set
of optimal damping factors directly, the hypernetwork learns how to generate the optimal damping
factors according to the clinical settings, thereby ensuring its adaptivity to different scenarios.
To enable the hypernetwork to adapt to varying layer numbers, we use a recurrent architecture to
develop a dynamic hypernetwork that generates a damping factor that can vary online across layers.
We also exploit a self-attention mechanism to enhance the robustness of the hypernetwork. Extensive
experiments show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing ones in terms of convergence
speed and accuracy and still works well under very harsh settings, even under which many classical
PR algorithms are unstable.

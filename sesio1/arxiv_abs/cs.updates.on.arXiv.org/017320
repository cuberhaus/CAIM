Super-Resolution is the process of generating a high-resolution image from a low-resolution image.
A picture may be of lower resolution due to smaller spatial resolution, poor camera quality, as a
result of blurring, or due to other possible degradations. Super-Resolution is the technique to
improve the quality of a low-resolution photo by boosting its plausible resolution. The computer
vision community has extensively explored the area of Super-Resolution. However, the previous
Super-Resolution methods require vast amounts of data for training. This becomes problematic
in domains where very few low-resolution, high-resolution pairs might be available. One of such
areas is statistical downscaling, where super-resolution is increasingly being used to obtain
high-resolution climate information from low-resolution data. Acquiring high-resolution climate
data is extremely expensive and challenging. To reduce the cost of generating high-resolution
climate information, Super-Resolution algorithms should be able to train with a limited number
of low-resolution, high-resolution pairs. This paper tries to solve the aforementioned problem
by introducing a semi-supervised way to perform super-resolution that can generate sharp, high-resolution
images with as few as 500 paired examples. The proposed semi-supervised technique can be used as
a plug-and-play module with any supervised GAN-based Super-Resolution method to enhance its performance.
We quantitatively and qualitatively analyze the performance of the proposed model and compare
it with completely supervised methods as well as other unsupervised techniques. Comprehensive
evaluations show the superiority of our method over other methods on different metrics. We also
offer the applicability of our approach in statistical downscaling to obtain high-resolution
climate images.

Classification models are a fundamental component of physical-asset management technologies
such as structural health monitoring (SHM) systems and digital twins. Previous work introduced
\textit{risk-based active learning}, an online approach for the development of statistical classifiers
that takes into account the decision-support context in which they are applied. Decision-making
is considered by preferentially querying data labels according to \textit{expected value of perfect
information} (EVPI). Although several benefits are gained by adopting a risk-based active learning
approach, including improved decision-making performance, the algorithms suffer from issues
relating to sampling bias as a result of the guided querying process. This sampling bias ultimately
manifests as a decline in decision-making performance during the later stages of active learning,
which in turn corresponds to lost resource/utility. The current paper proposes two novel approaches
to counteract the effects of sampling bias: \textit{semi-supervised learning}, and \textit{discriminative
classification models}. These approaches are first visualised using a synthetic dataset, then
subsequently applied to an experimental case study, specifically, the Z24 Bridge dataset. The
semi-supervised learning approach is shown to have variable performance; with robustness to sampling
bias dependent on the suitability of the generative distributions selected for the model with respect
to each dataset. In contrast, the discriminative classifiers are shown to have excellent robustness
to the effects of sampling bias. Moreover, it was found that the number of inspections made during
a monitoring campaign, and therefore resource expenditure, could be reduced with the careful selection
of the statistical classifiers used within a decision-supporting monitoring system.

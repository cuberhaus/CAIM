In 1940s, Claude Shannon developed the information theory focusing on quantifying the maximum
data rate that can be supported by a communication channel. Guided by this, the main theme of wireless
system design up until 5G was the data rate maximization. In his theory, the semantic aspect and meaning
of messages were treated as largely irrelevant to communication. The classic theory started to
reveal its limitations in the modern era of machine intelligence, consisting of the synergy between
IoT and AI. By broadening the scope of the classic framework, in this article we present a view of semantic
communication (SemCom) and conveying meaning through the communication systems. We address three
communication modalities, human-to-human (H2H), human-to-machine (H2M), and machine-to-machine
(M2M) communications. The latter two, the main theme of the article, represent the paradigm shift
in communication and computing. H2M SemCom refers to semantic techniques for conveying meanings
understandable by both humans and machines so that they can interact. M2M SemCom refers to effectiveness
techniques for efficiently connecting machines such that they can effectively execute a specific
computation task in a wireless network. The first part of the article introduces SemCom principles
including encoding, system architecture, and layer-coupling and end-to-end design approaches.
The second part focuses on specific techniques for application areas of H2M (human and AI symbiosis,
recommendation, etc.) and M2M SemCom (distributed learning, split inference, etc.) Finally,
we discuss the knowledge graphs approach for designing SemCom systems. We believe that this comprehensive
introduction will provide a useful guide into the emerging area of SemCom that is expected to play
an important role in 6G featuring connected intelligence and integrated sensing, computing, communication,
and control.

Biological neural networks define the brain function and intelligence of humans and other mammals,
and form ultra-large, spatial, structured graphs. Their neuronal organization is closely interconnected
with the spatial organization of the brain's microvasculature, which supplies oxygen to the neurons
and builds a complementary spatial graph. This vasculature (or the vessel structure) plays an important
role in neuroscience; for example, the organization of (and changes to) vessel structure can represent
early signs of various pathologies, e.g. Alzheimer's disease or stroke. Recently, advances in
tissue clearing have enabled whole brain imaging and segmentation of the entirety of the mouse brain's
vasculature. Building on these advances in imaging, we are presenting an extendable dataset of
whole-brain vessel graphs based on specific imaging protocols. Specifically, we extract vascular
graphs using a refined graph extraction scheme leveraging the volume rendering engine Voreen and
provide them in an accessible and adaptable form through the OGB and PyTorch Geometric dataloaders.
Moreover, we benchmark numerous state-of-the-art graph learning algorithms on the biologically
relevant tasks of vessel prediction and vessel classification using the introduced vessel graph
dataset. Our work paves a path towards advancing graph learning research into the field of neuroscience.
Complementarily, the presented dataset raises challenging graph learning research questions
for the machine learning community, in terms of incorporating biological priors into learning
algorithms, or in scaling these algorithms to handle sparse,spatial graphs with millions of nodes
and edges. All datasets and code are available for download at https://github.com/jocpae/VesselGraph

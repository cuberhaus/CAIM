Electroencephalogram (EEG) based emotional analysis has been employed in medical science, security
and human-computer interaction with good success. In the recent past, deep learning-based approaches
have significantly improved the classification accuracy when compared to classical signal processing
and machine learning based frameworks. But most of them were subject-dependent studies which were
not able to generalize on the subject-independent tasks due to the inter-subject variability present
in EEG data. In this work, a novel deep learning framework capable of doing subject-independent
emotion recognition is presented, consisting of two parts. First, an unsupervised Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) with channel-attention autoencoder is proposed for getting a common latent vector
subspace i.e., intrinsic variables present in the EEG data of each individual. Secondly, a convolutional
neural network (CNN) with attention framework is presented for performing the task of subject-independent
emotion recognition on the encoded lower dimensional latent space representations obtained from
the proposed LSTM with channel-attention autoencoder. With the attention mechanism, the proposed
approach could highlight the significant time-segments of the EEG signal, which contributes to
the emotion under consideration as validated by the results. The proposed approach has been validated
using publicly available datasets for EEG signals such as DEAP dataset, SEED dataset and CHB-MIT
dataset. With the proposed methodology, average subject independent accuracies of 65.9%, 69.5%
for valence and arousal classification in the DEAP dataset and 76.7% for positive-negative classification
in SEED dataset are obtained. Further for the CHB-MIT dataset, average subject independent accuracies
of 69.1%, 67.6%, 72.3% for Pre-Ictal Vs Ictal, Inter-Ictal Vs Ictal, Pre-Ictal Vs Inter-Ictal classification
are obtained.

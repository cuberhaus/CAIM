In this paper, we propose a novel integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) transmission framework
based on the spatially-spread orthogonal time frequency space (SS-OTFS) modulation by considering
the fact that communication channel strengths cannot be directly obtained from radar sensing.
We first propose the concept of SS-OTFS modulation, where the key novelty is the angular domain discretization
enabled by the spatial-spreading/de-spreading. This discretization gives rise to simple and
insightful effective models for both radar sensing and communication, which result in simplified
designs for the related estimation and detection problems. In particular, we design simple beam
tracking, angle estimation, and power allocation schemes for radar sensing, by utilizing the special
structure of the effective radar sensing matrix. Meanwhile, we provide a detailed analysis on the
pair-wise error probability (PEP) for communication, which unveils the key conditions for both
precoding and power allocation designs. Based on those conditions, we design a symbol-wise precoding
scheme for communication based only on the delay, Doppler, and angle estimates from radar sensing,
without the a priori knowledge of the communication channel fading coefficients, and also introduce
the power allocation for communication. Furthermore, we notice that radar sensing and communication
requires different power allocations. Therefore, we discuss the performances of both the radar
sensing and communication with different power allocations and show that the power allocation
should be designed leaning towards radar sensing in practical scenarios. The effectiveness of
the proposed ISAC transmission framework is verified by our numerical results, which also agree
with our analysis and discussions.

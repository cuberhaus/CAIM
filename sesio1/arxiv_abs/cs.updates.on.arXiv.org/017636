Background. Pre-operative risk assessments used in clinical practice are limited in their ability
to identify risk for post-operative mortality. We hypothesize that electrocardiograms contain
hidden risk markers that can help prognosticate post-operative mortality. Methods. In a derivation
cohort of 45,969 pre-operative patients (age 59+- 19 years, 55 percent women), a deep learning algorithm
was developed to leverage waveform signals from pre-operative ECGs to discriminate post-operative
mortality. Model performance was assessed in a holdout internal test dataset and in two external
hospital cohorts and compared with the Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) score. Results. In the
derivation cohort, there were 1,452 deaths. The algorithm discriminates mortality with an AUC
of 0.83 (95% CI 0.79-0.87) surpassing the discrimination of the RCRI score with an AUC of 0.67 (CI
0.61-0.72) in the held out test cohort. Patients determined to be high risk by the deep learning model's
risk prediction had an unadjusted odds ratio (OR) of 8.83 (5.57-13.20) for post-operative mortality
as compared to an unadjusted OR of 2.08 (CI 0.77-3.50) for post-operative mortality for RCRI greater
than 2. The deep learning algorithm performed similarly for patients undergoing cardiac surgery
with an AUC of 0.85 (CI 0.77-0.92), non-cardiac surgery with an AUC of 0.83 (0.79-0.88), and catherization
or endoscopy suite procedures with an AUC of 0.76 (0.72-0.81). The algorithm similarly discriminated
risk for mortality in two separate external validation cohorts from independent healthcare systems
with AUCs of 0.79 (0.75-0.83) and 0.75 (0.74-0.76) respectively. Conclusion. The findings demonstrate
how a novel deep learning algorithm, applied to pre-operative ECGs, can improve discrimination
of post-operative mortality.

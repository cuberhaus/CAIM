In this work, a simulation model for the optimal control of dielectric elastomer actuated flexible
multibody dynamics systems is presented. The Dielectric Elastomer Actuator (DEA) behaves like
a flexible artificial muscles in soft robotics. It is modeled as an electromechanically coupled
geometrically exact beam, where the electric charges serve as control variables. The DEA-beam
is integrated as an actuator into multibody systems consisting of rigid and flexible components.
The model also represents contact interaction via unilateral constraints between the beam actuator
and e.g. a rigid body during the grasping process of a soft robot. Specifically for the DEA, a work
conjugated electric displacement and strain-like electric variables are derived for the Cosserat
beam. With a mathematically concise and physically representative formulation, a reduced free
energy function is developed for the beam-DEA. In the optimal control problem, an objective function
is minimized while the dynamic balance equations for the multibody system have to be fulfilled together
with the complementarity conditions for the contact and boundary conditions. The optimal control
problem is solved via a direct transcription method, transforming it into a constrained nonlinear
optimization problem. The beam is firstly semidiscretized with 1D finite elements and then the
multibody dynamics is temporally discretized with a variational integrator leading to the discrete
Euler-Lagrange equations, which are further reduced with the null space projection. The discrete
Euler-Lagrange equations and the boundary conditions serve as equality constraints, whereas
the contact constraints are treated as inequality constraints in the optimization of the discretized
objective. The effectiveness of the developed model is demonstrated by three numerical examples,
including a cantilever beam, a soft robotic worm and a soft grasper.

An adequate classification of proximal femur fractures from X-ray images is crucial for the treatment
choice and the patients' clinical outcome. We rely on the commonly used AO system, which describes
a hierarchical knowledge tree classifying the images into types and subtypes according to the fracture's
location and complexity. In this paper, we propose a method for the automatic classification of
proximal femur fractures into 3 and 7 AO classes based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). As
it is known, CNNs need large and representative datasets with reliable labels, which are hard to
collect for the application at hand. In this paper, we design a curriculum learning (CL) approach
that improves over the basic CNNs performance under such conditions. Our novel formulation reunites
three curriculum strategies: individually weighting training samples, reordering the training
set, and sampling subsets of data. The core of these strategies is a scoring function ranking the
training samples. We define two novel scoring functions: one from domain-specific prior knowledge
and an original self-paced uncertainty score. We perform experiments on a clinical dataset of proximal
femur radiographs. The curriculum improves proximal femur fracture classification up to the performance
of experienced trauma surgeons. The best curriculum method reorders the training set based on prior
knowledge resulting into a classification improvement of 15%. Using the publicly available MNIST
dataset, we further discuss and demonstrate the benefits of our unified CL formulation for three
controlled and challenging digit recognition scenarios: with limited amounts of data, under class-imbalance,
and in the presence of label noise. The code of our work is available at: https://github.com/ameliajimenez/curriculum-learning-prior-uncertainty.

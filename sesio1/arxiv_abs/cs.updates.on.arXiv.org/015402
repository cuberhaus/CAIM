Machine learning methods exploiting multi-parametric biomarkers, especially based on neuroimaging,
have huge potential to improve early diagnosis of dementia and to predict which individuals are
at-risk of developing dementia. To benchmark algorithms in the field of machine learning and neuroimaging
in dementia and assess their potential for use in clinical practice and clinical trials, seven grand
challenges have been organized in the last decade: MIRIAD, Alzheimer's Disease Big Data DREAM,
CADDementia, Machine Learning Challenge, MCI Neuroimaging, TADPOLE, and the Predictive Analytics
Competition. Based on two challenge evaluation frameworks, we analyzed how these grand challenges
are complementing each other regarding research questions, datasets, validation approaches,
results and impact. The seven grand challenges addressed questions related to screening, diagnosis,
prediction and monitoring in (pre-clinical) dementia. There was little overlap in clinical questions,
tasks and performance metrics. Whereas this has the advantage of providing insight on a broad range
of questions, it also limits the validation of results across challenges. In general, winning algorithms
performed rigorous data pre-processing and combined a wide range of input features. Despite high
state-of-the-art performances, most of the methods evaluated by the challenges are not clinically
used. To increase impact, future challenges could pay more attention to statistical analysis of
which factors (i.e., features, models) relate to higher performance, to clinical questions beyond
Alzheimer's disease, and to using testing data beyond the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.
Given the potential and lessons learned in the past ten years, we are excited by the prospects of grand
challenges in machine learning and neuroimaging for the next ten years and beyond.

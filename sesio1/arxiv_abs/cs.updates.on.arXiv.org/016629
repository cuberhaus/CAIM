We develop a new four-phase tumor growth model with angiogenesis, derived from a diffuse-interface
mixture model composed by a viable, a necrotic, a liquid and an angiogenetic component, coupled
with two massless chemicals representing a perfectly diluted nutrient and an angiogenetic factor.
This model is derived from variational principles complying with the second law of thermodynamics
in isothermal situations, starting from biological constitutive assumptions on the tumor cells
adhesion properties and on the infiltrative mechanics of tumor-induced vasculature in the tumor
tissues, and takes the form of a coupled degenerate Cahn-Hilliard Keller-Segel system for the mixture
components with reaction diffusion equations for the chemicals. The model is informed by neuroimaging
data, which give informations about the patient-specific brain geometry and tissues microstructure,
the distribution of the different tumor components, the white matter fiber orientations and the
vasculature density. We describe specific and robust preprocessing steps to extract quantitative
informations from the neuroimaging data and to construct a computational platform to solve the
model on a patient-specific basis. We introduce a finite element approximation of the model which
preserve the qualitative properties of the continuous solutions. Finally, we show simulation
results for the patient-specific tumor evolution of a patient affected by GlioBlastoma Multiforme,
considering two different test cases before surgery, corresponding to situations with high or
low nutrient supply inside the tumor, and a test case after surgery. We show that our model correctly
predicts the overall extension of the tumor distribution and the intensity of the angiogenetic
process, paving the way for assisting the clinicians in properly assessing the therapy outcomes
and in designing optimal patient-specific therapeutic schedules.

Given a partial differential equation (PDE), goal-oriented error estimation allows us to understand
how errors in a diagnostic quantity of interest (QoI), or goal, occur and accumulate in a numerical
approximation, for example using the finite element method. By decomposing the error estimates
into contributions from individual elements, it is possible to formulate adaptation methods,
which modify the mesh with the objective of minimising the resulting QoI error. However, the standard
error estimate formulation involves the true adjoint solution, which is unknown in practice. As
such, it is common practice to approximate it with an 'enriched' approximation (e.g. in a higher
order space or on a refined mesh). Doing so generally results in a significant increase in computational
cost, which can be a bottleneck compromising the competitiveness of (goal-oriented) adaptive
simulations. The central idea of this paper is to develop a "data-driven" goal-oriented mesh adaptation
approach through the selective replacement of the expensive error estimation step with an appropriately
configured and trained neural network. In doing so, the error estimator may be obtained without
even constructing the enriched spaces. An element-by-element construction is employed here,
whereby local values of various parameters related to the mesh geometry and underlying problem
physics are taken as inputs, and the corresponding contribution to the error estimator is taken
as output. We demonstrate that this approach is able to obtain the same accuracy with a reduced computational
cost, for adaptive mesh test cases related to flow around tidal turbines, which interact via their
downstream wakes, and where the overall power output of the farm is taken as the QoI. Moreover, we
demonstrate that the element-by-element approach implies reasonably low training costs.

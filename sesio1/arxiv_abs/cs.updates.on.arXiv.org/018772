We study the problem of allocating indivisible goods among $n$ agents with the objective of maximizing
Nash social welfare (NSW). This welfare function is defined as the geometric mean of the agents'
valuations and, hence, it strikes a balance between the extremes of social welfare (arithmetic
mean) and egalitarian welfare (max-min value). Nash social welfare has been extensively studied
in recent years for various valuation classes. In particular, a notable negative result is known
when the agents' valuations are complement-free and are specified via value queries: for XOS valuations,
one necessarily requires exponentially many value queries to find any sublinear (in $n$) approximation
for NSW. Indeed, this lower bound implies that stronger query models are needed for finding better
approximations. Towards this, we utilize demand oracles and XOS oracles; both of these query models
are standard and have been used in prior work on social welfare maximization with XOS valuations.
We develop the first sublinear approximation algorithm for maximizing Nash social welfare under
XOS valuations, specified via demand and XOS oracles. Hence, this work breaks the $O(n)$-approximation
barrier for NSW maximization under XOS valuations. We obtain this result by developing a novel connection
between NSW and social welfare under a capped version of the agents' valuations. In addition to this
insight, which might be of independent interest, this work relies on an intricate combination of
multiple technical ideas, including the use of repeated matchings and the discrete moving knife
method. In addition, we partially complement the algorithmic result by showing that, under XOS
valuations, an exponential number of demand and XOS queries are necessarily required to approximate
NSW within a factor of $\left(1 - \frac{1}{e}\right)$.

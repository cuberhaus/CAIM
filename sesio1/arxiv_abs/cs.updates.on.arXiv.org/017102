Relative vehicle positioning methods can contribute to safer and more efficient autonomous driving
in the future by enabling collision avoidance and platooning applications. For full automation,
these applications require cm-level positioning accuracy and greater than 50 Hz update rate. Since
sensor-based methods (e.g., LIDAR, cameras) have not been able to reliably satisfy these requirements
under all conditions so far, complementary methods are sought. Recently, alternative methods
that use visible light communication (VLC) signals from vehicle head/tail LED lights for positioning
(VLP) have shown significant promise, attaining cm-level accuracy and near-kHz rate in realistic
driving scenarios. These methods estimate position in two steps: 1) Relative transmitter bearings
(angle) or ranges (distance) are measured based on received VLC signals, and 2) these measurements
are combined to estimate relative positions of transmitters (i.e., head/tail lights). In this
survey paper, we first review existing bearing/range measurement techniques and positioning
algorithms for vehicular VLP. Next, we formulate two new positioning algorithms: One based on consecutive
range measurements from a single receiver, and another one based on differential bearing measurements
from two receivers. We analyze the performance of all methods by deriving their respective Cramer-Rao
lower bounds on positioning accuracy (CRLB) and simulating them in realistic driving scenarios
with challenging noise and weather conditions. Our results show that VLP methods can indeed satisfy
the accuracy and rate requirements for localization in collision avoidance and platooning applications.
Finally, we discuss remaining open challenges that are faced for the deployment of VLP solutions
in the automotive sector.

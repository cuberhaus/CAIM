Online platforms have a wealth of data, run countless experiments and use industrial-scale algorithms
to optimize user experience. Despite this, many users seem to regret the time they spend on these
platforms. One possible explanation is that incentives are misaligned: platforms are not optimizing
for user happiness. We suggest the problem runs deeper, transcending the specific incentives of
any particular platform, and instead stems from a mistaken foundational assumption. To understand
what users want, platforms look at what users do. This is a kind of revealed-preference assumption
that is ubiquitous in user models. Yet research has demonstrated, and personal experience affirms,
that we often make choices in the moment that are inconsistent with what we actually want: we can choose
mindlessly or myopically, behaviors that feel entirely familiar on online platforms. In this work,
we develop a model of media consumption where users have inconsistent preferences. We consider
what happens when a platform that simply wants to maximize user utility is only able to observe behavioral
data in the form of user engagement. Our model produces phenomena related to overconsumption that
are familiar from everyday experience, but difficult to capture in traditional user interaction
models. A key ingredient is a formulation for how platforms determine what to show users: they optimize
over a large set of potential content (the content manifold) parametrized by underlying features
of the content. We show how the relationship between engagement and utility depends on the structure
of the content manifold, characterizing when engagement optimization leads to good utility outcomes.
By linking these effects to abstractions of platform design choices, our model thus creates a theoretical
framework and vocabulary in which to explore interactions between design, behavioral science,
and social media.

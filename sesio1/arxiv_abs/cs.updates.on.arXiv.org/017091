The implementation of automatic image registration is still difficult in various applications.
In this paper, an automatic image registration approach through line-support region segmentation
and geometrical outlier removal (ALRS-GOR) is proposed. This new approach is designed to address
the problems associated with the registration of images with affine deformations and inconsistent
content, such as remote sensing images with different spectral content or noise interference,
or map images with inconsistent annotations. To begin with, line-support regions, namely a straight
region whose points share roughly the same image gradient angle, are extracted to address the issues
of inconsistent content existing in images. To alleviate the incompleteness of line segments,
an iterative strategy with multi-resolution is employed to preserve global structures that are
masked at full resolution by image details or noise. Then, Geometrical Outlier Removal (GOR) is
developed to provide reliable feature point matching, which is based on affineinvariant geometrical
classifications for corresponding matches initialized by SIFT. The candidate outliers are selected
by comparing the disparity of accumulated classifications among all matches, instead of conventional
methods which only rely on local geometrical relations. Various image sets have been considered
in this paper for the evaluation of the proposed approach, including aerial images with simulated
affine deformations, remote sensing optical and synthetic aperture radar images taken at different
situations (multispectral, multisensor, and multitemporal), and map images with inconsistent
annotations. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method
over the existing approaches for the whole data set.

We study the joint active/passive beamforming and channel blocklength (CBL) allocation in a non-ideal
reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided ultra-reliable and low-latency communication
(URLLC) system. The considered scenario is a finite blocklength (FBL) regime and the problem is
solved by leveraging a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm named twin-delayed deep
deterministic policy gradient (TD3). First, assuming an industrial automation system with multiple
actuators, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and achievable rate in the FBL regime
are identified for each actuator in terms of the phase shift configuration matrix at the RIS. Next,
the joint active/passive beamforming and CBL optimization problem is formulated where the objective
is to maximize the total achievable FBL rate in all actuators, subject to non-linear amplitude response
at the RIS elements, BS transmit power budget, and total available CBL. Since the amplitude response
equality constraint is highly non-convex and non-linear, we resort to employing an actor-critic
policy gradient DRL algorithm based on TD3. The considered method relies on interacting RIS with
the industrial automation environment by taking actions which are the phase shifts at the RIS elements,
CBL variables, and BS beamforming to maximize the expected observed reward, i.e., the total FBL
rate. We assess the performance loss of the system when the RIS is non-ideal, i.e., with non-linear
amplitude response, and compare it with ideal RIS without impairments. The numerical results show
that optimizing the RIS phase shifts, BS beamforming, and CBL variables via the proposed TD3 method
is highly beneficial to improving the network total FBL rate as the proposed method with deterministic
policy outperforms conventional methods.

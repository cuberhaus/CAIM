Indoor thermal comfort immensely impacts the health and performance of occupants. Therefore,
researchers and engineers have proposed numerous computational models to estimate thermal comfort
(TC). Given the impetus toward energy efficiency, the current focus is on data-driven TC prediction
solutions that leverage state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) algorithms. However, an indoor
occupant's perception of indoor thermal comfort (TC) is subjective and multi-dimensional. Different
aspects of TC are represented by various standard metrics/scales viz., thermal sensation (TSV),
thermal comfort (TCV), and thermal preference (TPV). The current ML-based TC prediction solutions
adopt the Single-task Learning approach, i.e., one prediction model per metric. Consequently,
solutions often focus on only one TC metric. Moreover, when several metrics are considered, multiple
TC models for a single indoor space lead to conflicting predictions, making real-world deployment
infeasible. This work addresses these problems. With the vision toward energy conservation and
real-world application, naturally ventilated primary school classrooms are considered. First,
month-long field experiments are conducted in 5 schools and 14 classrooms, including 512 unique
student participants. Further, "DeepComfort," a Multi-task Learning inspired deep-learning
model is proposed. DeepComfort predicts multiple TC output metrics viz., TSV, TPV, and TCV, simultaneously,
through a single model. It demonstrates high F1-scores, Accuracy (>90%), and generalization capability
when validated on the ASHRAE-II database and the dataset created in this study. DeepComfort is also
shown to outperform 6 popular metric-specific single-task machine learning algorithms. To the
best of our knowledge, this work is the first application of Multi-task Learning to thermal comfort
prediction in classrooms.

Most visual scene understanding tasks in the field of computer vision involve identification of
the objects present in the scene. Image regions like hideouts, turns, & other obscured regions of
the scene also contain crucial information, for specific surveillance tasks. Task proposed in
this paper involves the design of an intelligent visual aid for identification of such locations
in an image, which has either the potential to create an imminent threat from an adversary or appear
as the target zones needing further investigation. Covert places (CGL) for hiding behind an occluding
object are concealed 3D locations, not detectable from the viewpoint (camera). Hence this involves
delineating specific image regions around the projections of outer boundary of the occluding objects,
as places to be accessed around the potential hideouts. CGL detection finds applications in military
counter-insurgency operations, surveillance with path planning for an exploratory robot. Given
an RGB image, the goal is to identify all CGLs in the 2D scene. Identification of such regions would
require knowledge about the 3D boundaries of obscuring items (pillars, furniture), their spatial
location with respect to the neighboring regions of the scene. We propose this as a novel task, termed
Covert Geo-Location (CGL) Detection. Classification of any region of an image as a CGL (as boundary
sub-segments of an occluding object that conceals the hideout) requires examining the 3D relation
between boundaries of occluding objects and their neighborhoods & surroundings. Our method successfully
extracts relevant depth features from a single RGB image and quantitatively yields significant
improvement over existing object detection and segmentation models adapted and trained for CGL
detection. We also introduce a novel hand-annotated CGL detection dataset containing 1.5K real-world
images for experimentation.

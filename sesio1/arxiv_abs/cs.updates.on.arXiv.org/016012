Keyphrase extraction from a given document is the task of automatically extracting salient phrases
that best describe the document. This paper proposes a novel unsupervised graph-based ranking
method to extract high-quality phrases from a given document. We obtain the contextualized embeddings
from pre-trained language models enriched with topic vectors from Latent Dirichlet Allocation
(LDA) to represent the candidate phrases and the document. We introduce a scoring mechanism for
the phrases using the information obtained from contextualized embeddings and the topic vectors.
The salient phrases are extracted using a ranking algorithm on an undirected graph constructed
for the given document. In the undirected graph, the nodes represent the phrases, and the edges between
the phrases represent the semantic relatedness between them, weighted by a score obtained from
the scoring mechanism. To demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method, we perform several experiments
on open source datasets in the science domain and observe that our novel method outperforms existing
unsupervised embedding based keyphrase extraction methods. For instance, on the SemEval2017
dataset, our method advances the F1 score from 0.2195 (EmbedRank) to 0.2819 at the top 10 extracted
keyphrases. Several variants of the proposed algorithm are investigated to determine their effect
on the quality of keyphrases. We further demonstrate the ability of our proposed method to collect
additional high-quality keyphrases that are not present in the document from external knowledge
bases like Wikipedia for enriching the document with newly discovered keyphrases. We evaluate
this step on a collection of annotated documents. The F1-score at the top 10 expanded keyphrases
is 0.60, indicating that our algorithm can also be used for 'concept' expansion using external knowledge.

Automatic segmentation of vertebral bodies (VBs) and intervertebral discs (IVDs) in 3D magnetic
resonance (MR) images is vital in diagnosing and treating spinal diseases. However, segmenting
the VBs and IVDs simultaneously is not trivial. Moreover, problems exist, including blurry segmentation
caused by anisotropy resolution, high computational cost, inter-class similarity and intra-class
variability, and data imbalances. We proposed a two-stage algorithm, named semi-supervised hybrid
spine network (SSHSNet), to address these problems by achieving accurate simultaneous VB and IVD
segmentation. In the first stage, we constructed a 2D semi-supervised DeepLabv3+ by using cross
pseudo supervision to obtain intra-slice features and coarse segmentation. In the second stage,
a 3D full-resolution patch-based DeepLabv3+ was built. This model can be used to extract inter-slice
information and combine the coarse segmentation and intra-slice features provided from the first
stage. Moreover, a cross tri-attention module was applied to compensate for the loss of inter-slice
and intra-slice information separately generated from 2D and 3D networks, thereby improving feature
representation ability and achieving satisfactory segmentation results. The proposed SSHSNet
was validated on a publicly available spine MR image dataset, and remarkable segmentation performance
was achieved. Moreover, results show that the proposed method has great potential in dealing with
the data imbalance problem. Based on previous reports, few studies have incorporated a semi-supervised
learning strategy with a cross attention mechanism for spine segmentation. Therefore, the proposed
method may provide a useful tool for spine segmentation and aid clinically in spinal disease diagnoses
and treatments. Codes are publicly available at: https://github.com/Meiyan88/SSHSNet.

Purpose: (1) To assess the performance of geometric deep learning (PointNet) in diagnosing glaucoma
from a single optical coherence tomography (OCT) 3D scan of the optic nerve head (ONH); (2) To compare
its performance to that obtained with a standard 3D convolutional neural network (CNN), and with
a gold-standard glaucoma parameter, i.e. retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness. Methods:
3D raster scans of the ONH were acquired with Spectralis OCT for 477 glaucoma and 2,296 non-glaucoma
subjects at the Singapore National Eye Centre. All volumes were automatically segmented using
deep learning to identify 7 major neural and connective tissues including the RNFL, the prelamina,
and the lamina cribrosa (LC). Each ONH was then represented as a 3D point cloud with 1,000 points chosen
randomly from all tissue boundaries. To simplify the problem, all ONH point clouds were aligned
with respect to the plane and center of Bruch's membrane opening. Geometric deep learning (PointNet)
was then used to provide a glaucoma diagnosis from a single OCT point cloud. The performance of our
approach was compared to that obtained with a 3D CNN, and with RNFL thickness. Results: PointNet
was able to provide a robust glaucoma diagnosis solely from the ONH represented as a 3D point cloud
(AUC=95%). The performance of PointNet was superior to that obtained with a standard 3D CNN (AUC=87%)
and with that obtained from RNFL thickness alone (AUC=80%). Discussion: We provide a proof-of-principle
for the application of geometric deep learning in the field of glaucoma. Our technique requires
significantly less information as input to perform better than a 3D CNN, and with an AUC superior
to that obtained from RNFL thickness alone. Geometric deep learning may have wide applicability
in the field of Ophthalmology.

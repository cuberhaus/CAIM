In this paper, we put forward secure network function computation over a directed acyclic network.
In such a network, a sink node is required to compute with zero error a target function of which the
inputs are generated as source messages at multiple source nodes, while a wiretapper, who can access
any one but not more than one wiretap set in a given collection of wiretap sets, is not allowed to obtain
any information about a security function of the source messages. The secure computing capacity
for the above model is defined as the maximum average number of times that the target function can
be securely computed with zero error at the sink node with the given collection of wiretap sets and
security function for one use of the network. The characterization of this capacity is in general
overwhelmingly difficult. In the current paper, we consider securely computing linear functions
with a wiretapper who can eavesdrop any subset of edges up to a certain size r, referred to as the security
level, with the security function being the identity function. We first prove an upper bound on the
secure computing capacity, which is applicable to arbitrary network topologies and arbitrary
security levels. When the security level r is equal to 0, our upper bound reduces to the computing
capacity without security consideration. We discover the surprising fact that for some models,
there is no penalty on the secure computing capacity compared with the computing capacity without
security consideration. We further obtain an equivalent expression of the upper bound by using
a graph-theoretic approach, and accordingly we develop an efficient approach for computing this
bound. Furthermore, we present a construction of linear function-computing secure network codes
and obtain a lower bound on the secure computing capacity.

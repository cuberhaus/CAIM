The paper presents a conceptual, multidimensional approach to understand the technological factors
that are assumed to or even have been proven to contribute to what has been coined as Zoom Fatigue (ZF)
or more generally Videoconferencing Fatigue (VCF). With the advent of the Covid-19 pandemic, the
usage of VC services has drastically increased, leading to more and more reports about the ZF or VCF
phenomenon. The paper is motivated by the fact that some of the media outlets initially starting
the debate on what Zoom fatigue is and how it can be avoided, as well as some of the scientific papers
addressing the topic, contain assumptions that are rather hypothetical and insufficiently underpinned
by scientific evidence. Most of these works are acknowledge the lacking evidence and partly suggest
directions for future research. This paper intends to deepen the survey of VC-technology-related
literature and to provide more existing evidence, where possible, while reviewing some of the already
provided support or evidence for certain causal hypotheses. The technological factors dimension
and its identified sub-dimensions presented in this paper are embedded within a more holistic four-dimensional
conceptual factors model describing the causes for ZF or VCF. The paper describing this overall
conceptual model is written by the same group of authors and currently under revision for an Open
Access Journal publication. The present paper expands on the technological factors dimension
descriptions provided in the overall model paper and provides more detailed analyzes and concepts
associated with how VC technology may affect users' perception, cognitive load, interaction and
communication, possibly leading to stress, exhaustion and fatigue. The paper currently is a living
document which will be expanded further with regard to the evidence for or against the impact of certain
technological factors.

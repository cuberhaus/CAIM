The goal of this work is to propose a robust, fast, and fully automatic method for personalized cranial
defect reconstruction and implant modeling. We propose a two-step deep learning-based method
using a modified U-Net architecture to perform the defect reconstruction, and a dedicated iterative
procedure to improve the implant geometry, followed by automatic generation of models ready for
3-D printing. We propose a cross-case augmentation based on imperfect image registration combining
cases from different datasets. We perform ablation studies regarding different augmentation
strategies and compare them to other state-of-the-art methods. We evaluate the method on three
datasets introduced during the AutoImplant 2021 challenge, organized jointly with the MICCAI
conference. We perform the quantitative evaluation using the Dice and boundary Dice coefficients,
and the Hausdorff distance. The average Dice coefficient, boundary Dice coefficient, and the 95th
percentile of Hausdorff distance are 0.91, 0.94, and 1.53 mm respectively. We perform an additional
qualitative evaluation by 3-D printing and visualization in mixed reality to confirm the implant's
usefulness. We propose a complete pipeline that enables one to create the cranial implant model
ready for 3-D printing. The described method is a greatly extended version of the method that scored
1st place in all AutoImplant 2021 challenge tasks. We freely release the source code, that together
with the open datasets, makes the results fully reproducible. The automatic reconstruction of
cranial defects may enable manufacturing personalized implants in a significantly shorter time,
possibly allowing one to perform the 3-D printing process directly during a given intervention.
Moreover, we show the usability of the defect reconstruction in mixed reality that may further reduce
the surgery time.

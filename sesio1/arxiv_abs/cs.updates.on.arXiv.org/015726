We study the online influence maximization (OIM) problem in social networks, where in multiple
rounds the learner repeatedly chooses seed nodes to generate cascades, observes the cascade feedback,
and gradually learns the best seeds that generate the largest cascade. We focus on two major challenges
in this paper. First, we work with node-level feedback instead of edge-level feedback. The edge-level
feedback reveals all edges that pass through information in a cascade, where the node-level feedback
only reveals the activated nodes with timestamps. The node-level feedback is arguably more realistic
since in practice it is relatively easy to observe who is influenced but very difficult to observe
from which relationship (edge) the influence comes from. Second, we use standard offline oracle
instead of offline pair-oracle. To compute a good seed set for the next round, an offline pair-oracle
finds the best seed set and the best parameters within the confidence region simultaneously, and
such an oracle is difficult to compute due to the combinatorial core of OIM problem. So we focus on
how to use the standard offline influence maximization oracle which finds the best seed set given
the edge parameters as input. In this paper, we resolve these challenges for the two most popular
diffusion models, the independent cascade (IC) and the linear threshold (LT) model. For the IC model,
the past research only achieves edge-level feedback, while we present the first $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$-regret
algorithm for the node-level feedback. Besides, the algorithm only invokes standard offline oracles.
For the LT model, a recent study only provides an OIM solution that meets the first challenge but still
requires a pair-oracle. In this paper, we apply a similar technique as in the IC model to replace the
pair-oracle with a standard oracle while maintaining $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$-regret.

With the enrichment of literature resources, researchers are facing the growing problem of information
explosion and knowledge overload. To help scholars retrieve literature and acquire knowledge
successfully, clarifying the semantic structure of the content in academic literature has become
the essential research question. In the research on identifying the structure function of chapters
in academic articles, only a few studies used the deep learning model and explored the optimization
for feature input. This limits the application, optimization potential of deep learning models
for the research task. This paper took articles of the ACL conference as the corpus. We employ the
traditional machine learning models and deep learning models to construct the classifiers based
on various feature input. Experimental results show that (1) Compared with the chapter content,
the chapter title is more conducive to identifying the structure function of academic articles.
(2) Relative position is a valuable feature for building traditional models. (3) Inspired by (2),
this paper further introduces contextual information into the deep learning models and achieved
significant results. Meanwhile, our models show good migration ability in the open test containing
200 sampled non-training samples. We also annotated the ACL main conference papers in recent five
years based on the best practice performing models and performed a time series analysis of the overall
corpus. This work explores and summarizes the practical features and models for this task through
multiple comparative experiments and provides a reference for related text classification tasks.
Finally, we indicate the limitations and shortcomings of the current model and the direction of
further optimization.

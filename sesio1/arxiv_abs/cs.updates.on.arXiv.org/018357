Computational catalysis and machine learning communities have made considerable progress in
developing machine learning models for catalyst discovery and design. Yet, a general machine learning
potential that spans the chemical space of catalysis is still out of reach. A significant hurdle
is obtaining access to training data across a wide range of materials. One important class of materials
where data is lacking are oxides, which inhibits models from studying the Oxygen Evolution Reaction
and oxide electrocatalysis more generally. To address this we developed the Open Catalyst 2022(OC22)
dataset, consisting of 62,521 Density Functional Theory (DFT) relaxations (~9,884,504 single
point calculations) across a range of oxide materials, coverages, and adsorbates (*H, *O, *N, *C,
*OOH, *OH, *OH2, *O2, *CO). We define generalized tasks to predict the total system energy that are
applicable across catalysis, develop baseline performance of several graph neural networks (SchNet,
DimeNet++, ForceNet, SpinConv, PaiNN, GemNet-dT, GemNet-OC), and provide pre-defined dataset
splits to establish clear benchmarks for future efforts. For all tasks, we study whether combining
datasets leads to better results, even if they contain different materials or adsorbates. Specifically,
we jointly train models on Open Catalyst 2020 (OC20) Dataset and OC22, or fine-tune pretrained OC20
models on OC22. In the most general task, GemNet-OC sees a ~32% improvement in energy predictions
through fine-tuning and a ~9% improvement in force predictions via joint training. Surprisingly,
joint training on both the OC20 and much smaller OC22 datasets also improves total energy predictions
on OC20 by ~19%. The dataset and baseline models are open sourced, and a public leaderboard will follow
to encourage continued community developments on the total energy tasks and data.

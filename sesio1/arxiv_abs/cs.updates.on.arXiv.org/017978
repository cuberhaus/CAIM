Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic allergic inflammatory condition of the esophagus
associated with elevated esophageal eosinophils. Second only to gastroesophageal reflux disease,
EoE is one of the leading causes of chronic refractory dysphagia in adults and children. EoE diagnosis
requires enumerating the density of esophageal eosinophils in esophageal biopsies, a somewhat
subjective task that is time-consuming, thus reducing the ability to process the complex tissue
structure. Previous artificial intelligence (AI) approaches that aimed to improve histology-based
diagnosis focused on recapitulating identification and quantification of the area of maximal
eosinophil density. However, this metric does not account for the distribution of eosinophils
or other histological features, over the whole slide image. Here, we developed an artificial intelligence
platform that infers local and spatial biomarkers based on semantic segmentation of intact eosinophils
and basal zone distributions. Besides the maximal density of eosinophils (referred to as Peak Eosinophil
Count [PEC]) and a maximal basal zone fraction, we identify two additional metrics that reflect
the distribution of eosinophils and basal zone fractions. This approach enables a decision support
system that predicts EoE activity and classifies the histological severity of EoE patients. We
utilized a cohort that includes 1066 biopsy slides from 400 subjects to validate the system's performance
and achieved a histological severity classification accuracy of 86.70%, sensitivity of 84.50%,
and specificity of 90.09%. Our approach highlights the importance of systematically analyzing
the distribution of biopsy features over the entire slide and paves the way towards a personalized
decision support system that will assist not only in counting cells but can also potentially improve
diagnosis and provide treatment prediction.

Wildfires pose a growing risk to public safety in regions like the western United States, and, historically,
electric power systems have ignited some of the most destructive wildfires. To reduce wildfire
ignition risks, power system operators preemptively de-energize high-risk power lines during
extreme wildfire conditions as part of "Public Safety Power Shutoff" (PSPS) events. While capable
of substantially reducing acute wildfire risks, PSPS events can also result in significant amounts
of load shedding as the partially de-energized system may not be able to supply all customer demands.
We investigate the extent to which infrastructure investments can support system operations during
PSPS events by enabling reduced load shedding and wildfire ignition risk. We consider the installation
of grid-scale batteries, solar PV, and line hardening or maintenance measures (e.g., undergrounding
or increased vegetation management). Optimally selecting the locations, types, and sizes of these
infrastructure investments requires considering the line de-energizations associated with
PSPS events. Accordingly, this paper proposes a multi-period optimization formulation that locates
and sizes infrastructure investments while simultaneously choosing line de-energizations to
minimize wildfire ignition risk and load shedding. The proposed formulation is evaluated using
two geolocated test cases along with realistic infrastructure investment parameters and actual
wildfire risk data from the US Geological Survey. We evaluate the performance of investment choices
by simulating de-energization decisions for the entire 2021 wildfire season with optimized infrastructure
placements. With investment decisions varying significantly for different test cases, budgets,
and operator priorities, the numerical results demonstrate the proposed formulation's value
in tailoring investment choices to different settings.

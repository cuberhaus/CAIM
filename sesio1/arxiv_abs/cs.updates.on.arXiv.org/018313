The problem of reconstructing evolutionary trees or phylogenies is of great interest in computational
biology. A popular model for this problem assumes that we are given the set of leaves (current species)
of an unknown binary tree and the results of `experiments' on triples of leaves (a,b,c), which return
the pair with the deepest least common ancestor. If the tree is assumed to be an ultrametric (i.e.,
all root-leaf paths have the same length), the experiment can be equivalently seen to return the
closest pair of leaves. In this model, efficient algorithms are known for tree reconstruction.
In reality, since the data on which these `experiments' are run is itself generated by the stochastic
process of evolution, these experiments are noisy. In all reasonable models of evolution, if the
branches leading to the leaves in a triple separate from each other at common ancestors that are very
close to each other in the tree, the result of the experiment should be close to uniformly random.
Motivated by this, we consider a model where the noise on any triple is just dependent on the three
pairwise distances (referred to as distance based noise). Our results are the following: 1. Suppose
the length of every edge in the unknown tree is at least $\tilde{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt n})$ fraction
of the length of a root-leaf path. Then, we give an efficient algorithm to reconstruct the topology
of the tree for a broad family of distance-based noise models. Further, we show that if the edges are
asymptotically shorter, then topology reconstruction is information-theoretically impossible.
2. Further, for a specific distance-based noise model--which we refer to as the homogeneous noise
model--we show that the edge weights can also be approximately reconstructed under the same quantitative
lower bound on the edge lengths.

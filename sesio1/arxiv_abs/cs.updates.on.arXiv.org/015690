Energy research is of crucial public importance but the use of computer science technologies like
automatic text processing and data management for the energy domain is still rare. Employing these
technologies in the energy domain will be a significant contribution to the interdisciplinary
topic of ``energy informatics", just like the related progress within the interdisciplinary area
of ``bioinformatics". In this paper, we present the architecture of a Web-based semantic system
called EneMonIE (Energy Monitoring through Information Extraction) for monitoring up-to-date
energy trends through the use of automatic, continuous, and guided information extraction from
diverse types of media available on the Web. The types of media handled by the system will include
online news articles, social media texts, online news videos, and open-access scholarly papers
and technical reports as well as various numeric energy data made publicly available by energy organizations.
The system will utilize and contribute to the energy-related ontologies and its ultimate form will
comprise components for (i) text categorization, (ii) named entity recognition, (iii) temporal
expression extraction, (iv) event extraction, (v) social network construction, (vi) sentiment
analysis, (vii) information fusion and summarization, (viii) media interlinking, and (ix) Web-based
information retrieval and visualization. Wits its diverse data sources, automatic text processing
capabilities, and presentation facilities open for public use; EneMonIE will be an important source
of distilled and concise information for decision-makers including energy generation, transmission,
and distribution system operators, energy research centres, related investors and entrepreneurs
as well as for academicians, students, other individuals interested in the pace of energy events
and technologies.

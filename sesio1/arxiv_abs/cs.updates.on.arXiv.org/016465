Purpose: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data acquired through resting-state studies
have been used to obtain information about the spontaneous activations inside the brain. One of
the approaches for analysis and interpretation of resting-state fMRI data require spatially and
functionally homogenous parcellation of the whole brain based on underlying temporal fluctuations.
Clustering is often used to generate functional parcellation. However, major clustering algorithms,
when used for fMRI data, have their limitations. Among commonly used parcellation schemes, a tradeoff
exists between intra-cluster functional similarity and alignment with anatomical regions. Approach:
In this work, we present a clustering algorithm for resting state and task fMRI data which is developed
to obtain brain parcellations that show high structural and functional homogeneity. The clustering
is performed by multistage binary k-means clustering algorithm designed specifically for the
4D fMRI data. The results from this multistage k-means algorithm show that by modifying and combining
different algorithms, we can take advantage of the strengths of different techniques while overcoming
their limitations. Results: The clustering output for resting state fMRI data using the multistage
k-means approach is shown to be better than simple k-means or functional atlas in terms of spatial
and functional homogeneity. The clusters also correspond to commonly identifiable brain networks.
For task fMRI, the clustering output can identify primary and secondary activation regions and
provide information about the varying hemodynamic response across different brain regions. Conclusion:
The multistage k-means approach can provide functional parcellations of the brain using resting
state fMRI data. The method is model-free and is data driven which can be applied to both resting state
and task fMRI.

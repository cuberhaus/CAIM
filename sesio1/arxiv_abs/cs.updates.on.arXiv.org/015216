The development of accurate methods for multi-label classification (MLC) of remote sensing (RS)
images is one of the most important research topics in RS. Methods based on Deep Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) have shown strong performance gains in RS MLC problems. However, CNN-based methods
usually require a high number of reliable training images annotated by multiple land-cover class
labels. Collecting such data is time-consuming and costly. To address this problem, the publicly
available thematic products, which can include noisy labels, can be used to annotate RS images with
zero-labeling cost. However, multi-label noise (which can be associated with wrong and missing
label annotations) can distort the learning process of the MLC algorithm. The detection and correction
of label noise are challenging tasks, especially in a multi-label scenario, where each image can
be associated with more than one label. To address this problem, we propose a novel noise robust collaborative
multi-label learning (RCML) method to alleviate the adverse effects of multi-label noise during
the training phase of the CNN model. RCML identifies, ranks and excludes noisy multi-labels in RS
images based on three main modules: 1) discrepancy module; 2) group lasso module; and 3) swap module.
The discrepancy module ensures that the two networks learn diverse features, while producing the
same predictions. The task of the group lasso module is to detect the potentially noisy labels assigned
to the multi-labeled training images, while the swap module task is devoted to exchanging the ranking
information between two networks. Unlike existing methods that make assumptions about the noise
distribution, our proposed RCML does not make any prior assumption about the type of noise in the
training set. Our code is publicly available online: this http URL

Estimating the rank of a corrupted data matrix is an important task in data analysis, most notably
for choosing the number of components in PCA. Significant progress on this task was achieved using
random matrix theory by characterizing the spectral properties of large noise matrices. However,
utilizing such tools is not straightforward when the data matrix consists of count random variables,
e.g., Poisson, in which case the noise can be heteroskedastic with an unknown variance in each entry.
In this work, we consider a Poisson random matrix with independent entries, and propose a simple
procedure termed \textit{biwhitening} for estimating the rank of the underlying signal matrix
(i.e., the Poisson parameter matrix) without any prior knowledge. Our approach is based on the key
observation that one can scale the rows and columns of the data matrix simultaneously so that the
spectrum of the corresponding noise agrees with the standard Marchenko-Pastur (MP) law, justifying
the use of the MP upper edge as a threshold for rank selection. Importantly, the required scaling
factors can be estimated directly from the observations by solving a matrix scaling problem via
the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm. Aside from the Poisson, our approach is extended to families of distributions
that satisfy a quadratic relation between the mean and the variance, such as the generalized Poisson,
binomial, negative binomial, gamma, and many others. This quadratic relation can also account
for missing entries in the data. We conduct numerical experiments that corroborate our theoretical
findings, and showcase the advantage of our approach for rank estimation in challenging regimes.
Furthermore, we demonstrate the favorable performance of our approach on several real datasets
of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), High-Throughput Chromosome Conformation Capture
(Hi-C), and document topic modeling.

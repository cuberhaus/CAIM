Driven by the fast development of Internet of Things (IoT) applications, tremendous data need to
be collected by sensors and passed to the servers for further process. As a promising solution, the
mobile crowd sensing (MCS) enables controllable sensing and transmission processes for multiple
types of data in a single device. To achieve the energy efficient MCS, the data sensing and transmission
over a long-term time duration should be designed accounting for the differentiated requirements
of IoT tasks including data size and delay tolerance. The said design is achieved by jointly optimizing
the sensing and transmission rates, which leads to a complex optimization problem due to the restraining
relationship between the controlling variables as well as the existence of busy time interval during
which no data can be sensed. To deal with such problem, a vital concept namely height is introduced,
based on which the classical string-pulling algorithms can be applied for obtaining the corresponding
optimal sensing and transmission rates. Therefore, the original rates optimization problem can
be converted to a searching problem for the optimal height. Based on the property of the objective
function, the upper and lower bounds of the area where the optimal height lies in are derived. The
whole searching area is further divided into a series of sub-areas due to the format change of the
objective function with the varying heights. Finally, the optimal height in each sub-area is obtained
based on the convexity of the objective function and the global optimal height is further determined
by comparing the local optimums. The above solving approach is further extended for the case with
limited data buffer capacity of the server. Simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance
of the proposed design.

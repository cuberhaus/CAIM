Deep Learning (DL) algorithms are becoming increasingly popular for the reconstruction of high-resolution
turbulent flows (aka super-resolution). However, current DL approaches perform spatially uniform
super-resolution - a key performance limiter for scalability of DL-based surrogates for Computational
Fluid Dynamics (CFD). To address the above challenge, we introduce NUNet, a deep learning-based
adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) framework for non-uniform super-resolution of turbulent flows.
NUNet divides the input low-resolution flow field into patches, scores each patch, and predicts
their target resolution. As a result, it outputs a spatially non-uniform flow field, adaptively
refining regions of the fluid domain to achieve the target accuracy. We train NUNet with Reynolds-Averaged
Navier-Stokes (RANS) solutions from three different canonical flows, namely turbulent channel
flow, flat plate, and flow around ellipses. NUNet shows remarkable discerning properties, refining
areas with complex flow features, such as near-wall domains and the wake region in flow around solid
bodies, while leaving areas with smooth variations (such as the freestream) in the low-precision
range. Hence, NUNet demonstrates an excellent qualitative and quantitative alignment with the
traditional OpenFOAM AMR solver. Moreover, it reaches the same convergence guarantees as the AMR
solver while accelerating it by 3.2-5.5x, including unseen-during-training geometries and boundary
conditions, demonstrating its generalization capacities. Due to NUNet's ability to super-resolve
only regions of interest, it predicts the same target 1024x1024 spatial resolution 7-28.5x faster
than state-of-the-art DL methods and reduces the memory usage by 4.4-7.65x, showcasing improved
scalability.

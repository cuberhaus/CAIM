Social media has been known to be a hotbed of political and social communications and analyzing the
polarization of opinions has been gaining attention. In this study, we have proposed a measure for
quantifying polarization on social networks. The proposed metric, unlike state-of-the-art methods,
does not assume a two-opinion scenario and applies to multiple opinions. Our metric was tested on
both binary opinion based benchmark networks as well as synthetically opinion-labeled social
networks with a multi-opinion scenario and varying degrees of polarization. The metric showed
promising results for social networks with different levels of polarization. The method was then
employed to study polarization using data obtained from Twitter concerning the tri-opinion ("pro",
"anti" and "neutral") based communications regarding the implementation of the Citizenship Amendment
Act (CAA) in India. We have measured the polarization on a variety of social networks such as communication
networks based on retweets or mentions, a social relationships network based on follower-followee
connections and finally hybrid networks by combining the communication networks with the social
relationships network. The proposed method suggested a high level of polarization among the users
with respect to sharing posts on Twitter, thereby indicating the highly contentious nature of the
issue. We also obtained a high polarization score for a social relationships network. Thus indicating
the presence of homophily among users i.e. opinion on CAA is in-line with their social relationships
on the platform. For a retweet based hybrid network, the scores returned by our polarization metric
highlighted opinion to be the key driver in retweeting behaviour irrespective of the social relationships
among users. On the contrary, the mention based communications among the users were not polarized
in nature.

We intend to create a new risk assessment methodology that combines the best characteristics of
both risk score and machine learning models. More specifically, we aim to develop a method that,
besides having a good performance, offers a personalized model and outcome for each patient, presents
high interpretability, and incorporates an estimation of the prediction reliability which is
not usually available. By combining these features in the same approach we expect that it can boost
the confidence of physicians to use such a tool in their daily activity. In order to achieve the mentioned
goals, a three-step methodology was developed: several rules were created by dichotomizing risk
factors; such rules were trained with a machine learning classifier to predict the acceptance degree
of each rule (the probability that the rule is correct) for each patient; that information was combined
and used to compute the risk of mortality and the reliability of such prediction. The methodology
was applied to a dataset of patients admitted with any type of acute coronary syndromes (ACS), to
assess the 30-days all-cause mortality risk. The performance was compared with state-of-the-art
approaches: logistic regression (LR), artificial neural network (ANN), and clinical risk score
model (Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events - GRACE). The proposed approach achieved testing
results identical to the standard LR, but offers superior interpretability and personalization;
it also significantly outperforms the GRACE risk model and the standard ANN model. The calibration
curve also suggests a very good generalization ability of the obtained model as it approaches the
ideal curve. Finally, the reliability estimation of individual predictions presented a great
correlation with the misclassifications rate. Those properties may have a beneficial application
in other clinical scenarios as well. [abridged]

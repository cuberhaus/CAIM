This paper studies a fundamental problem regarding the security of blockchain PoW consensus on
how the existence of multiple misbehaving miners influences the profitability of selfish mining.
Each selfish miner (or attacker interchangeably) maintains a private chain and makes it public
opportunistically for acquiring more rewards incommensurate to his Hash power. We first establish
a general Markov chain model to characterize the state transition of public and private chains for
Basic Selfish Mining (BSM), and derive the stationary profitable threshold of Hash power in closed-form.
It reduces from 25% for a single attacker to below 21.48% for two symmetric attackers theoretically,
and further reduces to around 10% with eight symmetric attackers experimentally. We next explore
the profitable threshold when one of the attackers performs strategic mining based on Partially
Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) that only half of the attributes pertinent to a mining
state are observable to him. An online algorithm is presented to compute the nearly optimal policy
efficiently despite the large state space and high dimensional belief space. The strategic attacker
mines selfishly and more agilely than BSM attacker when his Hash power is relatively high, and mines
honestly otherwise, thus leading to a much lower profitable threshold. Last, we formulate a simple
model of absolute mining revenue that yields an interesting observation: selfish mining is never
profitable at the first difficulty adjustment period, but replying on the reimbursement of stationary
selfish mining gains in the future periods. The delay till being profitable of an attacker increases
with the decrease of his Hash power, making blockchain miners more cautious on performing selfish
mining.

Genome sequence analysis plays a pivotal role in enabling many medical and scientific advancements
in personalized medicine, outbreak tracing, and forensics. However, the analysis of genome sequencing
data is currently bottlenecked by the computational power and memory bandwidth limitations of
existing systems. In this dissertation, we propose four major works, where we characterize the
real-system behavior of the genome sequence analysis pipeline and its associated tools, expose
the bottlenecks and tradeoffs, and co-design fast and efficient algorithms along with scalable
and energy-efficient customized hardware accelerators for the key bottlenecks to enable faster
genome sequence analysis. First, we comprehensively analyze the tools in the genome assembly pipeline
for long reads in multiple dimensions, uncovering bottlenecks and tradeoffs that different combinations
of tools and different underlying systems lead to. Second, we propose GenASM, an acceleration framework
that builds upon bitvector-based approximate string matching to accelerate multiple steps of
the genome sequence analysis pipeline. We co-design our highly-parallel, scalable and memory-efficient
algorithms with low-power and area-efficient hardware accelerators. Third, we implement an FPGA-based
prototype for GenASM, where state-of-the-art 3D-stacked memory offers high memory bandwidth
and FPGA resources offer high parallelism. Fourth, we propose SeGraM, the first hardware acceleration
framework for sequence-to-graph mapping and alignment. We co-design algorithms and accelerators
for memory-efficient minimizer-based seeding and bitvector-based, highly-parallel sequence-to-graph
alignment. Overall, we demonstrate that genome sequence analysis can be accelerated by co-designing
scalable and energy-efficient customized accelerators along with efficient algorithms for the
key steps of genome sequence analysis.

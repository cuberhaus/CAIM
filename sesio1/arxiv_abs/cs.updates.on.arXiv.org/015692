Design optimization of mechanisms is a promising research area as it results in more energy-efficient
machines without compromising performance. However, machine builders do not actually use the
design methods described in the literature as these algorithms require too much theoretical analysis.
Moreover, the design synthesis approaches in the literature predominantly utilize heuristic
optimizers leading to suboptimal local minima. This research introduces a convenient optimization
workflow allowing wide industrial adoption, while guaranteeing to reveal the global optimum.
To guarantee that we find the global optimum, a mathematical expression of the constraints describing
the feasible region of possible designs is of great importance. Therefore, kinematic analysis
of the point-to-point (PTP) planar four-bar mechanism is discussed to obtain the static and dynamic
constraints. Within the feasible region, objective value samples are generated through CAD multi-body
software. These motion simulations determine the required torque to fulfill the movement for a
certain combination of design parameters. Sparse interpolation techniques allow minimizing
the required amount of samples and thus CAD simulations. Moreover, this interpolation of simulation
results enables the representation of the objective in a mathematical description without in-depth
analytical design analysis by the machine designer. Subsequently, the mathematical expression
of the objective allows global optimizers to find a global optimal design within the feasible design
space. In a case study of a coronaventilator mechanism with three design parameters (DP's), 1870
CAD motion simulations from which only 618 are used to build a model allowed to reduce the RMS torque
of the mechanism by 67%.

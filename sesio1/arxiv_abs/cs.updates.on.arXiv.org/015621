The potential of wearable robotics technology is undeniable. However, quantifying its value is
difficult. Various types of exoskeleton robots have already been developed and tested for upper
limb rehabilitation but, evaluations are not standardized, particularly in pediatric rehabilitation.
This paper proposes a methodology for the quantitative evaluation of upper limb exoskeletons that,
like a test bench, would serve for replicable testing. We determined the range of motion (ROM) and
joint torques using both kinematic modeling and experimental measurements (using sensors integrated
into Dynamixel actuators). The proposed test bench can provide an accurate range of motion (ROM)
and joint torques during the pronation-supination (PS) task. The range of motion obtained with
the physical prototype was approximately 156.26 +- 4.71{\deg} during the PS task, while it was approximately
146.84 +- 14.32{\deg} for the multibody model. The results show that the average range of experimental
torques (0.28 +- 0.06 N.m) was overestimated by 40% and just 3.4%, respectively, when compared to
the average range of simulated torques (0.2 +- 0.05 N.m) and to the highest range of simulated torques
(0.29 N.m). For the experimental measurements, test-retest reliability was excellent (0.96-0.98)
within sessions and excellent (0.93) or good (0.81-0.86) between sessions. Finally, the suggested
approach provides a ROM close to the normal ROM necessary during PS tasks. These results validate
the measurements' accuracy and underline the proposed methodology's relevance. The proposed
test bench could become a reference standard for evaluating exoskeletons. This study also addresses
a methodological aspect on the accurate assessment of joint torques that can serve in applications
such as the sizing of actuators in exoskeletons or the non-invasive evaluation of muscle forces
in the human body.

Purpose: Intra-Cardiac Echocardiography (ICE) is a powerful imaging modality for guiding cardiac
electrophysiology and structural heart interventions. ICE provides real-time observation of
anatomy and devices, while enabling direct monitoring of potential complications. In single operator
settings, the physician needs to switch back-and-forth between the ICE catheter and therapy device,
making continuous ICE support impossible. Two operators setup are therefore sometimes implemented,
with the challenge of increase room occupation and cost. Two operator setups are sometimes implemented,
but increase procedural costs and room occupation. Methods: ICE catheter robotic control system
is developed with automated catheter tip repositioning (i.e. view recovery) method, which can
reproduce important views previously navigated to and saved by the user. The performance of the
proposed method is demonstrated and evaluated in a combination of heart phantom and animal experiments.
Results: Automated ICE view recovery achieved catheter tip position accuracy of 2.09 +/-0.90 mm
and catheter image orientation accuracy of 3.93 +/- 2.07 degree in animal studies, and 0.67 +/- 0.79
mm and 0.37 +/- 0.19 degree in heart phantom studies, respectively. Our proposed method is also successfully
used during transeptal puncture in animals without complications, showing the possibility for
fluoro-less transeptal puncture with ICE catheter robot. Conclusion: Robotic ICE imaging has
the potential to provide precise and reproducible anatomical views, which can reduce overall execution
time, labor burden of procedures, and x-ray usage for a range of cardiac procedures. Keywords: Automated

Enterprise data typically involves multiple heterogeneous data sources and external data that
respectively record business activities, transactions, customer demographics, status, behaviors,
interactions and communications with the enterprise, and the consumption and feedback of its products,
services, production, marketing, operations, and management, etc. A critical challenge in enterprise
data science is to enable an effective whole-of-enterprise data understanding and data-driven
discovery and decision-making on all-round enterprise DNA. We introduce a neural encoder Table2Vec
for automated universal representation learning of entities such as customers from all-round
enterprise DNA with automated data characteristics analysis and data quality augmentation. The
learned universal representations serve as representative and benchmarkable enterprise data
genomes and can be used for enterprise-wide and domain-specific learning tasks. Table2Vec integrates
automated universal representation learning on low-quality enterprise data and downstream learning
tasks. We illustrate Table2Vec in characterizing all-round customer data DNA in an enterprise
on complex heterogeneous multi-relational big tables to build universal customer vector representations.
The learned universal representation of each customer is all-round, representative and benchmarkable
to support both enterprise-wide and domain-specific learning goals and tasks in enterprise data
science. Table2Vec significantly outperforms the existing shallow, boosting and deep learning
methods typically used for enterprise analytics. We further discuss the research opportunities,
directions and applications of automated universal enterprise representation and learning and
the learned enterprise data DNA for automated, all-purpose, whole-of-enterprise and ethical
machine learning and data science.

Due to the wide-ranging travel restrictions and lockdowns applied to limit the diffusion of the
SARS-CoV2 virus, the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had an immediate and significant
effect on human mobility at the global, national, and local levels. At the local level, bike-sharing
played a significant role in urban transport during the pandemic since riders could travel outdoors
with reduced infection risk. However, based on different data resources, this non-motorized mode
of transportation was still negatively affected by the pandemic (i.e., relative reduction in ridership).
This study has two objectives: 1) to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the numbers
and duration of trips conducted through a bike-sharing system -- the Capital Bikeshare in Washington,
DC, USA; and 2) to explore whether land use and household income in the nation's capital influence
the spatial variation of ridership during the pandemic. Towards realizing these objectives, this
research looks at the relationship between bike sharing and COVID-19 transmission as a two-directional
relationship rather than a one-directional causal relationship. Accordingly, this study models
i) the impact of COVID-19 infection numbers and rates on the use of the Capital Bikeshare system and
ii) the risk of COVID-19 transmission among individual bike-sharing users. In other words, we examine
i) the cyclist's behavior as a function of the COVID-19 transmission evolution in an urban environment
and ii) the possible relationship between the bike share usage and the COVID-19 transmission through
adopting a probabilistic contagion model. The findings show the risk of using a bike-sharing system
during the pandemic and whether bike sharing remains a healthier alternative mode of transportation
in terms of infection risk.

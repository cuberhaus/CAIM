A movement for a more transparent and decentralized Internet is globally attracting more attention.
People are becoming more privacy-aware of their online identities and data. The Internet is constantly
evolving. Web2 focused on companies that provide services in exchange for personal user data. Web3
commits to user-centricity using decentralization and zero-server architectures. The current
digital society demands a global change to empower citizens and take back control. Citizens are
locked into big-tech for personal data storage and their for-profit digital identity. Protection
of data has proven to be essential, especially due to increased home Internet traffic during the
COVID pandemic. Citizens do not possess their own travel documents. The European Commission aims
to transition this governmental property towards self-sovereign identity, introducing many
new opportunities. Citizens are locked into banks with non-portable IBAN accounts and unsustainable
legacy banking infrastructures. Migration to all-digital low-fraud infrastructures and healthier
competitive ecosystems is essential. The overall challenge is to return the power to citizens and
users again. The transition to a more decentralized Internet is the first crucial step in the realization
of user-centricity. This thesis presents the first exploratory study that integrates governmental-issued
travel documents into a (decentralized) societal infrastructure. These self-sovereign identities
form the authentic base to a private and secure transfer of money and data, and can effectively provide
trust in authenticity that is currently missing in online conversations. A fully operational zero-server
infrastructure that incorporates all our requirements has been developed for Android using the
P2P network overlay IPv8, and a personalized blockchain called TrustChain...

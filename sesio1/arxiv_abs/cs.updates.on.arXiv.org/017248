Process Industry (PI e.g. Steel, Metals, Chemicals, Cement, Asphalt, Ceramics) is one of the leading
sectors of the world economy, characterized however by intense environmental impact, and very
high energy consumption. In spite of a traditional low innovation pace in PI, in the recent years
a strong push at worldwide level towards the dual objective of improving the efficiency of plants
and the quality of products, significantly reducing the consumption of electricity and CO2 emissions
has taken momentum. Digital Technologies (namely Smart Embedded Systems, IoT, Data, AI and Edge-to-Cloud
Technologies) are enabling drivers for a Twin Digital-Green Transition, as well as foundations
for human centric, safe, comfortable and inclusive work places. Currently, digital sensors in
plants produce a large amount of data which in most cases constitutes just a potential and not a real
value for Process Industry, often locked-in in close proprietary systems and seldomly exploited.
Digital technologies, with process modelling-simulation via digital twins, can build a bridge
between the physical and the virtual worlds, bringing innovation with great efficiency and drastic
reduction of waste. In accordance with the guidelines of Industrie 4.0, the H2020 funded CAPRI project
aims to innovate the process industry, with a modular and scalable Reference Architecture, based
on open source software, which can be implemented both in brownfield and greenfield scenarios.
The ability to distribute processing between the edge, where the data is created, and the cloud,
where the greatest computational resources are available, facilitates the development of integrated
digital solutions with cognitive capabilities. The reference architecture is being validated
in the asphalt, steel & pharma pilot plants, allowing the development of integrated planning solutions,
with scheduling and control of the plants.

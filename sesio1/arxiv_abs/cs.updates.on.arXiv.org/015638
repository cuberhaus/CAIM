Shannon's Index of Difficulty ($ID$), reputable for quantifying the perceived difficulty of pointing
tasks as a logarithmic relationship between movement-amplitude ($A$) and target-width ($W$),
is used for modelling the corresponding observed movement-times ($MT_O$) in such tasks in controlled
experimental setup. However, real-life pointing tasks are both spatially and temporally uncontrolled,
being influenced by factors such as - human aspects, subjective behavior, the context of interaction,
the inherent speed-accuracy trade-off where, emphasizing accuracy compromises speed of interaction
and vice versa, and so on. Effective target-width ($W_e$) is considered as spatial adjustment for
compensating accuracy. However, no significant adjustment exists in the literature for compensating
speed in different contexts of interaction in these tasks. As a result, without any temporal adjustment,
the true difficulty of an uncontrolled pointing task may be inaccurately quantified using Shannon's
ID. To verify this, we propose the ANTASID (A Novel Temporal Adjustment to Shannon's ID) formulation
with detailed performance analysis. We hypothesized a temporal adjustment factor ($t$) as a binary
logarithm of $MT_O$, compensating for speed due to contextual differences and minimizing the non-linearity
between movement-amplitude and target-width. Considering spatial and/or temporal adjustments
to ID, we conducted regression analysis using our own and Benchmark datasets in both controlled
and uncontrolled scenarios of pointing tasks with a generic mouse.ANTASID formulation showed
significantly superior fitness values and throughput in all the scenarios while reducing the standard
error. Furthermore, the quantification of ID with ANTASID varied significantly compared to the
classical formulations of Shannon's ID, validating the purpose of this study.

The study of Markov processes and broadcasting on trees has deep connections to a variety of areas
including statistical physics, graphical models, phylogenetic reconstruction, MCMC algorithms,
and community detection in random graphs. Notably, the celebrated Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm
achieves optimal performance for the reconstruction problem of predicting the value of the Markov
process at the root of the tree from its values at the leaves. Recently, the analysis of low-degree
polynomials has emerged as a valuable tool for predicting computational-to-statistical gaps.
In this work, we investigate the performance of low-degree polynomials for the reconstruction
problem. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that there are simple tree models of fixed arity $d$ and growing
depth $\ell$ (so $N = 2^{\ell \log_2(d)}$ leaves) where (1) nontrivial reconstruction of the root
value is possible with a simple polynomial time algorithm and with robustness to noise, but not with
any polynomial of degree $2^{c \ell} = N^{c/\log_2(d)}$ for $c > 0$ a constant, and (2) when the tree
is unknown and given multiple samples with correlated root assignments, nontrivial reconstruction
of the root value is possible with a simple, noise-robust, and computationally efficient SQ algorithm
but not with any polynomial of degree $2^{c \ell}$. These results clarify limitations of low-degree
polynomials vs. polynomial time algorithms for Bayesian estimation problems. They also complement
recent work of Moitra, Mossel, and Sandon who studied the circuit complexity of Belief Propagation.
As a consequence of our main result, we show that for some $c' > 0$, $\exp(2^{c'\ell}) = \exp(N^{c'/\log_2(d)})$
many samples are needed for RBF kernel regression to obtain nontrivial correlation with the true
regression function (BP). We pose related open questions about low-degree polynomials and the
Kesten-Stigum threshold.

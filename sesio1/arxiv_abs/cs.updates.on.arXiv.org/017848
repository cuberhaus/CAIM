In e-commerce, online retailers are usually suffering from professional malicious users (PMUs),
who utilize negative reviews and low ratings to their consumed products on purpose to threaten the
retailers for illegal profits. Specifically, there are three challenges for PMU detection: 1)
professional malicious users do not conduct any abnormal or illegal interactions (they never concurrently
leave too many negative reviews and low ratings at the same time), and they conduct masking strategies
to disguise themselves. Therefore, conventional outlier detection methods are confused by their
masking strategies. 2) the PMU detection model should take both ratings and reviews into consideration,
which makes PMU detection a multi-modal problem. 3) there are no datasets with labels for professional
malicious users in public, which makes PMU detection an unsupervised learning problem. To this
end, we propose an unsupervised multi-modal learning model: MMD, which employs Metric learning
for professional Malicious users Detection with both ratings and reviews. MMD first utilizes a
modified RNN to project the informational review into a sentiment score, which jointly considers
the ratings and reviews. Then professional malicious user profiling (MUP) is proposed to catch
the sentiment gap between sentiment scores and ratings. MUP filters the users and builds a candidate
PMU set. We apply a metric learning-based clustering to learn a proper metric matrix for PMU detection.
Finally, we can utilize this metric and labeled users to detect PMUs. Specifically, we apply the
attention mechanism in metric learning to improve the model's performance. The extensive experiments
in four datasets demonstrate that our proposed method can solve this unsupervised detection problem.
Moreover, the performance of the state-of-the-art recommender models is enhanced by taking MMD
as a preprocessing stage.

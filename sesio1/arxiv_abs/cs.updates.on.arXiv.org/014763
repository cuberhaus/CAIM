In embryogenesis, epithelial cells, acting as individual entities or as coordinated aggregates
in a tissue, exhibit strong coupling between chemical signalling and mechanical responses to internally
or externally applied stresses. Intercellular communication in combination with such coordination
of morphogenetic movements can lead to drastic modifications in the calcium distribution in the
cells. In this paper we extend the recent mechanochemical model in [K. Kaouri, P.K. Maini, P.A. Skourides,
N. Christodoulou, S.J. Chapman. J. Math. Biol., 78 (2019) 2059--2092], for an epithelial continuum
in one dimension, to a more realistic multi-dimensional case. The resulting parametrised governing
equations consist of an advection-diffusion-reaction system for calcium signalling coupled
with active-stress linear viscoelasticity and equipped with pure Neumann boundary conditions.
We implement a mixed finite element method for the simulation of this complex multiphysics problem.
Special care is taken in the treatment of the stress-free boundary conditions for the viscoelasticity
in order to eliminate rigid motions from the space of admissible displacements. The stability and
solvability of the continuous weak formulation is shown using fixed-point theory. We investigate
numerically the solutions of this system and show that solitary waves and periodic wavetrains of
calcium propagate through the embryonic epithelial sheet. We analyse the bifurcations of the system
guided by the bifurcation analysis of the one-dimensional model. We also demonstrate the nucleation
of calcium sparks into synchronous calcium waves coupled with contraction. This coupled model
can be employed to gain insights into recent experimental observations in the context of embryogenesis,
but also in other biological systems such as cancer cells, wound healing, keratinocytes, or white
blood cells.

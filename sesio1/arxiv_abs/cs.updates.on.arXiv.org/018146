Network medicine has been pursued for Covid-19 drug repurposing. One such approach adopts structural
controllability, a theory for controlling a network (the cell). Motivated to protect the cell from
viral infections, we extended this theory to total controllability and introduced a new concept
of control hubs. Perturbation to any control hub renders the cell uncontrollable by exogenous stimuli,
e.g., viral infections, so control hubs are ideal drug targets. We developed an efficient algorithm
for finding all control hubs and applied it to the largest homogenous human protein-protein interaction
network. Our new method outperforms several popular gene-selection methods, including that based
on structural controllability. The final 65 druggable control hubs are enriched with functions
of cell proliferation, regulation of apoptosis, and responses to cellular stress and nutrient
levels, revealing critical pathways induced by SARS-CoV-2. These druggable control hubs led to
drugs in 4 major categories: antiviral and anti-inflammatory agents, drugs on central nerve systems,
and dietary supplements and hormones that boost immunity. Their functions also provided deep insights
into the therapeutic mechanisms of the drugs for Covid-19 therapy, making the new approach an explainable
drug repurposing method. A remarkable example is Fostamatinib that has been shown to lower mortality,
shorten the length of ICU stay, and reduce disease severity of hospitalized Covid-19 patients.
The drug targets 10 control hubs, 9 of which are kinases that play key roles in cell differentiation
and programmed death. One such kinase is RIPK1 that directly interacts with viral protein nsp12,
the RdRp of the virus. The study produced many control hubs that were not targets of existing drugs
but were enriched with proteins on membranes and the NF-$\kappa$B pathway, so are excellent candidate
targets for new drugs.

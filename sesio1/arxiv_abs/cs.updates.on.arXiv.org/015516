Image denoising is of vital importance in many imaging or computer vision related areas. With the
convolutional neural networks showing strong capability in computer vision tasks, the performance
of image denoising has also been brought up by CNN based methods. Though CNN based image denoisers
show promising results on this task, most of the current CNN based methods try to learn the mapping
from noisy image to clean image directly, which lacks the explicit exploration of prior knowledge
of images and noises. Natural images are observed to obey the reciprocal power law, implying the
low-frequency band of image tend to occupy most of the energy. Thus in the condition of AGWN (additive
gaussian white noise) deterioration, low-frequency band tend to preserve a higher PSNR than high-frequency
band. Considering the spatial morphological consistency of different frequency bands, low-frequency
band with more fidelity can be used as a guidance to refine the more contaminated high-frequency
bands. Based on this thought, we proposed a novel network architecture denoted as IGNet, in order
to refine the frequency bands from low to high in a progressive manner. Firstly, it decomposes the
feature maps into high- and low-frequency subbands using DWT (discrete wavelet transform) iteratively,
and then each low band features are used to refine the high band features. Finally, the refined feature
maps are processed by a decoder to recover the clean result. With this design, more inter-frequency
prior and information are utilized, thus the model size can be lightened while still perserves competitive
results. Experiments on several public datasets show that our model obtains competitive performance
comparing with other state-of-the-art methods yet with a lightweight structure.

Structural graph parameters, such as treewidth, pathwidth, and clique-width, are a central topic
of study in parameterized complexity. A main aim of research in this area is to understand the "price
of generality" of these widths: as we transition from more restrictive to more general notions,
which are the problems that see their complexity status deteriorate from fixed-parameter tractable
to intractable? This type of question is by now very well-studied, but, somewhat strikingly, the
algorithmic frontier between the two (arguably) most central width notions, treewidth and pathwidth,
is still not understood: currently, no natural graph problem is known to be W-hard for one but FPT
for the other. Indeed, a surprising development of the last few years has been the observation that
for many of the most paradigmatic problems, their complexities for the two parameters actually
coincide exactly, despite the fact that treewidth is a much more general parameter. It would thus
appear that the extra generality of treewidth over pathwidth often comes "for free". Our main contribution
in this paper is to uncover the first natural example where this generality comes with a high price.
We consider Grundy Coloring, a variation of coloring where one seeks to calculate the worst possible
coloring that could be assigned to a graph by a greedy First-Fit algorithm. We show that this well-studied
problem is FPT parameterized by pathwidth; however, it becomes significantly harder (W[1]-hard)
when parameterized by treewidth. Furthermore, we show that Grundy Coloring makes a second complexity
jump for more general widths, as it becomes para-NP-hard for clique-width. Hence, Grundy Coloring
nicely captures the complexity trade-offs between the three most well-studied parameters. Completing
the picture, we show that Grundy Coloring is FPT parameterized by modular-width.

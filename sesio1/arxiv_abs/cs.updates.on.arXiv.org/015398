In the field of deep learning, various architectures have been developed. However, most studies
are limited to specific tasks or datasets due to their fixed layer structure. This paper does not
express the structure delivering information as a network model but as a data structure called a
neuro tree(NT). And we propose two artificial association networks(AANs) designed to solve the
problems of existing networks by analyzing the structure of human neural networks. Defining the
starting and ending points of the path in a single graph is difficult, and a tree cannot express the
relationship among sibling nodes. On the contrary, an NT can express leaf and root nodes as the starting
and ending points of the path and the relationship among sibling nodes. Instead of using fixed sequence
layers, we create a neuro tree for each data and train AANs according to the tree's structure. AANs
are data-driven learning in which the number of convolutions varies according to the depth of the
tree. Moreover, AANs can simultaneously learn various types of datasets through the recursive
learning. Depth-first convolution (DFC) encodes the interaction result from leaf nodes to the
root node in a bottom-up approach, and depth-first deconvolution (DFD) decodes the interaction
result from the root node to the leaf nodes in a top-down approach. We conducted three experiments.
The first experiment verified whether it could be processed by combining AANs and feature extraction
networks. In the second, we compared the performance of networks that separately learned image,
sound, and tree, graph structure datasets with the performance simultaneously learned by connecting
these networks. In the third, we verified whether the output of AANs can embed all data in the NT. As
a result, AATs learned without significant performance degradation.

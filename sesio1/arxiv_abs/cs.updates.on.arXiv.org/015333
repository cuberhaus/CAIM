In recent years the sleeping model came to the focus of researchers. In this model nodes can go into
a sleep state in which they spend no energy but at the same time cannot receive or send messages, nor
can they perform internal computations. This model captures energy considerations of a problem.
A problem P is an O-LOCAL problem if, given an acyclic orientation on the edges of the input graph,
one can solve the problem as follows. Each vertex awaits the decisions of its parents according to
the given orientation and can make its own decision in regard to P using only the information about
its parents decisions. problems and showed that for this class of problems there is a deterministic
algorithm that runs in $O(\log \Delta)$ awake time. The clock round complexity of that algorithm
is $O(\Delta^2)$. In this work we offer three algorithms for the bf O-LOCAL class of problems with
a trade off between awake complexity and clock round complexity. One of these algorithms requires
only $O(\Delta^{1+\epsilon})$ clock rounds for some constant $\epsilon>0$ but still only $O(\log
\Delta)$ awake time which improves on the algorithm in \cite{BM21}. We add to this two other algorithms
that trade a higher awake complexity for lower clock round complexity. We note that the awake time
incurred is not that significant. We offer dynamic algorithms in the sleeping model. We show three
algorithms for solving dynamic problems in the O-LOCAL class as well as an algorithm for solving
any dynamic decidable problem. We show that one can solve any {\bf O-LOCAL} problem in constant awake
time in graphs with constant neighborhood independence. Specifically, our algorithm requires
$O(K)$ awake time where $K$ is the neighborhood independence of the input graph. Graphs with bounded
neighborhood independence are well studied with several results in recent years for several core
problem in the distributed setting.

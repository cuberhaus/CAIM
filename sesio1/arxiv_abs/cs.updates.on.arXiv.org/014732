Wikipedia has been turned into an immensely popular crowd-sourced encyclopedia for information
dissemination on numerous versatile topics in the form of subscription free content. It allows
anyone to contribute so that the articles remain comprehensive and updated. For enrichment of content
without compromising standards, the Wikipedia community enumerates a detailed set of guidelines,
which should be followed. Based on these, articles are categorized into several quality classes
by the Wikipedia editors with increasing adherence to guidelines. This quality assessment task
by editors is laborious as well as demands platform expertise. As a first objective, in this paper,
we study evolution of a Wikipedia article with respect to such quality scales. Our results show novel
non-intuitive patterns emerging from this exploration. As a second objective we attempt to develop
an automated data driven approach for the detection of the early signals influencing the quality
change of articles. We posit this as a change point detection problem whereby we represent an article
as a time series of consecutive revisions and encode every revision by a set of intuitive features.
Finally, various change point detection algorithms are used to efficiently and accurately detect
the future change points. We also perform various ablation studies to understand which group of
features are most effective in identifying the change points. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first work that rigorously explores English Wikipedia article quality life cycle from the
perspective of quality indicators and provides a novel unsupervised page level approach to detect
quality switch, which can help in automatic content monitoring in Wikipedia thus contributing
significantly to the CSCW community.

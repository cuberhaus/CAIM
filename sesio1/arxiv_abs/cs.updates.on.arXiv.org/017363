The advancements in peer-to-peer wireless power transfer (P2P-WPT) have empowered the portable
and mobile devices to wirelessly replenish their battery by directly interacting with other nearby
devices. The existing works unrealistically assume the users to exchange energy with any of the
users and at every such opportunity. However, due to the users' mobility, the inter-node meetings
in such opportunistic mobile networks vary, and P2P energy exchange in such scenarios remains uncertain.
Additionally, the social interests and interactions of the users influence their mobility as well
as the energy exchange between them. The existing P2P-WPT methods did not consider the joint problem
for energy exchange due to user's inevitable mobility, and the influence of sociality on the latter.
As a result of computing with imprecise information, the energy balance achieved by these works
at a slower rate as well as impaired by energy loss for the crowd. Motivated by this problem scenario,
in this work, we present a wireless crowd charging method, namely MoSaBa, which leverages mobility
prediction and social information for improved energy balancing. MoSaBa incorporates two dimensions
of social information, namely social context and social relationships, as additional features
for predicting contact opportunities. In this method, we explore the different pairs of peers such
that the energy balancing is achieved at a faster rate as well as the energy balance quality improves
in terms of maintaining low energy loss for the crowd. We justify the peer selection method in MoSaBa
by detailed performance evaluation. Compared to the existing state-of-the-art, the proposed
method achieves better performance trade-offs between energy-efficiency, energy balance quality
and convergence time.

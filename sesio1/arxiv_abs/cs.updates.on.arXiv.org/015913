The presented study elaborates a multi-server catastrophic retrial queueing model considering
preemptive repeat priority policy with phase-type (PH) distributed retrial times. For the sake
of comprehension, the scenario of model operation prior and later to the occurrence of the disaster
is referred to as the normal scenario and as the catastrophic scenario, respectively. In both scenarios,
the arrival and service processes of all types of calls follow marked Markovian arrival process
(MMAP) and PH distribution with distinct parameters, respectively. In the normal scenario, the
incoming heterogeneous calls are categorized as handoff calls and new calls. An arriving new call
will be blocked when all the channels are occupied, and consequently, will join the orbit (virtual
space) of infinite capacity. From the orbit, the blocked new call can either retry for the service
or exit the system following PH distribution. Whereas, an arriving handoff call is given preemptive
repeat priority over a new call in service when all the channels are occupied and at least one of the
channel is occupied with a new call otherwise the handoff call is dropped, and consequently, this
preempted new call will join the orbit. In the catastrophic scenario, when a disaster causes the
shut down of the entire system and failure of all functioning channels, a set of backup channels is
quickly deployed to restore services. The Markov chain's ergodicity criteria are established
by demonstrating that it belongs to the class of asymptotically quasi-Toeplitz Markov chains (AQTMC).
For the approximate computation of the stationary distribution, a new approach is developed. An
optimization problem to obtain optimal value of total number of backup channels has been formulated
and dealt by employing non dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) approach.

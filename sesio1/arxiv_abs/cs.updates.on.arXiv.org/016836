Caching at the wireless edge nodes is a promising way to boost the spatial and spectral efficiency,
for the sake of alleviating networks from content-related traffic. Coded caching originally introduced
by Maddah-Ali and Niesen significantly speeds up communication efficiency by transmitting multicast
messages simultaneously useful to multiple users. Most prior works on coded caching are based on
the assumption that each user may request all content in the library. However, in many applications
the users are interested only in a limited set of content that depends on their location. Motivated
by these considerations, this paper formulates the coded caching problem for location-based content
with edge cache nodes. The considered problem includes a content server with access to $N$ location-based
files (e.g., High-Definition maps), $K$ edge cache nodes located at different regions, and $K$
users (i.e., vehicles) each of which is in the serving region of one cache node and can retrieve the
cached content of this cache node with negligible cost. Depending on the location, each user only
requests a file from a location-dependent subset of the library. The objective is to minimize the
worst-case load. For this novel coded caching problem, we propose a highly non-trivial converse
bound under uncoded cache placement, which shows that a simple achievable scheme is optimal under
uncoded cache placement. In addition, this achievable scheme is also proved to be generally order
optimal within a factor of $3$. Finally, we extend the coded caching problem for location-based
content to the multiaccess coded caching topology originally proposed by Hachem et al., where each
user is connected to $L$ nearest cache nodes. When $L \geq 2$, we characterize the exact optimality
on the worst-case load.

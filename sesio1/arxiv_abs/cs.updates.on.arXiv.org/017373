The problem of scheduling unrelated machines has been studied since the inception of algorithmic
mechanism design \cite{NR99}. It is a resource allocation problem that entails assigning $m$ tasks
to $n$ machines for execution. Machines are regarded as strategic agents who may lie about their
execution costs so as to minimize their allocated workload. To address the situation when monetary
payment is not an option to compensate the machines' costs, \citeauthor{DBLP:journals/mst/Koutsoupias14}
[2014] devised two \textit{truthful} mechanisms, K and P respectively, that achieve an approximation
ratio of $\frac{n+1}{2}$ and $n$, for social cost minimization. In addition, no truthful mechanism
can achieve an approximation ratio better than $\frac{n+1}{2}$. Hence, mechanism K is optimal.
While approximation ratio provides a strong worst-case guarantee, it also limits us to a comprehensive
understanding of mechanism performance on various inputs. This paper investigates these two scheduling
mechanisms beyond the worst case. We first show that mechanism K achieves a smaller social cost than
mechanism P on every input. That is, mechanism K is pointwise better than mechanism P. Next, for each
task $j$, when machines' execution costs $t_i^j$ are independent and identically drawn from a task-specific
distribution $F^j(t)$, we show that the average-case approximation ratio of mechanism K converges
to a constant. This bound is tight for mechanism K. For a better understanding of this distribution
dependent constant, on the one hand, we estimate its value by plugging in a few common distributions;
on the other, we show that this converging bound improves a known bound \cite{DBLP:conf/aaai/Zhang18}
which only captures the single-task setting. Last, we find that the average-case approximation
ratio of mechanism P converges to the same constant.

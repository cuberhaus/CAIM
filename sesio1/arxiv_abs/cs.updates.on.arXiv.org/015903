Jet fires are relatively small and have the least severe effects among the diverse fire accidents
that can occur in industrial plants; however, they are usually involved in a process known as the
domino effect, that leads to more severe events, such as explosions or the initiation of another
fire, making the analysis of such fires an important part of risk analysis. This research work explores
the application of deep learning models in an alternative approach that uses the semantic segmentation
of jet fires flames to extract main geometrical attributes, relevant for fire risk assessments.
A comparison is made between traditional image processing methods and some state-of-the-art deep
learning models. It is found that the best approach is a deep learning architecture known as UNet,
along with its two improvements, Attention UNet and UNet++. The models are then used to segment a
group of vertical jet flames of varying pipe outlet diameters to extract their main geometrical
characteristics. Attention UNet obtained the best general performance in the approximation of
both height and area of the flames, while also showing a statistically significant difference between
it and UNet++. UNet obtained the best overall performance for the approximation of the lift-off
distances; however, there is not enough data to prove a statistically significant difference between
Attention UNet and UNet++. The only instance where UNet++ outperformed the other models, was while
obtaining the lift-off distances of the jet flames with 0.01275 m pipe outlet diameter. In general,
the explored models show good agreement between the experimental and predicted values for relatively
large turbulent propane jet flames, released in sonic and subsonic regimes; thus, making these
radiation zones segmentation models, a suitable approach for different jet flame risk management
scenarios.

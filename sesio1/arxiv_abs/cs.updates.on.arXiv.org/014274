Strawberries are widely appreciated for their aroma, bright red color, juicy texture, and sweetness.
They are, however, among the most sensitive fruits when it comes to the quality of the end product.
The recent commercial trends show a rising number of farmers who directly sell their products and
are interested in using smart solutions for a continuous quality control of the product. Cloud-based
approaches for smart irrigation have been widely used in the recent years. However, the network
traffic, security and regulatory challenges, which come hand in hand with sharing the crop data
with third parties outside the edge of the network, lead strawberry farmers and data owners to rely
on global clouds and potentially lose control over their data, which are usually transferred to
third party data centers. In this paper, we follow a three-step methodological approach in order
to design, implement and validate a solution for smart strawberry irrigation in greenhouses, while
keeping the corresponding data at the edge of the network: (i) We develop a small-scale smart irrigation
prototype solution with off-the-shelf hardware and software equipment, which we test and evaluate
on different kinds of plants in order to gain useful insights for larger scale deployments, (ii)
we introduce a reference network architecture, specifically targeting smart irrigation and edge
data distribution for strawberry greenhouses, and (iii) adopting the proposed reference architecture,
we implement a full-scale system in an actual strawberry greenhouse environment in Greece, and
we compare its performance against that of conventional strawberries irrigation. We show that
our design significantly outperforms the conventional approach, both in terms of soil moisture
variation and in terms of water consumption, and conclude by critically appraising the costs and
benefits of our approach in the agricultural industry.

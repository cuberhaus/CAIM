Crop type mapping at the field level is critical for a variety of applications in agricultural monitoring,
and satellite imagery is becoming an increasingly abundant and useful raw input from which to create
crop type maps. Still, in many regions crop type mapping with satellite data remains constrained
by a scarcity of field-level crop labels for training supervised classification models. When training
data is not available in one region, classifiers trained in similar regions can be transferred,
but shifts in the distribution of crop types as well as transformations of the features between regions
lead to reduced classification accuracy. We present a methodology that uses aggregate-level crop
statistics to correct the classifier by accounting for these two types of shifts. To adjust for shifts
in the crop type composition we present a scheme for properly reweighting the posterior probabilities
of each class that are output by the classifier. To adjust for shifts in features we propose a method
to estimate and remove linear shifts in the mean feature vector. We demonstrate that this methodology
leads to substantial improvements in overall classification accuracy when using Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA) to map crop types in Occitanie, France and in Western Province, Kenya. When using
LDA as our base classifier, we found that in France our methodology led to percent reductions in misclassifications
ranging from 2.8% to 42.2% (mean = 21.9%) over eleven different training departments, and in Kenya
the percent reductions in misclassification were 6.6%, 28.4%, and 42.7% for three training regions.
While our methodology was statistically motivated by the LDA classifier, it can be applied to any
type of classifier. As an example, we demonstrate its successful application to improve a Random
Forest classifier.

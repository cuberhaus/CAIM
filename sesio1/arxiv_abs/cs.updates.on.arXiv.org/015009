Massive Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications (mURLLC), which integrates URLLC with
massive access, is emerging as a new and important service class in the next generation (6G) for time-sensitive
traffics and has recently received tremendous research attention. However, realizing efficient,
delay-bounded, and reliable communications for a massive number of user equipments (UEs) in mURLLC,
is extremely challenging as it needs to simultaneously take into account the latency, reliability,
and massive access requirements. To support these requirements, the third generation partnership
project (3GPP) has introduced enhanced grant-free (GF) transmission in the uplink (UL), with multiple
active configured-grants (CGs) for URLLC UEs. With multiple CGs (MCG) for UL, UE can choose any of
these grants as soon as the data arrives. In addition, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has
been proposed to synergize with GF transmission to mitigate the serious transmission delay and
network congestion problems. In this paper, we develop a novel learning framework for MCG-GF-NOMA
systems with bursty traffic. We first design the MCG-GF-NOMA model by characterizing each CG using
the parameters: the number of contention-transmission units (CTUs), the starting slot of each
CG within a subframe, and the number of repetitions of each CG. Based on the model, the latency and
reliability performances are characterized. We then formulate the MCG-GF-NOMA resources configuration
problem taking into account three constraints. Finally, we propose a Cooperative Multi-Agent
based Double Deep Q-Network (CMA-DDQN) algorithm to allocate the channel resources among MCGs
so as to maximize the number of successful transmissions under the latency constraint. Our results
show that the MCG-GF-NOMA framework can simultaneously improve the low latency and high reliability
performances in massive URLLC.

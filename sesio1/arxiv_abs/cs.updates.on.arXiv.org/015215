This paper studies a variant of the Art Gallery problem in which the "walls" can be replaced by \emph{reflecting-edges},
which allows the guard to see further and thereby see a larger portion of the gallery. We study visibility
with specular and diffuse reflections. The number of times a ray can be reflected can be taken as a
parameter. The Art Gallery problem has two primary versions: point guarding and vertex guarding.
Both versions are proven to be NP-hard by Lee and Aggarwal. We show that several cases of the generalized
problem are NP-hard, too. We managed to do this by reducing the 3-SAT and the Subset-Sum problems
to the various cases of the generalized problem. We also illustrate that if $\cal P$ is a funnel or
a weak visibility polygon, the problem becomes more straightforward and can be solved in polynomial
time. We generalize the $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$-approximation ratio algorithm of the vertex guarding
problem to work in the presence of reflection. For a bounded $r$, the generalization gives a polynomial-time
algorithm with $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$-approximation ratio for several special cases of the generalized
problem. Furthermore, Chao Xu proved that although reflection helps the visibility of guards to
be expanded, similar to the normal guarding problem, even considering $r$ specular reflections
we may need $\lfloor \frac{n}{3} \rfloor$ guards to cover a simple polygon $\cal P$. In this article,
we prove that considering $r$ diffuse reflections the minimum number of vertex or boundary guards
required to cover $\cal P$ decreases to $\lceil \frac{\alpha}{1+ \lfloor \frac{r}{4} \rfloor}
\rceil$, where $\alpha$ indicates the minimum number of guards required to cover $\cal P$ without
reflection. funnel or a weak visibility polygon, then the problem becomes more straightforward
and can be solved in polynomial time.

Sequential recommendation based on multi-interest framework models the user's recent interaction
sequence into multiple different interest vectors, since a single low-dimensional vector cannot
fully represent the diversity of user interests. However, most existing models only intercept
users' recent interaction behaviors as training data, discarding a large amount of historical
interaction sequences. This may raise two issues. On the one hand, data reflecting multiple interests
of users is missing; on the other hand, the co-occurrence between items in historical user-item
interactions is not fully explored. To tackle the two issues, this paper proposes a novel sequential
recommendation model called "Global Interaction Aware Multi-Interest Framework for Sequential
Recommendation (GIMIRec)". Specifically, a global context extraction module is firstly proposed
without introducing any external information, which calculates a weighted co-occurrence matrix
based on the constrained co-occurrence number of each item pair and their time interval from the
historical interaction sequences of all users and then obtains the global context embedding of
each item by using a simplified graph convolution. Secondly, the time interval of each item pair
in the recent interaction sequence of each user is captured and combined with the global context
item embedding to get the personalized item embedding. Finally, a self-attention based multi-interest
framework is applied to learn the diverse interests of users for sequential recommendation. Extensive
experiments on the three real-world datasets of Amazon-Books, Taobao-Buy and Amazon-Hybrid show
that the performance of GIMIRec on the Recall, NDCG and Hit Rate indicators is significantly superior
to that of the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the proposed global context extraction module
can be easily transplanted to most sequential recommendation models.

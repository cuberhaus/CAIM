Aiming at facilitating a real-world, ever-evolving and scalable autonomous driving system, we
present a large-scale dataset for standardizing the evaluation of different self-supervised
and semi-supervised approaches by learning from raw data, which is the first and largest dataset
to date. Existing autonomous driving systems heavily rely on `perfect' visual perception models
(i.e., detection) trained using extensive annotated data to ensure safety. However, it is unrealistic
to elaborately label instances of all scenarios and circumstances (i.e., night, extreme weather,
cities) when deploying a robust autonomous driving system. Motivated by recent advances of self-supervised
and semi-supervised learning, a promising direction is to learn a robust detection model by collaboratively
exploiting large-scale unlabeled data and few labeled data. Existing datasets either provide
only a small amount of data or covers limited domains with full annotation, hindering the exploration
of large-scale pre-trained models. Here, we release a Large-Scale 2D Self/semi-supervised Object
Detection dataset for Autonomous driving, named as SODA10M, containing 10 million unlabeled images
and 20K images labeled with 6 representative object categories. To improve diversity, the images
are collected within 27833 driving hours under different weather conditions, periods and location
scenes of 32 different cities. We provide extensive experiments and deep analyses of existing popular
self/semi-supervised approaches, and give some interesting findings in autonomous driving scope.
Experiments show that SODA10M can serve as a promising pre-training dataset for different self-supervised
learning methods, which gives superior performance when fine-tuning with different downstream
tasks (i.e., detection, semantic/instance segmentation) in autonomous driving domain. More

Accurate segmentation of the liver is a prerequisite for the diagnosis of disease. Automated segmentation
is an important application of computer-aided detection and diagnosis of liver disease. In recent
years, automated processing of medical images has gained breakthroughs. However, the low contrast
of abdominal scan CT images and the complexity of liver morphology make accurate automatic segmentation
challenging. In this paper, we propose RA V-Net, which is an improved medical image automatic segmentation
model based on U-Net. It has the following three main innovations. CofRes Module (Composite Original
Feature Residual Module) is proposed. With more complex convolution layers and skip connections
to make it obtain a higher level of image feature extraction capability and prevent gradient disappearance
or explosion. AR Module (Attention Recovery Module) is proposed to reduce the computational effort
of the model. In addition, the spatial features between the data pixels of the encoding and decoding
modules are sensed by adjusting the channels and LSTM convolution. Finally, the image features
are effectively retained. CA Module (Channel Attention Module) is introduced, which used to extract
relevant channels with dependencies and strengthen them by matrix dot product, while weakening
irrelevant channels without dependencies. The purpose of channel attention is achieved. The attention
mechanism provided by LSTM convolution and CA Module are strong guarantees for the performance
of the neural network. The accuracy of U-Net network: 0.9862, precision: 0.9118, DSC: 0.8547, JSC:
0.82. The evaluation metrics of RA V-Net, accuracy: 0.9968, precision: 0.9597, DSC: 0.9654, JSC:
0.9414. The most representative metric for the segmentation effect is DSC, which improves 0.1107
over U-Net, and JSC improves 0.1214.

Wireless communication using electro-magnetic (EM) fields acts as the backbone for information
exchange among wearable devices around the human body. However, for Implanted devices, EM fields
incur high amount of absorption in the tissue, while alternative modes of transmission including
ultrasound, optical and magneto-electric methods result in large amount of transduction losses
due to conversion of one form of energy to another, thereby increasing the overall end-to-end energy
loss. To solve the challenge of powering and communication in a brain implant with low end-end channel
loss, we present Bi-Phasic Quasistatic Brain Communication (BP-QBC), achieving < 60dB worst-case
end-to-end channel loss at a channel length of 55mm, by avoiding the transduction losses during
field-modality conversion. BP-QBC utilizes dipole coupling based signal transmission within
the brain tissue using differential excitation in the transmitter and differential signal pick-up
at the receiver, and offers 41X lower power w.r.t. traditional Galvanic Human Body Communication
at a carrier frequency of 1MHz, by blocking any DC current paths through the brain tissue. Since the
electrical signal transfer through the human tissue is electro-quasistatic up to several 10's
of MHz range, BP-QBC allows a scalable (bps-10Mbps) duty-cycled uplink from the implant to an external
wearable. The power consumption in the BP-QBC TX is only 0.52uW at 1Mbps (with 1% duty cycling), which
is within the range of harvested body-coupled power in the downlink from an external wearable to
the brain implant. Furthermore, BP-QBC eliminates the need for sub-cranial repeaters, as it utilizes
quasi-static electrical signals, thereby avoiding any transduction losses. Such low end-to-end
channel loss with high data rates would find applications in neuroscience, brain-machine interfaces,
electroceuticals and connected healthcare.

In recent years, owing to the outstanding performance in graph representation learning, graph
neural network (GNN) techniques have gained considerable interests in many real-world scenarios,
such as recommender systems and social networks. In recommender systems, the main challenge is
to learn the effective user/item representations from their interactions. However, many recent
publications using GNNs for recommender systems cannot be directly compared, due to their difference
on datasets and evaluation metrics. Furthermore, many of them only provide a demo to conduct experiments
on small datasets, which is far away to be applied in real-world recommender systems. To address
this problem, we introduce Graph4Rec, a universal toolkit that unifies the paradigm to train GNN
models into the following parts: graphs input, random walk generation, ego graphs generation,
pairs generation and GNNs selection. From this training pipeline, one can easily establish his
own GNN model with a few configurations. Besides, we develop a large-scale graph engine and a parameter
server to support distributed GNN training. We conduct a systematic and comprehensive experiment
to compare the performance of different GNN models on several scenarios in different scale. Extensive
experiments are demonstrated to identify the key components of GNNs. We also try to figure out how
the sparse and dense parameters affect the performance of GNNs. Finally, we investigate methods
including negative sampling, ego graph construction order, and warm start strategy to find a more
effective and efficient GNNs practice on recommender systems. Our toolkit is based on PGL https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PGL
and the code is opened source in https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PGL/tree/main/apps/Graph4Rec.

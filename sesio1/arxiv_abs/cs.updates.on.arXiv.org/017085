Over the several decades, the space debris at LEO has grown rapidly which had caused a serious threat
to the operating satellite in an orbit. To avoid the risk of collision and protect the LEO environment,
the space robotics ADR concept has been continuously developed for over a decade to chase, capture,
and deorbit space debris. This paper presents the designed small satellite with dual robotic manipulators.
The small satellite is designed based on CubeSat standards, which uses commercially available
products in the market. In this paper, an approach is detailed for designing the controlled chase
and deorbit maneuver for a small satellite equipped with an RCS thruster. The maneuvers are comprised
of two phases, a. bringing the chaser satellite to the debris orbit and accelerating it to close proximity
of 1m to the debris object by using the low thrust RCS thruster, and b. Once captured, controlled deorbiting
it to 250 km of altitude. A Hohmann transfer concept is used to move our chaser satellite from the lower
orbit to the debris orbit by two impulsive burns. A number of the scenarios are simulated, where one
or more orbital elements are adjusted. For more than one orbital elements adjustment, the DAG law
and the Q law are utilized. These laws synthesize the three direction thrusts to the single thrust
force for the controlled maneuver. The $\Delta$V requirement at each maneuver is determined by
using the performance parameters of the RCS thruster intended for a small satellite. The results
show that, for long term simulation of a chaser satellite maneuver to debris object, an optimum DAG
law is most suitable than the Q law, as it can handle the singularity behavior of the orbital elements
caused due by adjustment of one or more elements more efficiently.

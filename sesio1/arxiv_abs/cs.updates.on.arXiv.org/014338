Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) may demonstrate racial bias when skin or choroidal pigmentation
is present in medical images. Recent studies have shown that convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
can predict race from images that were not previously thought to contain race-specific features.
We evaluate whether grayscale retinal vessel maps (RVMs) of patients screened for retinopathy
of prematurity (ROP) contain race-specific features. Methods: 4095 retinal fundus images (RFIs)
were collected from 245 Black and White infants. A U-Net generated RVMs from RFIs, which were subsequently
thresholded, binarized, or skeletonized. To determine whether RVM differences between Black
and White eyes were physiological, CNNs were trained to predict race from color RFIs, raw RVMs, and
thresholded, binarized, or skeletonized RVMs. Area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR)
was evaluated. Findings: CNNs predicted race from RFIs near perfectly (image-level AUC-PR: 0.999,
subject-level AUC-PR: 1.000). Raw RVMs were almost as informative as color RFIs (image-level AUC-PR:
0.938, subject-level AUC-PR: 0.995). Ultimately, CNNs were able to detect whether RFIs or RVMs
were from Black or White babies, regardless of whether images contained color, vessel segmentation
brightness differences were nullified, or vessel segmentation widths were normalized. Interpretation:
AI can detect race from grayscale RVMs that were not thought to contain racial information. Two potential
explanations for these findings are that: retinal vessels physiologically differ between Black
and White babies or the U-Net segments the retinal vasculature differently for various fundus pigmentations.
Either way, the implications remain the same: AI algorithms have potential to demonstrate racial
bias in practice, even when preliminary attempts to remove such information from the underlying
images appear to be successful.

How people think, feel, and behave, primarily is a representation of their personality characteristics.
By being conscious of personality characteristics of individuals whom we are dealing with or decided
to deal with, one can competently ameliorate the relationship, regardless of its type. With the
rise of Internet-based communication infrastructures (social networks, forums, etc.), a considerable
amount of human communications take place there. The most prominent tool in such communications,
is the language in written and spoken form that adroitly encodes all those essential personality
characteristics of individuals. Text-based Automatic Personality Prediction (APP) is the automated
forecasting of the personality of individuals based on the generated/exchanged text contents.
This paper presents a novel knowledge graph-enabled approach to text-based APP that relies on the
Big Five personality traits. To this end, given a text a knowledge graph which is a set of interlinked
descriptions of concepts, was built through matching the input text's concepts with DBpedia knowledge
base entries. Then, due to achieving more powerful representation the graph was enriched with the
DBpedia ontology, NRC Emotion Intensity Lexicon, and MRC psycholinguistic database information.
Afterwards, the knowledge graph which is now a knowledgeable alternative for the input text was
embedded to yield an embedding matrix. Finally, to perform personality predictions the resulting
embedding matrix was fed to four suggested deep learning models independently, which are based
on convolutional neural network (CNN), simple recurrent neural network (RNN), long short term
memory (LSTM) and bidirectional long short term memory (BiLSTM). The results indicated a considerable
improvements in prediction accuracies in all of the suggested classifiers.

In nuclear imaging, limited resolution causes partial volume effects (PVEs) that affect image
sharpness and quantitative accuracy. Partial volume correction (PVC) methods incorporating
high-resolution anatomical information from CT or MRI have been demonstrated to be effective.
However, such anatomical-guided methods typically require tedious image registration and segmentation
steps. Accurately segmented organ templates are also hard to obtain, particularly in cardiac SPECT
imaging, due to the lack of hybrid SPECT/CT scanners with high-end CT and associated motion artifacts.
Slight mis-registration/mis-segmentation would result in severe degradation in image quality
after PVC. In this work, we develop a deep-learning-based method for fast cardiac SPECT PVC without
anatomical information and associated organ segmentation. The proposed network involves a densely-connected
multi-dimensional dynamic mechanism, allowing the convolutional kernels to be adapted based
on the input images, even after the network is fully trained. Intramyocardial blood volume (IMBV)
is introduced as an additional clinical-relevant loss function for network optimization. The
proposed network demonstrated promising performance on 28 canine studies acquired on a GE Discovery
NM/CT 570c dedicated cardiac SPECT scanner with a 64-slice CT using Technetium-99m-labeled red
blood cells. This work showed that the proposed network with densely-connected dynamic mechanism
produced superior results compared with the same network without such mechanism. Results also
showed that the proposed network without anatomical information could produce images with statistically
comparable IMBV measurements to the images generated by anatomical-guided PVC methods, which
could be helpful in clinical translation.

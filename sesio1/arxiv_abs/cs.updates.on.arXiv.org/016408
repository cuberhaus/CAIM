Session-based recommendation (SBR) aims at predicting the next item for an ongoing anonymous session.
The major challenge of SBR is how to capture richer relations in between items and learn ID-based
item embeddings to capture such relations. Recent studies propose to first construct an item graph
from sessions and employ a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to encode item embedding from the graph. Although
such graph-based approaches have achieved performance improvements, their GNNs are not suitable
for ID-based embedding learning for the SBR task. In this paper, we argue that the objective of such
ID-based embedding learning is to capture a kind of \textit{neighborhood affinity} in that the
embedding of a node is similar to that of its neighbors' in the embedding space. We propose a new graph
neural network, called Graph Spring Network (GSN), for learning ID-based item embedding on an item
graph to optimize neighborhood affinity in the embedding space. Furthermore, we argue that even
stacking multiple GNN layers may not be enough to encode potential relations for two item nodes far-apart
in a graph. In this paper, we propose a strategy that first selects some informative item anchors
and then encode items' potential relations to such anchors. In summary, we propose a GSN-IAS model
(Graph Spring Network and Informative Anchor Selection) for the SBR task. We first construct an
item graph to describe items' co-occurrences in all sessions. We design the GSN for ID-based item
embedding learning and propose an \textit{item entropy} measure to select informative anchors.
We then design an unsupervised learning mechanism to encode items' relations to anchors. We next
employ a shared gated recurrent unit (GRU) network to learn two session representations and make
two next item predictions. Finally, we design an adaptive decision fusion strategy to fuse two predictions
to make the final recommendation.

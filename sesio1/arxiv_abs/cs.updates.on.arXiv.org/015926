In the standard Gaussian linear measurement model $Y=X\mu_0+\xi \in \mathbb{R}^m$ with a fixed
noise level $\sigma>0$, we consider the problem of estimating the unknown signal $\mu_0$ under
a convex constraint $\mu_0 \in K$, where $K$ is a closed convex set in $\mathbb{R}^n$. We show that
the risk of the natural convex constrained least squares estimator (LSE) $\hat{\mu}(\sigma)$
can be characterized exactly in high dimensional limits, by that of the convex constrained LSE $\hat{\mu}_K^{\mathsf{seq}}$
in the corresponding Gaussian sequence model at a different noise level. The characterization
holds (uniformly) for risks in the maximal regime that ranges from constant order all the way down
to essentially the parametric rate, as long as certain necessary non-degeneracy condition is satisfied
for $\hat{\mu}(\sigma)$. The precise risk characterization reveals a fundamental difference
between noiseless (or low noise limit) and noisy linear inverse problems in terms of the sample complexity
for signal recovery. A concrete example is given by the isotonic regression problem: While exact
recovery of a general monotone signal requires $m\gg n^{1/3}$ samples in the noiseless setting,
consistent signal recovery in the noisy setting requires as few as $m\gg \log n$ samples. Such a discrepancy
occurs when the low and high noise risk behavior of $\hat{\mu}_K^{\mathsf{seq}}$ differ significantly.
In statistical languages, this occurs when $\hat{\mu}_K^{\mathsf{seq}}$ estimates $0$ at a faster
`adaptation rate' than the slower `worst-case rate' for general signals. Several other examples,
including non-negative least squares and generalized Lasso (in constrained forms), are also worked
out to demonstrate the concrete applicability of the theory in problems of different types.

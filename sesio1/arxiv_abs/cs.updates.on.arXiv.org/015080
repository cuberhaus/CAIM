Vehicle classification is a hot computer vision topic, with studies ranging from ground-view up
to top-view imagery. In remote sensing, the usage of top-view images allows for understanding city
patterns, vehicle concentration, traffic management, and others. However, there are some difficulties
when aiming for pixel-wise classification: (a) most vehicle classification studies use object
detection methods, and most publicly available datasets are designed for this task, (b) creating
instance segmentation datasets is laborious, and (c) traditional instance segmentation methods
underperform on this task since the objects are small. Thus, the present research objectives are:
(1) propose a novel semi-supervised iterative learning approach using GIS software, (2) propose
a box-free instance segmentation approach, and (3) provide a city-scale vehicle dataset. The iterative
learning procedure considered: (1) label a small number of vehicles, (2) train on those samples,
(3) use the model to classify the entire image, (4) convert the image prediction into a polygon shapefile,
(5) correct some areas with errors and include them in the training data, and (6) repeat until results
are satisfactory. To separate instances, we considered vehicle interior and vehicle borders,
and the DL model was the U-net with the Efficient-net-B7 backbone. When removing the borders, the
vehicle interior becomes isolated, allowing for unique object identification. To recover the
deleted 1-pixel borders, we proposed a simple method to expand each prediction. The results show
better pixel-wise metrics when compared to the Mask-RCNN (82% against 67% in IoU). On per-object
analysis, the overall accuracy, precision, and recall were greater than 90%. This pipeline applies
to any remote sensing target, being very efficient for segmentation and generating datasets.

It is imperative for all stakeholders that digital forensics investigations produce reliable
results to ensure the field delivers a positive contribution to the pursuit of justice across the
globe. Some aspects of these investigations are inevitably contingent on trust, however this is
not always explicitly considered or critically evaluated. Erroneously treating features of the
investigation as trusted can be enormously damaging to the overall reliability of an investigations
findings as well as the confidence that external stakeholders can have in it. As an example, digital
crime scenes can be manipulated by tampering with the digital artefacts left on devices, yet recent
studies have shown that efforts to detect occurrences of this are rare and argue that this leaves
digital forensics investigations vulnerable to accusations of inaccuracy. In this paper a new
approach to digital forensics is considered based on the concept of Zero Trust, an increasingly
popular design in network security. Zero Trust describes the practitioner mindset and principles
upon which the reliance on trust in network components is eliminated in favour of dynamic verification
of network interactions. An initial definition of Zero Trust Digital Forensics will be proposed
and then a specific example considered showing how this strategy can be applied to digital forensic
investigations to mitigate against the specific risk of evidence tampering. A definition of Zero
Trust Digital Forensics is proposed, specifically that it is a strategy adopted by investigators
whereby each aspect of an investigation is assumed to be unreliable until verified. A new principle
will be introduced, namely the multifaceted verification of digital artefacts that can be used
by practitioners who wish to adopt a Zero Trust Digital Forensics strategy during their investigations...

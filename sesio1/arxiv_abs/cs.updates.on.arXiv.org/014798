Solid-State Drives (SSDs) have significant performance advantages over traditional Hard Disk
Drives (HDDs) such as lower latency and higher throughput. Significantly higher price per capacity
and limited lifetime, however, prevents designers to completely substitute HDDs by SSDs in enterprise
storage systems. SSD-based caching has recently been suggested for storage systems to benefit
from higher performance of SSDs while minimizing the overall cost. While conventional caching
algorithms such as Least Recently Used (LRU) provide high hit ratio in processors, due to the highly
random behavior of Input/Output (I/O) workloads, they hardly provide the required performance
level for storage systems. In addition to poor performance, inefficient algorithms also shorten
SSD lifetime with unnecessary cache replacements. Such shortcomings motivate us to benefit from
more complex non-linear algorithms to achieve higher cache performance and extend SSD lifetime.
In this paper, we propose RC-RNN, the first reconfigurable SSD-based cache architecture for storage
systems that utilizes machine learning to identify performance-critical data pages for I/O caching.
The proposed architecture uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to characterize ongoing workloads
and optimize itself towards higher cache performance while improving SSD lifetime. RC-RNN attempts
to learn characteristics of the running workload to predict its behavior and then uses the collected
information to identify performance-critical data pages to fetch into the cache. Experimental
results show that RC-RNN characterizes workloads with an accuracy up to 94.6% for SNIA I/O workloads.
RC-RNN can perform similarly to the optimal cache algorithm by an accuracy of 95% on average, and
outperforms previous SSD caching architectures by providing up to 7x higher hit ratio and decreasing
cache replacements by up to 2x.

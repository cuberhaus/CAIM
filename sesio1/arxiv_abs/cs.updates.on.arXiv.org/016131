The emerging technology of snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) enables capturing high dimensional
(HD) data in an efficient way. It is generally implemented by two components: an optical encoder
that compresses HD signals into a 2D measurement and an algorithm decoder that retrieves the HD data
upon the hardware-encoded measurement. Over a broad range of SCI applications, hyperspectral
imaging (HSI) and video compressive sensing have received significant research attention in recent
years. Among existing SCI reconstruction algorithms, deep learning-based methods stand out as
their promising performance and efficient inference. However, the deep reconstruction network
may suffer from overlarge model size and highly-specialized network design, which inevitably
lead to costly training time, high memory usage, and limited flexibility, thus discouraging the
deployments of SCI systems in practical scenarios. In this paper, we tackle the above challenges
by proposing a simple yet highly efficient reconstruction method, namely stacked residual network
(SRN), by revisiting the residual learning strategy with nested structures and spatial-invariant
property. The proposed SRN empowers high-fidelity data retrieval with fewer computation operations
and negligible model size compared with existing networks, and also serves as a versatile backbone
applicable for both hyperspectral and video data. Based on the proposed backbone, we first develop
the channel attention enhanced SRN (CAE-SRN) to explore the spectral inter-dependencies for fine-grained
spatial estimation in HSI. We then employ SRN as a deep denoiser and incorporate it into a generalized
alternating projection (GAP) framework -- resulting in GAP-SRN -- to handle the video compressive
sensing task. Experimental results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance, high computational
efficiency of the proposed SRN on two SCI applications.

This paper addresses the issue of the real-time tracking quality of moving objects in large-scale
video surveillance systems. During the tracking process, the system assigns an identifier or label
to each tracked object to distinguish it from other objects. In such a mission, it is essential to
keep this identifier for the same objects, whatever the area, the time of their appearance, or the
detecting camera. This is to conserve as much information about the tracking object as possible,
decrease the number of ID switching (ID-Sw), and increase the quality of object tracking. To accomplish
object labeling, a massive amount of data collected by the cameras must be searched to retrieve the
most similar (nearest neighbor) object identifier. Although this task is simple, it becomes very
complex in large-scale video surveillance networks, where the data becomes very large. In this
case, the label retrieval time increases significantly with this increase, which negatively affects
the performance of the real-time tracking system. To avoid such problems, we propose a new solution
to automatically label multiple objects for efficient real-time tracking using the indexing mechanism.
This mechanism organizes the metadata of the objects extracted during the detection and tracking
phase in an Adaptive BCCF-tree. The main advantage of this structure is: its ability to index massive
metadata generated by multi-cameras, its logarithmic search complexity, which implicitly reduces
the search response time, and its quality of research results, which ensure coherent labeling of
the tracked objects. The system load is distributed through a new Internet of Video Things infrastructure-based
architecture to improve data processing and real-time object tracking performance. The experimental
evaluation was conducted on a publicly available dataset generated by multi-camera containing
different crowd activities.

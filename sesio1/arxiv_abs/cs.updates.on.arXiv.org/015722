Lung nodule detection from 3D Computed Tomography scans plays a vital role in efficient lung cancer
screening. Despite the SOTA performance obtained by recent anchor-based detectors using CNNs
for this task, they require predetermined anchor parameters such as the size, number, and aspect
ratio of anchors, and have limited robustness when dealing with lung nodules with a massive variety
of sizes. To overcome these problems, we propose a 3D sphere representation-based center-points
matching detection network that is anchor-free and automatically predicts the position, radius,
and offset of nodules without the manual design of nodule/anchor parameters. The SCPM-Net consists
of two novel components: sphere representation and center points matching. First, to match the
nodule annotation in clinical practice, we replace the commonly used bounding box with our proposed
bounding sphere to represent nodules with the centroid, radius, and local offset in 3D space. A compatible
sphere-based intersection over-union loss function is introduced to train the lung nodule detection
network stably and efficiently. Second, we empower the network anchor-free by designing a positive
center-points selection and matching process, which naturally discards pre-determined anchor
boxes. An online hard example mining and re-focal loss subsequently enable the CPM process to be
more robust, resulting in more accurate point assignment and mitigation of class imbalance. In
addition, to better capture spatial information and 3D context for the detection, we propose to
fuse multi-level spatial coordinate maps with the feature extractor and combine them with 3D squeeze-and-excitation
attention modules. Experimental results on the LUNA16 dataset showed that our proposed framework
achieves superior performance compared with existing anchor-based and anchor-free methods for
lung nodule detection.

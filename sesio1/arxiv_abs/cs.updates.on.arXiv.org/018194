Background: Early detection and isolation of COVID-19 patients are essential for successful implementation
of mitigation strategies and eventually curbing the disease spread. With a limited number of daily
COVID-19 tests performed in every country, simulating the COVID-19 spread along with the potential
effect of each mitigation strategy currently remains one of the most effective ways in managing
the healthcare system and guiding policy-makers. Methods: We introduce COVIDHunter, a flexible
and accurate COVID-19 outbreak simulation model that evaluates the current mitigation measures
that are applied to a region and provides suggestions on what strength the upcoming mitigation measure
should be. The key idea of COVIDHunter is to quantify the spread of COVID-19 in a geographical region
by simulating the average number of new infections caused by an infected person considering the
effect of external factors, such as environmental conditions (e.g., climate, temperature, humidity)
and mitigation measures. Results: Using Switzerland as a case study, COVIDHunter estimates that
if the policy-makers relax the mitigation measures by 50% for 30 days then both the daily capacity
need for hospital beds and daily number of deaths increase exponentially by an average of 5.1x, who
may occupy ICU beds and ventilators for a period of time. Unlike existing models, the COVIDHunter
model accurately monitors and predicts the daily number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths
due to COVID-19. Our model is flexible to configure and simple to modify for modeling different scenarios
under different environmental conditions and mitigation measures. Availability: We release
the source code of the COVIDHunter implementation at https://github.com/CMU- SAFARI/COVIDHunter
and show how to flexibly configure our model for any scenario and easily extend it for different measures
and conditions than we account for.

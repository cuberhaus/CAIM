Why does stable matching work well in practice despite agents only providing short preference lists?
Perhaps the most compelling explanation is due to Lee (Lee, 2016). He considered a model with preferences
based on correlated cardinal utilities. The utilities were based on common public values for each
agent and individual private values. He showed that for suitable utility functions, in large markets,
for most agents, all stable matchings yield similar valued utilities. By means of a new analysis,
we strengthen this result, showing that in large markets, with high probability, for \emph{all}
but the bottommost agents, all stable matches yield similar valued utilities. We can then deduce
that for \emph{all} but the bottommost agents, relatively short preference lists suffice. Our
analysis shows that the key distinction is between models in which the derivatives of the utility
function are bounded, and those in which they can be unbounded. For the bounded derivative model,
we show that for any given constant $c\ge 1$, with $n$ agents on each side of the market, with probability
$1 - n^{-c}$, for each agent its possible utilities in all stable matches vary by at most $O((c\ln
n/n)^{1/3})$ for all but the bottommost $O((c\ln n/n)^{1/3})$ fraction of the agents. When the
derivatives can be unbounded, we obtain the following bound on the utility range and the bottommost
fraction: for any constant $\epsilon>0$, for large enough $n$, the bound is $\epsilon$. Both these
bounds are tight. In the bounded derivative model, we also show the existence of an $\epsilon$-Bayes-Nash
equilibrium in which agents make relatively few proposals. Our results all rely on a new technique
for sidestepping the conditioning between the matching events that occur over the course of a run
of the Deferred Acceptance algorithm. We complement these theoretical results with a variety of
simulation experiments.

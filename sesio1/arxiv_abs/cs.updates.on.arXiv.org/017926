During lung radiotherapy, the position of infrared reflective objects on the chest can be recorded
to estimate the tumor location. However, radiotherapy systems have a latency inherent to robot
control limitations that impedes the radiation delivery precision. Prediction with online learning
of recurrent neural networks (RNN) allows for adaptation to non-stationary respiratory signals,
but classical methods such as RTRL and truncated BPTT are respectively slow and biased. This study
investigates the capabilities of unbiased online recurrent optimization (UORO) to forecast respiratory
motion and enhance safety in lung radiotherapy. We used 9 observation records of the 3D position
of 3 external markers on the chest and abdomen of healthy individuals breathing during intervals
from 73s to 222s. The sampling frequency was 10Hz, and the amplitudes of the recorded trajectories
range from 6mm to 40mm in the superior-inferior direction. We forecast the 3D location of each marker
simultaneously with a horizon value between 0.1s and 2.0s, using an RNN trained with UORO. We compare
its performance with an RNN trained with RTRL, LMS, and offline linear regression. We provide closed-form
expressions for quantities involved in the gradient loss calculation in UORO, thereby making its
implementation efficient. Training and cross-validation were performed during the first minute
of each sequence. On average over the horizon values considered and the 9 sequences, UORO achieves
the lowest root-mean-square (RMS) error and maximum error among the compared algorithms. These
errors are respectively equal to 1.3mm and 8.8mm, and the prediction time per time step was lower
than 2.8ms (Dell Intel core i9-9900K 3.60 GHz). Linear regression has the lowest RMS error for the
horizon values 0.1s and 0.2s, followed by LMS for horizon values between 0.3s and 0.5s, and UORO for
horizon values greater than 0.6s.

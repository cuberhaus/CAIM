From designing architected materials to connecting mechanical behavior across scales, computational
modeling is a critical tool in solid mechanics. Recently, there has been a growing interest in using
machine learning to reduce the computational cost of physics-based simulations. Notably, while
machine learning approaches that rely on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown success in learning
mechanics, the performance of GNNs has yet to be investigated on a myriad of solid mechanics problems.
In this work, we examine the ability of GNNs to predict a fundamental aspect of mechanically driven
emergent behavior: the connection between a column's geometric structure and the direction that
it buckles. To accomplish this, we introduce the Asymmetric Buckling Columns (ABC) dataset, a dataset
comprised of three sub-datasets of asymmetric and heterogeneous column geometries where the goal
is to classify the direction of symmetry breaking (left or right) under compression after the onset
of instability. Because of complex local geometry, the "image-like" data representations required
for implementing standard convolutional neural network based metamodels are not ideal, thus motivating
the use of GNNs. In addition to investigating GNN model architecture, we study the effect of different
input data representation approaches, data augmentation, and combining multiple models as an
ensemble. While we were able to obtain good results, we also showed that predicting solid mechanics
based emergent behavior is non-trivial. Because both our model implementation and dataset are
distributed under open-source licenses, we hope that future researchers can build on our work to
create enhanced mechanics-specific machine learning pipelines for capturing the behavior of
complex geometric structures.

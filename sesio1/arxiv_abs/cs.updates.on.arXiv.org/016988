In this study, novel physics-informed neural network (PINN) methods for coupling neighboring
support points and their derivative terms which are obtained by automatic differentiation (AD),
are proposed to allow efficient training with improved accuracy. The computation of differential
operators required for PINNs loss evaluation at collocation points are conventionally obtained
via AD. Although AD has the advantage of being able to compute the exact gradients at any point, such
PINNs can only achieve high accuracies with large numbers of collocation points, otherwise they
are prone to optimizing towards unphysical solution. To make PINN training fast, the dual ideas
of using numerical differentiation (ND)-inspired method and coupling it with AD are employed to
define the loss function. The ND-based formulation for training loss can strongly link neighboring
collocation points to enable efficient training in sparse sample regimes, but its accuracy is restricted
by the interpolation scheme. The proposed coupled-automatic-numerical differentiation framework,
labeled as can-PINN, unifies the advantages of AD and ND, providing more robust and efficient training
than AD-based PINNs, while further improving accuracy by up to 1-2 orders of magnitude relative
to ND-based PINNs. For a proof-of-concept demonstration of this can-scheme to fluid dynamic problems,
two numerical-inspired instantiations of can-PINN schemes for the convection and pressure gradient
terms were derived to solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations. The superior performance
of can-PINNs is demonstrated on several challenging problems, including the flow mixing phenomena,
lid driven flow in a cavity, and channel flow over a backward facing step. The results reveal that
for challenging problems like these, can-PINNs can consistently achieve very good accuracy whereas
conventional AD-based PINNs fail.

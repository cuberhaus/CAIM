Many software systems today face uncertain operating conditions, such as sudden changes in the
availability of resources or unexpected user behavior. Without proper mitigation these uncertainties
can jeopardize the system goals. Self-adaptation is a common approach to tackle such uncertainties.
When the system goals may be compromised, the self-adaptive system has to select the best adaptation
option to reconfigure by analyzing the possible adaptation options, i.e., the adaptation space.
Yet, analyzing large adaptation spaces using rigorous methods can be resource- and time-consuming,
or even be infeasible. One approach to tackle this problem is by using online machine learning to
reduce adaptation spaces. However, existing approaches require domain expertise to perform feature
engineering to define the learner, and support online adaptation space reduction only for specific
goals. To tackle these limitations, we present 'Deep Learning for Adaptation Space Reduction Plus'
-- DLASeR+ in short. DLASeR+ offers an extendable learning framework for online adaptation space
reduction that does not require feature engineering, while supporting three common types of adaptation
goals: threshold, optimization, and set-point goals. We evaluate DLASeR+ on two instances of an
Internet-of-Things application with increasing sizes of adaptation spaces for different combinations
of adaptation goals. We compare DLASeR+ with a baseline that applies exhaustive analysis and two
state-of-the-art approaches for adaptation space reduction that rely on learning. Results show
that DLASeR+ is effective with a negligible effect on the realization of the adaptation goals compared
to an exhaustive analysis approach, and supports three common types of adaptation goals beyond
the state-of-the-art approaches.

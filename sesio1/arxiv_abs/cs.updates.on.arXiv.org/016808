This work presents an extended version of the Vehicle Energy Dataset (VED), which is a openly released
large-scale dataset for vehicle energy consumption analysis. Compared with its original version,
the extended VED (eVED) dataset is enhanced with accurate vehicle trip GPS coordinates, serving
as a basis to associate the VED trip records with external information, e.g., road speed limit and
intersections, from accessible map services to accumulate attributes that is essential in analyzing
vehicle energy consumption. In particularly, we calibrate all the GPS trace records in the original
VED data, upon which we associated the VED data with attributes extracted from the Geographic Information
System (QGIS), the Overpass API, the Open Street Map API, and Google Maps API. The associated attributes
include 12,609,170 records of road elevation, 12,203,044 of speed limit, 12,281,719 of speed limit
with direction (in case the road is bi-directional), 584,551 of intersections, 429,638 of bus stop,
312,196 of crossings, 195,856 of traffic signals, 29,397 of stop signs, 5,848 of turning loops,
4,053 of railway crossings (level crossing), 3,554 of turning circles, and 2,938 of motorway junctions.
With the accurate GPS coordinates and enriched features of the vehicle trip record, the obtained
eVED dataset can provide a precise and abundant medium to feed a learning engine, especially a deep
learning engine that is more demanding on data sufficiency and richness. Moreover, our software
work for data calibration and enrichment can be reused to generate further vehicle trip datasets
for specific user cases, contributing to deep insights into vehicle behaviors and traffic dynamics
analyses. We anticipate that the eVED dataset and our data enrichment software can serve the academic
and industrial automotive section as apparatus in developing future technologies.

Privacy is an essential issue in data trading markets. This work uses a mechanism design approach
to study the optimal market model to economize the value of privacy of personal data, using differential
privacy. The buyer uses a finite number of randomized algorithms to get access to the owners' data
in a sequential-composition manner, in which each randomized algorithm is differentially private.
Each usage of a randomized algorithm is referred to as a period. Due to the composability of differential
privacy, there are inevitable privacy losses accumulated over periods. Hence, we allow the owners
to leave the market at the end of any period by making stopping decisions. We define an instrumental
kernel function to capture the instrumentalness of owners' preferences and model the formation
of each owner's (both intrinsic and instrumental) preference over periods by taking into consideration
the composability of differential privacy and the time-varying nature of privacy concerns. Our
desideratum is to study the buyer's design regime of optimal market models in a dynamic environment
when each owner makes coupled decisions of stopping and reporting of their preferences. The buyer
seeks to design a privacy allocation rule that dynamically specifies the degree of privacy protections
and a payment rule to compensate for the privacy losses of the owners. The buyer additionally chooses
a payment rule which is independent of owners' reports of their preferences to influence the owners'
stopping decisions. We characterize the dynamic incentive compatibility and provide a design
principle to construct the payment rules in terms of the privacy allocation rule. Further, we relax
the buyer's market design problem and provide a sufficient condition for an approximated dynamic
incentive-compatible market model.

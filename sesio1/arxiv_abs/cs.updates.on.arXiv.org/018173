Humans are naturally endowed with the ability to write in a particular style. They can, for instance,
re-phrase a formal letter in an informal way, convey a literal message with the use of figures of speech
or edit a novel mimicking the style of some well-known authors. Automating this form of creativity
constitutes the goal of style transfer. As a natural language generation task, style transfer aims
at rewriting existing texts, and specifically, it creates paraphrases that exhibit some desired
stylistic attributes. From a practical perspective, it envisions beneficial applications, like
chat-bots that modulate their communicative style to appear empathetic, or systems that automatically
simplify technical articles for a non-expert audience. Several style-aware paraphrasing methods
have attempted to tackle style transfer. A handful of surveys give a methodological overview of
the field, but they do not support researchers to focus on specific styles. With this paper, we aim
at providing a comprehensive discussion of the styles that have received attention in the transfer
task. We organize them in a hierarchy, highlighting the challenges for the definition of each of
them, and pointing out gaps in the current research landscape. The hierarchy comprises two main
groups. One encompasses styles that people modulate arbitrarily, along the lines of registers
and genres. The other group corresponds to unintentionally expressed styles, due to an author's
personal characteristics. Hence, our review shows how these groups relate to one another, and where
specific styles, including some that have not yet been explored, belong in the hierarchy. Moreover,
we summarize the methods employed for different stylistic families, hinting researchers towards
those that would be the most fitting for future research.

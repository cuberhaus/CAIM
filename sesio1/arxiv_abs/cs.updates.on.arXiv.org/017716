Without sufficient information about research data practices occurring in a particular research
organisation, there is a risk of mismatching research data service efforts with the needs of its
researchers. This study describes how data acquiring and data sharing occurring within a particular
research organisation can be investigated by using current research information system publication
data. A sample of 193 journal articles published by researchers in the computer science department
of the case study's university during 2019 were extracted for scrutiny from the current research
information system. For these 193 articles, a classification of the main study types was developed
to accommodate the multidisciplinary nature of the case department's research agenda. Furthermore,
a coding framework was developed to capture the key elements of data acquiring and data sharing.
The articles representing life sciences and computational research relatively frequently reused
open data, whereas data acquisition of experimental research, human interaction studies and human
intervention studies often relied on collecting original data. Data sharing also differed between
the computationally intensive study types of life sciences and computational research and the
study types relying on collection of original data. Research data were not available for reuse in
only a minority of life science (n= 2; 7%) and computational research (n = 15; 14%) studies. The study
types of experimental research, human interaction studies and human intervention studies less
frequently made their data available for reuse. This study demonstrates that analyses of publications
listed in current research information systems provide detailed descriptions how the affiliated
researchers acquire and share research data.

De-homogenization is becoming an effective method to significantly expedite the design of high-resolution
multiscale structures, but existing methods have thus far been confined to simple static compliance
minimization. There are two critical challenges to be addressed in accommodating general cases:
enabling the design of unit-cell orientation and using free-form microstructures. In this paper,
we propose a data-driven de-homogenization method that allows effective design of the unit-cell
orientation angles and conformal mapping of spatially varying, complex microstructures. We devise
a parameterized microstructure composed of rods in different directions to provide more diversity
in stiffness while retaining geometrical simplicity. The microstructural geometry-property
relationship is then surrogated by a neural network to avoid costly homogenization. A Cartesian
representation of the unit-cell orientation is incorporated into homogenization-based optimization
to design the angles. Corresponding high-resolution multiscale structures are obtained from
the homogenization-based designs through a conformal mapping constructed with sawtooth function
fields. This allows us to assemble complex microstructures with an oriented and compatible tiling
pattern, while preserving the local homogenized properties. To demonstrate our method with a specific
application, we optimize the frequency response of structures under harmonic excitations within
a given frequency range. It is the first time that a sawtooth function is applied in a de-homogenization
framework for complex design scenarios beyond static compliance minimization. The examples illustrate
that multiscale structures can be generated with high efficiency and much better dynamic performance
compared with the macroscale-only optimization. Beyond frequency response design, our proposed
framework can be applied to other general problems.

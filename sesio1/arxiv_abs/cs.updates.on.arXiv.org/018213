Layout planning is centrally important in the field of architecture and urban design. Among the
various basic units carrying urban functions, residential community plays a vital part for supporting
human life. Therefore, the layout planning of residential community has always been of concern,
and has attracted particular attention since the advent of deep learning that facilitates the automated
layout generation and spatial pattern recognition. However, the research circles generally suffer
from the insufficiency of residential community layout benchmark or high-quality datasets, which
hampers the future exploration of data-driven methods for residential community layout planning.
The lack of datasets is largely due to the difficulties of large-scale real-world residential data
acquisition and long-term expert screening. In order to address the issues and advance a benchmark
dataset for various intelligent spatial design and analysis applications in the development of
smart city, we introduce Residential Community Layout Planning (ReCo) Dataset, which is the first
and largest open-source vector dataset related to real-world community to date. ReCo Dataset is
presented in multiple data formats with 37,646 residential community layout plans, covering 598,728
residential buildings with height information. ReCo can be conveniently adapted for residential
community layout related urban design tasks, e.g., generative layout design, morphological pattern
recognition and spatial evaluation. To validate the utility of ReCo in automated residential community
layout planning, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based generative model is further applied
to the dataset. We expect ReCo Dataset to inspire more creative and practical work in intelligent
design and beyond. The ReCo Dataset is published at: https://www.kaggle.com/fdudsde/reco-dataset.

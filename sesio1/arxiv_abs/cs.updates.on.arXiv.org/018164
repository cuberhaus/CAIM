During the design process of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), the pressure vessel has a critical
role. The pressure vessel contains dry electronics, power sources, and other sensors that can not
be flooded. A traditional design approach for a pressure vessel design involves running multiple
Finite Element Analysis (FEA) based simulations and optimizing the design to find the best suitable
design which meets the requirement. Running these FEAs are computationally very costly for any
optimization process and it becomes difficult to run even hundreds of evaluation. In such a case,
a better approach is the surrogate design with the goal of replacing FEA-based prediction with some
learning-based regressor. Once the surrogate is trained for a class of problem, then the learned
response surface can be used to analyze the stress effect without running the FEA for that class of
problem. The challenge of creating a surrogate for a class of problems is data generation. Since
the process is computationally costly, it is not possible to densely sample the design space and
the learning response surface on sparse data set becomes difficult. During experimentation, we
observed that a Deep Learning-based surrogate outperforms other regression models on such sparse
data. In the present work, we are utilizing the Deep Learning-based model to replace the costly finite
element analysis-based simulation process. By creating the surrogate we speed up the prediction
on the other design much faster than direct Finite element Analysis. We also compared our DL-based
surrogate with other classical Machine Learning (ML) based regression models( random forest and
Gradient Boost regressor). We observed on the sparser data, the DL-based surrogate performs much
better than other regression models.

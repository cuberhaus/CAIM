We prove new bounds on the distributed fractional coloring problem in the LOCAL model. Fractional
$c$-colorings can be understood as multicolorings as follows. For some natural numbers $p$ and
$q$ such that $p/q\leq c$, each node $v$ is assigned a set of at least $q$ colors from $\{1,\dots,p\}$
such that adjacent nodes are assigned disjoint sets of colors. The minimum $c$ for which a fractional
$c$-coloring of a graph $G$ exists is called the fractional chromatic number $\chi_f(G)$ of $G$.
Recently, [Bousquet, Esperet, and Pirot; SIROCCO '21] showed that for any constant $\epsilon>0$,
a fractional $(\Delta+\epsilon)$-coloring can be computed in $\Delta^{O(\Delta)} + O(\Delta\cdot\log^*
n)$ rounds. We show that such a coloring can be computed in only $O(\log^2 \Delta)$ rounds, without
any dependency on $n$. We further show that in $O\big(\frac{\log n}{\epsilon}\big)$ rounds, it
is possible to compute a fractional $(1+\epsilon)\chi_f(G)$-coloring, even if the fractional
chromatic number $\chi_f(G)$ is not known. That is, this problem can be approximated arbitrarily
well by an efficient algorithm in the LOCAL model. For the standard coloring problem, it is only known
that an $O\big(\frac{\log n}{\log\log n}\big)$-approximation can be computed in polylogarithmic
time in the LOCAL model. We also show that our distributed fractional coloring approximation algorithm
is best possible. We show that in trees, which have fractional chromatic number $2$, computing a
fractional $(2+\epsilon)$-coloring requires at least $\Omega\big(\frac{\log n}{\epsilon}\big)$
rounds. We finally study fractional colorings of regular grids. In [Bousquet, Esperet, and Pirot;
SIROCCO '21], it is shown that in regular grids of bounded dimension, a fractional $(2+\epsilon)$-coloring
can be computed in time $O(\log^* n)$. We show that such a coloring can even be computed in $O(1)$ rounds
in the LOCAL model.

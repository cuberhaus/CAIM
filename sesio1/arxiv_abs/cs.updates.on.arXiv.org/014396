Crowdsourcing markets provide workers with a centralized place to find paid work. What may not be
obvious at first glance is that, in addition to the work they do for pay, crowd workers also have to
shoulder a variety of unpaid invisible labor in these markets, which ultimately reduces workers'
hourly wages. Invisible labor includes finding good tasks, messaging requesters, or managing
payments. However, we currently know little about how much time crowd workers actually spend on
invisible labor or how much it costs them economically. To ensure a fair and equitable future for
crowd work, we need to be certain that workers are being paid fairly for all of the work they do. In this
paper, we conduct a field study to quantify the invisible labor in crowd work. We build a plugin to
record the amount of time that 100 workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk dedicate to invisible labor
while completing 40,903 tasks. If we ignore the time workers spent on invisible labor, workers'
median hourly wage was $3.76. But, we estimated that crowd workers in our study spent 33% of their
time daily on invisible labor, dropping their median hourly wage to $2.83. We found that the invisible
labor differentially impacts workers depending on their skill level and workers' demographics.
The invisible labor category that took the most time and that was also the most common revolved around
workers having to manage their payments. The second most time-consuming invisible labor category
involved hyper-vigilance, where workers vigilantly watched over requesters' profiles for newly
posted work or vigilantly searched for labor. We hope that through our paper, the invisible labor
in crowdsourcing becomes more visible, and our results help to reveal the larger implications of
the continuing invisibility of labor in crowdsourcing.

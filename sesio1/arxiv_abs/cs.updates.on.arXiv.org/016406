Contact tracing has been proven an effective approach to mitigate the virus spread in pandemics
like COVID-19. As an emerging powerful decentralized data sharing and storage technique, blockchain
has been explored to ensure data privacy and security in contact tracing processes. Existing work
mostly treats blockchain as a separate storage system requiring third-party servers to perform
data collection and computation, and avoids revealing detailed interior design of blockchain
storage. However, blockchain system is capable to work as a fully automatic distributed contact
tracing system without any third-party server by tackling the following challenges: 1) how to ensure
the contact tracing correctness without compromising privacy; 2) how to design efficient and effective
consensus mechanism to ensure the system security and robustness; 3) how to design an incentive
mechanism to motivate people to behave honestly. In this article, we present the Blockchain Based
Contact Tracing Framework for the contact tracing problem. In the framework, RSA encryption based
transaction verification algorithm (RSA-TVA) is proposed to ensure contact tracing correctness,
which can achieve more than 97% contact case recording accuracy even when each person has 60% chance
of failing to verify the contact information. Reputation Corrected Delegated Proof of Stack (RC-DPoS)
consensus mechanism is applied to jointly work with the proposed incentive mechanism, which can
ensure timeliness of reporting contact cases and meanwhile balance the reward gained by different
people. A novel contact tracing simulation environment is created in the simulation part, which
considers three different contact scenarios. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness,
robustness and attack resistance of RSA-TVA and RC-DPoS in the proposed Blockchain Based Contact
Tracing Framework.

The fundamental goal of business data analysis is to improve business decisions using data. Business
users often make decisions to achieve key performance indicators (KPIs) such as increasing customer
retention or sales, or decreasing costs. To discover the relationship between data attributes
hypothesized to be drivers and those corresponding to KPIs of interest, business users currently
need to perform lengthy exploratory analyses. This involves considering multitudes of combinations
and scenarios and performing slicing, dicing, and transformations on the data accordingly, e.g.,
analyzing customer retention across quarters of the year or suggesting optimal media channels
across strata of customers. However, the increasing complexity of datasets combined with the cognitive
limitations of humans makes it challenging to carry over multiple hypotheses, even for simple datasets.
Therefore mentally performing such analyses is hard. Existing commercial tools either provide
partial solutions or fail to cater to business users altogether. Here we argue for four functionalities
to enable business users to interactively learn and reason about the relationships between sets
of data attributes thereby facilitating data-driven decision making. We implement these functionalities
in SystemD, an interactive visual data analysis system enabling business users to experiment with
the data by asking what-if questions. We evaluate the system through three business use cases: marketing
mix modeling, customer retention analysis, and deal closing analysis, and report on feedback from
multiple business users. Users find the SystemD functionalities highly useful for quick testing
and validation of their hypotheses around their KPIs of interest, addressing their unmet analysis
needs. The feedback also suggests that the UX design can be enhanced to further improve the understandability
of these functionalities.

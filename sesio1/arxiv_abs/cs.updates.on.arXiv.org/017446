Genome sequencing projects are rapidly increasing the number of high-dimensional protein sequence
datasets. Clustering a high-dimensional protein sequence dataset using traditional machine
learning approaches poses many challenges. Many different feature extraction methods exist and
are widely used. However, extracting features from millions of protein sequences becomes impractical
because they are not scalable with current algorithms. Therefore, there is a need for an efficient
feature extraction approach that extracts significant features. We have proposed two scalable
feature extraction approaches for extracting features from huge protein sequences using Apache
Spark, which are termed 60d-SPF (60-dimensional Scalable Protein Feature) and 6d-SCPSF (6-dimensional
Scalable Co-occurrence-based Probability-Specific Feature). The proposed 60d-SPF and 6d-SCPSF
approaches capture the statistical properties of amino acids to create a fixed-length numeric
feature vector that represents each protein sequence in terms of 60-dimensional and 6-dimensional
features, respectively. The preprocessed huge protein sequences are used as an input in two clustering
algorithms, i.e., Scalable Random Sampling with Iterative Optimization Fuzzy c-Means (SRSIO-FCM)
and Scalable Literal Fuzzy C-Means (SLFCM) for clustering. We have conducted extensive experiments
on various soybean protein datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed feature extraction
methods, 60d-SPF, 6d-SCPSF, and existing feature extraction methods on SRSIO-FCM and SLFCM clustering
algorithms. The reported results in terms of the Silhouette index and the Davies-Bouldin index
show that the proposed 60d-SPF extraction method on SRSIO-FCM and SLFCM clustering algorithms
achieves significantly better results than the proposed 6d-SCPSF and existing feature extraction
approaches.

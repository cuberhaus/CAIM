The high cost of data acquisition makes Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model training problematic
for most existing languages, including languages that do not even have a written script, or for which
the phone inventories remain unknown. Past works explored multilingual training, transfer learning,
as well as zero-shot learning in order to build ASR systems for these low-resource languages. While
it has been shown that the pooling of resources from multiple languages is helpful, we have not yet
seen a successful application of an ASR model to a language unseen during training. A crucial step
in the adaptation of ASR from seen to unseen languages is the creation of the phone inventory of the
unseen language. The ultimate goal of our work is to build the phone inventory of a language unseen
during training in an unsupervised way without any knowledge about the language. In this paper,
we 1) investigate the influence of different factors (i.e., model architecture, phonotactic model,
type of speech representation) on phone recognition in an unknown language; 2) provide an analysis
of which phones transfer well across languages and which do not in order to understand the limitations
of and areas for further improvement for automatic phone inventory creation; and 3) present different
methods to build a phone inventory of an unseen language in an unsupervised way. To that end, we conducted
mono-, multi-, and crosslingual experiments on a set of 13 phonetically diverse languages and several
in-depth analyses. We found a number of universal phone tokens (IPA symbols) that are well-recognized
cross-linguistically. Through a detailed analysis of results, we conclude that unique sounds,
similar sounds, and tone languages remain a major challenge for phonetic inventory discovery.

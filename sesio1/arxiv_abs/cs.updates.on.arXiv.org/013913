Over-complete systems of vectors, or in short, frames, play the role of analog codes in many areas
of communication and signal processing. To name a few, spreading sequences for code-division multiple
access (CDMA), over-complete representations for multiple-description (MD) source coding,
space-time codes, sensing matrices for compressed sensing (CS), and more recently, codes for unreliable
distributed computation. In this survey paper we observe an information-theoretic random-like
behavior of frame subsets. Such sub-frames arise in setups involving erasures (communication),
random user activity (multiple access), or sparsity (signal processing), in addition to channel
or quantization noise. The goodness of a frame as an analog code is a function of the eigenvalues of
a sub-frame, averaged over all sub-frames. For the highly symmetric class of Equiangular Tight
Frames (ETF), as well as for other "near ETF" frames, we show that the empirical eigenvalue distribution
of a randomly-selected sub-frame (i) is asymptotically indistinguishable from Wachter's MANOVA
distribution; and (ii) exhibits a universal convergence rate to this limit that is empirically
indistinguishable from that of a matrix sequence drawn from MANOVA (Jacobi) ensembles of corresponding
dimensions. Some of these results are shown via careful statistical analysis of empirical evidence,
and some are proved analytically using random matrix theory arguments of independent interest.
The goodness measures of the MANOVA limit distribution are better, in a concrete formal sense, than
those of the Marchenko-Pastur distribution at the same aspect ratio, implying that deterministic
analog codes are better than random (i.i.d.) analog codes. We further give evidence that the ETF
(and near ETF) family is in fact superior to any other frame family in terms of its typical sub-frame
goodness.

Grassland restoration is a critical means to safeguard grassland ecological degradation. To alleviate
the extensive human labors and boost the restoration efficiency, UAV is promising for its fully
automatic capability yet still waits to be exploited. This paper progresses this emerging technology
by explicitly considering the realistic constraints of the UAV and the grassland degradation while
planning the grassland restoration. To this end, the UAV-enabled restoration process is first
mathematically modeled as the maximization of restoration areas of the UAV under the limited battery
energy of UAV, the grass seeds weight, the number of restored areas, and the corresponding sizes.
Then we analyze that, by considering these constraints, this original problem emerges two conflict
objectives, namely the shortest flight path and the optimal areas allocation. As a result, the maximization
of restoration areas turns out to be a composite of a trajectory design problem and an areas allocation
problem that are highly coupled. From the perspective of optimization, this requires solving two
NP-hard problems of both the traveling salesman problem (TSP) and the multidimensional knapsack
problem (MKP) at the same time. To tackle this complex problem, we propose a cooperative optimization
algorithm, called CHAPBILM, to solve those two problems interlacedly by utilizing the interdependencies
between them. Multiple simulations verify the conflicts between the trajectory design and areas
allocation. The effectiveness of the cooperative optimization algorithm is also supported by
the comparisons with traditional optimization methods which do not utilize the interdependencies
between the two problems. As a result, the proposed algorithm successfully solves the multiple
simulation instances in a near-optimal way.

Many modern cyber physical systems incorporate computer vision technologies, complex sensors
and advanced control software, allowing them to interact with the environment autonomously. Testing
such systems poses numerous challenges: not only should the system inputs be varied, but also the
surrounding environment should be accounted for. A number of tools have been developed to test the
system model for the possible inputs falsifying its requirements. However, they are not directly
applicable to autonomous cyber physical systems, as the inputs to their models are generated while
operating in a virtual environment. In this paper, we aim to design a search based framework, named
AmbieGen, for generating diverse fault revealing test scenarios for autonomous cyber physical
systems. The scenarios represent an environment in which an autonomous agent operates. The framework
should be applicable to generating different types of environments. To generate the test scenarios,
we leverage the NSGA II algorithm with two objectives. The first objective evaluates the deviation
of the observed system behaviour from its expected behaviour. The second objective is the test case
diversity, calculated as a Jaccard distance with a reference test case. We evaluate AmbieGen on
three scenario generation case studies, namely a smart-thermostat, a robot obstacle avoidance
system, and a vehicle lane keeping assist system. We compared three configurations of AmbieGen:
based on a single objective genetic algorithm, multi objective, and random search. Both single
and multi objective configurations outperform the random search. Multi objective configuration
can find the individuals of the same quality as the single objective, producing more unique test
scenarios in the same time budget.

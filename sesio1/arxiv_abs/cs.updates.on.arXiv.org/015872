Scene flow estimation is the task to predict the point-wise or pixel-wise 3D displacement vector
between two consecutive frames of point clouds or images, which has important application in fields
such as service robots and autonomous driving. Although many previous works have explored greatly
on scene flow estimation based on point clouds, there are two problems that have not been noticed
or well solved before: 1) Points of adjacent frames in repetitive patterns may be wrongly associated
due to similar spatial structure in their neighbourhoods; 2) Scene flow between adjacent frames
of point clouds with long-distance movement may be inaccurately estimated. To solve the first problem,
a novel context-aware set convolution layer is proposed in this paper to exploit contextual structure
information of Euclidean space and learn soft aggregation weights for local point features. This
design is inspired by human perception of contextual structure information during scene understanding
with repetitive patterns. The context-aware set convolution layer is incorporated in a context-aware
point feature pyramid module of 3D point clouds for scene flow estimation. For the second problem,
an explicit residual flow learning structure is proposed in the residual flow refinement layer
to cope with long-distance movement. The experiments and ablation study on FlyingThings3D and
KITTI scene flow datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of each proposed component. The qualitative
results show that the problems of ambiguous inter-frame association and long-distance movement
estimation are well handled. Quantitative results on both FlyingThings3D and KITTI scene flow
datasets show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing all
other previous works to the best of our knowledge by at least 25%.

Data collected by multiple methods or from multiple sources is called multi-view data. To make full
use of the multi-view data, multi-view learning plays an increasingly important role. Traditional
multi-view learning methods rely on a large number of labeled and completed multi-view data. However,
it is expensive and time-consuming to obtain a large number of labeled multi-view data in real-world
applications. Moreover, multi-view data is often incomplete because of data collection failures,
self-deficiency, or other reasons. Therefore, we may have to face the problem of fewer labeled and
incomplete multi-view data in real application scenarios. In this paper, a transductive semi-supervised
incomplete multi-view TSK fuzzy system modeling method (SSIMV_TSK) is proposed to address these
challenges. First, in order to alleviate the dependency on labeled data and keep the model interpretable,
the proposed method integrates missing view imputation, pseudo label learning of unlabeled data,
and fuzzy system modeling into a single process to yield a model with interpretable fuzzy rules.
Then, two new mechanisms, i.e. the bidirectional structural preservation of instance and label,
as well as the adaptive multiple alignment collaborative learning, are proposed to improve the
robustness of the model. The proposed method has the following distinctive characteristics: 1)
it can deal with the incomplete and few labeled multi-view data simultaneously; 2) it integrates
the missing view imputation and model learning as a single process, which is more efficient than
the traditional two-step strategy; 3) attributed to the interpretable fuzzy inference rules,
this method is more interpretable. Experimental results on real datasets show that the proposed
method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

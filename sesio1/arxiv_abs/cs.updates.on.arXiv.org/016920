We present several new complexity results for the entropic regularized algorithms that approximately
solve the optimal transport (OT) problem between two discrete probability measures with at most
$n$ atoms. First, we improve the complexity bound of a greedy variant of Sinkhorn, known as \textit{Greenkhorn},
from $\widetilde{O}(n^2\varepsilon^{-3})$ to $\widetilde{O}(n^2\varepsilon^{-2})$. Notably,
our result can match the best known complexity bound of Sinkhorn and help clarify why Greenkhorn
significantly outperforms Sinkhorn in practice in terms of row/column updates as observed by~\citet{Altschuler-2017-Near}.
Second, we propose a new algorithm, which we refer to as \textit{APDAMD} and which generalizes an
adaptive primal-dual accelerated gradient descent (APDAGD) algorithm~\citep{Dvurechensky-2018-Computational}
with a prespecified mirror mapping $\phi$. We prove that APDAMD achieves the complexity bound of
$\widetilde{O}(n^2\sqrt{\delta}\varepsilon^{-1})$ in which $\delta>0$ stands for the regularity
of $\phi$. In addition, we show by a counterexample that the complexity bound of $\widetilde{O}(\min\{n^{9/4}\varepsilon^{-1},
n^2\varepsilon^{-2}\})$ proved for APDAGD before is invalid and give a refined complexity bound
of $\widetilde{O}(n^{5/2}\varepsilon^{-1})$. Further, we develop a \textit{deterministic}
accelerated variant of Sinkhorn via appeal to estimated sequence and prove the complexity bound
of $\widetilde{O}(n^{7/3}\varepsilon^{-4/3})$. As such, we see that accelerated variant of
Sinkhorn outperforms Sinkhorn and Greenkhorn in terms of $1/\varepsilon$ and APDAGD and accelerated
alternating minimization (AAM)~\citep{Guminov-2021-Combination} in terms of $n$. Finally,
we conduct the experiments on synthetic and real data and the numerical results show the efficiency
of Greenkhorn, APDAMD and accelerated Sinkhorn in practice.

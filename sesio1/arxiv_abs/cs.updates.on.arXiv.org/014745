Background and Objective: Gastric cancer has turned out to be the fifth most common cancer globally,
and early detection of gastric cancer is essential to save lives. Histopathological examination
of gastric cancer is the gold standard for the diagnosis of gastric cancer. However, computer-aided
diagnostic techniques are challenging to evaluate due to the scarcity of publicly available gastric
histopathology image datasets. Methods: In this paper, a noble publicly available Gastric Histopathology
Sub-size Image Database (GasHisSDB) is published to identify classifiers' performance. Specifically,
two types of data are included: normal and abnormal, with a total of 245,196 tissue case images. In
order to prove that the methods of different periods in the field of image classification have discrepancies
on GasHisSDB, we select a variety of classifiers for evaluation. Seven classical machine learning
classifiers, three Convolutional Neural Network classifiers, and a novel transformer-based
classifier are selected for testing on image classification tasks. Results: This study performed
extensive experiments using traditional machine learning and deep learning methods to prove that
the methods of different periods have discrepancies on GasHisSDB. Traditional machine learning
achieved the best accuracy rate of 86.08% and a minimum of just 41.12%. The best accuracy of deep learning
reached 96.47% and the lowest was 86.21%. Accuracy rates vary significantly across classifiers.
Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, it is the first publicly available gastric cancer histopathology
dataset containing a large number of images for weakly supervised learning. We believe that GasHisSDB
can attract researchers to explore new algorithms for the automated diagnosis of gastric cancer,
which can help physicians and patients in the clinical setting.

Biomedical machine reading comprehension (biomedical-MRC) aims to comprehend complex biomedical
narratives and assist healthcare professionals in retrieving information from them. The high
performance of modern neural network-based MRC systems depends on high-quality, large-scale,
human-annotated training datasets. In the biomedical domain, a crucial challenge in creating
such datasets is the requirement for domain knowledge, inducing the scarcity of labeled data and
the need for transfer learning from the labeled general-purpose (source) domain to the biomedical
(target) domain. However, there is a discrepancy in marginal distributions between the general-purpose
and biomedical domains due to the variances in topics. Therefore, direct-transferring of learned
representations from a model trained on a general-purpose domain to the biomedical domain can hurt
the model's performance. We present an adversarial learning-based domain adaptation framework
for the biomedical machine reading comprehension task (BioADAPT-MRC), a neural network-based
method to address the discrepancies in the marginal distributions between the general and biomedical
domain datasets. BioADAPT-MRC relaxes the need for generating pseudo labels for training a well-performing
biomedical-MRC model. We extensively evaluate the performance of BioADAPT-MRC by comparing it
with the best existing methods on three widely used benchmark biomedical-MRC datasets -- BioASQ-7b,
BioASQ-8b, and BioASQ-9b. Our results suggest that without using any synthetic or human-annotated
data from the biomedical domain, BioADAPT-MRC can achieve state-of-the-art performance on these
datasets. Availability: BioADAPT-MRC is freely available as an open-source project at \url{https://github.com/mmahbub/BioADAPT-MRC}.

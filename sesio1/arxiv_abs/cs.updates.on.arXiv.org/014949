Driving is a routine activity for many, but it is far from simple. Drivers deal with multiple concurrent
tasks, such as keeping the vehicle in the lane, observing and anticipating the actions of other road
users, reacting to hazards, and dealing with distractions inside and outside the vehicle. Failure
to notice and respond to the surrounding objects and events can cause accidents. The ongoing improvements
of the road infrastructure and vehicle mechanical design have made driving safer overall. Nevertheless,
the problem of driver inattention has remained one of the primary causes of accidents. Therefore,
understanding where the drivers look and why they do so can help eliminate sources of distractions
and identify unsafe attention patterns. Research on driver attention has implications for many
practical applications such as policy-making, improving driver education, enhancing road infrastructure
and in-vehicle infotainment systems, as well as designing systems for driver monitoring, driver
assistance, and automated driving. This report covers the literature on changes in drivers' visual
attention distribution due to factors, internal and external to the driver. Aspects of attention
during driving have been explored across multiple disciplines, including psychology, human factors,
human-computer interaction, intelligent transportation, and computer vision, each offering
different perspectives, goals, and explanations for the observed phenomena. We link cross-disciplinary
theoretical and behavioral research on driver's attention to practical solutions. Furthermore,
limitations and directions for future research are discussed. This report is based on over 175 behavioral
studies, nearly 100 practical papers, 20 datasets, and over 70 surveys published since 2010. A curated
list of papers used for this report is available at \url{https://github.com/ykotseruba/attention_and_driving}.

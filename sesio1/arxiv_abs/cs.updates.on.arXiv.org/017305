In this paper, we investigated whether we can 1) detect participants with ataxia-specific gait
characteristics (risk-prediction), and 2) assess severity of ataxia from gait (severity-assessment)
using computer vision. We created a dataset of 155 videos from 89 participants, 24 controls and 65
diagnosed with (or are pre-manifest) spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), performing the gait task
of the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) from 11 medical sites located in 8 different
states across the United States. We develop a computer vision pipeline to detect, track, and separate
out the participants from their surroundings and construct several features from their body pose
coordinates to capture gait characteristics like step width, step length, swing, stability, speed,
etc. Our risk-prediction model achieves 83.06% accuracy and an 80.23% F1 score. Similarly, our
severity-assessment model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) score of 0.6225 and a Pearson's
correlation coefficient score of 0.7268. Our models still performed competitively when evaluated
on data from sites not used during training. Furthermore, through feature importance analysis,
we found that our models associate wider steps, decreased walking speed, and increased instability
with greater ataxia severity, which is consistent with previously established clinical knowledge.
Our models create possibilities for remote ataxia assessment in non-clinical settings in the future,
which could significantly improve accessibility of ataxia care. Furthermore, our underlying
dataset was assembled from a geographically diverse cohort, highlighting its potential to further
increase equity. The code used in this study is open to the public, and the anonymized body pose landmark
dataset is also available upon request.

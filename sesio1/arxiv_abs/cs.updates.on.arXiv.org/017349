Stable matchings have been studied extensively in social choice literature. The focus has been
mostly on integral matchings, in which the nodes on the two sides are wholly matched. A fractional
matching, which is a convex combination of integral matchings, is a natural extension of integral
matchings. The topic of stability of fractional matchings has started receiving attention only
very recently. Further, incentive compatibility in the context of fractional matchings has received
very little attention. With this as the backdrop, our paper studies the important topic of incentive
compatibility of mechanisms to find stable fractional matchings. We work with preferences expressed
in the form of cardinal utilities. Our first result is an impossibility result that there are matching
instances for which no mechanism that produces a stable fractional matching can be incentive compatible
or even approximately incentive compatible. This provides the motivation to seek special classes
of matching instances for which there exist incentive compatible mechanisms that produce stable
fractional matchings. Our study leads to a class of matching instances that admit unique stable
fractional matchings. We first show that a unique stable fractional matching for a matching instance
exists if and only if the given matching instance satisfies the conditional mutual first preference
(CMFP) property. To this end, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm that makes ingenious use of
envy-graphs to find a non-integral stable matching whenever the preferences are strict and the
given instance is not a CMFP matching instance. For this class of CMFP matching instances, we prove
that every mechanism that produces the unique stable fractional matching is (a) incentive compatible
and further (b) resistant to coalitional manipulations.

Graphs have often been used to answer questions about the interaction between real-world entities
by taking advantage of their capacity to represent complex topologies. Complex networks are known
to be graphs that capture such non-trivial topologies; they are able to represent human phenomena
such as epidemic processes, the dynamics of populations, and the urbanization of cities. The investigation
of complex networks has been extrapolated to many fields of science, with particular emphasis on
computing techniques, including artificial intelligence. In such a case, the analysis of the interaction
between entities of interest is transposed to the internal learning of algorithms, a paradigm whose
investigation is able to expand the state of the art in Computer Science. By exploring this paradigm,
this thesis puts together complex networks and machine learning techniques to improve the understanding
of the human phenomena observed in pandemics, pendular migration, and street networks. Accordingly,
we contribute with: (i) a new neural network architecture capable of modeling dynamic processes
observed in spatial and temporal data with applications in epidemics propagation, weather forecasting,
and patient monitoring in intensive care units; (ii) a machine-learning methodology for analyzing
and predicting links in the scope of human mobility between all the cities of Brazil; and, (iii) techniques
for identifying inconsistencies in the urban planning of cities while tracking the most influential
vertices, with applications over Brazilian and worldwide cities. We obtained results sustained
by sound evidence of advances to the state of the art in artificial intelligence, rigorous formalisms,
and ample experimentation. Our findings rely upon real-world applications in a range of domains,
demonstrating the applicability of our methodologies.

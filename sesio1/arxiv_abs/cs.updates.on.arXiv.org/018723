Current object detectors typically have a feature pyramid (FP) module for multi-level feature
fusion (MFF) which aims to mitigate the gap between features from different levels and form a comprehensive
object representation to achieve better detection performance. However, they usually require
heavy cross-level connections or iterative refinement to obtain better MFF result, making them
complicated in structure and inefficient in computation. To address these issues, we propose a
novel and efficient context modeling mechanism that can help existing FPs deliver better MFF results
while reducing the computational costs effectively. In particular, we introduce a novel insight
that comprehensive contexts can be decomposed and condensed into two types of representations
for higher efficiency. The two representations include a locally concentrated representation
and a globally summarized representation, where the former focuses on extracting context cues
from nearby areas while the latter extracts key representations of the whole image scene as global
context cues. By collecting the condensed contexts, we employ a Transformer decoder to investigate
the relations between them and each local feature from the FP and then refine the MFF results accordingly.
As a result, we obtain a simple and light-weight Transformer-based Context Condensation (TCC)
module, which can boost various FPs and lower their computational costs simultaneously. Extensive
experimental results on the challenging MS COCO dataset show that TCC is compatible to four representative
FPs and consistently improves their detection accuracy by up to 7.8 % in terms of average precision
and reduce their complexities by up to around 20% in terms of GFLOPs, helping them achieve state-of-the-art
performance more efficiently. Code will be released.

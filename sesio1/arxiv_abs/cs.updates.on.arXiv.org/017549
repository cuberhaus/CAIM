Fast mixing of random walks on hypergraphs has led to myriad breakthroughs in theoretical computer
science in the last five years. On the other hand, many important applications (e.g. to locally testable
codes, 2-2 games) rely on a more general class of underlying structures called posets, and crucially
take advantage of non-simplicial structure. These works make it clear the global expansion properties
of posets depend strongly on their underlying architecture (e.g. simplicial, cubical, linear
algebraic), but the overall phenomenon remains poorly understood. In this work, we quantify the
advantage of different poset architectures in both a spectral and combinatorial sense, highlighting
how regularity controls the spectral decay and edge-expansion of corresponding random walks.
We show that the spectra of walks on expanding posets (Dikstein, Dinur, Filmus, Harsha APPROX-RANDOM
2018) concentrate in strips around a small number of approximate eigenvalues controlled by the
regularity of the underlying poset. This gives a simple condition to identify poset architectures
(e.g. the Grassmann) that exhibit exponential decay of eigenvalues, versus architectures like
hypergraphs whose eigenvalues decay linearly -- a crucial distinction in applications to hardness
of approximation such as the recent proof of the 2-2 Games Conjecture (Khot, Minzer, Safra FOCS 2018).
We show these results lead to a tight characterization of edge-expansion on posets in the $\ell_2$-regime
(generalizing recent work of Bafna, Hopkins, Kaufman, and Lovett (SODA 2022)), and pay special
attention to the case of the Grassmann where we show our results are tight for a natural set of sparsifications
of the Grassmann graphs. We note for clarity that our results do not recover the characterization
of expansion used in the proof of the 2-2 Games Conjecture which relies on $\ell_\infty$ rather than
$\ell_2$-structure.

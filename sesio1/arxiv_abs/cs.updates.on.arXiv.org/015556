Security ceremonies still fail despite decades of efforts by researchers and practitioners. Attacks
are often a cunning amalgam of exploits for technical systems and of forms of human behaviour. For
example, this is the case with the recent news headline of a large-scale attack against Electrum
Bitcoin wallets, which manages to spread a malicious update of the wallet app. I therefore set out
to look at things through a different lens. I make the (metaphorical) hypothesis that human ancestors
arrived on Earth along with security ceremonies from a very far planet, the Cybersecurity planet.
My hypothesis continues, in that studying (by huge telescopes) the surface of Cybersecurity in
combination with the logical projection on that surface of what happens on Earth is beneficial for
us earthlings. I have spotted four cities so far on the remote planet. Democratic City features security
ceremonies that allow inhabitants to follow personal paths of practice and, for example, make errors
or be driven by emotions. By contrast, security ceremonies in Dictatorial City compel inhabitants
to comply, thus behaving like programmed automata. Security ceremonies in Beautiful City are so
beautiful that inhabitants just love to follow them precisely. Invisible City has security ceremonies
that are not perceivable, hence inhabitants feel like they never encounter any. Incidentally,
we use the words "democratic" and "dictatorial" without any political connotation. A key argument
I shall develop is that all cities but Democratic City address the human factor, albeit in different
ways. In the light of these findings, I will also discuss security ceremonies of our planet, such
as WhatsApp web login and flight boarding, and explore room for improving them based upon the current
understanding of Cybersecurity.

Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is currently the gold standard in COVID-19
diagnosis. It can, however, take days to provide the diagnosis, and false negative rate is relatively
high. Imaging, in particular chest computed tomography (CT), can assist with diagnosis and assessment
of this disease. Nevertheless, it is shown that standard dose CT scan gives significant radiation
burden to patients, especially those in need of multiple scans. In this study, we consider low-dose
and ultra-low-dose (LDCT and ULDCT) scan protocols that reduce the radiation exposure close to
that of a single X-Ray, while maintaining an acceptable resolution for diagnosis purposes. Since
thoracic radiology expertise may not be widely available during the pandemic, we develop an Artificial
Intelligence (AI)-based framework using a collected dataset of LDCT/ULDCT scans, to study the
hypothesis that the AI model can provide human-level performance. The AI model uses a two stage capsule
network architecture and can rapidly classify COVID-19, community acquired pneumonia (CAP),
and normal cases, using LDCT/ULDCT scans. The AI model achieves COVID-19 sensitivity of 89.5% +\-
0.11, CAP sensitivity of 95% +\- 0.11, normal cases sensitivity (specificity) of 85.7% +\- 0.16,
and accuracy of 90% +\- 0.06. By incorporating clinical data (demographic and symptoms), the performance
further improves to COVID-19 sensitivity of 94.3% +\- pm 0.05, CAP sensitivity of 96.7% +\- 0.07,
normal cases sensitivity (specificity) of 91% +\- 0.09 , and accuracy of 94.1% +\- 0.03. The proposed
AI model achieves human-level diagnosis based on the LDCT/ULDCT scans with reduced radiation exposure.
We believe that the proposed AI model has the potential to assist the radiologists to accurately
and promptly diagnose COVID-19 infection and help control the transmission chain during the pandemic.

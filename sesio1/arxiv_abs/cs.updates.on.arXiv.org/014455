Phylogenetic trees are leaf-labelled trees used to model the evolution of species. Here we explore
the practical impact of kernelization (i.e. data reduction) on the NP-hard problem of computing
the TBR distance between two unrooted binary phylogenetic trees. This problem is better-known
in the literature as the maximum agreement forest problem, where the goal is to partition the two
trees into a minimum number of common, non-overlapping subtrees. We have implemented two well-known
reduction rules, the subtree and chain reduction, and five more recent, theoretically stronger
reduction rules, and compare the reduction achieved with and without the stronger rules. We find
that the new rules yield smaller reduced instances and thus have clear practical added value. In
many cases they also cause the TBR distance to decrease in a controlled fashion. Next, we compare
the achieved reduction to the known worst-case theoretical bounds of 15k-9 and 11k-9 respectively,
on the number of leaves of the two reduced trees, where k is the TBR distance, observing in both cases
a far larger reduction in practice. As a by-product of our experimental framework we obtain a number
of new insights into the actual computation of TBR distance. We find, for example, that very strong
lower bounds on TBR distance can be obtained efficiently by randomly sampling certain carefully
constructed partitions of the leaf labels, and identify instances which seem particularly challenging
to solve exactly. The reduction rules have been implemented within our new solver Tubro which combines
kernelization with an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) approach. Tubro also incorporates a number
of additional features, such as a cluster reduction and a practical upper-bounding heuristic,
and it can leverage combinatorial insights emerging from the proofs of correctness of the reduction
rules to simplify the ILP.

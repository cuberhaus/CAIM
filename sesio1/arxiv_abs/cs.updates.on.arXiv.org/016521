Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) rely upon the iterative optimization of a parameterized
unitary circuit with respect to an objective function. Since quantum machines are noisy and expensive
resources, it is imperative to choose a VQA's ansatz appropriately and its initial parameters to
be close to optimal. This work tackles the problem of finding initial ansatz parameters by proposing
CAFQA, a Clifford ansatz for quantum accuracy. The CAFQA ansatz is a hardware-efficient circuit
built with only Clifford gates. In this ansatz, the initial parameters for the tunable gates are
chosen by searching efficiently through the Clifford parameter space via classical simulation,
thereby producing a suitable stabilizer state. The stabilizer states produced are shown to always
equal or outperform traditional classical initialization (e.g., Hartree-Fock), and often produce
high accuracy estimations prior to quantum exploration. Furthermore, the technique is classically
suited since a) Clifford circuits can be exactly simulated classically in polynomial time and b)
the discrete Clifford space, while scaling exponentially in the number of qubits, is searched efficiently
via Bayesian Optimization. For the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) task of molecular ground
state energy estimation up to 20 qubits, CAFQA's Clifford Ansatz achieves a mean accuracy of near
99%, recovering as much as 99.99% of the correlation energy over Hartree-Fock. Notably, the scalability
of the approach allows for preliminary ground state energy estimation of the challenging Chromium
dimer with an accuracy greater than Hartree-Fock. With CAFQA's initialization, VQA convergence
is accelerated by a factor of 2.5x. In all, this work shows that stabilizer states are an accurate
ansatz initialization for VQAs. Furthermore, it highlights the potential for quantum-inspired
classical techniques to support VQAs.

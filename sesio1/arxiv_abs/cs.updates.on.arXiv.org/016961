Safe collaboration between human and robots in a common unstructured environment becomes increasingly
critical with the emergence of Industry 4.0. However, to accomplish safe, robust, and autonomous
collaboration with humans, modern robotic systems must possess not only effective proximity perception
but also reactive obstacle avoidance. Unfortunately, for most robotic systems, their shared working
environment with human operators may not always be static, instead often dynamically varying and
being constantly cluttered with unanticipated obstacles or hazards. In this paper, we present
a novel methodology of reactive whole-body obstacle avoidance methodology that safeguards the
human who enters the robot's workspace through achieving conflict-free human-robot interactions
even in a dynamically constrained environment. Unlike existing Jacobian-type or geometric approaches,
our proposed methodology leverages both topological manifold learning and latest deep learning
advances, therefore can not only be readily generalized into other unseen problem settings, but
also achieve high computing efficiency with concrete theoretical basis. Furthermore, in sharp
contrast to the industrial cobot setting, our methodology allows a robotic arm to proactively avoid
obstacles of arbitrary 3D shapes without direct contacting. To solidify our study, we implement
and validate our methodology with a robotic platform consisting of dual 6-DoF robotic arms with
optimized proximity sensor placement, both of which are capable of working collaboratively with
different levels of interference. Specifically, one arm will perform reactive whole-body obstacle
avoidance while achieving its pre-determined objective, with the other arm emulating the presence
of a human collaborator with independent and potentially adversary movements.

Advances in service personalization are driven by low-cost data collection and processing, in
addition to the wide variety of third-party frameworks for authentication, storage, and marketing.
New privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California
Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), increasingly require organizations to explicitly state their data
practices in privacy policies. When data practices change, a new version of the policy is released.
This can occur a few times a year, when data collection or processing requirements are rapidly changing.
Consent evolution raises specific challenges to ensuring GDPR compliance. We propose a formal
consent framework to support organizations, data users and data subjects in their understanding
of policy evolution under a consent regime that supports both the retroactive and non-retroactive
granting and withdrawal of consent. The contributions include: (i) a formal framework to reason
about data collection and access under multiple consent granting and revocation scenarios; (ii)
a scripting language that implements the consent framework for encoding and executing different
scenarios; (iii) five consent evolution use cases that illustrate how organizations would evolve
their policies using this framework; and (iv) a scalability evaluation of the reasoning framework.
The framework models are used to verify when user consent prevents or detects unauthorized data
collection and access. The framework can be integrated into a runtime architecture to monitor policy
violations as data practices evolve in real-time. The framework was evaluated using the five use
cases and a simulation to measure the framework scalability. The simulation results show that the
approach is computationally scalable for use in runtime consent monitoring under a standard model
of data collection and access, and practice and policy evolution.

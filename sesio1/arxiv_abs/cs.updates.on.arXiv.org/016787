Personalized PageRank (PPR) is a popular node proximity metric in graph mining and network research.
Given a graph G=(V,E) and a source node $s \in V$, a single-source PPR (SSPPR) query asks for the PPR
value $\vpi(u)$ with respect to s, which represents the relative importance of node u in the context
of the source node s. Among existing algorithms for SSPPR queries, LocalPush is a fundamental method
which serves as a cornerstone for subsequent algorithms. In LocalPush, a push operation is a crucial
primitive operation, which distributes the probability at a node u to ALL u's neighbors via the corresponding
edges. Although this push operation works well on unweighted graphs, unfortunately, it can be rather
inefficient on weighted graphs. In particular, on unbalanced weighted graphs where only a few of
these edges take the majority of the total weight among them, the push operation would have to distribute
insignificant probabilities along those edges which just take the minor weights, resulting in
expensive overhead. To resolve this issue, we propose the EdgePush algorithm, a novel method for
computing SSPPR queries on weighted graphs. EdgePush decomposes the aforementioned push operations
in edge-based push, allowing the algorithm to operate at the edge level granularity. Hence, it can
flexibly distribute the probabilities according to edge weights. Furthermore, our EdgePush allows
a fine-grained termination threshold for each individual edge, leading to a superior complexity
over LocalPush. Notably, we prove that EdgePush improves the theoretical query cost of LocalPush
by an order of up to O(n) when the graph's weights are unbalanced, both in terms of $\ell_1$-error
and normalized additive error. Our experimental results demonstrate that EdgePush significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of query efficiency on large motif-based and
real-world weighted graphs.

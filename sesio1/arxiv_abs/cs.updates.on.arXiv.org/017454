Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) is a new approach to conceptualizing and measuring democracy and
politics. It has information for 200 countries and is one of the biggest databases for political
science. According to the V-Dem annual democracy report 2019, Taiwan is one of the two countries
that got disseminated false information from foreign governments the most. It also shows that the
"made-up news" has caused a great deal of confusion in Taiwanese society and has serious impacts
on global stability. Although there are several applications helping distinguish the false information,
we found out that the pre-processing of categorizing the news is still done by human labor. However,
human labor may cause mistakes and cannot work for a long time. The growing demands for automatic
machines in the near decades show that while the machine can do as good as humans or even better, using
machines can reduce humans' burden and cut down costs. Therefore, in this work, we build a predictive
model to classify the category of news. The corpora we used contains 28358 news and 200 news scraped
from the online newspaper Liberty Times Net (LTN) website and includes 8 categories: Technology,
Entertainment, Fashion, Politics, Sports, International, Finance, and Health. At first, we use
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) for word embeddings which transform
each Chinese character into a (1,768) vector. Then, we use a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layer
to transform word embeddings into sentence embeddings and add another LSTM layer to transform them
into document embeddings. Each document embedding is an input for the final predicting model, which
contains two Dense layers and one Activation layer. And each document embedding is transformed
into 1 vector with 8 real numbers, then the highest one will correspond to the 8 news categories with
up to 99% accuracy.

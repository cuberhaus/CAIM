Remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a fast, effective, inexpensive and convenient method for
collecting biometric data as it enables vital signs estimation using face videos. Remote contactless
medical service provisioning has proven to be a dire necessity during the COVID-19 pandemic. We
propose an end-to-end framework to measure people's vital signs including Heart Rate (HR), Heart
Rate Variability (HRV), Oxygen Saturation (SpO2) and Blood Pressure (BP) based on the rPPG methodology
from the video of a user's face captured with a smartphone camera. We extract face landmarks with
a deep learning-based neural network model in real-time. Multiple face patches also called Region-of-Interests
(RoIs) are extracted by using the predicted face landmarks. Several filters are applied to reduce
the noise from the RoIs in the extracted cardiac signals called Blood Volume Pulse (BVP) signal.
We trained and validated machine learning models using two public rPPG datasets namely the TokyoTech
rPPG and the Pulse Rate Detection (PURE) datasets, on which our models achieved the following Mean
Absolute Errors (MAE): a) for HR, 1.73 and 3.95 Beats-Per-Minute (bpm) respectively, b) for HRV,
18.55 and 25.03 ms respectively, and c) for SpO2, a MAE of 1.64 on the PURE dataset. We validated our
end-to-end rPPG framework, ReViSe, in real life environment, and thereby created the Video-HR
dataset. Our HR estimation model achieved a MAE of 2.49 bpm on this dataset. Since no publicly available
rPPG datasets existed for BP measurement with face videos, we used a dataset with signals from fingertip
sensor to train our model and also created our own video dataset, Video-BP. On our Video-BP dataset,
our BP estimation model achieved a MAE of 6.7 mmHg for Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP), and a MAE of 9.6
mmHg for Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP).

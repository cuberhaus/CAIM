Millions of particles are collided every second at the LHCb detector placed inside the Large Hadron
Collider at CERN. The particles produced as a result of these collisions pass through various detecting
devices which will produce a combined raw data rate of up to 40 Tbps by 2021. These data will be fed through
a data acquisition system which reconstructs individual particles and filters the collision events
in real time. This process will occur in a heterogeneous farm employing exclusively off-the-shelf
CPU and GPU hardware, in a two stage process known as High Level Trigger. The reconstruction of charged
particle trajectories in physics detectors, also referred to as track reconstruction or tracking,
determines the position, charge and momentum of particles as they pass through detectors. The Vertex
Locator subdetector (VELO) is the closest such detector to the beamline, placed outside of the region
where the LHCb magnet produces a sizable magnetic field. It is used to reconstruct straight particle
trajectories which serve as seeds for reconstruction of other subdetectors and to locate collision
vertices. The VELO subdetector will detect up to 1000 million particles every second, which need
to be reconstructed in real time in the High Level Trigger. We present Search by triplet, an efficient
track reconstruction algorithm. Our algorithm is designed to run efficiently across parallel
architectures. We extend on previous work and explain the algorithm evolution since its inception.
We show the scaling of our algorithm under various situations, and analyze its amortized time in
terms of complexity for each of its constituent parts and profile its performance. Our algorithm
is the current state-of-the-art in VELO track reconstruction on SIMT architectures, and we qualify
its improvements over previous results.

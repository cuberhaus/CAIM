The recent development of artificial intelligence (AI) has increased the interest of researchers
and practitioners towards applying its techniques into multiple domains like automotive, health
care and air space to achieve automation. Combined to these applications, the attempt to use AI techniques
into carrying out safety issues is momentarily at a progressive state. As AI problems are getting
even more complex, large processing power is demanded for safety-critical systems to fulfill real-time
requirements. These challenges can be solved through edge or cloud computing, which makes the communication
an integral part of the solution. This study aims at providing a comprehensive picture of the state
of the art AI based safety solutions that uses different communication technologies in diverse
application domains. To achieve this, a systematic mapping study is conducted and 565 relevant
papers are shortlisted through a multistage selection process, which are then analyzed according
to a systematically defined classification framework. The results of the study are based on these
main objectives: to clarify current research gaps in the field, to identify the possibility of increased
usage of cellular communication in multiple domains, to identify the mostly used AI algorithms
and to summarize the emerging future research trends on the topic. The results demonstrate that
automotive domain is the one applying AI and communication the most to implement safety and the most
used AI in this domain is neural networks, clustering and computer vision; applying cellular communication
to automotive domain is highest; the use of non-cellular communication technologies is dominant
however a clear trend of a rapid increase in the use of cellular communication is observed specially
from 2020 with the roll-out of 5G technology.

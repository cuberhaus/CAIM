Pixel-level analysis of blood images plays a pivotal role in diagnosing blood-related diseases,
especially Anaemia. These analyses mainly rely on an accurate diagnosis of morphological deformities
like shape, size, and precise pixel counting. In traditional segmentation approaches, instance
or object-based approaches have been adopted that are not feasible for pixel-level analysis. The
convolutional neural network (CNN) model required a large dataset with detailed pixel-level information
for the semantic segmentation of red blood cells in the deep learning domain. In current research
work, we address these problems by proposing a multi-level deep convolutional encoder-decoder
network along with two state-of-the-art healthy and Anaemic-RBC datasets. The proposed multi-level
CNN model preserved pixel-level semantic information extracted in one layer and then passed to
the next layer to choose relevant features. This phenomenon helps to precise pixel-level counting
of healthy and anaemic-RBC elements along with morphological analysis. For experimental purposes,
we proposed two state-of-the-art RBC datasets, i.e., Healthy-RBCs and Anaemic-RBCs dataset.
Each dataset contains 1000 images, ground truth masks, relevant, complete blood count (CBC), and
morphology reports for performance evaluation. The proposed model results were evaluated using
crossmatch analysis with ground truth mask by finding IoU, individual training, validation, testing
accuracies, and global accuracies using a 05-fold training procedure. This model got training,
validation, and testing accuracies as 0.9856, 0.9760, and 0.9720 on the Healthy-RBC dataset and
0.9736, 0.9696, and 0.9591 on an Anaemic-RBC dataset. The IoU and BFScore of the proposed model were
0.9311, 0.9138, and 0.9032, 0.8978 on healthy and anaemic datasets, respectively.

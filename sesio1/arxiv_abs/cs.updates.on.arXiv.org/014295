Accurately segmenting teeth and identifying the corresponding anatomical landmarks on dental
mesh models are essential in computer-aided orthodontic treatment. Manually performing these
two tasks is time-consuming, tedious, and, more importantly, highly dependent on orthodontists'
experiences due to the abnormality and large-scale variance of patients' teeth. Some machine learning-based
methods have been designed and applied in the orthodontic field to automatically segment dental
meshes (e.g., intraoral scans). In contrast, the number of studies on tooth landmark localization
is still limited. This paper proposes a two-stage framework based on mesh deep learning (called
TS-MDL) for joint tooth labeling and landmark identification on raw intraoral scans. Our TS-MDL
first adopts an end-to-end \emph{i}MeshSegNet method (i.e., a variant of the existing MeshSegNet
with both improved accuracy and efficiency) to label each tooth on the downsampled scan. Guided
by the segmentation outputs, our TS-MDL further selects each tooth's region of interest (ROI) on
the original mesh to construct a light-weight variant of the pioneering PointNet (i.e., PointNet-Reg)
for regressing the corresponding landmark heatmaps. Our TS-MDL was evaluated on a real-clinical
dataset, showing promising segmentation and localization performance. Specifically, \emph{i}MeshSegNet
in the first stage of TS-MDL reached an averaged Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) at $0.953\pm0.076$,
significantly outperforming the original MeshSegNet. In the second stage, PointNet-Reg achieved
a mean absolute error (MAE) of $0.623\pm0.718 \, mm$ in distances between the prediction and ground
truth for $44$ landmarks, which is superior compared with other networks for landmark detection.
All these results suggest the potential usage of our TS-MDL in clinical practices.

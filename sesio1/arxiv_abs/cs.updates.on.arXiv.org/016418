Medical diagnosis assistant (MDA) aims to build an interactive diagnostic agent to sequentially
inquire about symptoms for discriminating diseases. However, since the dialogue records used
to build a patient simulator are collected passively, the data might be deteriorated by some task-unrelated
biases, such as the preference of the collectors. These biases might hinder the diagnostic agent
to capture transportable knowledge from the simulator. This work attempts to address these critical
issues in MDA by taking advantage of the causal diagram to identify and resolve two representative
non-causal biases, i.e., (i) default-answer bias and (ii) distributional inquiry bias. Specifically,
Bias (i) originates from the patient simulator which tries to answer the unrecorded inquiries with
some biased default answers. Consequently, the diagnostic agents cannot fully demonstrate their
advantages due to the biased answers. To eliminate this bias and inspired by the propensity score
matching technique with causal diagram, we propose a propensity-based patient simulator to effectively
answer unrecorded inquiry by drawing knowledge from the other records; Bias (ii) inherently comes
along with the passively collected data, and is one of the key obstacles for training the agent towards
"learning how" rather than "remembering what". For example, within the distribution of training
data, if a symptom is highly coupled with a certain disease, the agent might learn to only inquire
about that symptom to discriminate that disease, thus might not generalize to the out-of-distribution
cases. To this end, we propose a progressive assurance agent, which includes the dual processes
accounting for symptom inquiry and disease diagnosis respectively. The inquiry process is driven
by the diagnosis process in a top-down manner to inquire about symptoms for enhancing diagnostic
confidence.

Discrete gene regulatory networks (GRNs) play a vital role in the study of robustness and modularity.
A common method of evaluating the robustness of GRNs is to measure their ability to regulate a set
of perturbed gene activation patterns back to their unperturbed forms. Usually, perturbations
are obtained by collecting random samples produced by a predefined distribution of gene activation
patterns. This sampling method introduces stochasticity, in turn inducing dynamicity. This dynamicity
is imposed on top of an already complex fitness landscape. So where sampling is used, it is important
to understand which effects arise from the structure of the fitness landscape, and which arise from
the dynamicity imposed on it. Stochasticity of the fitness function also causes difficulties in
reproducibility and in post-experimental analyses. We develop a deterministic distributional
fitness evaluation by considering the complete distribution of gene activity patterns, so as to
avoid stochasticity in fitness assessment. This fitness evaluation facilitates repeatability.
Its determinism permits us to ascertain theoretical bounds on the fitness, and thus to identify
whether the algorithm has reached a global optimum. It enables us to differentiate the effects of
the problem domain from those of the noisy fitness evaluation, and thus to resolve two remaining
anomalies in the behaviour of the problem domain of~\citet{espinosa2010specialization}. We
also reveal some properties of solution GRNs that lead them to be robust and modular, leading to a
deeper understanding of the nature of the problem domain. We conclude by discussing potential directions
toward simulating and understanding the emergence of modularity in larger, more complex domains,
which is key both to generating more useful modular solutions, and to understanding the ubiquity
of modularity in biological systems.

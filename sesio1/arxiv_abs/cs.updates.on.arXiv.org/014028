Small magnitude earthquakes are the most abundant but the most difficult to locate robustly and
well due to their low amplitudes and high frequencies usually obscured by heterogeneous noise sources.
They highlight crucial information about the stress state and the spatio-temporal behavior of
fault systems during the earthquake cycle, therefore, its full characterization is then crucial
for improving earthquake hazard assessment. Modern DL algorithms along with the increasing computational
power are exploiting the continuously growing seismological databases, allowing scientists
to improve the completeness for earthquake catalogs, systematically detecting smaller magnitude
earthquakes and reducing the errors introduced mainly by human intervention. In this work, we introduce
OKSP, a novel automatic earthquake detection pipeline for seismic monitoring in Costa Rica. Using
Kabre supercomputer from the Costa Rica High Technology Center, we applied OKSP to the day before
and the first 5 days following the Puerto Armuelles, M6.5, earthquake that occurred on 26 June, 2019,
along the Costa Rica-Panama border and found 1100 more earthquakes previously unidentified by
the Volcanological and Seismological Observatory of Costa Rica. From these events, a total of 23
earthquakes with magnitudes below 1.0 occurred a day to hours prior to the mainshock, shedding light
about the rupture initiation and earthquake interaction leading to the occurrence of this productive
seismic sequence. Our observations show that for the study period, the model was 100% exhaustive
and 82% precise, resulting in an F1 score of 0.90. This effort represents the very first attempt for
automatically detecting earthquakes in Costa Rica using deep learning methods and demonstrates
that, in the near future, earthquake monitoring routines will be carried out entirely by AI algorithms.

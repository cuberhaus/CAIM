Recently, Vision Transformer (ViT) has continuously established new milestones in the computer
vision field, while the high computation and memory cost makes its propagation in industrial production
difficult. Pruning, a traditional model compression paradigm for hardware efficiency, has been
widely applied in various DNN structures. Nevertheless, it stays ambiguous on how to perform exclusive
pruning on the ViT structure. Considering three key points: the structural characteristics, the
internal data pattern of ViTs, and the related edge device deployment, we leverage the input token
sparsity and propose a computation-aware soft pruning framework, which can be set up on vanilla
Transformers of both flatten and CNN-type structures, such as Pooling-based ViT (PiT). More concretely,
we design a dynamic attention-based multi-head token selector, which is a lightweight module for
adaptive instance-wise token selection. We further introduce a soft pruning technique, which
integrates the less informative tokens generated by the selector module into a package token that
will participate in subsequent calculations rather than being completely discarded. Our framework
is bound to the trade-off between accuracy and computation constraints of specific edge devices
through our proposed computation-aware training strategy. Experimental results show that our
framework significantly reduces the computation cost of ViTs while maintaining comparable performance
on image classification. Moreover, our framework can guarantee the identified model to meet resource
specifications of mobile devices and FPGA, and even achieve the real-time execution of DeiT-T on
mobile platforms. For example, our method reduces the latency of DeiT-T to 26 ms (26%$\sim $41% superior
to existing works) on the mobile device with 0.25%$\sim $4% higher top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. Our
code will be released soon.

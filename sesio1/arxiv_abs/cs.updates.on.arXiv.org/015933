Featuring the fast response and flexibility in control allocation, an electric vehicle with in-wheel
motors is a good platform for implementing advanced vehicle dynamics control. Among many active
safety functions of an in-wheel motor driven vehicle (IMDV), lateral stability control is a key
technology, which can be realized through torque vectoring. To further advance the lateral stabilization
performance of the IMDV, in this paper a novel data-driven nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC)
is proposed based the recurrent high-order neural network (RHONN) modelling method. First, the
new RHONN model is developed to represent vehicle's nonlinear dynamic behaviors. Different from
the conventional physics-based modelling method, the RHONN model only needs data and forms high-order
polynomials. Based on the RHONN model, the steady-state responses of vehicle's yaw rate and sideslip
angle are iteratively optimized and set as the control objectives for low-level controller, aiming
to improve the system robustness. Besides, a nonlinear model predictive controller is designed
based on the RHONN, which is expected to improve the prediction accuracy during the receding horizon
control. Further, a constrained optimization problem is formulated to derive the required yaw
moment for vehicle lateral dynamics stabilization. Finally, the performance of the developed
RHONN-based nonlinear MPC is validated on an IMDV in the CarSim/Simulink simulation environment.
The validation results show that the developed approach outperforms the conventional method,
and further improves the stable margin of the system. It is able to enhance the lateral stabilization
performance of the IMDV under various driving scenarios, demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness
of the proposed approach.

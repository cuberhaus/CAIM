There has been increasing interest in smart factories powered by robotics systems to tackle repetitive,
laborious tasks. One impactful yet challenging task in robotics-powered smart factory applications
is robotic grasping: using robotic arms to grasp objects autonomously in different settings. Robotic
grasping requires a variety of computer vision tasks such as object detection, segmentation, grasp
prediction, pick planning, etc. While significant progress has been made in leveraging of machine
learning for robotic grasping, particularly with deep learning, a big challenge remains in the
need for large-scale, high-quality RGBD datasets that cover a wide diversity of scenarios and permutations.
To tackle this big, diverse data problem, we are inspired by the recent rise in the concept of metaverse,
which has greatly closed the gap between virtual worlds and the physical world. Metaverses allow
us to create digital twins of real-world manufacturing scenarios and to virtually create different
scenarios from which large volumes of data can be generated for training models. In this paper, we
present MetaGraspNet: a large-scale benchmark dataset for vision-driven robotic grasping via
physics-based metaverse synthesis. The proposed dataset contains 100,000 images and 25 different
object types and is split into 5 difficulties to evaluate object detection and segmentation model
performance in different grasping scenarios. We also propose a new layout-weighted performance
metric alongside the dataset for evaluating object detection and segmentation performance in
a manner that is more appropriate for robotic grasp applications compared to existing general-purpose
performance metrics. Our benchmark dataset is available open-source on Kaggle, with the first
phase consisting of detailed object detection, segmentation, layout annotations, and a layout-weighted
performance metric script.

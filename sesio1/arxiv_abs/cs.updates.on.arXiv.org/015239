Traffic forecasting is a problem of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and crucial for individuals
and public agencies. Therefore, researches pay great attention to deal with the complex spatio-temporal
dependencies of traffic system for accurate forecasting. However, there are two challenges: 1)
Most traffic forecasting studies mainly focus on modeling correlations of neighboring sensors
and ignore correlations of remote sensors, e.g., business districts with similar spatio-temporal
patterns; 2) Prior methods which use static adjacency matrix in graph convolutional networks (GCNs)
are not enough to reflect the dynamic spatial dependence in traffic system. Moreover, fine-grained
methods which use self-attention to model dynamic correlations of all sensors ignore hierarchical
information in road networks and have quadratic computational complexity. In this paper, we propose
a novel dynamic multi-graph convolution recurrent network (DMGCRN) to tackle above issues, which
can model the spatial correlations of distance, the spatial correlations of structure, and the
temporal correlations simultaneously. We not only use the distance-based graph to capture spatial
information from nodes are close in distance but also construct a novel latent graph which encoded
the structure correlations among roads to capture spatial information from nodes are similar in
structure. Furthermore, we divide the neighbors of each sensor into coarse-grained regions, and
dynamically assign different weights to each region at different times. Meanwhile, we integrate
the dynamic multi-graph convolution network into the gated recurrent unit (GRU) to capture temporal
dependence. Extensive experiments on three real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that our
proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

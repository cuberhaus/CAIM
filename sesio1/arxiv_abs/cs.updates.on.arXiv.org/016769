We present a new machine learning based bed-occupancy detection system that uses the accelerometer
signal captured by a bed-attached consumer smartphone. Automatic bed-occupancy detection is
necessary for automatic long-term cough monitoring, since the time which the monitored patient
occupies the bed is required to accurately calculate a cough rate. Accelerometer measurements
are more cost effective and less intrusive than alternatives such as video monitoring or pressure
sensors. A 249-hour dataset of manually-labelled acceleration signals gathered from seven patients
undergoing treatment for tuberculosis (TB) was compiled for experimentation. These signals are
characterised by brief activity bursts interspersed with long periods of little or no activity,
even when the bed is occupied. To process them effectively, we propose an architecture consisting
of three interconnected components. An occupancy-change detector locates instances at which
bed occupancy is likely to have changed, an occupancy-interval detector classifies periods between
detected occupancy changes and an occupancy-state detector corrects falsely-identified occupancy
changes. Using long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, this architecture was demonstrated to
achieve an AUC of 0.94. When integrated into a complete cough monitoring system, the daily cough
rate of a patient undergoing TB treatment was determined over a period of 14 days. As the colony forming
unit (CFU) counts decreased and the time to positivity (TPP) increased, the measured cough rate
decreased, indicating effective TB treatment. This provides a first indication that automatic
cough monitoring based on bed-mounted accelerometer measurements may present a non-invasive,
non-intrusive and cost-effective means of monitoring long-term recovery of TB patients.

Evaluation of researchers' output is vital for hiring committees and funding bodies, and it is usually
measured via their scientific productivity, citations, or a combined metric such as h-index. Assessing
young researchers is more critical because it takes a while to get citations and increment of h-index.
Hence, predicting the h-index can help to discover the researchers' scientific impact. In addition,
identifying the influential factors to predict the scientific impact is helpful for researchers
seeking solutions to improve it. This study investigates the effect of author, paper and venue-specific
features on the future h-index. For this purpose, we used machine learning methods to predict the
h-index and feature analysis techniques to advance the understanding of feature impact. Utilizing
the bibliometric data in Scopus, we defined and extracted two main groups of features. The first
relates to prior scientific impact, and we name it 'prior impact-based features' and includes the
number of publications, received citations, and h-index. The second group is 'non-impact-based
features' and contains the features related to author, co-authorship, paper, and venue characteristics.
We explored their importance in predicting h-index for researchers in three different career phases.
Also, we examine the temporal dimension of predicting performance for different feature categories
to find out which features are more reliable for long- and short-term prediction. We referred to
the gender of the authors to examine the role of this author's characteristics in the prediction
task. Our findings showed that gender has a very slight effect in predicting the h-index. We found
that non-impact-based features are more robust predictors for younger scholars than seniors in
the short term. Also, prior impact-based features lose their power to predict more than other features
in the long-term.

Background: A preliminary study we conducted showed that software practitioners respond to requirements
changes(RCs) with different emotions, and that their emotions vary at stages of the RC handling
life cycle, such as receiving, developing, and delivering RCs. Objective: We wanted to study more
comprehensively how practitioners emotionally respond to RCs. Method: We conducted a world-wide
survey with the participation of 201 software practitioners. In our survey, we used the Job-related
Affective Well-being Scale (JAWS) and open-ended questions to capture participants emotions
when handling RCs in their work and query about the different circumstances when they feel these
emotions. We used a combined approach of statistical analysis, JAWS, and Socio-Technical Grounded
Theory (STGT) for Data Analysis to analyse our survey data. Findings: We identified (1) emotional
responses to RCs, i.e., the most common emotions felt by practitioners when handling RCs; (2) different
stimuli -- such as the RC, the practitioner, team, manager, customer -- that trigger these emotions
through their own different characteristics; (3)emotion dynamics, i.e., the changes in emotions
during the project and RC handling life cycles; (4) distinct events where particular emotions are
triggered:project milestones, and RC stages; (5) and time related matters that regulate the emotion
dynamics. Conclusion: Practitioners are not pleased with receiving RCs all the time. Last minute
RCs introduced closer to a deadline especially violate emotional well-being of practitioners.
We present some practical recommendations for practitioners to follow, including a dual-purpose
emotion-centric decision guide to help decide when to introduce or accept an RC, and some future
key research directions.

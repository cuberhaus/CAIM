A search engine maintains local copies of different web pages to provide quick search results. This
local cache is kept up-to-date by a web crawler that frequently visits these different pages to track
changes in them. Ideally, the local copy should be updated as soon as a page changes on the web. However,
finite bandwidth availability and server restrictions limit how frequently different pages can
be crawled. This brings forth the following optimization problem: maximize the freshness of the
local cache subject to the crawling frequencies being within prescribed bounds. While tractable
algorithms do exist to solve this problem, these either assume the knowledge of exact page change
rates or use inefficient methods such as MLE for estimating the same. We address this issue here.
We provide three novel schemes for online estimation of page change rates, all of which have extremely
low running times per iteration. The first is based on the law of large numbers and the second on stochastic
approximation. The third is an extension of the second and includes a heavy-ball momentum term.
All these schemes only need partial information about the page change process, i.e., they only need
to know if the page has changed or not since the last crawled instance. Our main theoretical results
concern asymptotic convergence and convergence rates of these three schemes. In fact, our work
is the first to show convergence of the original stochastic heavy-ball method when neither the gradient
nor the noise variance is uniformly bounded. We also provide some numerical experiments (based
on real and synthetic data) to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed estimators over existing
ones such as MLE. We emphasize that our algorithms are also readily applicable to the synchronization
of databases and network inventory management.

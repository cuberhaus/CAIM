With the increasing adoption of data-hungry machine learning algorithms, personal data privacy
has emerged as one of the key concerns that could hinder the success of digital transformation. As
such, Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning (PPML) has received much attention from both academia
and industry. However, organizations are faced with the dilemma that, on the one hand, they are encouraged
to share data to enhance ML performance, but on the other hand, they could potentially be breaching
the relevant data privacy regulations. Practical PPML typically allows multiple participants
to individually train their ML models, which are then aggregated to construct a global model in a
privacy-preserving manner, e.g., based on multi-party computation or homomorphic encryption.
Nevertheless, in most important applications of large-scale PPML, e.g., by aggregating clients'
gradients to update a global model for federated learning, such as consumer behavior modeling of
mobile application services, some participants are inevitably resource-constrained mobile
devices, which may drop out of the PPML system due to their mobility nature. Therefore, the resilience
of privacy-preserving aggregation has become an important problem to be tackled. In this paper,
we propose a scalable privacy-preserving aggregation scheme that can tolerate dropout by participants
at any time, and is secure against both semi-honest and active malicious adversaries by setting
proper system parameters. By replacing communication-intensive building blocks with a seed homomorphic
pseudo-random generator, and relying on the additive homomorphic property of Shamir secret sharing
scheme, our scheme outperforms state-of-the-art schemes by up to 6.37$\times$ in runtime and provides
a stronger dropout-resilience. The simplicity of our scheme makes it attractive both for implementation
and for further improvements.

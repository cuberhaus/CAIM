The outbreak of COVID-19 forced schools to swiftly transition from in-person classes to online
or remote offerings, making educators and learners alike rely on online videoconferencing platforms.
Platforms like Zoom offer audio-visual channels of communication and include features that are
designed to approximate the classroom experience. However, it is not clear how students' learning
experiences are affected by affordances of the videoconferencing platforms or what underlying
factors explain the differential effects of these affordances on class experiences of engagement,
interaction, and satisfaction. In order to find out, we conducted two online survey studies: Study
1 (N = 176) investigated the effects of three types of videoconferencing affordances (i.e., modality,
interactivity, and agency affordances) on class experience during the first two months after the
transition to online learning. Results showed that usage of the three kinds of affordances was positively
correlated with students' class engagement, interaction, and satisfaction. Perceived anonymity,
nonverbal cues, and comfort level were found to be the key mediators. In addition, students' usage
of video cameras in class was influenced by their classmates. Study 2 (N = 256) tested the proposed
relationships at a later stage of the pandemic and found similar results, thus serving as a constructive
replication. This paper focuses on reporting the results of Study 1 since it captures the timely
reactions from students when they first went online, and the second study plays a supplementary
role in verifying Study 1 and thereby extending its external validity. Together, the two studies
provide insights for instructors on how to leverage different videoconferencing affordances
to enhance the virtual learning experience. Design implications for digital tools in online education
are also discussed.

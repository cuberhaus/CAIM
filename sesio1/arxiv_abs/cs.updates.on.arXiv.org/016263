We study iterative methods based on Krylov subspaces for low-rank approximation under any Schatten-$p$
norm. Here, given access to a matrix $A$ through matrix-vector products, an accuracy parameter
$\epsilon$, and a target rank $k$, the goal is to find a rank-$k$ matrix $Z$ with orthonormal columns
such that $\| A(I -ZZ^\top)\|_{S_p} \leq (1+\epsilon)\min_{U^\top U = I_k} \|A(I - U U^\top)\|_{S_p}$,
where $\|M\|_{S_p}$ denotes the $\ell_p$ norm of the the singular values of $M$. For the special
cases of $p=2$ (Frobenius norm) and $p = \infty$ (Spectral norm), Musco and Musco (NeurIPS 2015)
obtained an algorithm based on Krylov methods that uses $\tilde{O}(k/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ matrix-vector
products, improving on the na\"ive $\tilde{O}(k/\epsilon)$ dependence obtainable by the power
method, where $\tilde{O}$ suppresses poly$(\log(dk/\epsilon))$ factors. Our main result is
an algorithm that uses only $\tilde{O}(kp^{1/6}/\epsilon^{1/3})$ matrix-vector products,
and works for all $p \geq 1$. For $p = 2$ our bound improves the previous $\tilde{O}(k/\epsilon^{1/2})$
bound to $\tilde{O}(k/\epsilon^{1/3})$. Since the Schatten-$p$ and Schatten-$\infty$ norms
are the same up to a $1+ \epsilon$ factor when $p \geq (\log d)/\epsilon$, our bound recovers the result
of Musco and Musco for $p = \infty$. Further, we prove a matrix-vector query lower bound of $\Omega(1/\epsilon^{1/3})$
for any fixed constant $p \geq 1$, showing that surprisingly $\tilde{\Theta}(1/\epsilon^{1/3})$
is the optimal complexity for constant~$k$. To obtain our results, we introduce several new techniques,
including optimizing over multiple Krylov subspaces simultaneously, and pinching inequalities
for partitioned operators. Our lower bound for $p \in [1,2]$ uses the Araki-Lieb-Thirring trace
inequality, whereas for $p>2$, we appeal to a norm-compression inequality for aligned partitioned
operators.

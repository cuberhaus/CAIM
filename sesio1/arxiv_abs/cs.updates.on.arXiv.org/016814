Low-order thermoacoustic models are qualitatively correct, but they are typically quantitatively
inaccurate. We propose a time-domain bias-aware method to make qualitatively low--order models
quantitatively (more) accurate. First, we develop a Bayesian ensemble data assimilation method
for a low-order model to self-adapt and self-correct any time that reference data becomes available.
Second, we apply the methodology to infer the thermoacoustic states and heat release parameters
on the fly without storing data (real-time). We perform twin experiments using synthetic acoustic
pressure measurements to analyse the performance of data assimilation in all nonlinear thermoacoustic
regimes, from limit cycles to chaos, and interpret the results physically. Third, we propose practical
rules for thermoacoustic data assimilation. An increase, reject, inflate strategy is proposed
to deal with the rich nonlinear behaviour; and physical time scales for assimilation are proposed
in non-chaotic regimes (with the Nyquist-Shannon criterion) and in chaotic regimes (with the Lyapunov
time). Fourth, we perform data assimilation using data from a higher-fidelity model. We introduce
an echo state network to estimate in real-time the forecast bias, which is the model error of the low-fidelity
model. We show that (i) the correct acoustic pressure, parameters, and model bias can be accurately
inferred; (ii) the learning is robust as it can tackle large uncertainties in the observations (up
to 50% the mean values); (iii) the uncertainty of the prediction and parameters is naturally part
of the output; and (iv) both the time-accurate solution and statistics can be successfully inferred.
Data assimilation opens up new possibility for real-time prediction of thermoacoustics by synergistically
combining physical knowledge and experimental data.

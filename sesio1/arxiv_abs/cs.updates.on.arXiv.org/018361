In a multi-party fair coin-flipping protocol, the parties output a common (close to) unbiased bit,
even when some adversarial parties try to bias the output. In this work we focus on the case of an arbitrary
number of corrupted parties. Cleve [STOC 1986] has shown that in any such $m$-round coin-flipping
protocol, the corrupted parties can bias the honest parties' common output bit by $\Theta(1/m)$.
For more than two decades, the best known coin-flipping protocol was the one of Awerbuch et al. [Manuscript
1985], who presented a $t$-party, $m$-round protocol with bias $\Theta(t/\sqrt{m})$. This was
changed by the breakthrough result of Moran et al. [TCC 2009], who constructed an $m$-round, two-party
coin-flipping protocol with optimal bias $\Theta(1/m)$. Haitner and Tsfadia [STOC 2014] constructed
an $m$-round, three-party coin-flipping protocol with bias $O(\log^3m / m)$. Still for the case
of more than three parties, the best known protocol remained the $\Theta(t/\sqrt{m})$-bias protocol
of Awerbuch et al. We make a step towards eliminating the above gap, presenting a $t$-party, $m$-round
coin-flipping protocol, with bias $O(\frac{t^4 \cdot 2^t \cdot \sqrt{\log m}}{m^{1/2+1/\left(2^{t-1}-2\right)}})$
for any $t\le \tfrac12 \log\log m$. This improves upon the $\Theta(t/\sqrt{m})$-bias protocol
of Awerbuch et al., and in particular, for $t\in O(1)$ it is an $1/m^{\frac12 + \Theta(1)}$-bias
protocol. For the three-party case, it is an $O(\sqrt{\log m}/m)$-bias protocol, improving over
the $O(\log^3m / m)$-bias protocol of Haitner and Tsfadia. Our protocol generalizes that of Haitner
and Tsfadia, by presenting an appropriate recovery protocol for the remaining parties to interact
in, in the case that some parties abort or are caught cheating. We prove the fairness of the new protocol
by presenting a new paradigm for analyzing fairness of coin-flipping protocols.

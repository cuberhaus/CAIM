A major challenge in obtaining evaluations of products or services on e-commerce platforms is eliciting
informative responses in the absence of verifiability. This paper proposes the Square Root Agreement
Rule (SRA): a simple reward mechanism that incentivizes truthful responses to objective evaluations
on such platforms. In this mechanism, an agent gets a reward for an evaluation only if her answer matches
that of her peer, where this reward is inversely proportional to a popularity index of the answer.
This index is defined to be the square root of the empirical frequency at which any two agents performing
the same evaluation agree on the particular answer across evaluations of similar entities operating
on the platform. Rarely agreed-upon answers thus earn a higher reward than answers for which agreements
are relatively more common. We show that in the many tasks regime, the truthful equilibrium under
SRA is strictly payoff-dominant across large classes of natural equilibria that could arise in
these settings, thus increasing the likelihood of its adoption. While there exist other mechanisms
achieving such guarantees, they either impose additional assumptions on the response distribution
that are not generally satisfied for objective evaluations or they incentivize truthful behavior
only if each agent performs a prohibitively large number of evaluations and commits to using the
same strategy for each evaluation. SRA is the first known incentive mechanism satisfying such guarantees
without imposing any such requirements. Moreover, our empirical findings demonstrate the robustness
of the incentive properties of SRA in the presence of mild subjectivity or observational biases
in the responses. These properties make SRA uniquely attractive for administering reward-based
incentive schemes (e.g., rebates, discounts, reputation scores, etc.) on online platforms.

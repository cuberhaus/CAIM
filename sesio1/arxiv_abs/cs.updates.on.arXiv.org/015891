For distributed protocols involving many servers, assuming that they do not collude with each other
makes some secrecy problems solvable and reduces overheads and computational hardness assumptions
in others. While the non-collusion assumption is pervasive among privacy-preserving systems,
it remains highly susceptible to covert, undetectable collusion among computing parties. This
work stems from an observation that if the number of available computing parties is much higher than
the number of parties required to perform a secure computation, collusion attempts could be deterred.
We focus on the standard problem of multi-server private information retrieval (PIR) that inherently
assumes that servers do not collude. For PIR application scenarios, such as those for blockchain
light clients, where the available servers are plentiful, a single server's deviating action is
not tremendously beneficial to itself. We can make deviations undesired through small amounts
of rewards and penalties, thus raising the bar for collusion significantly. For any given multi-server
1-private PIR (i.e. the base PIR scheme is constructed assuming no pairwise collusion), we provide
a collusion mitigation mechanism. We first define a two-stage sequential game that captures how
rational servers interact with each other during collusion, then determine the payment rules such
that the game realizes the unique sequential equilibrium: a non-collusion outcome. We also offer
privacy protection for an extended period beyond the time the query executions happen, and guarantee
user compensation in case of a reported privacy breach. Overall, we conjecture that the incentive
structure for collusion mitigation to be functional towards relaxing the strong non-collusion
assumptions across a variety of multi-party computation tasks.

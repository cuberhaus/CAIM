We consider a variation of balls-into-bins which randomly allocates $m$ balls into $n$ bins. Following
Godfrey's model (SODA, 2008), we assume that each ball $t$, $1\le t\le m$, comes with a hypergraph
$\mathcal{H}^{(t)}=\{B_1,B_2,\ldots,B_{s_t}\}$, and each edge $B\in\mathcal{H}^{(t)}$
contains at least a logarithmic number of bins. Given $d\ge 2$, our $d$-choice algorithm chooses
an edge $B\in \mathcal{H}^{(t)}$, uniformly at random, and then chooses a set $D$ of $d$ random bins
from the selected edge $B$. The ball is allocated to a least-loaded bin from $D$, with ties are broken
randomly. We prove that if the hypergraphs $\mathcal{H}^{(1)},\ldots, \mathcal{H}^{(m)}$ satisfy
a \emph{balancedness} condition and have low \emph{pair visibility}, then after allocating $m=\Theta(n)$
balls, the maximum number of balls at any bin, called the \emph{maximum load}, is at most $\log_d\log
n+O(1)$, with high probability. The balancedness condition enforces that bins appear almost uniformly
within the hyperedges of $\mathcal{H}^{(t)}$, $1\le t\le m$, while the pair visibility condition
measures how frequently a pair of bins is chosen during the allocation of balls. Moreover, we establish
a lower bound for the maximum load attained by the balanced allocation for a sequence of hypergraphs
in terms of pair visibility, showing the relevance of the visibility parameter to the maximum load.
In Godfrey's model, each ball is forced to probe all bins in a randomly selected hyperedge and the
ball is then allocated in a least-loaded bin. Godfrey showed that if each $\mathcal{H}^{(t)}$,
$1\le t\le m$, is balanced and $m=O(n)$, then the maximum load is at most one, with high probability.
However, we apply the power of $d$ choices paradigm, and only query the load information of $d$ random
bins per ball, while achieving very slow growth in the maximum load.

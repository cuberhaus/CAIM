Globally, Skin carcinoma is among the most lethal diseases. Millions of people are diagnosed with
this cancer every year. Sill, early detection can decrease the medication cost and mortality rate
substantially. The recent improvement in automated cancer classification using deep learning
methods has reached a human-level performance requiring a large amount of annotated data assembled
in one location, yet, finding such conditions usually is not feasible. Recently, federated learning
(FL) has been proposed to train decentralized models in a privacy-preserved fashion depending
on labeled data at the client-side, which is usually not available and costly. To address this, we
propose \verb!FedPerl!, a semi-supervised federated learning method. Our method is inspired
by peer learning from educational psychology and ensemble averaging from committee machines.
FedPerl builds communities based on clients' similarities. Then it encourages communities members
to learn from each other to generate more accurate pseudo labels for the unlabeled data. We also proposed
the peer anonymization (PA) technique to anonymize clients. As a core component of our method, PA
is orthogonal to other methods without additional complexity and reduces the communication cost
while enhancing performance. Finally, we propose a dynamic peer-learning policy that controls
the learning stream to avoid any degradation in the performance, especially for individual clients.
Our experimental setup consists of 71,000 skin lesion images collected from 5 publicly available
datasets. We test our method in four different scenarios in SSFL. With few annotated data, FedPerl
is on par with a state-of-the-art method in skin lesion classification in the standard setup while
outperforming SSFLs and the baselines by 1.8% and 15.8%, respectively. Also, it generalizes better
to unseen clients while being less sensitive to noisy ones.

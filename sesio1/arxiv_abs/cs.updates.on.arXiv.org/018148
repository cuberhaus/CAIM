The stagnation of EDA technologies roots from insufficient knowledge reuse. In practice, very
similar simulation or optimization results may need to be repeatedly constructed from scratch.
This motivates my research on introducing more 'intelligence' to EDA with machine learning (ML),
which explores complex correlations in design flows based on prior data. Besides design time, I
also propose ML solutions to boost IC performance by assisting the circuit management at runtime.
In this dissertation, I present multiple fast yet accurate ML models covering a wide range of chip
design stages from the register-transfer level (RTL) to sign-off, solving primary chip-design
problems about power, timing, interconnect, IR drop, routability, and design flow tuning. Targeting
the RTL stage, I present APOLLO, a fully automated power modeling framework. It constructs an accurate
per-cycle power model by extracting the most power-correlated signals. The model can be further
implemented on chip for runtime power management with unprecedented low hardware costs. Targeting
gate-level netlist, I present Net2 for early estimations on post-placement wirelength. It further
enables more accurate timing analysis without actual physical design information. Targeting
circuit layout, I present RouteNet for early routability prediction. As the first deep learning-based
routability estimator, some feature-extraction and model-design principles proposed in it are
widely adopted by later works. I also present PowerNet for fast IR drop estimation. It captures spatial
and temporal information about power distribution with a customized CNN architecture. Last, besides
targeting a single design step, I present FIST to efficiently tune design flow parameters during
both logic synthesis and physical design.

The ability to abstract, count, and use System 2 reasoning are well-known manifestations of intelligence
and understanding. In this paper, we argue, using the example of the ``Look and Say" puzzle, that
although deep neural networks can exhibit high `competence' (as measured by accuracy) when trained
on large data sets (2M examples in our case), they do not show any sign on the deeper understanding
of the problem, or what D. Dennett calls `comprehension'. We report on two sets experiments on the
``Look and Say" puzzle data. We view the problem as building a translator from one set of tokens to
another. We apply both standard LSTMs and Transformer/Attention -- based neural networks, using
publicly available machine translation software. We observe that despite the amazing accuracy
(on both, training and test data), the performance of the trained programs on the actual L\&S sequence
is bad. We then discuss a few possible ramifications of this finding and connections to other work,
experimental and theoretical. First, from the cognitive science perspective, we argue that we
need better mathematical models of abstraction. Second, the classical and more recent results
on the universality of neural networks should be re-examined for functions acting on discrete data
sets. Mapping on discrete sets usually have no natural continuous extensions. This connects the
results on a simple puzzle to more sophisticated results on modeling of mathematical functions,
where algebraic functions are more difficult to model than e.g. differential equations. Third,
we hypothesize that for problems such as ``Look and Say", computing the parity of bitstrings, or
learning integer addition, it might be worthwhile to introduce concepts from topology, where continuity
is defined without the reference to the concept of distance.

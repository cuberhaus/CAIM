Longitudinal variations and complementary information inherent in longitudinal and multi-modal
data play an important role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) prediction, particularly in identifying
subjects with mild cognitive impairment who are about to have AD. However, longitudinal and multi-modal
data may have missing data, which hinders the effective application of these data. Additionally,
previous longitudinal studies require existing longitudinal data to achieve prediction, but
AD prediction is expected to be conducted at patients' baseline visit (BL) in clinical practice.
Thus, we proposed a multi-view imputation and cross-attention network (MCNet) to integrate data
imputation and AD prediction in a unified framework and achieve accurate AD prediction. First,
a multi-view imputation method combined with adversarial learning, which can handle a wide range
of missing data situations and reduce imputation errors, was presented. Second, two cross-attention
blocks were introduced to exploit the potential associations in longitudinal and multi-modal
data. Finally, a multi-task learning model was built for data imputation, longitudinal classification,
and AD prediction tasks. When the model was properly trained, the disease progression information
learned from longitudinal data can be leveraged by BL data to improve AD prediction. The proposed
method was tested on two independent testing sets and single-model data at BL to verify its effectiveness
and flexibility on AD prediction. Results showed that MCNet outperformed several state-of-the-art
methods. Moreover, the interpretability of MCNet was presented. Thus, our MCNet is a tool with a
great application potential in longitudinal and multi-modal data analysis for AD prediction.

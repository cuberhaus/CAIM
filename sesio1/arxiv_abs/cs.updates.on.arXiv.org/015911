As the popularity of Location-based Social Networks (LBSNs) increases, designing accurate models
for Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation receives more attention. POI recommendation is often
performed by incorporating contextual information into previously designed recommendation
algorithms. Some of the major contextual information that has been considered in POI recommendation
are the location attributes (i.e., exact coordinates of a location, category, and check-in time),
the user attributes (i.e., comments, reviews, tips, and check-in made to the locations), and other
information, such as the distance of the POI from user's main activity location, and the social tie
between users. The right selection of such factors can significantly impact the performance of
the POI recommendation. However, previous research does not consider the impact of the combination
of these different factors. In this paper, we propose different contextual models and analyze the
fusion of different major contextual information in POI recommendation. The major contributions
of this paper are: (i) providing an extensive survey of context-aware location recommendation
(ii) quantifying and analyzing the impact of different contextual information (e.g., social,
temporal, spatial, and categorical) in the POI recommendation on available baselines and two new
linear and non-linear models, that can incorporate all the major contextual information into a
single recommendation model, and (iii) evaluating the considered models using two well-known
real-world datasets. Our results indicate that while modeling geographical and temporal influences
can improve recommendation quality, fusing all other contextual information into a recommendation
model is not always the best strategy.

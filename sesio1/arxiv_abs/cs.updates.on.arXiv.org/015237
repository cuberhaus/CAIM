As enterprises embrace blockchain technology, many real-world applications have been developed
and deployed using permissioned blockchain platforms (access to network is controlled and given
to only nodes with known identities). Such blockchain platforms heavily depend on cryptography
to provide a layer of trust within the network, thus verification of cryptographic signatures often
becomes the bottleneck. The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) is the most commonly
used cryptographic scheme in permissioned blockchains. In this paper, we propose an efficient
implementation of ECDSA signature verification on an FPGA, in order to improve the performance
of permissioned blockchains that aim to use FPGA-based hardware accelerators. We propose several
optimizations for modular arithmetic (e.g., custom multipliers and fast modular reduction) and
point arithmetic (e.g., reduced number of point double and addition operations, and optimal width
NAF representation). Based on these optimized modular and point arithmetic modules, we propose
an ECDSA verification engine that can be used by any application for fast verification of ECDSA signatures.
We further optimize our ECDSA verification engine for Hyperledger Fabric (one of the most widely
used permissioned blockchain platforms) by moving carefully selected operations to a precomputation
block, thus simplifying the critical path of ECDSA signature verification. From our implementation
on Xilinx Alveo U250 accelerator board with target frequency of 250MHz, our ECDSA verification
engine can perform a single verification in $760\mu s$ resulting in a throughput of 1,315 verifications
per second, which is ~2.5x faster than state-of-the-art FPGA-based implementations. Our Hyperledger
Fabric-specific ECDSA engine can perform a single verification in $368\mu s$ with a throughput
of 2,717 verifications per second.

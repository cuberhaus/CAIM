Patient similarity assessment, which identifies patients similar to a given patient, can help
improve medical care. The assessment can be performed using Electronic Medical Records (EMRs).
Patient similarity measurement requires converting heterogeneous EMRs into comparable formats
to calculate their distance. While versatile document representation learning methods have been
developed in recent years, it is still unclear how complex EMR data should be processed to create
the most useful patient representations. This study presents a new data representation method
for EMRs that takes the information in clinical narratives into account. To address the limitations
of previous approaches in handling complex parts of EMR data, an unsupervised method is proposed
for building a patient representation, which integrates unstructured data with structured data
extracted from patients' EMRs. In order to model the extracted data, we employed a tree structure
that captures the temporal relations of multiple medical events from EMR. We processed clinical
notes to extract symptoms, signs, and diseases using different tools such as medspaCy, MetaMap,
and scispaCy and mapped entities to the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). After creating
a tree data structure, we utilized two novel relabeling methods for the non-leaf nodes of the tree
to capture two temporal aspects of the extracted events. By traversing the tree, we generated a sequence
that could create an embedding vector for each patient. The comprehensive evaluation of the proposed
method for patient similarity and mortality prediction tasks demonstrated that our proposed model
leads to lower mean squared error (MSE), higher precision, and normalized discounted cumulative
gain (NDCG) relative to baselines.

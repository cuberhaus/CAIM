Automatic question answering is an important yet challenging task in E-commerce given the millions
of questions posted by users about the product that they are interested in purchasing. Hence, there
is a great demand for automatic answer generation systems that provide quick responses using related
information about the product. There are three sources of knowledge available for answering a user
posted query, they are reviews, duplicate or similar questions, and specifications. Effectively
utilizing these information sources will greatly aid us in answering complex questions. However,
there are two main challenges present in exploiting these sources: (i) The presence of irrelevant
information and (ii) the presence of ambiguity of sentiment present in reviews and similar questions.
Through this work we propose a novel pipeline (MSQAP) that utilizes the rich information present
in the aforementioned sources by separately performing relevancy and ambiguity prediction before
generating a response. Experimental results show that our relevancy prediction model (BERT-QA)
outperforms all other variants and has an improvement of 12.36% in F1 score compared to the BERT-base
baseline. Our generation model (T5-QA) outperforms the baselines in all content preservation
metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE and has an average improvement of 35.02% in ROUGE and 198.75% in BLEU compared
to the highest performing baseline (HSSC-q). Human evaluation of our pipeline shows us that our
method has an overall improvement in accuracy of 30.7% over the generation model (T5-QA), resulting
in our full pipeline-based approach (MSQAP) providing more accurate answers. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work in the e-commerce domain that automatically generates natural
language answers combining the information present in diverse sources such as specifications,
similar questions, and reviews data.

Two-sided platforms rely on their recommendation algorithms to help visitors successfully find
a match. However, on platforms such as VolunteerMatch (VM) -- which has facilitated millions of
connections between volunteers and nonprofits -- a sizable fraction of website traffic arrives
directly to a nonprofit's volunteering page via an external link, thus bypassing the platform's
recommendation algorithm. We study how such platforms should account for this external traffic
in the design of their recommendation algorithms, given the goal of maximizing successful matches.
We model the platform's problem as a special case of online matching, where (using VM terminology)
volunteers arrive sequentially and probabilistically match with one opportunity, each of which
has finite need for volunteers. In our framework, external traffic is interested only in their targeted
opportunity; by contrast, internal traffic may be interested in many opportunities, and the platform's
online algorithm selects which opportunity to recommend. In evaluating different algorithms,
we parameterize the competitive ratio based on the amount of external traffic. After demonstrating
the shortcomings of a commonly-used algorithm that is optimal in the absence of external traffic,
we propose a new algorithm -- Adaptive Capacity (AC) -- which accounts for matches differently based
on whether they originate from internal or external traffic. We provide a lower bound on AC's competitive
ratio that is increasing in the amount of external traffic and that is close to the parameterized
upper bound we establish on the competitive ratio of any online algorithm. Our analysis utilizes
a path-based, pseudo-rewards approach, which we further generalize to settings where the platform
can recommend a ranked set of opportunities. Beyond our theoretical results, we show the strong
performance of AC in a case study motivated by VM data.

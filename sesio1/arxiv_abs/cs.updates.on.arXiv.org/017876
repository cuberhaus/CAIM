Past research has attributed the online circulation of misinformation to two main factors - individual
characteristics (e.g., a person's information literacy) and social media effects (e.g., algorithm-mediated
information diffusion) - and has overlooked a third one: the critical mass created by the offline
self-segregation of Americans into like-minded geographical regions such as states (a phenomenon
called "The Big Sort"). We hypothesized that this latter factor matters for the online spreading
of misinformation not least because online interactions, despite having the potential of being
global, end up being localized: interaction probability is known to rapidly decay with distance.
Upon analysis of more than 8M Reddit comments containing news links spanning four years, from January
2016 to December 2019, we found that Reddit did not work as an "hype machine" for misinformation (as
opposed to what previous work reported for other platforms, circulation was not mainly caused by
platform-facilitated network effects) but worked as a supply-and-demand system: misinformation
news items scaled linearly with the number of users in each state (with a scaling exponent beta=1,
and a goodness of fit R2 = 0.95). Furthermore, deviations from such a universal pattern were best
explained by state-level personality and cultural factors (R2 = {0.12, 0.39}), rather than socioeconomic
conditions (R2 = {0.15, 0.29}) or, as one would expect, political characteristics (R2 ={0.06, 0.21}).
Higher-than-expected circulation of any type of news (including reputable news) was found in states
characterised by residents who tend to be less diligent in terms of their personality (low in conscientiousness)
and by loose cultures understating the importance of adherence to norms (low in cultural tightness).

From the minimal assumption of post-quantum semi-honest oblivious transfers, we build the first
$\epsilon$-simulatable two-party computation (2PC) against quantum polynomial-time (QPT)
adversaries that is both constant-round and black-box (for both the construction and security
reduction). A recent work by Chia, Chung, Liu, and Yamakawa (FOCS'21) shows that post-quantum 2PC
with standard simulation-based security is impossible in constant rounds, unless either $\mathbf{NP}
\subseteq \mathbf{BQP}$ or relying on non-black-box simulation. The $\epsilon$-simulatability
we target is a relaxation of the standard simulation-based security that allows for an arbitrarily
small noticeable simulation error $\epsilon$. Moreover, when quantum communication is allowed,
we can further weaken the assumption to post-quantum secure one-way functions (PQ-OWFs), while
maintaining the constant-round and black-box property. Our techniques also yield the following
set of constant-round and black-box two-party protocols secure against QPT adversaries, only
assuming black-box access to PQ-OWFs: - extractable commitments for which the extractor is also
an $\epsilon$-simulator; - $\epsilon$-zero-knowledge commit-and-prove whose commit stage
is extractable with $\epsilon$-simulation; - $\epsilon$-simulatable coin-flipping; - $\epsilon$-zero-knowledge
arguments of knowledge for $\mathbf{NP}$ for which the knowledge extractor is also an $\epsilon$-simulator;
- $\epsilon$-zero-knowledge arguments for $\mathbf{QMA}$. At the heart of the above results is
a black-box extraction lemma showing how to efficiently extract secrets from QPT adversaries while
disturbing their quantum state in a controllable manner, i.e., achieving $\epsilon$-simulatability
of the after-extraction state of the adversary.

Understanding real-world dynamical phenomena remains a challenging task. Across various scientific
disciplines, machine learning has advanced as the go-to technology to analyze nonlinear dynamical
systems, identify patterns in big data, and make decision around them. Neural networks are now consistently
used as universal function approximators for data with underlying mechanisms that are incompletely
understood or exceedingly complex. However, neural networks alone ignore the fundamental laws
of physics and often fail to make plausible predictions. Here we integrate data, physics, and uncertainties
by combining neural networks, physics-informed modeling, and Bayesian inference to improve the
predictive potential of traditional neural network models. We embed the physical model of a damped
harmonic oscillator into a fully-connected feed-forward neural network to explore a simple and
illustrative model system, the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19. Our Physics-Informed Neural Networks
can seamlessly integrate data and physics, robustly solve forward and inverse problems, and perform
well for both interpolation and extrapolation, even for a small amount of noisy and incomplete data.
At only minor additional cost, they can self-adaptively learn the weighting between data and physics.
Combined with Bayesian Neural Networks, they can serve as priors in a Bayesian Inference, and provide
credible intervals for uncertainty quantification. Our study reveals the inherent advantages
and disadvantages of Neural Networks, Bayesian Inference, and a combination of both and provides
valuable guidelines for model selection. While we have only demonstrated these approaches for
the simple model problem of a seasonal endemic infectious disease, we anticipate that the underlying
concepts and trends generalize to more complex disease conditions and, more broadly, to a wide variety
of nonlinear dynamical systems.

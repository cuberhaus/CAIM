The objective of this study is to develop a robust deep learning-based framework to distinguish
COVID-19, Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP), and Normal cases based on chest CT scans acquired
in different imaging centers using various protocols, and radiation doses. We showed that while
our proposed model is trained on a relatively small dataset acquired from only one imaging center
using a specific scanning protocol, the model performs well on heterogeneous test sets obtained
by multiple scanners using different technical parameters. We also showed that the model can be
updated via an unsupervised approach to cope with the data shift between the train and test sets and
enhance the robustness of the model upon receiving a new external dataset from a different center.
We adopted an ensemble architecture to aggregate the predictions from multiple versions of the
model. For initial training and development purposes, an in-house dataset of 171 COVID-19, 60 CAP,
and 76 Normal cases was used, which contained volumetric CT scans acquired from one imaging center
using a constant standard radiation dose scanning protocol. To evaluate the model, we collected
four different test sets retrospectively to investigate the effects of the shifts in the data characteristics
on the model's performance. Among the test cases, there were CT scans with similar characteristics
as the train set as well as noisy low-dose and ultra-low dose CT scans. In addition, some test CT scans
were obtained from patients with a history of cardiovascular diseases or surgeries. The entire
test dataset used in this study contained 51 COVID-19, 28 CAP, and 51 Normal cases. Experimental
results indicate that our proposed framework performs well on all test sets achieving total accuracy
of 96.15% (95%CI: [91.25-98.74]), COVID-19 sensitivity of 96.08% (95%CI: [86.54-99.5]), CAP
sensitivity of 92.86% (95%CI: [76.50-99.19]).

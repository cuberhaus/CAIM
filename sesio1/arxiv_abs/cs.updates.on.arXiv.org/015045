LoRaWAN deployments follow an ad-hoc deployment model that has organically led to overlapping
communication networks, sharing the wireless spectrum, and completely unaware of each other.
LoRaWAN uses ALOHA-style communication where it is almost impossible to schedule transmission
between networks belonging to different owners properly. The inability to schedule overlapping
networks will cause inter-network interference, which will increase node-to-gateway message
losses and gateway-to-node acknowledgement failures. This problem is likely to get worse as the
number of LoRaWAN networks increase. In response to this problem, we propose IRONWAN, a wireless
overlay network that shares communication resources without modifications to underlying protocols.
It utilises the broadcast nature of radio communication and enables gateway-to-gateway communication
to facilitate the search for failed messages and transmit failed acknowledgements already received
and cached in overlapping network's gateways. IRONWAN uses two novel algorithms, a Real-time Message
Inter-arrival Predictor, to highlight when a server has not received an expected uplink message.
The Interference Predictor ensures that extra gateway-to-gateway communication does not negatively
impact communication bandwidth. We evaluate IRONWAN on a 1000-node simulator with up to ten gateways
and a 10-node testbed with 2-gateways. Results show that IRONWAN can achieve up to 12\% higher packet
delivery ratio (PDR) and total messages received per node while increasing the minimum PDR by up
to 28\%. These improvements save up to 50\% node's energy. Finally, we demonstrate that IRONWAN
has comparable performance to an optimal solution (wired, centralised) but with 2-32 times lower
communication costs. IRONWAN also has up to 14\% better PDR when compared to FLIP, a wired-distributed
gateway-to-gateway protocol in certain scenarios.

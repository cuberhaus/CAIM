Different people have different habits of describing their intents in conversations. Some people
tend to deliberate their intents in several successive utterances, i.e., they use several consistent
messages for readability instead of a long sentence to express their question. This creates a predicament
faced by the application of dialogue systems, especially in real-world industry scenarios, in
which the dialogue system is unsure whether it should answer the query of user immediately or wait
for further supplementary input. Motivated by such an interesting predicament, we define a novel
Wait-or-Answer task for dialogue systems. We shed light on a new research topic about how the dialogue
system can be more intelligent to behave in this Wait-or-Answer quandary. Further, we propose a
predictive approach named Predict-then-Decide (PTD) to tackle this Wait-or-Answer task. More
specifically, we take advantage of a decision model to help the dialogue system decide whether to
wait or answer. The decision of decision model is made with the assistance of two ancillary prediction
models: a user prediction and an agent prediction. The user prediction model tries to predict what
the user would supplement and uses its prediction to persuade the decision model that the user has
some information to add, so the dialogue system should wait. The agent prediction model tries to
predict the answer of the dialogue system and convince the decision model that it is a superior choice
to answer the query of user immediately since the input of user has come to an end. We conduct our experiments
on two real-life scenarios and three public datasets. Experimental results on five datasets show
our proposed PTD approach significantly outperforms the existing models in solving this Wait-or-Answer
problem.

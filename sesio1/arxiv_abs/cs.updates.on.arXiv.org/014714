Laboratory testing and medication prescription are two of the most important routines in daily
clinical practice. Developing an artificial intelligence system that can automatically make
lab test imputations and medication recommendations can save costs on potentially redundant lab
tests and inform physicians of a more effective prescription. We present an intelligent medical
system (named MedGCN) that can automatically recommend the patients' medications based on their
incomplete lab tests, and can even accurately estimate the lab values that have not been taken. In
our system, we integrate the complex relations between multiple types of medical entities with
their inherent features in a heterogeneous graph. Then we model the graph to learn a distributed
representation for each entity in the graph based on graph convolutional networks (GCN). By the
propagation of graph convolutional networks, the entity representations can incorporate multiple
types of medical information that can benefit multiple medical tasks. Moreover, we introduce a
cross regularization strategy to reduce overfitting for multi-task training by the interaction
between the multiple tasks. In this study, we construct a graph to associate 4 types of medical entities,
i.e., patients, encounters, lab tests, and medications, and applied a graph neural network to learn
node embeddings for medication recommendation and lab test imputation. we validate our MedGCN
model on two real-world datasets: NMEDW and MIMIC-III. The experimental results on both datasets
demonstrate that our model can outperform the state-of-the-art in both tasks. We believe that our
innovative system can provide a promising and reliable way to assist physicians to make medication
prescriptions and to save costs on potentially redundant lab tests.

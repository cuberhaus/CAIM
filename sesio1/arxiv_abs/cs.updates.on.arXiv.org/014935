We consider the rooted prize-collecting walks (PCW) problem, wherein we seek a collection $C$ of
rooted walks having minimum prize-collecting cost, which is the (total cost of walks in $C$) + (total
node-reward of nodes not visited by any walk in $C$). This problem arises naturally as the Lagrangian
relaxation of both orienteering, where we seek a length-bounded walk of maximum reward, and the
$\ell$-stroll problem, where we seek a minimum-length walk covering at least $\ell$ nodes. Our
main contribution is to devise a simple, combinatorial algorithm for the PCW problem in directed
graphs that returns a rooted tree whose prize-collecting cost is at most the optimum value of the
prize-collecting walks problem. We utilize our algorithm to develop combinatorial approximation
algorithms for two fundamental vehicle-routing problems (VRPs): (1) orienteering; and (2) $k$-minimum-latency
problem ($k$-MLP), wherein we seek to cover all nodes using $k$ paths starting at a prescribed root
node, so as to minimize the sum of the node visiting times. Our combinatorial algorithm allows us
to sidestep the part where we solve a preflow-based LP in the LP-rounding algorithms of Friggstand
and Swamy (2017) for orienteering, and in the state-of-the-art $7.183$-approximation algorithm
for $k$-MP in Post and Swamy (2015). Consequently, we obtain combinatorial implementations of
these algorithms with substantially improved running times compared with the current-best approximation
factors. We report computational results for our resulting (combinatorial implementations of)
orienteering algorithms, which show that the algorithms perform quite well in practice, both in
terms of the quality of the solution they return, as also the upper bound they yield on the orienteering
optimum (which is obtained by leveraging the workings of our PCW algorithm).

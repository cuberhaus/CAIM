This paper revisits the generation hosting capacity (HC) calculation approach to account for grid
operational flexibility--the ability to reconfigure the system safely. In essence, the generation
hosting capacity is determined against the set of limiting factors--voltage, thermal (conductor
loading), reverse flow (at the feeder head, station transformer, or substation), and change in
the voltage (due to sudden change in generation output)). Not that long ago, California Investor-Owned
Utilities (IOUs) added a new criterion that does not allow reverse flow at the supervisory control
and data acquisition (SCADA) points that can change the system configuration, aiming to prevent
the potential transfer of reverse flow to an adjacent feeder. This new criterion intended to capture
operational constraints as part of hosting capacity-known as hosting capacity with operational
flexibility (OpFlex). This paper explores the shortfalls of such an approach and proposes performing
actual transfer analysis when determining hosting capacity rather than implementing the OpFlex
approach. Furthermore, we discuss the need for transition to determining hosting capacity profile
(all intervals) rather than a flat line (one, worst performing interval) hosting capacity. A hosting
capacity profile would inform the developers of interval-by-interval limits and opportunities,
creating new opportunities to reach higher penetration of DERs at a lower cost. With technological
and computational advancements, such an approach is neither out of implementation reach nor that
computationally expensive. In return, far more DER can be interconnected once programmed not to
violate certain generation profiles as part of the interconnection requirement, and utilities
would be better informed of their actual operational flexibility, benefiting society overall.

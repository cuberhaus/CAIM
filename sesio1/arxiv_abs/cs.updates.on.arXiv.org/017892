Diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy (DSPN) is one of the prevalent forms of neuropathy affected
by diabetic patients that involves alterations in biomechanical changes in human gait. In literature,
for the last 50 years, researchers are trying to observe the biomechanical changes due to DSPN by
studying muscle electromyography (EMG), and ground reaction forces (GRF). However, the literature
is contradictory. In such a scenario, we are proposing to use Machine learning techniques to identify
DSPN patients by using EMG, and GRF data. We have collected a dataset consists of three lower limb
muscles EMG (tibialis anterior (TA), vastus lateralis (VL), gastrocnemius medialis (GM) and 3-dimensional
GRF components (GRFx, GRFy, and GRFz). Raw EMG and GRF signals were preprocessed, and a newly proposed
feature extraction technique scheme from literature was applied to extract the best features from
the signals. The extracted feature list was ranked using Relief feature ranking techniques, and
highly correlated features were removed. We have trained different ML models to find out the best-performing
model and optimized that model. We trained the optimized ML models for different combinations of
muscles and GRF components features, and the performance matrix was evaluated. This study has found
ensemble classifier model was performing in identifying DSPN Severity, and we optimized it before
training. For EMG analysis, we have found the best accuracy of 92.89% using the Top 14 features for
features from GL, VL and TA muscles combined. In the GRF analysis, the model showed 94.78% accuracy
by using the Top 15 features for the feature combinations extracted from GRFx, GRFy and GRFz signals.
The performance of ML-based DSPN severity classification models, improved significantly, indicating
their reliability in DSPN severity classification, for biomechanical data.

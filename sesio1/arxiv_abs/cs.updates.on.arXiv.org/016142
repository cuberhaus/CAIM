Documents containing mathematical content remain largely inaccessible to blind and visually
impaired readers because they are predominantly published as untagged PDF which does not include
the semantic data necessary for effective accessibility. We present a browsing approach for print-disabled
readers specifically aimed at such mathematical content. This approach draws on the navigational
mechanisms often used to explore the virtual worlds of text adventure games with audio-visual sensory
substitution for graphical content. The relative spatial placement of the elements of an equation
are represented as a virtual world, so that the reader can navigate from element to element. Text
elements are announced conventionally using synthesised speech while graphical elements, such
as roots and fraction lines, are rendered using a modification of the vOICe algorithm. The virtual
world allows the reader to interactively discover the spatial structure of the equation, while
the rendition of graphical elements as sound allows the shape and identity of elements that cannot
be synthesised as speech to be discovered and recognised. The browsing approach was evaluated by
eleven blind and fourteen sighted participants in a user trial that included the identification
of twelve equations extracted from PDF documents. Overall, equations were identified completely
correctly in 78% of cases (74% and 83% respectively for blind and sighted subjects). If partial correctness
is considered, the performance is substantially higher. We conclude that the integration of a spatial
model represented as a virtual world in conjunction with audio-visual sensory substitution for
non-textual elements can be an effective way for blind and visually impaired readers to read currently
inaccessible mathematical content in PDF documents.

The COVID-19 pandemic is yet again on the verge of escalating, despite a hopeful case decrease recorded
during spring and summer 2021, due to successful vaccination roll-outs. Together with the emergence
of new variants, the potential waning of the vaccination immunity could pose threats to public health.
It is tenable that the timing of such a gradual drop in the immunity of most of the vaccinated population
would synchronize with the near-complete restoration of normalcy. Should also testing be relaxed,
we might witness a potentially disastrous COVID-19 wave in winter 2021/2022. In response to this
risk, many countries, including the U.S., are opting for the administration of a third vaccine dose,
the booster shot. Here, in a projected study with an outlook of six months, we explore the interplay
between the rate at which boosters are distributed and the extent to which testing practices are
implemented. Projections are based on a highly granular agent-based model that provides a close,
one-to-one digital reproduction of a real, medium-sized U.S. town. Focusing on the dominant Delta
variant, we contemplate the waning immunity provided by the locally available Johnson&Johnson,
Pfizer, and Moderna vaccines. Theoretical projections indicate that the administration of boosters
at the rate at which the vaccine is currently administered could yield a severe resurgence of the
pandemic, even worse than the first wave experienced in spring and summer 2020. Our projections
suggest that the peak levels of mid spring 2021 in the vaccination rate may prevent the occurrence
of such a scenario. Our study highlights the importance of testing, especially to detect infection
of asymptomatic individuals in the very near future, as the release of the booster reaches full speed.

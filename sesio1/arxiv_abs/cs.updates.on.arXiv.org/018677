In this paper we investigate the impact of path additions to transport networks with optimised traffic
routing. In particular, we study the behaviour of total travel time, and consider both self-interested
routing paradigms, such as User Equilibrium (UE) routing, as well as cooperative paradigms, such
as classic Multi-Commodity (MC) network flow and System Optimal (SO) routing. We provide a formal
framework for designing transport networks through iterative path additions, introducing the
concepts of trip spanning tree and trip path graph. Using this formalisation, we prove multiple
properties of the objective function for transport network design. Since the underlying routing
problem is NP-Hard, we investigate properties that provide guarantees in approximate algorithm
design. Firstly, while Braess' paradox has shown that total travel time is not monotonic non-increasing
with respect to path additions under self-interested routing (UE), we prove that, instead, monotonicity
holds for cooperative routing (MC and SO). This result has the important implication that cooperative
agents make the best use of redundant infrastructure. Secondly, we prove via a counterexample that
the intuitive statement `adding a path to a transport network always grants greater or equal benefit
to users than adding it to a superset of that network' is false. In other words we prove that, for all
the routing formulations studied, total travel time is not supermodular with respect to path additions.
While this counter-intuitive result yields a hardness property for algorithm design, we provide
particular instances where, instead, the property of supermodularity holds. Our study on monotonicity
and supermodularity of total travel time with respect to path additions provides formal proofs
and scenarios that constitute important insights for transport network designers.

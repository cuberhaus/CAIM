Much of the success of fingerprint recognition is attributed to minutiae-based fingerprint representation.
It was believed that minutiae templates could not be inverted to obtain a high fidelity fingerprint
image, but this assumption has been shown to be false. The success of deep learning has resulted in
alternative fingerprint representations (embeddings), in the hope that they might offer better
recognition accuracy as well as non-invertibility of deep network-based templates. We evaluate
whether deep fingerprint templates suffer from the same reconstruction attacks as the minutiae
templates. We show that while a deep template can be inverted to produce a fingerprint image that
could be matched to its source image, deep templates are more resistant to reconstruction attacks
than minutiae templates. In particular, reconstructed fingerprint images from minutiae templates
yield a TAR of about 100.0% (98.3%) @ FAR of 0.01% for type-I (type-II) attacks using a state-of-the-art
commercial fingerprint matcher, when tested on NIST SD4. The corresponding attack performance
for reconstructed fingerprint images from deep templates using the same commercial matcher yields
a TAR of less than 1% for both type-I and type-II attacks; however, when the reconstructed images
are matched using the same deep network, they achieve a TAR of 85.95% (68.10%) for type-I (type-II)
attacks. Furthermore, what is missing from previous fingerprint template inversion studies is
an evaluation of the black-box attack performance, which we perform using 3 different state-of-the-art
fingerprint matchers. We conclude that fingerprint images generated by inverting minutiae templates
are highly susceptible to both white-box and black-box attack evaluations, while fingerprint
images generated by deep templates are resistant to black-box evaluations and comparatively less
susceptible to white-box evaluations.

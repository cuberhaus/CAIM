The most prominent tasks in emotion analysis are to assign emotions to texts and to understand how
emotions manifest in language. An important observation for natural language processing is that
emotions can be communicated implicitly by referring to events alone, appealing to an empathetic,
intersubjective understanding of events, even without explicitly mentioning an emotion name.
In psychology, the class of emotion theories known as appraisal theories aims at explaining the
link between events and emotions. Appraisals can be formalized as variables that measure a cognitive
evaluation by people living through an event that they consider relevant. They include the assessment
if an event is novel, if the person considers themselves to be responsible, if it is in line with the
own goals, and many others. Such appraisals explain which emotions are developed based on an event,
e.g., that a novel situation can induce surprise or one with uncertain consequences could evoke
fear. We analyze the suitability of appraisal theories for emotion analysis in text with the goal
of understanding if appraisal concepts can reliably be reconstructed by annotators, if they can
be predicted by text classifiers, and if appraisal concepts help to identify emotion categories.
To achieve that, we compile a corpus by asking people to textually describe events that triggered
particular emotions and to disclose their appraisals. Then, we ask readers to reconstruct emotions
and appraisals from the text. This setup allows us to measure if emotions and appraisals can be recovered
purely from text and provides a human baseline to judge model's performance measures. Our comparison
of text classification methods to human annotators shows that both can reliably detect emotions
and appraisals with similar performance. We further show that appraisal concepts improve the categorization
of emotions in text.

Given the counters of vehicles that traverse the roads of a traffic network, we reconstruct the travel
demand that generated them expressed in terms of the number of origin-destination trips made by
users. We model the problem as a bi-level optimization problem. At the inner-level, given a tentative
demand, we solve a Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA) problem to decide the routing of the users between
their origins and destinations. Finally, we adjust the number of trips and their origins and destinations
at the outer-level to minimize the discrepancy between the counters generated at the inner-level
and the given vehicle counts measured by sensors in the traffic network. We solve the DTA problem
by employing a mesoscopic model implemented by the traffic simulator SUMO. Thus, the outer problem
becomes an optimization problem that minimizes a black-box Objective Function (OF) determined
by the results of the simulation, which is a costly computation. We study different approaches to
the outer-level problem categorized as gradient-based and derivative-free approaches. Among
the gradient-based approaches, we look at an assignment matrix-based approach and an assignment
matrix-free approach that uses the Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA)
algorithm. Among the derivative-free approaches, we investigate Machine Learning (ML) algorithms
to learn a model of the simulator that can then be used as a surrogate OF in the optimization problem.
We compare these approaches computationally on an artificial network. The gradient-based approaches
perform the best in terms of solution quality and computational requirements. In contrast, the
results obtained by the ML approach are currently less satisfactory but provide an interesting
avenue for future research.

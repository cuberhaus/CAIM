Echo State Networks (ESN) are versatile recurrent neural network models in which the hidden layer
remains unaltered during training. Interactions among nodes of this static backbone produce diverse
representations of the given stimuli that are harnessed by a read-out mechanism to perform computations
needed for solving a given task. ESNs are accessible models of neuronal circuits, since they are
relatively inexpensive to train. Therefore, ESNs have become attractive for neuroscientists
studying the relationship between neural structure, function, and behavior. For instance, it
is not yet clear how distinctive connectivity patterns of brain networks support effective interactions
among their nodes and how these patterns of interactions give rise to computation. To address this
question, we employed an ESN with a biologically inspired structure and used a systematic multi-site
lesioning framework to quantify the causal contribution of each node to the network's output, thus
providing a causal link between network structure and behavior. We then focused on the structure-function
relationship and decomposed the causal influence of each node on all other nodes, using the same
lesioning framework. We found that nodes in a properly engineered ESN interact largely irrespective
of the network's underlying structure. However, in a network with the same topology and a non-optimal
parameter set, the underlying connectivity patterns determine the node interactions. Our results
suggest that causal structure-function relations in ESNs can be decomposed into two components,
direct and indirect interactions. The former are based on influences relying on structural connections.
The latter describe the effective communication between any two nodes through other intermediate
nodes. These widely distributed indirect interactions may crucially contribute to the efficient
performance of ESNs.

The connectivity and resource-constrained nature of single-board devices open the door to cybersecurity
concerns affecting Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios. One of the most important issues is the presence
of unauthorized IoT devices that want to impersonate legitimate ones by using identical hardware
and software specifications. This situation can provoke sensitive information leakages, data
poisoning, or privilege escalation in IoT scenarios. Combining behavioral fingerprinting and
Machine/Deep Learning (ML/DL) techniques is a promising approach to identify these malicious
spoofing devices by detecting minor performance differences generated by imperfections in manufacturing.
However, existing solutions are not suitable for single-board devices since they do not consider
their hardware and software limitations, underestimate critical aspects such as fingerprint
stability or context changes, and do not explore the potential of ML/DL techniques. To improve it,
this work first identifies the essential properties for single-board device identification:
uniqueness, stability, diversity, scalability, efficiency, robustness, and security. Then,
a novel methodology relies on behavioral fingerprinting to identify identical single-board devices
and meet the previous properties. The methodology leverages the different built-in components
of the system and ML/DL techniques, comparing the device internal behavior with each other to detect
manufacturing variations. The methodology validation has been performed in a real environment
composed of 15 identical Raspberry Pi 4 B and 10 Raspberry Pi 3 B+ devices, obtaining a 91.9% average
TPR and identifying all devices by setting a 50% threshold in the evaluation process. Finally, a
discussion compares the proposed solution with related work, highlighting the fingerprint properties
not met, and provides important lessons learned and limitations.

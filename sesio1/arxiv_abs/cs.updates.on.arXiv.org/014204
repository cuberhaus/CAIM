Formulating cyber-security problems with attackers and defenders as a partially observable stochastic
game has become a trend recently. Among them, the one-sided two-player zero-sum partially observable
stochastic game (OTZ-POSG) has emerged as a popular model because it allows players to compete for
multiple stages based on partial knowledge of the system. All existing work on OTZ-POSG has focused
on the simultaneous move scenario and assumed that one player's actions are private in the execution
process. However, this assumption may become questionable since one player's action may be detected
by the opponent through deploying action detection strategies. Hence, in this paper, we propose
a turn-based OTZ-POSG with the assumption of public actions and investigate the existence and properties
of a Stackelberg equilibrium for this game. We first prove the existence of the Stackelberg equilibrium
for the one-stage case and show that the one-stage game can be converted into a linear-fractional
programming problem and therefore solved by linear programming. For multiple stages, the main
challenge is the information leakage issue as the public run-time action reveals certain private
information to the opponent and allows the opponent to achieve more rewards in the future. To deal
with this issue, we adopt the concept of $\epsilon$-Stackelberg equilibrium and prove that this
equilibrium can be achieved for finite-horizon OTZ-POSGs. We propose a space partition approach
to solve the game iteratively and show that the value function of the leader is piece-wise linear
and the value function of the follower is piece-wise constant for multiple stages. Finally, examples
are given to illustrate the space partition approach and show that value functions are piece-wise
linear and piece-wise constant.

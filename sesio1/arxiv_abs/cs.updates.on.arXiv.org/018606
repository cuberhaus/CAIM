Heterogeneous networks, which connect informative nodes containing text with different edge
types, are routinely used to store and process information in various real-world applications.
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and their hyperbolic variants provide a promising approach to encode
such networks in a low-dimensional latent space through neighborhood aggregation and hierarchical
feature extraction, respectively. However, these approaches typically ignore metapath structures
and the available semantic information. Furthermore, these approaches are sensitive to the noise
present in the training data. To tackle these limitations, in this paper, we propose Text Enriched
Sparse Hyperbolic Graph Convolution Network (TESH-GCN) to capture the graph's metapath structures
using semantic signals and further improve prediction in large heterogeneous graphs. In TESH-GCN,
we extract semantic node information, which successively acts as a connection signal to extract
relevant nodes' local neighborhood and graph-level metapath features from the sparse adjacency
tensor in a reformulated hyperbolic graph convolution layer. These extracted features in conjunction
with semantic features from the language model (for robustness) are used for the final downstream
task. Experiments on various heterogeneous graph datasets show that our model outperforms the
current state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin on the task of link prediction. We also report
a reduction in both the training time and model parameters compared to the existing hyperbolic approaches
through a reformulated hyperbolic graph convolution. Furthermore, we illustrate the robustness
of our model by experimenting with different levels of simulated noise in both the graph structure
and text, and also, present a mechanism to explain TESH-GCN's prediction by analyzing the extracted
metapaths.

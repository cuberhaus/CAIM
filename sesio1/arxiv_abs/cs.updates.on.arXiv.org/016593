With the rapid development of smart manufacturing, data-driven machinery health management has
received a growing attention. As one of the most popular methods in machinery health management,
deep learning (DL) has achieved remarkable successes. However, due to the issues of limited samples
and poor separability of different cavitation states of acoustic signals, which greatly hinder
the eventual performance of DL modes for cavitation intensity recognition and cavitation detection.
In this work, a novel multi-task learning framework for simultaneous cavitation detection and
cavitation intensity recognition framework using 1-D double hierarchical residual networks
(1-D DHRN) is proposed for analyzing valves acoustic signals. Firstly, a data augmentation method
based on sliding window with fast Fourier transform (Swin-FFT) is developed to alleviate the small-sample
issue confronted in this study. Secondly, a 1-D double hierarchical residual block (1-D DHRB) is
constructed to capture sensitive features from the frequency domain acoustic signals of valve.
Then, a new structure of 1-D DHRN is proposed. Finally, the devised 1-D DHRN is evaluated on two datasets
of valve acoustic signals without noise (Dataset 1 and Dataset 2) and one dataset of valve acoustic
signals with realistic surrounding noise (Dataset 3) provided by SAMSON AG (Frankfurt). Our method
has achieved state-of-the-art results. The prediction accurcies of 1-D DHRN for cavitation intensitys
recognition are as high as 93.75%, 94.31% and 100%, which indicates that 1-D DHRN outperforms other
DL models and conventional methods. At the same time, the testing accuracies of 1-D DHRN for cavitation
detection are as high as 97.02%, 97.64% and 100%. In addition, 1-D DHRN has also been tested for different
frequencies of samples and shows excellent results for frequency of samples that mobile phones
can accommodate.

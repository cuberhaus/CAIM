Many startups and companies worldwide have been using project management software and tools to
monitor, track and manage their projects. For software projects, the number of tasks from the beginning
to the end is quite a large number that sometimes takes a lot of time and effort to search and link the
current task to a group of previous ones for further references. This paper proposes an efficient
task dependency recommendation algorithm to suggest tasks dependent on a given task that the user
has just created. We present an efficient feature engineering step and construct a deep neural network
to this aim. We performed extensive experiments on two different large projects (MDLSITE from moodle.org
and FLUME from apache.org) to find the best features in 28 combinations of features and the best performance
model using two embedding methods (GloVe and FastText). We consider three types of models (GRU,
CNN, LSTM) using Accuracy@K, MRR@K, and Recall@K (where K = 1, 2, 3, and 5) and baseline models using
traditional methods: TF-IDF with various matching score calculating such as cosine similarity,
Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, and Chebyshev distance. After many experiments, the
GloVe Embedding and CNN model reached the best result in our dataset, so we chose this model as our
proposed method. In addition, adding the time filter in the post-processing step can significantly
improve the recommendation system's performance. The experimental results show that our proposed
method can reach 0.2335 in Accuracy@1 and MRR@1 and 0.2011 in Recall@1 of dataset FLUME. With the
MDLSITE dataset, we obtained 0.1258 in Accuracy@1 and MRR@1 and 0.1141 in Recall@1. In the top 5,
our model reached 0.3040 in Accuracy@5, 0.2563 MRR@5, and 0.2651 Recall@5 in FLUME. In the MDLSITE
dataset, our model got 0.5270 Accuracy@5, 0.2689 MRR@5, and 0.2651 Recall@5.

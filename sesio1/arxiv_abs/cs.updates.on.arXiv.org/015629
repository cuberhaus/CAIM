Objective: The paper focuses on development of robust and accurate processing solutions for continuous
and cuff-less blood pressure (BP) monitoring. In this regard, a robust deep learning-based framework
is proposed for computation of low latency, continuous, and calibration-free upper and lower bounds
on the systolic and diastolic BP. Method: Referred to as the BP-Net, the proposed framework is a novel
convolutional architecture that provides longer effective memory while achieving superior performance
due to incorporation of casual dialated convolutions and residual connections. To utilize the
real potential of deep learning in extraction of intrinsic features (deep features) and enhance
the long-term robustness, the BP-Net uses raw Electrocardiograph (ECG) and Photoplethysmograph
(PPG) signals without extraction of any form of hand-crafted features as it is common in existing
solutions. Results: By capitalizing on the fact that datasets used in recent literature are not
unified and properly defined, a benchmark dataset is constructed from the MIMIC-I and MIMIC-III
databases obtained from PhysioNet. The proposed BP-Net is evaluated based on this benchmark dataset
demonstrating promising performance and shows superior generalizable capacity. Conclusion:
The proposed BP-Net architecture is more accurate than canonical recurrent networks and enhances
the long-term robustness of the BP estimation task. Significance: The proposed BP-Net architecture
addresses key drawbacks of existing BP estimation solutions, i.e., relying heavily on extraction
of hand-crafted features, such as pulse arrival time (PAT), and; Lack of robustness. Finally, the
constructed BP-Net dataset provides a unified base for evaluation and comparison of deep learning-based
BP estimation algorithms.

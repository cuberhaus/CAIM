We consider the construction of a polyhedral Delaunay partition as a limit of the sequence of power
diagrams (radical partitions). The dual Voronoi diagram is obtained as a limit of the sequence of
weighted Delaunay partitions. The problem is reduced to the construction of two dual convex polyhedra,
inscribed and superscribed around a circular paraboloid, as a limit of the sequence of pairs of general
dual convex polyhedra. The sequence of primal polyhedra should converge to the superscribed polyhedron
and the sequence of the dual polyhedra converges to the inscribed polyhedron. We are interested
in the case when the vertices of primal polyhedra can move or merge together, i.e., no new faces are
allowed for dual polyhedra. These rules define the transformation of the set of initial spheres
into the set of Delaunay spheres using radius variation and sphere movement and elimination. Existence
theorems are still unavailable but we suggest a functional measuring the deviation of the convex
polyhedron from the one inscribed into the paraboloid. It is the discrete Dirichlet functional
for the power function which is a linear interpolant of the vertical distance of the dual vertices
from the paraboloid. The functional's absolute minimizer is attained on the constant power field,
meaning that the inscribed polyhedron can be obtained by a simple translation. This formulation
of the functional for the dual surface is not quadratic since the unknowns are the vertices of the
primal polyhedron, hence, the transformation of the set of spheres into Delaunay spheres is not
unique. We concentrate on the experimental confirmation of the approach viability and put aside
mesh quality problems. The zero value of the gradient of the proposed functional defines a manifold
describing the evolution of Delaunay spheres. Hence, Delaunay-Voronoi meshes can be optimized
using the manifold as a constraint.

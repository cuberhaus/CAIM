A powerful tool for analyzing and approximating the singular values and eigenvalues of structured
matrices is the theory of GLT sequences. By the GLT theory one can derive a function, which describes
the singular value or the eigenvalue distribution of the sequence, the latter under precise assumptions.
However, for small values of the matrix size of the considered sequence, the approximations may
not be as good as it is desirable, since in the construction of the GLT symbol one disregards small
norm and low-rank perturbations. On the other hand, LFA can be used to construct polynomial symbols
in a similar manner for discretizations, where the geometric information is present, but the small
norm perturbations are retained. The main focus of this paper is the introduction of the concept
of sequence of "Toeplitz momentary symbols", associated with a given sequence of truncated Toeplitz-like
matrices. We construct the symbol in the same way as in the GLT theory, but we keep the information
of the small norm contributions. The low-rank contributions are still disregarded, and we give
an idea on the reason why this is negligible in certain cases and why it is not in other cases, being
aware that in presence of high nonnormality the same low-rank perturbation can produce a dramatic
change in the eigenvalue distribution. Moreover, a difference with respect to the LFA symbols is
that GLT symbols and Toeplitz momentary symbols are more general and are applicable to a larger class
of matrices. We show the applicability of the approach which leads to higher accuracy in some cases
when compared with the GLT symbol. Finally, since for many applications and their analysis it is
often necessary to consider non-square Toeplitz matrices, we formalize and provide some useful
definitions, applicable for non-square Toeplitz momentary symbols.

The originality of this publication is to look at the subject of IDP (Intelligent Document Processing)
from the perspective of an end-user and industrialist and not that of a Computer Science researcher.
This domain is one part of the challenge of information digitalisation that constitutes the Industrial
Revolution of the twenty first century (Industry 4.0) and this paper looks specifically at the difficult
areas of classifying, extracting information and subsequent integration into business processes
with respect to forms and invoices. Since the focus is on practical implementation a brief review
is carried out of the market in commercial tools for OCR, document classification and data extraction
in so far as this is publicly available together with pricing (if known). Brief definitions of the
main terms encountered in Computer Science publications and commercial prospectuses are provided
in order to de-mystify the language for the layman. A small number of practical tests are carried
out on a few real documents in order to illustrate the capabilities of tools that are commonly available
at a reasonable price. The unsolved (so far) issue of tables contained in invoices is raised. The
case of a typical large industrial company is evoked where the requirement is to extract 100 per cent
of the information with 100 per cent reliability in order to integrate into the back-end Enterprise
Resource Planning system. Finally a brief description is given of the state-of-the-art research
by the huge corporations who are pushing the boundaries of deep learning techniques further and
further with massive computing and financial power - progress that will undoubtedly trickle down
into the real world at some later date. The paper finishes by asking the question whether the objectives
and timing of the commercial world and the progress of Computer Science are fully aligned.

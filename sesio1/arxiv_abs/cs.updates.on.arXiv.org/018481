Statistical model checking is a class of sequential algorithms that can verify specifications
of interest on an ensemble of cyber-physical systems (e.g., whether 99% of cars from a batch meet
a requirement on their energy efficiency). These algorithms infer the probability that given specifications
are satisfied by the systems with provable statistical guarantees by drawing sufficient numbers
of independent and identically distributed samples. During the process of statistical model checking,
the values of the samples (e.g., a user's car energy efficiency) may be inferred by intruders, causing
privacy concerns in consumer-level applications (e.g., automobiles and medical devices). This
paper addresses the privacy of statistical model checking algorithms from the point of view of differential
privacy. These algorithms are sequential, drawing samples until a condition on their values is
met. We show that revealing the number of the samples drawn can violate privacy. We also show that
the standard exponential mechanism that randomizes the output of an algorithm to achieve differential
privacy fails to do so in the context of sequential algorithms. Instead, we relax the conservative
requirement in differential privacy that the sensitivity of the output of the algorithm should
be bounded to any perturbation for any data set. We propose a new notion of differential privacy which
we call expected differential privacy. Then, we propose a novel expected sensitivity analysis
for the sequential algorithm and proposed a corresponding exponential mechanism that randomizes
the termination time to achieve the expected differential privacy. We apply the proposed mechanism
to statistical model checking algorithms to preserve the privacy of the samples they draw. The utility
of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated in a case study.

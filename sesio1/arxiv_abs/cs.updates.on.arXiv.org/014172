Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC) is a worldwide malignant epithelial cancer. Survival prediction
is a major concern for NPC patients, as it provides early prognostic information that is needed to
guide treatments. Recently, deep learning, which leverages Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to learn
deep representations of image patterns, has been introduced to the survival prediction in various
cancers including NPC. It has been reported that image-derived end-to-end deep survival models
have the potential to outperform clinical prognostic indicators and traditional radiomics-based
survival models in prognostic performance. However, deep survival models, especially 3D models,
require large image training data to avoid overfitting. Unfortunately, medical image data is usually
scarce, especially for Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) due to the
high cost of PET/CT scanning. Compared to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Computed Tomography
(CT) providing only anatomical information of tumors, PET/CT that provides both anatomical (from
CT) and metabolic (from PET) information is promising to achieve more accurate survival prediction.
However, we have not identified any 3D end-to-end deep survival model that applies to small PET/CT
data of NPC patients. In this study, we introduced the concept of multi-task leaning into deep survival
models to address the overfitting problem resulted from small data. Tumor segmentation was incorporated
as an auxiliary task to enhance the model's efficiency of learning from scarce PET/CT data. Based
on this idea, we proposed a 3D end-to-end Deep Multi-Task Survival model (DeepMTS) for joint survival
prediction and tumor segmentation. Our DeepMTS can jointly learn survival prediction and tumor
segmentation using PET/CT data of only 170 patients with advanced NPC.

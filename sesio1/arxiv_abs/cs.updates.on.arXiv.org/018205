We train a neural network model to predict the full phase space evolution of cosmological N-body
simulations. Its success implies that the neural network model is accurately approximating the
Green's function expansion that relates the initial conditions of the simulations to its outcome
at later times in the deeply nonlinear regime. We test the accuracy of this approximation by assessing
its performance on well understood simple cases that have either known exact solutions or well understood
expansions. These scenarios include spherical configurations, isolated plane waves, and two
interacting plane waves: initial conditions that are very different from the Gaussian random fields
used for training. We find our model generalizes well to these well understood scenarios, demonstrating
that the networks have inferred general physical principles and learned the nonlinear mode couplings
from the complex, random Gaussian training data. These tests also provide a useful diagnostic for
finding the model's strengths and weaknesses, and identifying strategies for model improvement.
We also test the model on initial conditions that contain only transverse modes, a family of modes
that differ not only in their phases but also in their evolution from the longitudinal growing modes
used in the training set. When the network encounters these initial conditions that are orthogonal
to the training set, the model fails completely. In addition to these simple configurations, we
evaluate the model's predictions for the density, displacement, and momentum power spectra with
standard initial conditions for N-body simulations. We compare these summary statistics against
N-body results and an approximate, fast simulation method called COLA. Our model achieves percent
level accuracy at nonlinear scales of $k\sim 1\ \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}\, h$, representing a significant
improvement over COLA.

A major impediment to successful drug development is the complexity, cost, and scale of clinical
trials. The detailed internal structure of clinical trial data can make conventional optimization
difficult to achieve. Recent advances in machine learning, specifically graph-structured data
analysis, have the potential to enable significant progress in improving the clinical trial design.
TrialGraph seeks to apply these methodologies to produce a proof-of-concept framework for developing
models which can aid drug development and benefit patients. In this work, we first introduce a curated
clinical trial data set compiled from the CT.gov, AACT and TrialTrove databases (n=1191 trials;
representing one million patients) and describe the conversion of this data to graph-structured
formats. We then detail the mathematical basis and implementation of a selection of graph machine
learning algorithms, which typically use standard machine classifiers on graph data embedded
in a low-dimensional feature space. We trained these models to predict side effect information
for a clinical trial given information on the disease, existing medical conditions, and treatment.
The MetaPath2Vec algorithm performed exceptionally well, with standard Logistic Regression,
Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector, and Neural Network classifiers exhibiting typical
ROC-AUC scores of 0.85, 0.68, 0.86, 0.80, and 0.77, respectively. Remarkably, the best performing
classifiers could only produce typical ROC-AUC scores of 0.70 when trained on equivalent array-structured
data. Our work demonstrates that graph modelling can significantly improve prediction accuracy
on appropriate datasets. Successive versions of the project that refine modelling assumptions
and incorporate more data types can produce excellent predictors with real-world applications
in drug development.

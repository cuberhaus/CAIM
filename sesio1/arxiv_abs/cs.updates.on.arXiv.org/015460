With the increasing number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, massive amounts of raw data is being
generated. The latency, cost, and other challenges in cloud-based IoT data processing have driven
the adoption of Edge and Fog computing models, where some data processing tasks are moved closer
to data sources. Properly dealing with the flow of such data requires building data pipelines, to
control the complete life cycle of data streams from data acquisition at the data source, edge and
fog processing, to Cloud side storage and analytics. Data analytics tasks need to be executed dynamically
at different distances from the data sources and often on very heterogeneous hardware devices.
This can be streamlined by the use of a Serverless (or FaaS) cloud computing model, where tasks are
defined as virtual functions, which can be migrated from edge to cloud (and vice versa) and executed
in an event-driven manner on data streams. In this work, we investigate the benefits of building
Serverless data pipelines (SDP) for IoT data analytics and evaluate three different approaches
for designing SDPs: 1) Off-the-shelf data flow tool (DFT) based, 2) Object storage service (OSS)
based and 3) MQTT based. Further, we applied these strategies on three fog applications (Aeneas,
PocketSphinx, and custom Video processing application) and evaluated the performance by comparing
their processing time (computation time, network communication and disk access time), and resource
utilization. Results show that DFT is unsuitable for compute-intensive applications such as video
or image processing, whereas OSS is best suitable for this task. However, DFT is nicely fit for bandwidth-intensive
applications due to the minimum use of network resources. On the other hand, MQTT-based SDP is observed
with increase in CPU and Memory usage as the number of...<truncted to fit character limit in Arxiv>

The multi-user Holographic Multiple-Input and Multiple-Output Surface (MU-HMIMOS) paradigm,
which is capable of realizing large continuous apertures with minimal power consumption, has been
recently considered as an energyefficient solution for future wireless networks, offering increased
flexibility in impacting electromagnetic (EM) wave propagation according to the desired communication,
localization, and sensing objectives. The tractable channel modeling in MU-HMIMOS wireless systems
is one of the most critical research challenges, mainly due to the coupling effect induced by the
excessively large number of closely spaced patch antennas. In this paper, we focus on this challenge
for the downlink of multi-user MIMO communications and present an EM-compliant channel model,
which is expressed in the wavenumber domain using the Fourier plane wave approximation. Based on
the proposed channel model, we investigate the spectral efficiency of maximum-ratio transmission
and Zero-Forcing (ZF) precoding schemes. We also introduce a novel hardware efficient ZF precoder,
leveraging Neumann series (NS) expansion to replace the required matrix inversion operation,
which is very hard to be computed in the conventional way due to the extremely large number of patch
antennas in the envisioned MU-HMIMOS communication systems. In comparison with the conventional
independent and identical Rayleigh fading channels that ignore antenna coupling effects, the
proposed EM-compliant channel model captures the mutual couplings induced by the very small antenna
spacing. Our extensive performance evaluation results demonstrate that our theoretical performance
expressions approximate sufficiently well the simulated achievable spectral efficiency with
the considered linear precoding schemes, even for the highly correlated cases, thus verifying
the effectiveness and robustness of the presented analytical framework.

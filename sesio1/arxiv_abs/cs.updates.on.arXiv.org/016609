With the rapidly increasing amount of scientific literature,it is getting continuously more difficult
for researchers in different disciplines to be updated with the recent findings in their field of
study.Processing scientific articles in an automated fashion has been proposed as a solution to
this problem,but the accuracy of such processing remains very poor for extraction tasks beyond
the basic ones.Few approaches have tried to change how we publish scientific results in the first
place,by making articles machine-interpretable by expressing them with formal semantics from
the start.In the work presented here,we set out to demonstrate that we can formally publish high-level
scientific claims in formal logic,and publish the results in a special issue of an existing journal.We
use the concept and technology of nanopublications for this endeavor,and represent not just the
submissions and final papers in this RDF-based format,but also the whole process in between,including
reviews,responses,and decisions.We do this by performing a field study with what we call formalization
papers,which contribute a novel formalization of a previously published claim.We received 15
submissions from 18 authors,who then went through the whole publication process leading to the
publication of their contributions in the special issue.Our evaluation shows the technical and
practical feasibility of our approach.The participating authors mostly showed high levels of
interest and confidence,and mostly experienced the process as not very difficult,despite the
technical nature of the current user interfaces.We believe that these results indicate that it
is possible to publish scientific results from different fields with machine-interpretable semantics
from the start,which in turn opens countless possibilities to radically improve in the future the
effectiveness and efficiency of the scientific endeavor as a whole.

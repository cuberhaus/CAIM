We introduce a data-driven fractional modeling framework aimed at complex materials, and particularly
bio-tissues. From multi-step relaxation experiments of distinct anatomical locations of porcine
urinary bladder, we identify an anomalous relaxation character, with two power-law-like behaviors
for short/long long times, and nonlinearity for strains greater than 25%. The first component of
our framework is an existence study, to determine admissible fractional viscoelastic models that
qualitatively describe the linear relaxation behavior. After the linear viscoelastic model is
selected, the second stage adds large-strain effects to the framework through a fractional quasi-linear
viscoelastic approach, given by a multiplicative kernel decomposition of the selected relaxation
function and a nonlinear elastic response for the bio-tissue of interest. From single-relaxation
data of the urinary bladder, a fractional Maxwell model captures both short/long-term behaviors
with two fractional orders, being the most suitable model for small strains at the first stage. For
the second stage, multi-step relaxation data under large strains were employed to calibrate a four-parameter
fractional quasi-linear viscoelastic model, that combines a Scott-Blair relaxation function
and an exponential instantaneous stress response, to describe the elastin/collagen phases of
bladder rheology. Our obtained results demonstrate that the employed fractional quasi-linear
model, with a single fractional order in the range $\alpha = 0.25 - 0.30$, is suitable for the porcine
urinary bladder, producing errors below 2% without need for recalibration over subsequent applied
strains. We conclude that fractional models are attractive tools to capture the bladder tissue
behavior under small-to-large strains and multiple time scales, therefore being potential alternatives
to describe multiple stages of bladder functionality.

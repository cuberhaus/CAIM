We consider the problem of space-efficiently estimating the number of simplices in a hypergraph
stream. This is the most natural hypergraph generalization of the highly-studied problem of estimating
the number of triangles in a graph stream. Our input is a $k$-uniform hypergraph $H$ with $n$ vertices
and $m$ hyperedges. A $k$-simplex in $H$ is a subhypergraph on $k+1$ vertices $X$ such that all $k+1$
possible hyperedges among $X$ exist in $H$. The goal is to process a stream of hyperedges of $H$ and
compute a good estimate of $T_k(H)$, the number of $k$-simplices in $H$. We design a suite of algorithms
for this problem. Under a promise that $T_k(H) \ge T$, our algorithms use at most four passes and together
imply a space bound of $O( \epsilon^{-2} \log\delta^{-1} \text{polylog} n \cdot \min\{ m^{1+1/k}/T,
m/T^{2/(k+1)} \} )$ for each fixed $k \ge 3$, in order to guarantee an estimate within $(1\pm\epsilon)T_k(H)$
with probability at least $1-\delta$. We also give a simpler $1$-pass algorithm that achieves $O(\epsilon^{-2}
\log\delta^{-1} \log n\cdot (m/T) ( \Delta_E + \Delta_V^{1-1/k} ))$ space, where $\Delta_E$ (respectively,
$\Delta_V$) denotes the maximum number of $k$-simplices that share a hyperedge (respectively,
a vertex). We complement these algorithmic results with space lower bounds of the form $\Omega(\epsilon^{-2})$,
$\Omega(m^{1+1/k}/T)$, $\Omega(m/T^{1-1/k})$ and $\Omega(m\Delta_V^{1/k}/T)$ for multi-pass
algorithms and $\Omega(m\Delta_E/T)$ for $1$-pass algorithms, which show that some of the dependencies
on parameters in our upper bounds are nearly tight. Our techniques extend and generalize several
different ideas previously developed for triangle counting in graphs, using appropriate innovations
to handle the more complicated combinatorics of hypergraphs.

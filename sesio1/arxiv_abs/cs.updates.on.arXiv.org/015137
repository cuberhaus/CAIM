Memory safety remains a critical and widely violated property in reality. Numerous defense techniques
have been proposed and developed but most of them are not applied or enabled by default in production-ready
environment due to their substantial running cost. The situation might change in the near future
because the hardware supported defenses against these attacks are finally beginning to be adopted
by commercial processors, operating systems and compilers. We then face a question as there is currently
no suitable test suite to measure the memory safety extensions supported on different processors.
In fact, the issue is not constrained only for memory safety but all aspect of processor security.
All of the existing test suites related to processor security lack some of the key properties, such
as comprehensiveness, distinguishability and portability. As an initial step, we propose an expandable
test framework for measuring the processor security and open source a memory safety test suite utilizing
this framework. The framework is deliberately designed to be flexible so it can be gradually extended
to all types of hardware supported security extensions in processors. The initial test suite for
memory safety currently contains 160 test cases covering spatial and temporal safety of memory,
memory access control, pointer integrity and control-flow integrity. Each type of vulnerabilities
and their related defenses have been individually evaluated by one or more test cases. The test suite
has been ported to three different instruction set architectures (ISAs) and experimented on six
different platforms. We have also utilized the test suite to explore the security benefits of applying
different sets of compiler flags available on the latest GNU GCC and LLVM compilers.

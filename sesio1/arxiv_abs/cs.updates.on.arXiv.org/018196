Annotating cancerous regions in whole-slide images (WSIs) of pathology samples plays a critical
role in clinical diagnosis, biomedical research, and machine learning algorithms development.
However, generating exhaustive and accurate annotations is labor-intensive, challenging, and
costly. Drawing only coarse and approximate annotations is a much easier task, less costly, and
it alleviates pathologists' workload. In this paper, we study the problem of refining these approximate
annotations in digital pathology to obtain more accurate ones. Some previous works have explored
obtaining machine learning models from these inaccurate annotations, but few of them tackle the
refinement problem where the mislabeled regions should be explicitly identified and corrected,
and all of them require a -- often very large -- number of training samples. We present a method, named
Label Cleaning Multiple Instance Learning (LC-MIL), to refine coarse annotations on a single WSI
without the need of external training data. Patches cropped from a WSI with inaccurate labels are
processed jointly within a multiple instance learning framework, mitigating their impact on the
predictive model and refining the segmentation. Our experiments on a heterogeneous WSI set with
breast cancer lymph node metastasis, liver cancer, and colorectal cancer samples show that LC-MIL
significantly refines the coarse annotations, outperforming state-of-the-art alternatives,
even while learning from a single slide. Moreover, we demonstrate how real annotations drawn by
pathologists can be efficiently refined and improved by the proposed approach. All these results
demonstrate that LC-MIL is a promising, light-weight tool to provide fine-grained annotations
from coarsely annotated pathology sets.

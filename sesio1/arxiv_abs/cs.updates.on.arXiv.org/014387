Background: The construction, evolution and usage of complex artificial intelligence (AI) models
demand expensive computational resources. While currently available high-performance computing
environments support well this complexity, the deployment of AI models in mobile devices, which
is an increasing trend, is challenging. Mobile applications consist of environments with low computational
resources and hence imply limitations in the design decisions during the AI-enabled software engineering
lifecycle that balance the trade-off between the accuracy and the complexity of the mobile applications.
Objective: Our objective is to systematically assess the trade-off between accuracy and complexity
when deploying complex AI models (e.g. neural networks) to mobile devices, which have an implicit
resource limitation. We aim to cover (i) the impact of the design decisions on the achievement of
high-accuracy and low resource-consumption implementations; and (ii) the validation of profiling
tools for systematically promoting greener AI. Method: This confirmatory registered report consists
of a plan to conduct an empirical study to quantify the implications of the design decisions on AI-enabled
applications performance and to report experiences of the end-to-end AI-enabled software engineering
lifecycle. Concretely, we will implement both image-based and language-based neural networks
in mobile applications to solve multiple image classification and text classification problems
on different benchmark datasets. Overall, we plan to model the accuracy and complexity of AI-enabled
applications in operation with respect to their design decisions and will provide tools for allowing
practitioners to gain consciousness of the quantitative relationship between the design decisions
and the green characteristics of study.

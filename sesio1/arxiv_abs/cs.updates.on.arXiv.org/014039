In this paper, we propose a novel memory-centric scheme based on CMOS SRAM for acceleration of data
intensive applications. Our proposal aims at dynamically increasing the on-chip memory storage
capacity of SRAM arrays on-demand. The proposed scheme called - Augmented Memory Computing allows
an SRAM cell to operate in two different modes 1) the Normal mode and 2) the Augmented mode. In the Normal
mode of operation, the SRAM cell functions like a standard 6 transistor (6T) SRAM cell, storing one
bit of data in static format. While in the Augmented mode, each SRAM cell can store >1 bit of data (in
a dynamic fashion). Specifically, we propose two novel SRAM cells - an 8 transistor (8T) dual bit
storage augmented cell and a 7 transistor (7T) ternary bit storage augmented cell. The proposed
8T dual bit SRAM cell when operated in the Augmented mode, can store a static bit of data while also,
simultaneously, storing another bit in a dynamic form. Thus, when operated in Augmented mode, the
8T SRAM cell can store two bits of data - one SRAM-like data and one DRAM-like data, thereby increasing
or augmenting the memory storage capacity. On the other hand, the proposed 7T ternary bit storage
augmented cell can either store a single SRAM data in Normal mode or can be configured to operate in
Augmented mode, wherein it can store ternary data (3 levels (0,0), (0,1), (1,0)) in a dynamic manner.
Thus, based on the mode of operation, the proposed augmented memory bit-cells can either store one
static bit of data or >1 bit of data in a dynamic format. We show the feasibility of our proposed bit-cells
through extensive simulations at Globalfoundries 22nm FDX node. It is worth mentioning, the novel
scheme of augmented memory bit-cells can be seamlessly combined with existing in-memory computing
approaches for added energy and throughput benefits.

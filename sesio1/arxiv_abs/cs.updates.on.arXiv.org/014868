In recent years, multi-factor strategies have gained increasing popularity in the financial industry,
as they allow investors to have a better understanding of the risk drivers underlying their portfolios.
Moreover, such strategies promise to promote diversification and thus limit losses in times of
financial turmoil. However, recent studies have reported a significant level of redundancy between
these factors, which might enhance risk contagion among multi-factor portfolios during financial
crises. Therefore, it is of fundamental importance to better understand the relationships among
factors. Empowered by recent advances in causal structure learning methods, this paper presents
a study of the causal structure of financial risk factors and its evolution over time. In particular,
the data we analyze covers 11 risk factors concerning the US equity market, spanning a period of 29
years at daily frequency. Our results show a statistically significant sparsifying trend of the
underlying causal structure. However, this trend breaks down during periods of financial stress,
in which we can observe a densification of the causal network driven by a growth of the out-degree
of the market factor node. Finally, we present a comparison with the analysis of factors cross-correlations,
which further confirms the importance of causal analysis for gaining deeper insights in the dynamics
of the factor system, particularly during economic downturns. Our findings are especially significant
from a risk-management perspective. They link the evolution of the causal structure of equity risk
factors with market volatility and a worsening macroeconomic environment, and show that, in times
of financial crisis, exposure to different factors boils down to exposure to the market risk factor.

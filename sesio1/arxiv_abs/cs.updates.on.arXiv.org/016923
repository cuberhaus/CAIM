We present a new method for assessing and measuring homophily in networks whose nodes have categorical
attributes, namely when the nodes of networks come partitioned into classes (colors). We probe
this method in two different classes of networks: i) Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks,
where nodes correspond to proteins, partitioned according to their functional role, and edges
represent potential interactions between proteins ii) Pokec on-line social network, where nodes
correspond to users, partitioned according to their age, and edges respresent friendship between
users. Similarly to other classical and well consolidated approaches, our method compares the
relative edge density of the subgraphs induced by each class with the corresponding expected relative
edge density under a null model. The novelty of our approach consists in prescribing an endogenous
null model, namely, the sample space of the null model is built on the input network itself. This allows
us to give exact explicit expression for the $\mathbf{z}$-score of the relative edge density of
each class as well as other related statistics. The $\mathbf{z}$-scores directly quantify the
statistical significance of the observed homophily via \v{C}eby\v{s}\"{e}v inequality. The
expression of each $\mathbf{z}$-score is entered by the network structure through basic combinatorial
invariant such as the number of subgraphs with two spanning edges. Each $\mathbf{z}$-score is computed
in $O(n+m)$ worst-case time for a network with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges. This leads to an overall effective
computational method for assesing homophily. We complement the analysis of homophily/heterophily
by considering $\mathbf{z}$-scores of the number of isolated nodes in the subgraphs induced by
each class, that are computed in $O(nm)$ worst-case time.

We explore the locomotion of soft robots in granular medium (GM) resulting from the elastic deformation
of slender rods. A low-cost, rapidly fabricable robot inspired by the physiological structure
of bacteria is presented. It consists of a rigid head, with a motor and batteries embedded, and multiple
elastic rods (our model for flagella) to investigate locomotion in GM. The elastic flagella are
rotated at one end by the motor, and they deform due to the drag from GM, propelling the robot. The external
drag is determined by the flagellar shape, while the latter changes due to the competition between
external loading and elastic forces. In this coupled fluid-structure interaction problem, we
observe that increasing the number of flagella can decrease or increase the propulsive speed of
the robot, depending on the physical parameters of the system. This nonlinearity in the functional
relation between propulsion and the parameters of this simple robot motivates us to fundamentally
analyze its mechanics using theory, numerical simulation, and experiments. We present a simple
Euler-Bernoulli beam theory-based analytical framework that is capable of qualitatively capturing
both cases. Theoretical prediction quantitatively matches experiments when the flagellar deformation
is small. To account for the geometrically nonlinear deformation often encountered in soft robots
and microbes, we implement a simulation framework that incorporates discrete differential geometry-based
simulations of elastic rods, a resistive force theory-based model for drag, and a modified Stokes
law for the hydrodynamics of the robot head. Comparison with experimental data indicates that the
simulations can quantitatively predict robotic motion. Overall, the theoretical and numerical
tools presented in this paper can shed light on the design and control of this class of articulated
robots in granular or fluid media.

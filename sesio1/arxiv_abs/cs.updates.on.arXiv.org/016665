Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide. The human epidermal growth factor
receptor 2 (HER2) with immunohistochemical (IHC) is widely used for pathological evaluation to
provide the appropriate therapy for patients with breast cancer. However, the deficiency of pathologists
and subjective and susceptible to inter-observer variation of visual diagnosis are the main challenges.
Recently, with the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) in disease diagnosis, several
automated HER2 scoring methods using traditional computer vision or machine learning methods
indicate the improvement of the HER2 diagnostic accuracy, but the unreasonable interpretation
in pathology, as well as the expensive and ethical issues for annotation, make these methods still
have a long way to deploy in hospitals to ease pathologists' burden in real. In this paper, we propose
a HER2 automated scoring system that strictly follows the HER2 scoring guidelines simulating the
real workflow of HER2 scores diagnosis by pathologists. Unlike the previous work, our method considers
the positive control of HER2 to make sure the assay performance for each slide, eliminating work
for repeated comparison between the current field of view (FOV) and positive control FOV, especially
for the borderline cases. Besides, for each selected FOV under the microscope, our system provides
real-time HER2 scores analysis and visualizations of the membrane staining intensity and completeness
corresponding with the cell classifications. Our rigorous workflow along with the flexible interactive
adjustion in demand substantially assists pathologists to finish the HER2 diagnosis faster and
improves the robustness and accuracy. The proposed system will be embedded in our Thorough Eye platform
for deployment in hospitals.

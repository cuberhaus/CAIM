Sales forecasting is the prerequisite for a lot of managerial decisions such as production planning,
material resource planning and budgeting in the supply chain. Promotions are one of the most important
business strategies that are often used to boost sales. While promotions are attractive for generating
demand, it is often difficult to forecast demand in their presence. In the past few decades, several
quantitative models have been developed to forecast sales including statistical and machine learning
models. However, these methods may not be adequate to account for all the internal and external factors
that may impact sales. As a result, qualitative models have been adopted along with quantitative
methods as consulting experts has been proven to improve forecast accuracy by providing contextual
information. Such models are being used extensively to account for factors that can lead to a rapid
change in sales, such as during promotions. In this paper, we aim to use Bayesian Networks to forecast
promotional sales where a combination of factors such as price, type of promotions, and product
location impacts sales. We choose to develop a BN model because BN models essentially have the capability
to combine various qualitative and quantitative factors with causal forms, making it an attractive
tool for sales forecasting during promotions. This can be used to adjust a company's promotional
strategy in the context of this case study. We gather sales data for a particular product from a retailer
that sells products in Australia. We develop a Bayesian Network for this product and validate our
results by empirical analysis. This paper confirms that BNs can be effectively used to forecast
sales, especially during promotions. In the end, we provide some research avenues for using BNs
in forecasting sales.

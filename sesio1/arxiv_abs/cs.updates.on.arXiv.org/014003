We explore how astronomers take observational data from telescopes, process them into usable scientific
data products, curate them for later use, and reuse data for further inquiry. Astronomers have invested
heavily in knowledge infrastructures - robust networks of people, artifacts, and institutions
that generate, share, and maintain specific knowledge about the human and natural worlds. Drawing
upon a decade of interviews and ethnography, this article compares how three astronomy groups capture,
process, and archive data, and for whom. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey is a mission with a dedicated
telescope and instruments, while the Black Hole Group and Integrative Astronomy Group (both pseudonyms)
are university-based, investigator-led collaborations. Findings are organized into four themes:
how these projects develop and maintain their workflows; how they capture and archive their data;
how they maintain and repair knowledge infrastructures; and how they use and reuse data products
over time. We found that astronomers encode their research methods in software known as pipelines.
Algorithms help to point telescopes at targets, remove artifacts, calibrate instruments, and
accomplish myriad validation tasks. Observations may be reprocessed many times to become new data
products that serve new scientific purposes. Knowledge production in the form of scientific publications
is the primary goal of these projects. They vary in incentives and resources to sustain access to
their data products. We conclude that software pipelines are essential components of astronomical
knowledge infrastructures, but are fragile, difficult to maintain and repair, and often invisible.
Reusing data products is fundamental to the science of astronomy, whether or not those resources
are made publicly available. We make recommendations for sustaining access to data products in
scientific fields such as astronomy.

The tutor-web drilling system is designed for learning so there are typically no limits on the number
of attempts at improving performance. This system is used at multiple schools and universities
in Iceland and Kenya, mostly for mathematics and statistics. Students earn SmileyCoin, a cryptocurrency,
while studying. In Iceland the system has typically been used by students who use their own devices
to solve homework assignments during the semester, accessing the Internet-based tutor-web at
this http URL These students typically take final exams on paper at the end of the semester. In Kenya
the system is a part of a plan to enhance mathematics education using educational technology, organised
by the Smiley Charity with the African Maths Initiative. This has been done by donating servers running
the tutor-web to schools and tablets to students. Typically these schools do not have Internet access
so the cryptocurrency can not be used. Innovative redesign was needed during COVID-19 in spring,
2020, since universities in Iceland were not able to host in-house finals and schools in Kenya were
closed so tablets could not be donated directly to students. Remote finals were held in Iceland but
the implementation was largely in the hands of the instructors. In Kenya, community libraries remained
open and became a place for students to come in to study. Innovations included using the tutor-web
as a remote drilling system in place of final exams in a large undergraduate course in statistics
and donating tablets to libraries in Kenya. These libraries all have access to the Internet and the
students have therefore been given the option to purchase the tablet using their SmileyCoin. This
paper describes these implementations and how this unintended experiment will likely affect the
future development and use of the tutor-web in both countries.

Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain systems, especially those that allow stakeholders to organize
themselves in ``stake-pools'', have emerged as a compelling paradigm for the deployment of large
scale distributed ledgers. A stake-pool operates a node that engages in the PoS protocol and potentially
represents a large number of smaller stakeholders. While such pooled PoS operation is attractive
from various angles, it also exhibits a significant shortcoming that, so far and to the best of our
knowledge, has not been sufficiently understood or investigated. Pooled PoS operation, to be effective
and not lead to sub-optimal dictatorial or cartel-like configurations, should enable the stakeholders
to revoke and re-delegate their stake in a way that is aligned with their incentives. However, given
that stake-pool operators are exactly those entities who determine what transactions are to be
recorded in the ledger, they are quite likely to form a cartel and censor any transaction they want,
such as those that attempt to adjust the current stake-pool lineup. In this way, a power grab takes
place, where the stake-pool cartel perpetuates its control over the PoS system. We first model and
observe formally the emergence of the above problem in pooled PoS systems, and then we describe an
anti-censorship mechanism that takes advantage of the underlying cryptographic functions of
the ledger and the nature of peer-to-peer networks to diffuse information without suppression.
We provide a thorough game-theoretic analysis of this mechanism discovering various types of Nash
equilibria which demonstrate that the ``revolution'', i.e., the strategic decision of pool members
to withdraw support from a censoring cartel as well as the pool operators to step down, can be incentivized,
under suitable and plausible conditions in the utility functions of the involved participants.

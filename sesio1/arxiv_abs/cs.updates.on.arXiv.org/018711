Cities around the world vary in terms of their transportation networks and travel demand patterns;
these variations affect the viability of shared mobility services. This study proposes metrics
to quantify the shareability of person-trips in a city, as a function of two inputs--the road network
structure and origin-destination (OD) travel demand. The study first conceptualizes a fundamental
shareability unit, 'flow overlap'. Flow overlap denotes, for a person-trip traversing a given
path, the weighted (by link distance) average number of other trips sharing the links along the original
person's path. The study extends this concept to the network level and formulates the Maximum Network
Flow Overlap Problem (MNFLOP) to assign all OD trips to paths that maximize network-wide flow overlap.
The study utilizes the MNFLOP output to calculate metrics of shareability at various levels of aggregation:
person-trip level, OD level, origin or destination level, network level, and link level. The study
applies the MNFLOP and associated shareability metrics to different OD demand scenarios in the
Sioux Falls network. The computational results verify that (i) MNFLOP assigns person-trips to
paths such that flow overlaps significantly increase relative to shortest path assignment, (ii)
MNFLOP and its associated shareability metrics can meaningfully differentiate between different
OD trip matrices in terms of shareability, and (iii) an MNFLOP-based metric can quantify demand
dispersion--a metric of the directionality of demand--in addition to the magnitude of demand,
for trips originating or terminating from a single node in the network. The paper also includes an
extensive discussion of potential future uses of the MNFLOP and its associated shareability metrics.

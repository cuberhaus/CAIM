The Treewidth-2 Vertex Deletion problem asks whether a set of at most $t$ vertices can be removed
from a graph, such that the resulting graph has treewidth at most two. A graph has treewidth at most
two if and only if it does not contain a $K_4$ minor. Hence, this problem corresponds to the NP-hard
$\mathcal{F}$-Minor Cover problem with $\mathcal{F} = \{K_4\}$. For any variant of the $\mathcal{F}$-Minor
Cover problem where $\mathcal{F}$ contains a planar graph, it is known that a polynomial kernel
exists. I.e., a preprocessing routine that in polynomial time outputs an equivalent instance of
size $t^{O(1)}$. However, this proof is non-constructive, meaning that this proof does not yield
an explicit bound on the kernel size. The $\{K_4\}$-Minor Cover problem is the simplest variant
of the $\mathcal{F}$-Minor Cover problem with an unknown kernel size. To develop a constructive
kernelization algorithm, we present a new method to decompose graphs into near-protrusions, such
that near-protrusions in this new decomposition can be reduced using elementary reduction rules.
Our method extends the `approximation and tidying' framework by van Bevern et al. [Algorithmica
2012] to provide guarantees stronger than those provided by both this framework and a regular protrusion
decomposition. Furthermore, we provide extensions of the elementary reduction rules used by the
$\{K_4, K_{2,3}\}$-Minor Cover kernelization algorithm introduced by Donkers et al. [IPEC 2021].
Using the new decomposition method and reduction rules, we obtain a kernel consisting of $O(t^{41})$
vertices, which is the first constructive kernel. This kernel is a step towards more concrete kernelization
bounds for the $\mathcal{F}$-Minor Cover problem where $\mathcal{F}$ contains a planar graph,
and our decomposition provides a potential direction to achieve these new bounds.

We present local distributed, stochastic algorithms for \emph{alignment} in self-organizing
particle systems (SOPS) on two-dimensional lattices, where particles occupy unique sites on the
lattice, and particles can make spatial moves to neighboring sites if they are unoccupied. Such
models are abstractions of programmable matter, composed of individual computational particles
with limited memory, strictly local communication abilities, and modest computational capabilities.
We consider oriented particle systems, where particles are assigned a vector pointing in one of
$q$ directions, and each particle can compute the angle between its direction and the direction
of any neighboring particle, although without knowledge of global orientation with respect to
a fixed underlying coordinate system. Particles move stochastically, with each particle able
to either modify its direction or make a local spatial move along a lattice edge during a move. We consider
two settings: (a) where particle configurations must remain simply connected at all times and (b)
where spatial moves are unconstrained and configurations can disconnect. Taking inspiration
from the Potts and clock models from statistical physics, we prove that for any $q \geq 2,$ these self-organizing
particle systems can be made to collectively align along a single dominant direction (analogous
to a solid or ordered state) or remain non-aligned, in which case the fraction of particles oriented
along any direction is nearly equal (analogous to a gaseous or disordered state). Moreover, we show
that with appropriate settings of the input parameters, we can achieve \emph{compression} and
\emph{expansion}, controlling how tightly gathered the particles are, as well as \emph{alignment}
or \emph{nonalignment}, producing a single dominant orientation or not.

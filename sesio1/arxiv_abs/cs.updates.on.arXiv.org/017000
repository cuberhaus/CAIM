Many transit agencies operating paratransit and microtransit services have to respond to trip
requests that arrive in real-time, which entails solving hard combinatorial and sequential decision-making
problems under uncertainty. To avoid decisions that lead to significant inefficiency in the long
term, vehicles should be allocated to requests by optimizing a non-myopic utility function or by
batching requests together and optimizing a myopic utility function. While the former approach
is typically offline, the latter can be performed online. We point out two major issues with such
approaches when applied to paratransit services in practice. First, it is difficult to batch paratransit
requests together as they are temporally sparse. Second, the environment in which transit agencies
operate changes dynamically (e.g., traffic conditions), causing estimates that are learned offline
to become stale. To address these challenges, we propose a fully online approach to solve the dynamic
vehicle routing problem (DVRP) with time windows and stochastic trip requests that is robust to
changing environmental dynamics by construction. We focus on scenarios where requests are relatively
sparse - our problem is motivated by applications to paratransit services. We formulate DVRP as
a Markov decision process and use Monte Carlo tree search to evaluate actions for any given state.
Accounting for stochastic requests while optimizing a non-myopic utility function is computationally
challenging; indeed, the action space for such a problem is intractably large in practice. To tackle
the large action space, we leverage the structure of the problem to design heuristics that can sample
promising actions for the tree search. Our experiments using real-world data from our partner agency
show that the proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches both in terms
of performance and robustness.

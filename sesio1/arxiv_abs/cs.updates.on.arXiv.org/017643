Given an undirected graph $G$, a conflict-free coloring CFON* (resp. CFCN*) is an assignment of
colors to a subset of the vertices of the graph, such that for every vertex there exists a color that
is assigned to exactly one vertex in its open neighborhood (resp. closed neighborhood). The conflict-free
coloring problem asks to find the minimum number of colors required for such a CFON* (resp. CFCN*)
coloring, called the conflict-free chromatic number, denoted by $\chi^*_{ON}(G)$ (resp. $\chi^*_{CN}(G)$).
The decision versions of the problems are NP-complete in general. In this paper, we show the following
results on the conflict-free coloring problem under open and closed neighborhood settings. Both
versions of the problem are fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by the combined parameters
clique width and the solution size. We also show the existence of graphs that have bounded clique
width and unbounded conflict-free chromatic numbers (on both versions). We show that $\chi^*_{CN}(G)\leq
3$, for a distance hereditary graph $G$. On the contrary, we show the existence of a distance hereditary
graph that has an unbounded $\chi^*_{ON}(G)$. On the positive side, we show that block graphs and
cographs (which are subclasses of distance hereditary graphs) have bounds of three and two respectively
for $\chi^*_{ON}(G)$, and show that both problems are polynomial time solvable on block graphs
and cographs. We show that $\chi^*_{ON}(G)\leq 3$, for an interval graph $G$, improving the bound
by Reddy (2018) and also prove that the above bound is tight. Moreover, we give upper bounds for $\chi^*_{ON}(G)$
on unit square and unit disk graphs and show NP-completeness results. For split graphs, we show that
the CFON* problem is NP-complete and the CFCN* problem is polynomial time solvable. We study the
problems on Kneser graphs and give upper and lower bounds.

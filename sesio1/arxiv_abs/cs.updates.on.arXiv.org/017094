Web phishing remains a serious cyber threat responsible for most data breaches. Machine Learning
(ML)-based anti-phishing detectors are seen as an effective countermeasure, and are increasingly
adopted by web-browsers and software products. However, with an average of 10K phishing links reported
per hour to platforms such as PhishTank and VirusTotal (VT), the deficiencies of such ML-based solutions
are laid bare. We first explore how phishing sites bypass ML-based detection with a deep dive into
13K phishing pages targeting major brands such as Facebook. Results show successful evasion is
caused by: (1) use of benign services to obscure phishing URLs; (2) high similarity between the HTML
structures of phishing and benign pages; (3) hiding the ultimate phishing content within Javascript
and running such scripts only on the client; (4) looking beyond typical credentials and credit cards
for new content such as IDs and documents; (5) hiding phishing content until after human interaction.
We attribute the root cause to the dependency of ML-based models on the vertical feature space (webpage
content). These solutions rely only on what phishers present within the page itself. Thus, we propose
Anti-SubtlePhish, a more resilient model based on logistic regression. The key augmentation is
the inclusion of a horizontal feature space, which examines correlation variables between the
final render of suspicious pages against what trusted services have recorded (e.g., PageRank).
To defeat (1) and (2), we correlate information between WHOIS, PageRank, and page analytics. To
combat (3), (4) and (5), we correlate features after rendering the page. Experiments with 100K phishing/benign
sites show promising accuracy (98.8%). We also obtained 100% accuracy against 0-day phishing pages
that were manually crafted, comparing well to the 0% recorded by VT vendors over the first four days.

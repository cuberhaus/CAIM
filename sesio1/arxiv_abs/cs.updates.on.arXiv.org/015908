The spirit of "blockchain technology" is a distributed database in which saved data is transparent,
accountable, public, immutable, and traceable. This base-level disruptive technology can boost
the security and privacy-related efficiency of various domains. As Bangladesh is currently aiming
for sustainable development, blockchain technology adoption by local researchers is growing
robustly. However, in Bangladesh, the blockchain Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is not yet
well structured which is also limiting the perspective of local developers and researchers. Therefore,
sectors like governance, healthcare, security, privacy, farming, information authentication,
cryptocurrencies, internet architecture, data, and so on are unable to utilize the full potential
of this technology. In this research, the authors conduct an in-depth review of such types of blockchain
technology-related research articles that have been published recently and are also solely focused
on Bangladesh. From 5 publishers (IEEE Xplore, ACM, ScienceDirect, Taylor & Francis, and SpringerLink)
this study analyses 70 articles published during the year 2016-2020. The study results find the
top 13 sectors where Bangladeshi researchers are currently focusing on. Those studies identify
that the rigid policy by the government, scarcity of expert researchers, and lack of resources are
the main reasons why Bangladesh is still struggling to accommodate blockchain extensively. In
addition, published papers are mostly based on theoretical concepts without an appropriate implementation.
Finally, this study will be a great resource to the developers, entrepreneurs, and technology enthusiasts
to determine the strategic plan for adopting blockchain technology in Bangladesh or even in any
other developing country.

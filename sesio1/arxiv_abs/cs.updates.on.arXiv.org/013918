We propose to apply non-linear representation learning to voxelwise rs-fMRI data. Learning the
non-linear representations is done using a variational autoencoder (VAE). The VAE is trained on
voxelwise rs-fMRI data and performs non-linear dimensionality reduction that retains meaningful
information. The retention of information in the model's representations is evaluated using downstream
age regression and sex classification tasks. The results on these tasks are highly encouraging
and a linear regressor trained with the representations of our unsupervised model performs almost
as well as a supervised neural network, trained specifically for age regression on the same dataset.
The model is also evaluated with a schizophrenia diagnosis prediction task, to assess its feasibility
as a dimensionality reduction method for neuropsychiatric datasets. These results highlight
the potential for pre-training on a larger set of individuals who do not have mental illness, to improve
the downstream neuropsychiatric task results. The pre-trained model is fine-tuned for a variable
number of epochs on a schizophrenia dataset and we find that fine-tuning for 1 epoch yields the best
results. This work therefore not only opens up non-linear dimensionality reduction for voxelwise
rs-fMRI data but also shows that pre-training a deep learning model on voxelwise rs-fMRI datasets
greatly increases performance even on smaller datasets. It also opens up the ability to look at the
distribution of rs-fMRI time series in the latent space of the VAE for heterogeneous neuropsychiatric
disorders like schizophrenia in future work. This can be complemented with the generative aspect
of the model that allows us to reconstruct points from the model's latent space back into brain space
and obtain an improved understanding of the relation that the VAE learns between subjects, timepoints,
and a subject's characteristics.

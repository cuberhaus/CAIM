Given a sequence of sets, where each set is associated with a timestamp and contains an arbitrary
number of elements, the task of temporal sets prediction aims to predict the elements in the subsequent
set. Previous studies for temporal sets prediction mainly capture each user's evolutionary preference
by learning from his/her own sequence. Although insightful, we argue that: 1) the collaborative
signals latent in different users' sequences are essential but have not been exploited; 2) users
also tend to show stationary preferences while existing methods fail to consider. To this end, we
propose an integrated learning framework to model both the evolutionary and the stationary preferences
of users for temporal sets prediction, which first constructs a universal sequence by chronologically
arranging all the user-set interactions, and then learns on each user-set interaction. In particular,
for each user-set interaction, we first design an evolutionary user preference modelling component
to track the user's time-evolving preference and exploit the latent collaborative signals among
different users. This component maintains a memory bank to store memories of the related user and
elements, and continuously updates their memories based on the currently encoded messages and
the past memories. Then, we devise a stationary user preference modelling module to discover each
user's personalized characteristics according to the historical sequence, which adaptively
aggregates the previously interacted elements from dual perspectives with the guidance of the
user's and elements' embeddings. Finally, we develop a set-batch algorithm to improve the model
efficiency, which can create time-consistent batches in advance and achieve 3.5x training speedups
on average. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and good interpretability
of our approach.

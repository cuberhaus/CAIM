Applications can tailor a network slice by specifying a variety of QoS attributes related to application-specific
performance, function or operation. However, some QoS attributes like guaranteed bandwidth required
by the application do vary over time. For example, network bandwidth needs of video streams from
surveillance cameras can vary a lot depending on the environmental conditions and the content in
the video streams. In this paper, we propose a novel, dynamic QoS attribute prediction technique
that assists any application to make optimal resource reservation requests at all times. Standard
forecasting using traditional cost functions like MAE, MSE, RMSE, MDA, etc. don't work well because
they do not take into account the direction (whether the forecasting of resources is more or less
than needed), magnitude (by how much the forecast deviates, and in which direction), or frequency
(how many times the forecast deviates from actual needs, and in which direction). The direction,
magnitude and frequency have a direct impact on the application's accuracy of insights, and the
operational costs. We propose a new, parameterized cost function that takes into account all three
of them, and guides the design of a new prediction technique. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work that considers time-varying application requirements and dynamically adjusts
slice QoS requests to 5G networks in order to ensure a balance between application's accuracy and
operational costs. In a real-world deployment of a surveillance video analytics application over
17 cameras, we show that our technique outperforms other traditional forecasting methods, and
it saves 34% of network bandwidth (over a ~24 hour period) when compared to a static, one-time reservation.

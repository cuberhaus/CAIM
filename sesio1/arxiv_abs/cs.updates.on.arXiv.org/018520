Since the mid-1980s it has been known that Byzantine Agreement can be solved with probability 1 asynchronously,
even against an omniscient, computationally unbounded adversary that can adaptively \emph{corrupt}
up to $f<n/3$ parties. Moreover, the problem is insoluble with $f\geq n/3$ corruptions. However,
Bracha's 1984 protocol achieved $f<n/3$ resilience at the cost of exponential expected latency
$2^{\Theta(n)}$, a bound that has never been improved in this model with $f=\lfloor (n-1)/3 \rfloor$
corruptions. In this paper we prove that Byzantine Agreement in the asynchronous, full information
model can be solved with probability 1 against an adaptive adversary that can corrupt $f<n/3$ parties,
while incurring only polynomial latency with high probability. Our protocol follows earlier polynomial
latency protocols of King and Saia and Huang, Pettie, and Zhu, which had suboptimal resilience,
namely $f \approx n/10^9$ and $f<n/4$, respectively. Resilience $f=(n-1)/3$ is uniquely difficult
as this is the point at which the influence of the Byzantine and honest players are of roughly equal
strength. The core technical problem we solve is to design a collective coin-flipping protocol
that eventually lets us flip a coin with an unambiguous outcome. In the beginning the influence of
the Byzantine players is too powerful to overcome and they can essentially fix the coin's behavior
at will. We guarantee that after just a polynomial number of executions of the coin-flipping protocol,
either (a) the Byzantine players fail to fix the behavior of the coin (thereby ending the game) or
(b) we can ``blacklist'' players such that the blacklisting rate for Byzantine players is at least
as large as the blacklisting rate for good players. The blacklisting criterion is based on a simple
statistical test of fraud detection.

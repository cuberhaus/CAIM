We present an algorithm for synchronous deterministic Byzantine consensus, tolerant to links
failures and links asynchrony. It cares for a class of networks with specific needs, where both safety
and liveness are essential, and timely irrevocable consensus has priority over highest throughput.
The algorithm operates with redundant delivery of messages via indirect paths of up to 3 hops, aims
all correct processes to obtain a coherent view of the system state within a bounded time, and establishes
consensus with no need of leader. Consensus involves exchange of 2*n*n*n asymmetrically authenticated
messages and tolerates up to < n/2 faulty processes. We show that in a consensus system with known
members: 1) The existing concepts for delivery over a fraction of links and gossip-based reliable
multicast can be extended to also circumvent asynchronous links and thereby convert the reliable
delivery into a reliable bounded delivery. 2) A system of synchronous processes with bounded delivery
does not need a leader - all correct processes from connected majority derive and propose the same
consensus value from atomically consistent individual views on system state. 3) The required for
bounded delivery asymmetric authentication of messages is sufficient for safety of the consensus
algorithm. Key finding: the impossibility of safety and liveness of consensus in partial synchrony
is not valid in the entire space between synchrony and asynchrony. A system of synchronized synchronous
processes, which communicate with asymmetrically authenticated messages over a medium susceptible
to asynchrony and faults, can operate with: 1) defined tolerance to number of asynchronous and/or
faulty links per number of stop-failed and/or Byzantine processes; 2) leaderless algorithm with
bounded termination; and 3) conceptually ensured simultaneous safety and bounded liveness.

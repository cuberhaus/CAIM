Healthcare systems are increasingly incorporating Artificial Intelligence into their systems,
but it is not a solution for all difficulties. AI's extraordinary potential is being held back by
challenges such as a lack of medical datasets for training AI models, adversarial attacks, and a
lack of trust due to its black box working style. We explored how blockchain technology can improve
the reliability and trustworthiness of AI-based healthcare. This paper has conducted a Systematic
Literature Review to explore the state-of-the-art research studies conducted in healthcare applications
developed with different AI techniques and Blockchain Technology. This systematic literature
review proceeds with three different paths as natural language processing-based healthcare systems,
computer vision-based healthcare systems and acoustic AI-based healthcare systems. We found
that 1) Defence techniques for adversarial attacks on AI are available for specific kind of attacks
and even adversarial training is AI based technique which in further prone to different attacks.
2) Blockchain can address security and privacy issues in healthcare fraternity. 3) Medical data
verification and user provenance can be enabled with Blockchain. 4) Blockchain can protect distributed
learning on heterogeneous medical data. 5) The issues like single point of failure, non-transparency
in healthcare systems can be resolved with Blockchain. Nevertheless, it has been identified that
research is at the initial stage. As a result, we have synthesized a conceptual framework using Blockchain
Technology for AI-based healthcare applications that considers the needs of each NLP, Computer
Vision, and Acoustic AI application. A global solution for all sort of adversarial attacks on AI
based healthcare. However, this technique has significant limits and challenges that need to be
addressed in future studies.

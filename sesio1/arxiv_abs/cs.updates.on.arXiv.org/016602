The wellbeing of modern societies is dependent upon the functioning of their infrastructure networks.
This paper introduces the 3C concept, an integrative multi-system and multi-stakeholder optimization
approach for managing infrastructure interventions (e.g., maintenance, renovation, etc.).
The proposed approach takes advantage of the benefits achieved by grouping (i.e., optimizing)
intervention activities. Intervention optimization leads to substantial savings on both direct
intervention costs (operator) and indirect unavailability costs (society) by reducing the number
of system interruptions. The proposed optimization approach is formalized into a structured mathematical
model that can account for the interactions between multiple infrastructure networks and the impact
on multiple stakeholders (e.g., society and infrastructure operators), and it can accommodate
different types of intervention, such as maintenance, removal, and upgrading. The different types
of interdependencies, within and across infrastructures, are modeled using a proposed interaction
matrix (IM). The IM allows integrating the interventions of different infrastructure networks
whose interventions are normally planned independently. Moreover, the introduced 3C concept
accounts for central interventions, which are those that must occur at a pre-established time moment,
where neither delay nor advance is permitted. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed
approach, an illustrative example of a multi-system and multi-actor intervention planning is
introduced. Results show a substantial reduction in the operator and societal costs. In addition,
the optimal intervention program obtained in the analysis shows no predictable patterns, which
indicates it is a useful managerial decision support tool.

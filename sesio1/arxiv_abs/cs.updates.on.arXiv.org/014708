Continuous medical time series data such as ECG is one of the most complex time series due to its dynamic
and high dimensional characteristics. In addition, due to its sensitive nature, privacy concerns
and legal restrictions, it is often even complex to use actual data for different medical research.
As a result, generating continuous medical time series is a very critical research area. Several
research works already showed that the ability of generative adversarial networks (GANs) in the
case of continuous medical time series generation is promising. Most medical data generation works,
such as ECG synthesis, are mainly driven by the GAN model and its variation. On the other hand, Some
recent work on Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE) demonstrates its strength against
informative missingness, high dimension as well as dynamic nature of continuous time series. Instead
of considering continuous-time series as a discrete-time sequence, Neural ODE can train continuous
time series in real-time continuously. In this work, we used Neural ODE based model to generate synthetic
sine waves and synthetic ECG. We introduced a new technique to design the generative adversarial
network with Neural ODE based Generator and Discriminator. We developed three new models to synthesise
continuous medical data. Different evaluation metrics are then used to quantitatively assess
the quality of generated synthetic data for real-world applications and data analysis. Another
goal of this work is to combine the strength of GAN and Neural ODE to generate synthetic continuous
medical time series data such as ECG. We also evaluated both the GAN model and the Neural ODE model
to understand the comparative efficiency of models from the GAN and Neural ODE family in medical
data synthesis.

Neither artificial intelligence designed to play Turing's imitation game, nor augmented intelligence
built to maximize the human manipulation of information are tuned to accelerate innovation and
improve humanity's collective advance against its greatest challenges. We reconceptualize and
pilot beneficial AI to radically augment human understanding by complementing rather than competing
with human cognitive capacity. Our approach to complementary intelligence builds on insights
underlying the wisdom of crowds, which hinges on the independence and diversity of crowd members'
information and approach. By programmatically incorporating information on the evolving distribution
of scientific expertise from research papers, our approach follows the distribution of content
in the literature while avoiding the scientific crowd and the hypotheses cognitively available
to it. We use this approach to generate valuable predictions for what materials possess valuable
energy-related properties (e.g., thermoelectricity), and what compounds possess valuable medical
properties (e.g., asthma) that complement the human scientific crowd. We demonstrate that our
complementary predictions, if identified by human scientists and inventors at all, are only discovered
years further into the future. When we evaluate the promise of our predictions with first-principles
equations, we demonstrate that increased complementarity of our predictions does not decrease
and in some cases increases the probability that the predictions possess the targeted properties.
In summary, by tuning AI to avoid the crowd, we can generate hypotheses unlikely to be imagined or
pursued until the distant future and promise to punctuate scientific advance. By identifying and
correcting for collective human bias, these models also suggest opportunities to improve human
prediction by reformulating science education for discovery.

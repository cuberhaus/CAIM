In conventional molecular communication (MC) systems, the signaling molecules used for information
transmission are stored, released, and then replenished by a transmitter (TX). However, the replenishment
of signaling molecules at the TX is challenging in practice. Furthermore, in most envisioned MC
applications, e.g., in the medical field, it is not desirable to insert the TX into the MC system,
as this might impair natural biological processes. In this paper, we propose the concept of media
modulation based MC where the TX is placed outside the channel and utilizes signaling molecules
already present inside the system. The signaling molecules can assume different states which can
be switched by external stimuli. Hence, in media modulation based MC, the TX modulates information
into the state of the signaling molecules. In particular, we exploit the group of photochromic molecules,
which undergo light-induced reversible state transitions, for media modulation. We study the
usage of these molecules for information transmission in a three-dimensional duct system, which
contains an eraser, a TX, and a receiver for erasing, writing, and reading of information via external
light, respectively. We develop a statistical model for the received signal. We adopt a maximum
likelihood detector and show that it can be reduced to a threshold based detector. Furthermore,
we derive analytical expressions for the optimal threshold value and the resulting bit error rate
(BER), respectively. Finally, we investigate the impact of various system parameters on the BER
of media modulation based MC. Both the statistical model and BER results are verified by computer
simulations. Our results reveal that media modulation enables reliable information transmission,
validating it as a promising alternative to MC based on molecule emitting TXs.

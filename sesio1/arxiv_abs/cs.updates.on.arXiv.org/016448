When the threat of COVID-19 became widely acknowledged, many hoped that this epidemic would squash
"the anti-vaccine movement". However, when vaccines started arriving in rich countries at the
end of 2020, it appeared that vaccine hesitancy might be an issue even in the context of this major
epidemic. Does it mean that the mobilization of vaccine-critical activists on social media is one
of the main causes of this reticence to vaccinate against COVID-19? In this paper, we wish to contribute
to current work on vaccine hesitancy during the COVID-19 epidemic by looking at one of the many mechanisms
which can cause reticence towards vaccines: the capacity of vaccine-critical activists to influence
a wider public on social media. We analyze the evolution of debates over the COVID-19 vaccine on the
French Twittosphere, during two first years of the pandemic, with a particular attention to the
spreading capacity of vaccine-critical websites. We address two main questions: 1) Did vaccine-critical
contents gain ground during this period? 2) Who were the central actors in the diffusion of these
contents? While debates over vaccines experienced a tremendous surge during this period, the share
of vaccine-critical contents in these debates remains stable except for a limited number of short
periods associated with specific events. Secondly, analyzing the community structure of the re-tweets
hyper-graph, we reconstruct the mesoscale structure of the information flows, identifying and
characterizing the major communities of users. We analyze their role in the information ecosystem:
the largest right-wing community has a typical echo-chamber behavior collecting all the vaccine-critical
tweets from outside and recirculating it inside the community. The smaller left-wing community
is less permeable to vaccine-critical contents but, has a large capacity to spread it once adopted.

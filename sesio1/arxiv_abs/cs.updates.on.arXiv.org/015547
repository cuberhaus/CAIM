The popularity of Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), a risk functional from finance, has been growing
in the control systems community due to its intuitive interpretation and axiomatic foundation.
We consider a non-standard optimal control problem in which the goal is to minimize the CVaR of a maximum
random cost subject to a Borel-space Markov decision process. The objective takes the form $\text{CVaR}_{\alpha}(\max_{t=0,1,\dots,N}
C_t)$, where $\alpha$ is a risk-aversion parameter representing a fraction of worst cases, $C_t$
is a stage or terminal cost, and $N \in \mathbb{N}$ is the length of a finite discrete-time horizon.
The objective represents the maximum departure from a desired operating region averaged over a
given fraction $\alpha$ of worst cases. This problem provides a safety criterion for a stochastic
system that is informed by both the probability and severity of the potential consequences of the
system's trajectory. In contrast, existing safety analysis frameworks apply stage-wise risk
constraints (i.e., $\rho(C_t)$ must be small for all $t$, where $\rho$ is a risk functional) or assess
the probability of constraint violation without quantifying its possible severity. To the best
of our knowledge, the problem of interest has not been solved. To solve the problem, we propose and
study a family of stochastic dynamic programs on an augmented state space. We prove that the optimal
CVaR of a maximum cost enjoys an equivalent representation in terms of the solutions to this family
of dynamic programs under appropriate assumptions. We show the existence of an optimal policy that
depends on the dynamics of an augmented state under a measurable selection condition. Moreover,
we demonstrate how our safety analysis framework is useful for assessing the severity of combined
sewer overflows under precipitation uncertainty.

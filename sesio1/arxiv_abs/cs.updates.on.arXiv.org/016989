The task of instance segmentation in remote sensing images, aiming at performing per-pixel labeling
of objects at instance level, is of great importance for various civil applications. Despite previous
successes, most existing instance segmentation methods designed for natural images encounter
sharp performance degradations when they are directly applied to top-view remote sensing images.
Through careful analysis, we observe that the challenges mainly come from the lack of discriminative
object features due to severe scale variations, low contrasts, and clustered distributions. In
order to address these problems, a novel context aggregation network (CATNet) is proposed to improve
the feature extraction process. The proposed model exploits three lightweight plug-and-play
modules, namely dense feature pyramid network (DenseFPN), spatial context pyramid (SCP), and
hierarchical region of interest extractor (HRoIE), to aggregate global visual context at feature,
spatial, and instance domains, respectively. DenseFPN is a multi-scale feature propagation module
that establishes more flexible information flows by adopting inter-level residual connections,
cross-level dense connections, and feature re-weighting strategy. Leveraging the attention
mechanism, SCP further augments the features by aggregating global spatial context into local
regions. For each instance, HRoIE adaptively generates RoI features for different downstream
tasks. We carry out extensive evaluations of the proposed scheme on the challenging iSAID, DIOR,
NWPU VHR-10, and HRSID datasets. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed approach
outperforms state-of-the-arts under similar computational costs. Source code and pre-trained
models are available at https://github.com/yeliudev/CATNet.

Object identification is one of the most fundamental and difficult issues in computer vision. It
aims to discover object instances in real pictures from a huge number of established categories.
In recent years, deep learning-based object detection techniques that developed from computer
vision have grabbed the public's interest. Object recognition methods based on deep learning frameworks
have quickly become a popular way to interpret moving images acquired by various sensors. Due to
its vast variety of applications for various computer vision tasks such as activity or event detection,
content-based image retrieval, and scene understanding, academics have spent decades attempting
to solve this problem. With this goal in mind, a unique deep learning classification technique is
used to create an autonomous object detecting system. The noise destruction and normalising operations,
which are carried out using gaussian filter and contrast normalisation techniques, respectively,
are the first steps in the study activity. The pre-processed picture is next subjected to entropy-based
segmentation algorithms, which separate the image's significant areas in order to distinguish
between distinct occurrences. The classification challenge is completed by the suggested Hybrid
Optimized Dense Convolutional Neural Network (HODCNN). The major goal of this framework is to aid
in the precise recognition of distinct items from the gathered input frames. The suggested system's
performance is assessed by comparing it to existing machine learning and deep learning methodologies.
The experimental findings reveal that the suggested framework has a detection accuracy of 0.9864,
which is greater than current techniques. As a result, the suggested object detection model outperforms
other current methods.

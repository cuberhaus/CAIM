Our modern society and competitive economy depend on a strong digital foundation and, in turn, on
sustained research and innovation in computer systems and networks (CompSys). With this manifesto,
we draw attention to CompSys as a vital part of ICT. Among ICT technologies, CompSys covers all the
hardware and all the operational software layers that enable applications; only application-specific
details, and often only application-specific algorithms, are not part of CompSys. Each of the Top
Sectors of the Dutch Economy, each route in the National Research Agenda, and each of the UN Sustainable
Development Goals pose challenges that cannot be addressed without groundbreaking CompSys advances.
Looking at the 2030-2035 horizon, important new applications will emerge only when enabled by CompSys
developments. Triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, millions moved abruptly online, raising infrastructure
scalability and data sovereignty issues; but governments processing social data and responsible
social networks still require a paradigm shift in data sovereignty and sharing. AI already requires
massive computer systems which can cost millions per training task, but the current technology
leaves an unsustainable energy footprint including large carbon emissions. Computational sciences
such as bioinformatics, and "Humanities for all" and "citizen data science", cannot become affordable
and efficient until computer systems take a generational leap. Similarly, the emerging quantum
internet depends on (traditional) CompSys to bootstrap operation for the foreseeable future.
Large commercial sectors, including finance and manufacturing, require specialized computing
and networking or risk becoming uncompetitive. And, at the core of Dutch innovation, promising
technology hubs, deltas, ports, and smart cities, could see their promise stagger due to critical
dependency on non-European technology.

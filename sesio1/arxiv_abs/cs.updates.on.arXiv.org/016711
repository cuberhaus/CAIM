Objective Ubiquitous internet access is reshaping the way we live, but it is accompanied by unprecedented
challenges in preventing chronic diseases that are usually planted by long exposure to unhealthy
lifestyles. This paper proposes leveraging online shopping behaviors as a proxy for personal lifestyle
choices to improve chronic disease prevention literacy, targeted for times when e-commerce user
experience has been assimilated into most people's everyday lives. Methods: Longitudinal query
logs and purchase records from 15 million online shoppers were accessed, constructing a broad spectrum
of lifestyle features covering various product categories and buyer personas. Using the lifestyle-related
information preceding online shoppers' first purchases of specific prescription drugs, we could
determine associations between their past lifestyle choices and whether they suffered from a particular
chronic disease. Results: Novel lifestyle risk factors were discovered in two exemplars--depression
and type 2 diabetes, most of which showed reasonable consistency with existing healthcare knowledge.
Further, such empirical findings could be adopted to locate online shoppers at higher risk of these
chronic diseases with decent accuracy [i.e., (area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve) AUC=0.68 for depression and AUC=0.70 for type 2 diabetes], closely matching the performance
of screening surveys benchmarked against medical diagnosis. Conclusions: Mining online shopping
behaviors can point medical experts to a series of lifestyle issues associated with chronic diseases
that are less explored to date. Hopefully, unobtrusive chronic disease surveillance via e-commerce
sites can grant consenting individuals a privilege to be connected more readily with the medical
profession and sophistication.

Digital maps are commonly used across the globe for exploring places that users are interested in,
commonly referred to as points of interest (PoI). In online food delivery platforms, PoIs could
represent any major private compounds where customers could order from such as hospitals, residential
complexes, office complexes, educational institutes and hostels. In this work, we propose an end-to-end
unsupervised system design for obtaining polygon representations of PoIs (PoI polygons) from
address locations and address texts. We preprocess the address texts using locality names and generate
embeddings for the address texts using a deep learning-based architecture, viz. RoBERTa, trained
on our internal address dataset. The PoI candidates are identified by jointly clustering the anonymised
customer phone GPS locations (obtained during address onboarding) and the embeddings of the address
texts. The final list of PoI polygons is obtained from these PoI candidates using novel post-processing
steps. This algorithm identified 74.8 % more PoIs than those obtained using the Mummidi-Krumm baseline
algorithm run on our internal dataset. The proposed algorithm achieves a median area precision
of 98 %, a median area recall of 8 %, and a median F-score of 0.15. In order to improve the recall of the
algorithmic polygons, we post-process them using building footprint polygons from the OpenStreetMap
(OSM) database. The post-processing algorithm involves reshaping the algorithmic polygon using
intersecting polygons and closed private roads from the OSM database, and accounting for intersection
with public roads on the OSM database. We achieve a median area recall of 70 %, a median area precision
of 69 %, and a median F-score of 0.69 on these post-processed polygons.

Citizen science datasets can be very large and promise to improve species distribution modelling,
but detection is imperfect, risking bias when fitting models. In particular, observers may not
detect species that are actually present. Occupancy models can estimate and correct for this observation
process, and multi-species occupancy models exploit similarities in the observation process,
which can improve estimates for rare species. However, the computational methods currently used
to fit these models do not scale to large datasets. We develop approximate Bayesian inference methods
and use graphics processing units (GPUs) to scale multi-species occupancy models to very large
citizen science data. We fit multi-species occupancy models to one month of data from the eBird project
consisting of 186,811 checklist records comprising 430 bird species. We evaluate the predictions
on a spatially separated test set of 59,338 records, comparing two different inference methods
-- Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and variational inference (VI) -- to occupancy models fitted
to each species separately using maximum likelihood. We fitted models to the entire dataset using
VI, and up to 32,000 records with MCMC. VI fitted to the entire dataset performed best, outperforming
single-species models on both AUC (90.4% compared to 88.7%) and on log likelihood (-0.080 compared
to -0.085). We also evaluate how well range maps predicted by the model agree with expert maps. We
find that modelling the detection process greatly improves agreement and that the resulting maps
agree as closely with expert maps as ones estimated using high quality survey data. Our results demonstrate
that multi-species occupancy models are a compelling approach to model large citizen science datasets,
and that, once the observation process is taken into account, they can model species distributions
accurately.

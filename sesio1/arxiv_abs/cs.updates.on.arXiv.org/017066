In classical planning, the goal is to derive a course of actions that allows an intelligent agent
to move from any situation it finds itself in to one that satisfies its goals. Classical planning
is considered domain-independent, i.e., it is not limited to a particular application and can be
used to solve different types of reasoning problems. In practice, however, some properties of a
planning problem at hand require an expressive extension of the standard classical planning formalism
to capture and model them. Although the importance of many of these extensions is well known, most
planners, especially optimal planners, do not support these extended planning formalisms. The
lack of support not only limits the use of these planners for certain problems, but even if it is possible
to model the problems without these extensions, it often leads to increased effort in modeling or
makes modeling practically impossible as the required problem encoding size increases exponentially.
In this thesis, we propose to use symbolic search for cost-optimal planning for different expressive
extensions of classical planning, all capturing different aspects of the problem. In particular,
we study planning with axioms, planning with state-dependent action costs, oversubscription
planning, and top-k planning. For all formalisms, we present complexity and compilability results,
highlighting that it is desirable and even necessary to natively support the corresponding features.
We analyze symbolic heuristic search and show that the search performance does not always benefit
from the use of a heuristic and that the search performance can exponentially deteriorate even under
the best possible circumstances, namely the perfect heuristic. This reinforces that symbolic
blind search is the dominant symbolic search strategy nowadays, on par with other state-of-the-art
cost-optimal planning strategies...

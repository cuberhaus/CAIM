Each year, underwater remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) collect thousands of hours of video of
unexplored ocean habitats revealing a plethora of information regarding biodiversity on Earth.
However, fully utilizing this information remains a challenge as proper annotations and analysis
require trained scientists time, which is both limited and costly. To this end, we present a Dataset
for Underwater Substrate and Invertebrate Analysis (DUSIA), a benchmark suite and growing large-scale
dataset to train, validate, and test methods for temporally localizing four underwater substrates
as well as temporally and spatially localizing 59 underwater invertebrate species. DUSIA currently
includes over ten hours of footage across 25 videos captured in 1080p at 30 fps by an ROV following
pre planned transects across the ocean floor near the Channel Islands of California. Each video
includes annotations indicating the start and end times of substrates across the video in addition
to counts of species of interest. Some frames are annotated with precise bounding box locations
for invertebrate species of interest, as seen in Figure 1. To our knowledge, DUSIA is the first dataset
of its kind for deep sea exploration, with video from a moving camera, that includes substrate annotations
and invertebrate species that are present at significant depths where sunlight does not penetrate.
Additionally, we present the novel context-driven object detector (CDD) where we use explicit
substrate classification to influence an object detection network to simultaneously predict
a substrate and species class influenced by that substrate. We also present a method for improving
training on partially annotated bounding box frames. Finally, we offer a baseline method for automating
the counting of invertebrate species of interest.

Deep learning self-supervised algorithms that can segment an image in a fixed number of hard labels
such as the k-means algorithm and relying only on deep learning techniques are still lacking. Here,
we introduce the k-textures algorithm which provides self-supervised segmentation of a 4-band
image (RGB-NIR) for a $k$ number of classes. An example of its application on high resolution Planet
satellite imagery is given. Our algorithm shows that discrete search is feasible using convolutional
neural networks (CNN) and gradient descent. The model detects $k$ hard clustering classes represented
in the model as $k$ discrete binary masks and their associated $k$ independently generated textures,
that combined are a simulation of the original image. The similarity loss is the mean squared error
between the features of the original and the simulated image, both extracted from the penultimate
convolutional block of Keras 'imagenet' pretrained VGG-16 model and a custom feature extractor
made with Planet data. The main advances of the k-textures model are: first, the $k$ discrete binary
masks are obtained inside the model using gradient descent. The model allows for the generation
of discrete binary masks using a novel method using a hard sigmoid activation function. Second,
it provides hard clustering classes -- each pixels has only one class. Finally, in comparison to
k-means, where each pixel is considered independently, here, contextual information is also considered
and each class is not associated only to similar values in the color channels but also to a texture.
Our approach is designed to ease the production of training samples for satellite image segmentation
and the k-textures architecture could be adapted to support different number of bands and for more
complex tasks, such as object self-segmentation. The model codes and weights are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6359859

Estimation of riverbed profiles, also known as bathymetry, plays a vital role in many applications,
such as safe and efficient inland navigation, prediction of bank erosion, land subsidence, and
flood risk management. The high cost and complex logistics of direct bathymetry surveys, i.e.,
depth imaging, have encouraged the use of indirect measurements such as surface flow velocities.
However, estimating high-resolution bathymetry from indirect measurements is an inverse problem
that can be computationally challenging. Here, we propose a reduced-order model (ROM) based approach
that utilizes a variational autoencoder (VAE), a type of deep neural network with a narrow layer
in the middle, to compress bathymetry and flow velocity information and accelerate bathymetry
inverse problems from flow velocity measurements. In our application, the shallow-water equations
(SWE) with appropriate boundary conditions (BCs), e.g., the discharge and/or the free surface
elevation, constitute the forward problem, to predict flow velocity. Then, ROMs of the SWEs are
constructed on a nonlinear manifold of low dimensionality through a variational encoder. Estimation
with uncertainty quantification (UQ) is performed on the low-dimensional latent space in a Bayesian
setting. We have tested our inversion approach on a one-mile reach of the Savannah River, GA, USA.
Once the neural network is trained (offline stage), the proposed technique can perform the inversion
operation orders of magnitude faster than traditional inversion methods that are commonly based
on linear projections, such as principal component analysis (PCA), or the principal component
geostatistical approach (PCGA). Furthermore, tests show that the algorithm can estimate the bathymetry
with good accuracy even with sparse flow velocity measurements.

Perovskite photovoltaics (PV) have achieved rapid development in the past decade in terms of power
conversion efficiency of small-area lab-scale devices; however, successful commercialization
still requires further development of low-cost, scalable, and high-throughput manufacturing
techniques. One of the critical challenges of developing a new fabrication technique is the high-dimensional
parameter space for optimization, but machine learning (ML) can readily be used to accelerate perovskite
PV scaling. Herein, we present an ML-guided framework of sequential learning for manufacturing
process optimization. We apply our methodology to the Rapid Spray Plasma Processing (RSPP) technique
for perovskite thin films in ambient conditions. With a limited experimental budget of screening
100 process conditions, we demonstrated an efficiency improvement to 18.5% as the best-in-our-lab
device fabricated by RSPP, and we also experimentally found 10 unique process conditions to produce
the top-performing devices of more than 17% efficiency, which is 5 times higher rate of success than
the control experiments with pseudo-random Latin hypercube sampling. Our model is enabled by three
innovations: (a) flexible knowledge transfer between experimental processes by incorporating
data from prior experimental data as a probabilistic constraint; (b) incorporation of both subjective
human observations and ML insights when selecting next experiments; (c) adaptive strategy of locating
the region of interest using Bayesian optimization first, and then conducting local exploration
for high-efficiency devices. Furthermore, in virtual benchmarking, our framework achieves faster
improvements with limited experimental budgets than traditional design-of-experiments methods
(e.g., one-variable-at-a-time sampling).

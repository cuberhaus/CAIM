This paper considers a novel multi-agent linear stochastic approximation algorithm driven by
Markovian noise and general consensus-type interaction, in which each agent evolves according
to its local stochastic approximation process which depends on the information from its neighbors.
The interconnection structure among the agents is described by a time-varying directed graph.
While the convergence of consensus-based stochastic approximation algorithms when the interconnection
among the agents is described by doubly stochastic matrices (at least in expectation) has been studied,
less is known about the case when the interconnection matrix is simply stochastic. For any uniformly
strongly connected graph sequences whose associated interaction matrices are stochastic, the
paper derives finite-time bounds on the mean-square error, defined as the deviation of the output
of the algorithm from the unique equilibrium point of the associated ordinary differential equation.
For the case of interconnection matrices being stochastic, the equilibrium point can be any unspecified
convex combination of the local equilibria of all the agents in the absence of communication. Both
the cases with constant and time-varying step-sizes are considered. In the case when the convex
combination is required to be a straight average and interaction between any pair of neighboring
agents may be uni-directional, so that doubly stochastic matrices cannot be implemented in a distributed
manner, the paper proposes a push-sum-type distributed stochastic approximation algorithm and
provides its finite-time bound for the time-varying step-size case by leveraging the analysis
for the consensus-type algorithm with stochastic matrices and developing novel properties of
the push-sum algorithm.

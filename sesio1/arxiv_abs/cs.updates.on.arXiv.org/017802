Accurate and reliable building footprint maps are vital to urban planning and monitoring, and most
existing approaches fall back on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for building footprint
generation. However, one limitation of these methods is that they require strong supervisory information
from massive annotated samples for network learning. State-of-the-art semi-supervised semantic
segmentation networks with consistency training can help to deal with this issue by leveraging
a large amount of unlabeled data, which encourages the consistency of model output on data perturbation.
Considering that rich information is also encoded in feature maps, we propose to integrate the consistency
of both features and outputs in the end-to-end network training of unlabeled samples, enabling
to impose additional constraints. Prior semi-supervised semantic segmentation networks have
established the cluster assumption, in which the decision boundary should lie in the vicinity of
low sample density. In this work, we observe that for building footprint generation, the low-density
regions are more apparent at the intermediate feature representations within the encoder than
the encoder's input or output. Therefore, we propose an instruction to assign the perturbation
to the intermediate feature representations within the encoder, which considers the spatial resolution
of input remote sensing imagery and the mean size of individual buildings in the study area. The proposed
method is evaluated on three datasets with different resolutions: Planet dataset (3 m/pixel),
Massachusetts dataset (1 m/pixel), and Inria dataset (0.3 m/pixel). Experimental results show
that the proposed approach can well extract more complete building structures and alleviate omission
errors.

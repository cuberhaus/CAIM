Mining the latent intentions from large volumes of natural language inputs is a key step to help data
analysts design and refine Intelligent Virtual Assistants (IVAs) for customer service. To aid
data analysts in this task we present Verint Intent Manager (VIM), an analysis platform that combines
unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches to help analysts quickly surface and organize relevant
user intentions from conversational texts. For the initial exploration of data we make use of a novel
unsupervised and semi-supervised pipeline that integrates the fine-tuning of high performing
language models, a distributed k-NN graph building method and community detection techniques
for mining the intentions and topics from texts. The fine-tuning step is necessary because pre-trained
language models cannot encode texts to efficiently surface particular clustering structures
when the target texts are from an unseen domain or the clustering task is not topic detection. For
flexibility we deploy two clustering approaches: where the number of clusters must be specified
and where the number of clusters is detected automatically with comparable clustering quality
but at the expense of additional computation time. We describe the application and deployment and
demonstrate its performance using BERT on three text mining tasks. Our experiments show that BERT
begins to produce better task-aware representations using a labeled subset as small as 0.5% of the
task data. The clustering quality exceeds the state-of-the-art results when BERT is fine-tuned
with labeled subsets of only 2.5% of the task data. As deployed in the VIM application, this flexible
clustering pipeline produces high quality results, improving the performance of data analysts
and reducing the time it takes to surface intentions from customer service data, thereby reducing
the time it takes to build and deploy IVAs in new domains.

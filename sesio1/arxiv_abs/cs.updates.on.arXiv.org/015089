Whenever a person hears about pollution, more often than not, the first thought that comes to their
mind is air pollution. One of the most under-mentioned and under-discussed pollution globally
is that caused by the non-biodegradable waste in our water bodies. In the case of India, there is a
lot of plastic waste on the surface of rivers and lakes. The Ganga river is one of the 10 rivers which
account for 90 percent of the plastic that ends up in the sea and there are major cases of local nalaas
and lakes being contaminated due to this waste. This limits the source of clean water which leads
to major depletion in water sources. From 2001 to 2012, in the city of Hyderabad, 3245 hectares of
lakes dissipated. The water recedes by nine feet a year on average in southern New Delhi. Thus, cleaning
of these local water bodies and rivers is of utmost importance. Our aim is to develop a water surface
cleaning bot that is deployed across the shore. The bot will detect garbage patches on its way and
collect the garbage thus making the water bodies clean. This solution employs a surveillance mechanism
in order to alert the authorities in case anyone is found polluting the water bodies. A more sustainable
system by using solar energy to power the system has been developed. Computer vision algorithms
are used for detecting trash on the surface of the water. This trash is collected by the bot and is disposed
of at a designated location. In addition to cleaning the water bodies, preventive measures have
been also implemented with the help of a virtual fencing algorithm that alerts the authorities if
anyone tries to pollute the water premises. A web application and a mobile app is deployed to keep
a check on the movement of the bot and shore surveillance respectively. This complete solution involves
both preventive and curative measures that are required for water care.

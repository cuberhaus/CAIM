With the popularity of Internet of Things (IoT), edge computing and cloud computing, more and more
stream analytics applications are being developed including real-time trend prediction and object
detection on top of IoT sensing data. One popular type of stream analytics is the recurrent neural
network (RNN) deep learning model based time series or sequence data prediction and forecasting.
Different from traditional analytics that assumes data to be processed are available ahead of time
and will not change, stream analytics deals with data that are being generated continuously and
data trend/distribution could change (aka concept drift), which will cause prediction/forecasting
accuracy to drop over time. One other challenge is to find the best resource provisioning for stream
analytics to achieve good overall latency. In this paper, we study how to best leverage edge and cloud
resources to achieve better accuracy and latency for RNN-based stream analytics. We propose a novel
edge-cloud integrated framework for hybrid stream analytics that support low latency inference
on the edge and high capacity training on the cloud. We study the flexible deployment of our hybrid
learning framework, namely edge-centric, cloud-centric and edge-cloud integrated. Further,
our hybrid learning framework can dynamically combine inference results from an RNN model pre-trained
based on historical data and another RNN model re-trained periodically based on the most recent
data. Using real-world and simulated stream datasets, our experiments show the proposed edge-cloud
deployment is the best among all three deployment types in terms of latency. For accuracy, the experiments
show our dynamic learning approach performs the best among all learning approaches for all three
concept drift scenarios.

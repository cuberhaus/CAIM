Deep learning has been shown to accurately assess 'hidden' phenotypes and predict biomarkers from
medical imaging beyond traditional clinician interpretation of medical imaging. Given the black
box nature of artificial intelligence (AI) models, caution should be exercised in applying models
to healthcare as prediction tasks might be short-cut by differences in demographics across disease
and patient populations. Using large echocardiography datasets from two healthcare systems,
we test whether it is possible to predict age, race, and sex from cardiac ultrasound images using
deep learning algorithms and assess the impact of varying confounding variables. We trained video-based
convolutional neural networks to predict age, sex, and race. We found that deep learning models
were able to identify age and sex, while unable to reliably predict race. Without considering confounding
differences between categories, the AI model predicted sex with an AUC of 0.85 (95% CI 0.84 - 0.86),
age with a mean absolute error of 9.12 years (95% CI 9.00 - 9.25), and race with AUCs ranging from 0.63
- 0.71. When predicting race, we show that tuning the proportion of a confounding variable (sex)
in the training data significantly impacts model AUC (ranging from 0.57 to 0.84), while in training
a sex prediction model, tuning a confounder (race) did not substantially change AUC (0.81 - 0.83).
This suggests a significant proportion of the model's performance on predicting race could come
from confounding features being detected by AI. Further work remains to identify the particular
imaging features that associate with demographic information and to better understand the risks
of demographic identification in medical AI as it pertains to potentially perpetuating bias and
disparities.

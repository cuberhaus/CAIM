Longitudinal interaction studies with Socially Assistive Robots are crucial to ensure that the
robot is relevant for long-term use and its perceptions are not prone to the novelty effect. In this
paper, we present a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) to capture the longitudinal interactions participants
had with a teleoperated robot coach (RC) delivering mindfulness sessions. The DBN model is used
to study complex, temporal interactions between the participants self-reported personality
traits, weekly baseline wellbeing scores, session ratings, and facial AUs elicited during the
sessions in a 5-week longitudinal study. DBN modelling involves learning a graphical representation
that facilitates intuitive understanding of how multiple components contribute to the longitudinal
changes in session ratings corresponding to the perceptions of the RC, and participants relaxation
and calm levels. The learnt model captures the following within and between sessions aspects of
the longitudinal interaction study: influence of the 5 personality dimensions on the facial AU
states and the session ratings, influence of facial AU states on the session ratings, and the influences
within the items of the session ratings. The DBN structure is learnt using first 3 time points and
the obtained model is used to predict the session ratings of the last 2 time points of the 5-week longitudinal
data. The predictions are quantified using subject-wise RMSE and R2 scores. We also demonstrate
two applications of the model, namely, imputation of missing values in the dataset and estimation
of longitudinal session ratings of a new participant with a given personality profile. The obtained
DBN model thus facilitates learning of conditional dependency structure between variables in
the longitudinal data and offers inferences and conceptual understanding which are not possible
through other regression methodologies.

Cities across the world vary in terms of their urban forms, transportation networks, and travel
demand patterns with the variation affecting the viability of different shared mobility modes
ranging from mass transit to ridesharing. This study proposes a modeling framework to quantify
the shareability of person flows in any city as a function of two inputs--the underlying transportation
(street) network and origin-destination (OD) travel demand in the network--as a first step toward
a deeper understanding of the joint influence of these factors on the viability of shared mobility
modes. This study conceptualizes flow overlap to denote, for a person trip traversing a given path,
the weighted (by link distance) average number of other travelers sharing the links along the person's
path. The study extends this concept and formulates the Maximum Network Flow Overlap Problem (MNFLOP)
to assign all O-D person flows to the network paths that maximize flow overlap in the region. The study
also proposes an MNFLOP variant with a second objective function term, OD flow detours, to capture
the trade-off between minimizing travel distance/time and increasing shareability. The study
utilizes the MNFLOP output to calculate measures of shareability at various levels of aggregation,
including, single location, single and multiple ODs, individual links, and network level. The
study applies the MNFLOP to networks in Sioux Falls and Chicago. Results show that with minor increases
in traveler detour, it is possible to significantly increase flow overlap relative to assigning
all OD flows to their shortest paths. Origin level measures of flow overlap indicate potential to
share trips even from locations with low demand, as long as the trips can be concentrated onto a few
paths, showing that critical demand assessment for operating shared mobility modes is guided by
both magnitude and directionality of demand.

In this paper we consider a class of structured monotone inclusion (MI) problems that consist of
finding a zero in the sum of two monotone operators, in which one is maximal monotone while another
is locally Lipschitz continuous. In particular, we first propose a primal-dual extrapolation
(PDE) method for solving a structured strongly MI problem by modifying the classical forward-backward
splitting method by using a point and operator extrapolation technique, in which the parameters
are adaptively updated by a backtracking line search scheme. The proposed PDE method is almost parameter-free,
equipped with a verifiable termination criterion, and enjoys an operation complexity of ${\cal
O}(\log \epsilon^{-1})$, measured by the amount of fundamental operations consisting only of
evaluations of one operator and resolvent of another operator, for finding an $\epsilon$-residual
solution of the structured strongly MI problem. We then propose another PDE method for solving a
structured non-strongly MI problem by applying the above PDE method to approximately solve a sequence
of structured strongly MI problems. The resulting PDE method is parameter-free, equipped with
a verifiable termination criterion, and enjoys an operation complexity of ${\cal O}(\epsilon^{-1}\log
\epsilon^{-1})$ for finding an $\epsilon$-residual solution of the structured non-strongly
MI problem. As a consequence, we apply the latter PDE method to convex conic optimization, conic
constrained saddle point, and variational inequality problems, and obtain complexity results
for finding an $\epsilon$-KKT or $\epsilon$-residual solution of them under local Lipschitz continuity.
To the best of our knowledge, no prior studies were conducted to investigate methods with complexity
guarantees for solving the aforementioned problems under local Lipschitz continuity. All the
complexity results obtained in this paper are entirely new.

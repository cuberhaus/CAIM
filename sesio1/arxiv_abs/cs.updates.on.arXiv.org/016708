Many fundamental problems affecting the care of critically ill patients lead to similar analytical
challenges: physicians cannot easily estimate the effects of at-risk medical conditions or treatments
because the causal effects of medical conditions and drugs are entangled. They also cannot easily
perform studies: there are not enough high-quality data for high-dimensional observational causal
inference, and RCTs often cannot ethically be conducted. However, mechanistic knowledge is available,
including how drugs are absorbed into the body, and the combination of this knowledge with the limited
data could potentially suffice -- if we knew how to combine them. In this work, we present a framework
for interpretable estimation of causal effects for critically ill patients under exactly these
complex conditions: interactions between drugs and observations over time, patient data sets
that are not large, and mechanistic knowledge that can substitute for lack of data. We apply this
framework to an extremely important problem affecting critically ill patients, namely the effect
of seizures and other potentially harmful electrical events in the brain (called epileptiform
activity -- EA) on outcomes. Given the high stakes involved and the high noise in the data, interpretability
is critical for troubleshooting such complex problems. Interpretability of our matched groups
allowed neurologists to perform chart reviews to verify the quality of our causal analysis. For
instance, our work indicates that a patient who experiences a high level of seizure-like activity
(75% high EA burden) and is untreated for a six-hour window, has, on average, a 16.7% increased chance
of adverse outcomes such as severe brain damage, lifetime disability, or death. We find that patients
with mild but long-lasting EA (average EA burden >= 50%) have their risk of an adverse outcome increased
by 11.2%.

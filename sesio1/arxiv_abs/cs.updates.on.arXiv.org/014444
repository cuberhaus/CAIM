Mobile connectivity has become more important, especially for visitors to parks and protected
areas. However, governments' policies prohibit cable wiring in these areas in order to preserve
the beauty and protect the historical interest of the landscape. Through observed practices from
other countries, mobile network operators and other licensed service providers can cooperate
with the administrators of such protected areas in order to provide mobile connectivity without
disturbing the environment. However, the most pervasive problem is the high energy consumption
of the wireless systems and it becomes expensive to power them using the electricity grid. One attractive
solution is to make use of green energy to power the communication systems and then share the base
station (BS) infrastructure that is co-located with the edge server, an entity responsible for
computing the offloaded delay-sensitive workloads. To alleviate this problem, this paper offers
a resource management solution that seeks to minimize the energy consumption per communication
site through (i) BS infrastructure and resource sharing, and (ii) assisted (peer-to-peer) computation
offloading for the energy-constrained communication sites, within a protected area. Using this
resource management strategy guarantees a Quality of Service (QoS). The performance evaluation
conducted through simulations validates our analysis as the prediction variations observed shows
greater accuracy between the harvested energy and the traffic load. Towards energy savings, the
proposed algorithm achieves a 52 % energy savings when compared with the 46 % obtained by our benchmark
algorithm. The energy savings that can be achieved decreases as the QoS is prioritized, within each
communication site, and when the number of active computing resources increases.

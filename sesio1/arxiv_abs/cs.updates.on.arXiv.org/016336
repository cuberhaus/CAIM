We consider fixpoint algorithms for two-player games on graphs with $\omega$-regular winning
conditions, where the environment is constrained by a strong transition fairness assumption.
Strong transition fairness is a widely occurring special case of strong fairness, which requires
that any execution is strongly fair with respect to a specified set of live edges: whenever the source
vertex of a live edge is visited infinitely often along a play, the edge itself is traversed infinitely
often along the play as well. We show that, surprisingly, strong transition fairness retains the
algorithmic characteristics of the fixpoint algorithms for $\omega$-regular games -- the new
algorithms can be obtained simply by replacing certain occurrences of the controllable predecessor
by a new almost sure predecessor operator. For Rabin games with $k$ pairs, the complexity of the new
algorithm is $O(n^{k+2}k!)$ symbolic steps, which is independent of the number of live edges in
the strong transition fairness assumption. Further, we show that GR(1) specifications with strong
transition fairness assumptions can be solved with a 3-nested fixpoint algorithm, same as the usual
algorithm. In contrast, strong fairness necessarily requires increasing the alternation depth
depending on the number of fairness assumptions. We get symbolic algorithms for (generalized)
Rabin, parity and GR(1) objectives under strong transition fairness assumptions as well as a direct
symbolic algorithm for qualitative winning in stochastic $\omega$-regular games that runs in
$O(n^{k+2}k!)$ symbolic steps, improving the state of the art. Finally, we have implemented a BDD-based
synthesis engine based on our algorithm. We show on a set of synthetic and real benchmarks that our
algorithm is scalable, parallelizable, and outperforms previous algorithms by orders of magnitude.

Purpose: (1) To develop a deep learning algorithm to identify major tissue structures of the optic
nerve head (ONH) in 3D optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans; (2) to exploit such information
to robustly differentiate among healthy, optic disc drusen (ODD), and papilledema ONHs. It was
a cross-sectional comparative study with confirmed ODD (105 eyes), papilledema due to high intracranial
pressure (51 eyes), and healthy controls (100 eyes). 3D scans of the ONHs were acquired using OCT,
then processed to improve deep-tissue visibility. At first, a deep learning algorithm was developed
using 984 B-scans (from 130 eyes) in order to identify: major neural/connective tissues, and ODD
regions. The performance of our algorithm was assessed using the Dice coefficient (DC). In a 2nd
step, a classification algorithm (random forest) was designed using 150 OCT volumes to perform
3-class classifications (1: ODD, 2: papilledema, 3: healthy) strictly from their drusen and prelamina
swelling scores (derived from the segmentations). To assess performance, we reported the area
under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) for each class. Our segmentation algorithm
was able to isolate neural and connective tissues, and ODD regions whenever present. This was confirmed
by an average DC of 0.93$\pm$0.03 on the test set, corresponding to good performance. Classification
was achieved with high AUCs, i.e. 0.99$\pm$0.01 for the detection of ODD, 0.99 $\pm$ 0.01 for the
detection of papilledema, and 0.98$\pm$0.02 for the detection of healthy ONHs. Our AI approach
accurately discriminated ODD from papilledema, using a single OCT scan. Our classification performance
was excellent, with the caveat that validation in a much larger population is warranted. Our approach
may have the potential to establish OCT as the mainstay of diagnostic imaging in neuro-ophthalmology.

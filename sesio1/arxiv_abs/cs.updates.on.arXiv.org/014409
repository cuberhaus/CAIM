Purpose: This work aims at developing a generalizable MRI reconstruction model in the meta-learning
framework. The standard benchmarks in meta-learning are challenged by learning on diverse task
distributions. The proposed network learns the regularization function in a variational model
and reconstructs MR images with various under-sampling ratios or patterns that may or may not be
seen in the training data by leveraging a heterogeneous dataset. Methods: We propose an unrolling
network induced by learnable optimization algorithms (LOA) for solving our nonconvex nonsmooth
variational model for MRI reconstruction. In this model, the learnable regularization function
contains a task-invariant common feature encoder and task-specific learner represented by a shallow
network. To train the network we split the training data into two parts: training and validation,
and introduce a bilevel optimization algorithm. The lower-level optimization trains task-invariant
parameters for the feature encoder with fixed parameters of the task-specific learner on the training
dataset, and the upper-level optimizes the parameters of the task-specific learner on the validation
dataset. Results: The average PSNR increases significantly compared to the network trained through
conventional supervised learning on the seen CS ratios. We test the result of quick adaption on the
unseen tasks after meta-training and in the meanwhile saving half of the training time; Conclusion:
We proposed a meta-learning framework consisting of the base network architecture, design of regularization,
and bi-level optimization-based training. The network inherits the convergence property of the
LOA and interpretation of the variational model. The generalization ability is improved by the
designated regularization and bilevel optimization-based training algorithm.

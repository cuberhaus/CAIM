Sequencing technologies are prone to errors, making error correction (EC) necessary for downstream
applications. EC tools need to be manually configured for optimal performance. We find that the
optimal parameters (e.g., k-mer size) are both tool- and dataset-dependent. Moreover, evaluating
the performance (i.e., Alignment-rate or Gain) of a given tool usually relies on a reference genome,
but quality reference genomes are not always available. We introduce Lerna for the automated configuration
of k-mer-based EC tools. Lerna first creates a language model (LM) of the uncorrected genomic reads;
then, calculates the perplexity metric to evaluate the corrected reads for different parameter
choices. Next, it finds the one that produces the highest alignment rate without using a reference
genome. The fundamental intuition of our approach is that the perplexity metric is inversely correlated
with the quality of the assembly after error correction. Results: First, we show that the best k-mer
value can vary for different datasets, even for the same EC tool. Second, we show the gains of our LM
using its component attention-based transformers. We show the model's estimation of the perplexity
metric before and after error correction. The lower the perplexity after correction, the better
the k-mer size. We also show that the alignment rate and assembly quality computed for the corrected
reads are strongly negatively correlated with the perplexity, enabling the automated selection
of k-mer values for better error correction, and hence, improved assembly quality. Additionally,
we show that our attention-based models have significant runtime improvement for the entire pipeline
-- 18X faster than previous works, due to parallelizing the attention mechanism and the use of JIT
compilation for GPU inferencing.

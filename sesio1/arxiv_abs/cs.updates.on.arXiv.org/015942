Capillaries are the smallest vessels in the body responsible for delivering oxygen and nutrients
to surrounding cells. Various life-threatening diseases are known to alter the density of healthy
capillaries and the flow velocity of erythrocytes within the capillaries. In previous studies,
capillary density and flow velocity were manually assessed by trained specialists. However, manual
analysis of a standard 20-second microvascular video requires 20 minutes on average and necessitates
extensive training. Thus, manual analysis has been reported to hinder the application of microvascular
microscopy in a clinical environment. To address this problem, this paper presents a fully automated
state-of-the-art system to quantify skin nutritive capillary density and red blood cell velocity
captured by handheld-based microscopy videos. The proposed method combines the speed of traditional
computer vision algorithms with the accuracy of convolutional neural networks to enable clinical
capillary analysis. The results show that the proposed system fully automates capillary detection
with an accuracy exceeding that of trained analysts and measures several novel microvascular parameters
that had eluded quantification thus far, namely, capillary hematocrit and intracapillary flow
velocity heterogeneity. The proposed end-to-end system, named CapillaryNet, can detect capillaries
at $\sim$0.9 seconds per frame with $\sim$93\% accuracy. The system is currently being used as a
clinical research product in a larger e-health application to analyse capillary data captured
from patients suffering from COVID-19, pancreatitis, and acute heart diseases. CapillaryNet
narrows the gap between the analysis of microcirculation images in a clinical environment and state-of-the-art
systems.

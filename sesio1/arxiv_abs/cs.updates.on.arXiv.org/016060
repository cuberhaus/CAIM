Parareal is a well-studied algorithm for numerically integrating systems of time-dependent differential
equations by parallelising the temporal domain. Given approximate initial values at each temporal
sub-interval, the algorithm locates a solution in a fixed number of iterations using a predictor-corrector,
stopping once a tolerance is met. This iterative process combines solutions located by inexpensive
(coarse resolution) and expensive (fine resolution) numerical integrators. In this paper, we
introduce a stochastic parareal algorithm aimed at accelerating the convergence of the deterministic
parareal algorithm. Instead of providing the predictor-corrector with a deterministically located
set of initial values, the stochastic algorithm samples initial values from dynamically varying
probability distributions in each temporal sub-interval. All samples are then propagated in parallel
using the expensive integrator. The set of sampled initial values yielding the most continuous
(smoothest) trajectory across consecutive sub-intervals are fed into the predictor-corrector,
converging in fewer iterations than the deterministic algorithm with a given probability. The
performance of the stochastic algorithm, implemented using various probability distributions,
is illustrated on low-dimensional systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We provide
numerical evidence that when the number of sampled initial values is large enough, stochastic parareal
converges almost certainly in fewer iterations than the deterministic algorithm, maintaining
solution accuracy. Given its stochastic nature, we also highlight that multiple simulations of
stochastic parareal return a distribution of solutions that can represent a measure of uncertainty
over the ODE solution.

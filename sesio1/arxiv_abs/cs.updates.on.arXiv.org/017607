The increasing access to non-expensive sensors, computing power, and more accurate forecasting
of storm events provides unique opportunities to shift flood management practices from static
approaches to an optimization-based real-time control (RTC) of urban drainage systems. Recent
studies have addressed a plethora of strategies for flood control in stormwater reservoirs; however,
advanced control theoretic techniques are not yet fully investigated and applied to these systems.
In addition, there is an absence of a coupled integrated control model for systems composed of watersheds,
reservoirs, and channels for flood mitigation. To this end, we develop a novel state-space model
of hydrologic and hydrodynamic processes in reservoirs and one-dimensional channels. The model
is tested under different types of reservoir control strategies based on real-time measurements
(reactive control), and based on predictions of the future behavior of the system (predictive control)
using rainfall forecastings. We apply the modeling approach in a system composed by a single watershed,
reservoir, and a channel connected in series, respectively, for the San Antonio observed rainfall
data. Results indicate that for flood mitigation, the predictive control strategy outperforms
the reactive controls not only when applied for synthetic design storm events, but also for a continuous
simulation. Moreover, the predictive control strategy requires smaller valve operations, while
still guaranteeing efficient hydrological performance. From the results, we recommend the use
of the model predictive control strategy to control stormwater systems due to the ability to handle
different objective functions, which can be altered according to rainfall forecasting and shift
the reservoir operation from flood-based control to strategies focused on increasing detention
times, depending on the forecasting.

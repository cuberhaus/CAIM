Cloud service brokerage is an emerging technology that attempts to simplify the consumption and
operation of hybrid clouds. Today's cloud brokers attempt to insulate consumers from the vagaries
of multiple clouds. To achieve the insulation, the modern cloud broker needs to disguise itself
as the end-provider to consumers by creating and operating a virtual data center construct that
we call a meta-cloud, which is assembled on top of a set of participating supplier clouds. It is crucial
for such a cloud broker to be considered a trusted partner both by cloud consumers and by the underpinning
cloud suppliers. A fundamental tenet of brokerage trust is vendor neutrality. On the one hand, cloud
consumers will be comfortable if a cloud broker guarantees that they will not be led through a preferred
path. And on the other hand, cloud suppliers would be more interested in partnering with a cloud broker
who promises a fair apportioning of client provisioning requests. Because consumer and supplier
trust on a meta-cloud broker stems from the assumption of being agnostic to supplier clouds, there
is a need for a test strategy that verifies the fairness of cloud brokerage. In this paper, we propose
a calculus of fairness that defines the rules to determine the operational behavior of a cloud broker.
The calculus uses temporal logic to model the fact that fairness is a trait that has to be ascertained
over time; it is not a characteristic that can be judged at a per-request fulfillment level. Using
our temporal calculus of fairness as the basis, we propose an algorithm to determine the fairness
of a broker probabilistically, based on its observed request apportioning policies. Our model
for the fairness of cloud broker behavior also factors in inter-provider variables such as cost
divergence and capacity variance.

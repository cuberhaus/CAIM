Industry 4.0 is an era of smart manufacturing. Manufacturing is impossible without the use of machinery.
Majority of these machines comprise rotating components and are called rotating machines. The
engineers' top priority is to maintain these critical machines to reduce the unplanned shutdown
and increase the useful life of machinery. Predictive maintenance (PDM) is the current trend of
smart maintenance. The challenging task in PDM is to diagnose the type of fault. With Artificial
Intelligence (AI) advancement, data-driven approach for predictive maintenance is taking a new
flight towards smart manufacturing. Several researchers have published work related to fault
diagnosis in rotating machines, mainly exploring a single type of fault. However, a consolidated
review of literature that focuses more on multi-fault diagnosis of rotating machines is lacking.
There is a need to systematically cover all the aspects right from sensor selection, data acquisition,
feature extraction, multi-sensor data fusion to the systematic review of AI techniques employed
in multi-fault diagnosis. In this regard, this paper attempts to achieve the same by implementing
a systematic literature review on a Data-driven approach for multi-fault diagnosis of Industrial
Rotating Machines using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA)
method. The PRISMA method is a collection of guidelines for the composition and structure of systematic
reviews and other meta-analyses. This paper identifies the foundational work done in the field
and gives a comparative study of different aspects related to multi-fault diagnosis of industrial
rotating machines. The paper also identifies the major challenges, research gap. It gives solutions
using recent advancements in AI in implementing multi-fault diagnosis, giving a strong base for
future research in this field.

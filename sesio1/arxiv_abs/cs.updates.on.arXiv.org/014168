Real-world information networks are increasingly occurring across various disciplines including
online social networks and citation networks. These network data are generally characterized
by sparseness, nonlinearity and heterogeneity bringing different challenges to the network analytics
task to capture inherent properties from network data. Artificial intelligence and machine learning
have been recently leveraged as powerful systems to learn insights from network data and deal with
presented challenges. As part of machine learning techniques, graph embedding approaches are
originally conceived for graphs constructed from feature represented datasets, like image dataset,
in which links between nodes are explicitly defined. These traditional approaches cannot cope
with network data challenges. As a new learning paradigm, network representation learning has
been proposed to map a real-world information network into a low-dimensional space while preserving
inherent properties of the network. In this paper, we present a systematic comprehensive survey
of network representation learning, known also as network embedding, from birth to the current
development state. Through the undertaken survey, we provide a comprehensive view of reasons behind
the emergence of network embedding and, types of settings and models used in the network embedding
pipeline. Thus, we introduce a brief history of representation learning and word representation
learning ancestor of network embedding. We provide also formal definitions of basic concepts required
to understand network representation learning followed by a description of network embedding
pipeline. Most commonly used downstream tasks to evaluate embeddings, their evaluation metrics
and popular datasets are highlighted. Finally, we present the open-source libraries for network
embedding.

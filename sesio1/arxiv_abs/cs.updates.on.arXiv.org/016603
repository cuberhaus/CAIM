With the rapid development of smart manufacturing, data-driven machinery health management has
been of growing attention. In situations where some classes are more difficult to be distinguished
compared to others and where classes might be organised in a hierarchy of categories, current DL
methods can not work well. In this study, a novel hierarchical cavitation intensity recognition
framework using Sub-Main Transfer Network, termed SMTNet, is proposed to classify acoustic signals
of valve cavitation. SMTNet model outputs multiple predictions ordered from coarse to fine along
a network corresponding to a hierarchy of target cavitation states. Firstly, a data augmentation
method based on Sliding Window with Fast Fourier Transform (Swin-FFT) is developed to solve few-shot
problem. Secondly, a 1-D double hierarchical residual block (1-D DHRB) is presented to capture
sensitive features of the frequency domain valve acoustic signals. Thirdly, hierarchical multi-label
tree is proposed to assist the embedding of the semantic structure of target cavitation states into
SMTNet. Fourthly, experience filtering mechanism is proposed to fully learn a prior knowledge
of cavitation detection model. Finally, SMTNet has been evaluated on two cavitation datasets without
noise (Dataset 1 and Dataset 2), and one cavitation dataset with real noise (Dataset 3) provided
by SAMSON AG (Frankfurt). The prediction accurcies of SMTNet for cavitation intensity recognition
are as high as 95.32%, 97.16% and 100%, respectively. At the same time, the testing accuracies of
SMTNet for cavitation detection are as high as 97.02%, 97.64% and 100%. In addition, SMTNet has also
been tested for different frequencies of samples and has achieved excellent results of the highest
frequency of samples of mobile phones.

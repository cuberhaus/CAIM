Smart Grids and Industry 4.0 (I4.0) are neither a dream nor a near-future thing anymore, rather it
is happening now. The integration of more and more embedded systems and IoT devices is pushing smart
grids and I4.0 forward at a breakneck speed. To cope up with this, the modification of age-old SCADA
(Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems in terms of decentralization, near-real-time
operation, security, and privacy is necessary. In this context, blockchain technology has the
potential of providing not only these essential features of the data acquisition process of future
SCADA systems but also many other useful add-ons. On the other side, it is evident that various type
of security breach tends to take place more during any economic turmoil. These can cause even more
serious devastation to the global economy and human life. Thus, it is necessary to make our industries
robust, automated, and resilient with secured and immutable data acquiring systems. This paper
deals with the implementation scopes of blockchain in the data acquisition part of SCADA systems
in the area of the smart grid and I4.0. There are several consensus mechanisms to support blockchain
integration in the field of cryptocurrencies, vehicular networks, healthcare systems, e-commerce,
etc. But little attention has been paid to developing efficient and easy-to-implement consensus
mechanisms in the field of blockchain-enabled SCADA systems. From this perspective, a novel consensus
mechanism, which we call PoRCH (Proof of Random Count in Hashes), with a customized mining node selection
scheme has been proposed in this paper. Also, a small-scale prototype of a blockchain-enabled data
acquisition system has been developed. The performance evaluation of the implemented prototype
shows the benefits of blockchain technology.

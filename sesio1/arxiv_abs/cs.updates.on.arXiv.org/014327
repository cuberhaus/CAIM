Synthesis and efficient implementation mRNA strands has been shown to have wide utility, especially
recently in the development of COVID vaccines. However, the intrinsic chemical stability of mRNA
poses a challenge due to the presence of 2'-hydroxyl groups in ribose sugars. The -OH group in the
backbone structure enables a base-catalyzed nucleophilic attack by the deprotonated hydroxyl
on the adjacent phosphorous and consequent self-hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bond. As expected
for in-line hydrolytic cleavage reactions, the chemical stability of mRNA strands is highly dependent
on external environmental factors, e.g. pH, temperature, oxidizers, etc. Predicting this chemical
instability using a computational model will reduce the number of sequences synthesized and tested
through identifying the most promising candidates, aiding the development of mRNA related therapies.
This paper proposes and evaluates three deep learning models (Long Short Term Memory, Gated Recurrent
Unit, and Graph Convolutional Networks) as methods to predict the reactivity and risk of degradation
of mRNA sequences. The Stanford Open Vaccine dataset of 6034 mRNA sequences was used in this study.
The training set consisted of 3029 of these sequences (length of 107 nucleotide bases) while the
testing dataset consisted of 3005 sequences (length of 130 nucleotide bases), in structured (Lowest
Entropy Base Pair Probability Matrix) and unstructured (Nodes and Edges) forms. The stability
of mRNA strands was accurately generated, with the Graph Convolutional Network being the best predictor
of reactivity ($RMSE = 0.249$) while the Gated Recurrent Unit Network was the best at predicting
risks of degradation ($RMSE = 0.266$). Combining all target variables, the GRU performed the best
with 76% accuracy. Results suggest these models can be applied to understand and predict the chemical
stability of mRNA in the near future.

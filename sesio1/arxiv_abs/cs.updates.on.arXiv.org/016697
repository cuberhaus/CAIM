Mosquitoes are known vectors for disease transmission that cause over one million deaths globally
each year. The majority of natural mosquito habitats are areas containing standing water that are
challenging to detect using conventional ground-based technology on a macro scale. Contemporary
approaches, such as drones, UAVs, and other aerial imaging technology are costly when implemented
and are only most accurate on a finer spatial scale whereas the proposed convolutional neural network(CNN)
approach can be applied for disease risk mapping and further guide preventative efforts on a more
global scale. By assessing the performance of autonomous mosquito habitat detection technology,
the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases can be prevented in a cost-effective manner. This
approach aims to identify the spatiotemporal distribution of mosquito habitats in extensive areas
that are difficult to survey using ground-based technology by employing computer vision on satellite
imagery for proof of concept. The research presents an evaluation and the results of 3 different
CNN models to determine their accuracy of predicting large-scale mosquito habitats. For this approach,
a dataset was constructed containing a variety of geographical features. Larger land cover variables
such as ponds/lakes, inlets, and rivers were utilized to classify mosquito habitats while minute
sites were omitted for higher accuracy on a larger scale. Using the dataset, multiple CNN networks
were trained and evaluated for accuracy of habitat prediction. Utilizing a CNN-based approach
on readily available satellite imagery is cost-effective and scalable, unlike most aerial imaging
technology. Testing revealed that YOLOv4 obtained greater accuracy in mosquito habitat detection
for identifying large-scale mosquito habitats.

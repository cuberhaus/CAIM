In the classical world, the existence of commitments is equivalent to the existence of one-way functions.
In the quantum setting, on the other hand, commitments are not known to imply one-way functions,
but all known constructions of quantum commitments use at least one-way functions. Are one-way
functions really necessary for commitments in the quantum world? In this work, we show that non-interactive
quantum commitments (for classical messages) with computational hiding and statistical binding
exist if pseudorandom quantum states exist. Pseudorandom quantum states are sets of quantum states
that are efficiently generated but their polynomially many copies are computationally indistinguishable
from the same number of copies of Haar random states [Ji, Liu, and Song, CRYPTO 2018]. It is known that
pseudorandom quantum states exist even if $\BQP=\QMA$ (relative to a quantum oracle) [Kretschmer,
TQC 2021], which means that pseudorandom quantum states can exist even if no quantum-secure classical
cryptographic primitive exists. Our result therefore shows that quantum commitments can exist
even if no quantum-secure classical cryptographic primitive exists. In particular, quantum commitments
can exist even if no quantum-secure one-way function exists. In this work, we also consider digital
signatures, which are other fundamental primitives in cryptography. We show that one-time secure
digital signatures with quantum public keys exist if pseudorandom quantum states exist. In the
classical setting, the existence of digital signatures is equivalent to the existence of one-way
functions. Our result, on the other hand, shows that quantum signatures can exist even if no quantum-secure
classical cryptographic primitive (including quantum-secure one-way functions) exists.

Social platforms, and the online communities that use them, are evolving at a rapid pace. As a result,
research and development regarding how to moderate online communities is being out-paced. In this
paper, we present a novel framework that will allow moderation researchers and practitioners to
not only keep-up with the diverse landscape of available platforms and affordances, but also comprehensively
represent and analyze moderation on these platforms. The MIC framework represents a social platform's
moderation ecosystem using a base-set of 12 platform-level affordances, along with a notion of
the inter-affordance relationships that can exist between them. These affordances fall into the
three categories -- Members, Infrastructure, and Content -- that are derived from Grimmelmann's
taxonomy of moderation, a framework that is already widely accepted and used by the moderation research
community. To show how MIC serves as an insightful augmentation of Grimmelmann's lens, we begin
by describing how its components have already been shown to impact Grimmelmann's techniques for
moderation. Then, we demonstrate the advantages of using an affordance-aware framework like MIC
by analyzing several social platforms over the course of two case studies. First, we analyze individual
platforms using MIC and demonstrate how MIC can be used to examine the effects of platform changes
on the moderation ecosystem and identify potential new challenges in moderation. Next, use MIC
to systematically compare three platforms and propose potential moderation mechanisms that each
can adapt. Moderation researchers and stakeholders can use such comparisons to uncover where platforms
can emulate established, successful and better-studied platforms, as well as learn from the pitfalls
other platforms have encountered.

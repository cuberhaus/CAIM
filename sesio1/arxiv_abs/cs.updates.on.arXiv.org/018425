We suggest a new methodology for designing robust energy systems. For this, we investigate so-called
near-optimal solutions to energy system optimisation models; solutions whose objective values
deviate only marginally from the optimum. Using a refined method for obtaining explicit geometric
descriptions of these near-optimal feasible spaces, we find designs that are as robust as possible
to perturbations. This contributes to the ongoing debate on how to define and work with robustness
in energy systems modelling. We apply our methods in an investigation using multiple decades of
weather data. For the first time, we run a capacity expansion model of the European power system (one
node per country) with a three-hourly temporal resolution with 41 years of weather data. While an
optimisation with 41 weather years is at the limits of computational feasibility, we use the near-optimal
feasible spaces of single years to gain an understanding of the design space over the full time period.
Specifically, we intersect all near-optimal feasible spaces for the individual years in order
to get designs that are likely to be feasible over the entire time period. We find significant potential
for flexibility, and verify the feasibility of these designs by simulating the resulting dispatch
problem with four decades of weather data. They are characterised by a shift towards more onshore
wind and solar power, while emitting up to 60\% less \ch{CO2} than a cost-optimal solution over that
period. Our work builds on recent developments in the field, including techniques such as Modelling
to Generate Alternatives and Modelling All Alternatives, and provides new insights into the geometry
of near-optimal feasible spaces and the importance of multi-decade weather variability for energy
systems design. We also provide an effective way of working with a multi-decade time frame in a highly
parallelised manner.

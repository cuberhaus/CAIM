Accurate decoding of surface electromyography (sEMG) is pivotal for muscle-to-machine-interfaces
(MMI) and their application for e.g. rehabilitation therapy. sEMG signals have high inter-subject
variability, due to various factors, including skin thickness, body fat percentage, and electrode
placement. Therefore, obtaining high generalization quality of a trained sEMG decoder is quite
challenging. Usually, machine learning based sEMG decoders are either trained on subject-specific
data, or at least recalibrated for each user, individually. Even though, deep learning algorithms
produced several state of the art results for sEMG decoding,however, due to the limited amount of
availability of sEMG data, the deep learning models are prone to overfitting. Recently, transfer
learning for domain adaptation improved generalization quality with reduced training time on
various machine learning tasks. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of transfer learning
using weight initialization for recalibration of two different pretrained deep learning models
on a new subjects data, and compare their performance to subject-specific models. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first study that thoroughly investigated weight-initialization based
transfer learning for sEMG classification and compared transfer learning to subject-specific
modeling. We tested our models on three publicly available databases under various settings. On
average over all settings, our transfer learning approach improves 5~\%-points on the pretrained
models without fine-tuning and 12~\%-points on the subject-specific models, while being trained
on average 22~\% fewer epochs. Our results indicate that transfer learning enables faster training
on fewer samples than user-specific models, and improves the performance of pretrained models
as long as enough data is available.

Electrical neuromodulation as a palliative treatment has been increasingly used in epilepsy.
However, most current neuromodulations implement pre-determined actuation strategies and lack
self-adaptive patterns for adjusting stimulation strategies. In this work, rooted in optimal
control theory, we propose a novel framework for real-time closed-loop electrical neuromodulation
in epilepsy, which combines i) a deep Koopman operator based dynamical model to predict the temporal
evolution of epileptic EEG with an approximated finite-dimensional linear dynamics and ii) a model
predictive control (MPC) modular to design optimal seizure suppression strategies. It is termed
Koopman-MPC framework. The Koopman operator based linear dynamical model is embedded in the latent
state space of the autoencoder neural network, in which we can approximate and update the Koopman
operator online. The linear dynamical property of the Koopman operator ensures the convexity of
the optimization problem for subsequent MPC control. The predictive capability of the deep Koopman
operator model is tested with both synthetic and real epileptic EEG data. The results demonstrate
that the deep Koopman operator based model can map nonlinear neural dynamics into finite-dimensional
linear dynamics with higher performance in predicting the seizure dynamics, compared with a 10-order
autoregressive model (AR) model and a recurrent neural network (RNN). Moreover, compared with
the RNN-MPC framework, the Koopman-MPC framework can better suppress seizure dynamics with less
time consumption (only 0.035s), enabling real-time updates of epilepsy control strategies. Our
Koopman-MPC framework opens a new window for model-based closed-loop neuromodulation and sheds
light on nonlinear neurodynamics and feedback control policies.

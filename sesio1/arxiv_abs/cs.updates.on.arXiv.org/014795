Functional groups and moieties are chemical descriptors of biomolecules that can be used to interpret
their properties and functions, leading to the understanding of chemical or biological mechanisms.
These chemical building blocks, or sub-structures, enable the identification of common molecular
subgroups, assessing the structural similarities and critical interactions among a set of biological
molecules with known activities, and designing novel compounds with similar chemical properties.
Here, we introduce a Python-based tool, SPECTRe (Substructure Processing, Enumeration, and Comparison
Tool Resource), designed to provide all substructures in a given molecular structure, regardless
of the molecule size, employing efficient enumeration and generation of substructures represented
in a human-readable SMILES format through the use of classical graph traversal (breadth-first
and depth-first search) algorithms. We demonstrate the application of SPECTRe for a set of 10,375
molecules in the molecular weight range 27 to 350 Da (<=26 non-hydrogen atoms), spanning a wide array
of structure-based chemical functionalities and chemical classes. We found that the substructure
count as a measure of molecular complexity depends strongly on the number of unique atom and bond
types present, degree of branching, and presence of rings. The substructure counts are found to
be similar for a set of molecules belonging to particular chemical classes and classified based
on the characteristic features of certain topologies. We demonstrate that SPECTRe shows promise
to be useful in many applications of cheminformatics such as virtual screening for drug discovery,
property prediction, fingerprint-based molecular similarity searching, and data mining for
identifying frequent substructures.

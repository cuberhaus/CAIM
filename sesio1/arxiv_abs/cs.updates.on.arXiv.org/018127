Food profiling is an essential step in any food monitoring system needed to prevent health risks
and potential frauds in the food industry. Significant improvements in sequencing technologies
are pushing food profiling to become the main computational bottleneck. State-of-the-art profilers
are unfortunately too costly for food profiling. Our goal is to design a food profiler that solves
the main limitations of existing profilers, namely (1) working on massive data structures and (2)
incurring considerable data movement, for a real-time monitoring system. To this end, we propose
Demeter, the first platform-independent framework for food profiling. Demeter overcomes the
first limitation through the use of hyperdimensional computing (HDC) and efficiently performs
the accurate few-species classification required in food profiling. We overcome the second limitation
by the use of an in-memory hardware accelerator for Demeter (named Acc-Demeter) based on memristor
devices. Acc-Demeter actualizes several domain-specific optimizations and exploits the inherent
characteristics of memristors to improve the overall performance and energy consumption of Acc-Demeter.
We compare Demeter's accuracy with other industrial food profilers using detailed software modeling.
We synthesize Acc-Demeter's required hardware using UMC's 65nm library by considering an accurate
PCM model based on silicon-based prototypes. Our evaluations demonstrate that Acc-Demeter achieves
a (1) throughput improvement of 192x and 724x and (2) memory reduction of 36x and 33x compared to Kraken2
and MetaCache (2 state-of-the-art profilers), respectively, on typical food-related databases.
Demeter maintains an acceptable profiling accuracy (within 2% of existing tools) and incurs a very
low area overhead.

Machine learning (ML) models have been deployed for high-stakes applications. Due to class imbalance
in the sensitive attribute observed in the datasets, ML models are unfair on minority subgroups
identified by a sensitive attribute, such as race and sex. In-processing fairness algorithms ensure
model predictions are independent of sensitive attribute. Furthermore, ML models are vulnerable
to attribute inference attacks where an adversary can identify the values of sensitive attribute
by exploiting their distinguishable model predictions. Despite privacy and fairness being important
pillars of trustworthy ML, the privacy risk introduced by fairness algorithms with respect to attribute
leakage has not been studied. We identify attribute inference attacks as an effective measure for
auditing blackbox fairness algorithms to enable model builder to account for privacy and fairness
in the model design. We proposed Dikaios, a privacy auditing tool for fairness algorithms for model
builders which leveraged a new effective attribute inference attack that account for the class
imbalance in sensitive attributes through an adaptive prediction threshold. We evaluated Dikaios
to perform a privacy audit of two in-processing fairness algorithms over five datasets. We show
that our attribute inference attacks with adaptive prediction threshold significantly outperform
prior attacks. We highlighted the limitations of in-processing fairness algorithms to ensure
indistinguishable predictions across different values of sensitive attributes. Indeed, the
attribute privacy risk of these in-processing fairness schemes is highly variable according to
the proportion of the sensitive attributes in the dataset. This unpredictable effect of fairness
mechanisms on the attribute privacy risk is an important limitation on their utilization which
has to be accounted by the model builder.

In this paper, a novel data-driven approach named Augmented Imagefication for Fault detection
(FD) of aircraft air data sensors (ADS) is proposed. Exemplifying the FD problem of aircraft air
data sensors, an online FD scheme on edge device based on deep neural network (DNN) is developed.
First, the aircraft inertial reference unit measurements is adopted as equivalent inputs, which
is scalable to different aircraft/flight cases. Data associated with 6 different aircraft/flight
conditions are collected to provide diversity (scalability) in the training/testing database.
Then Augmented Imagefication is proposed for the DNN-based prediction of flying conditions. The
raw data are reshaped as a grayscale image for convolutional operation, and the necessity of augmentation
is analyzed and pointed out. Different kinds of augmented method, i.e. Flip, Repeat, Tile and their
combinations are discussed, the result shows that the All Repeat operation in both axes of image
matrix leads to the best performance of DNN. The interpretability of DNN is studied based on Grad-CAM,
which provide a better understanding and further solidifies the robustness of DNN. Next the DNN
model, VGG-16 with augmented imagefication data is optimized for mobile hardware deployment.
After pruning of DNN, a lightweight model (98.79% smaller than original VGG-16) with high accuracy
(slightly up by 0.27%) and fast speed (time delay is reduced by 87.54%) is obtained. And the hyperparameters
optimization of DNN based on TPE is implemented and the best combination of hyperparameters is determined
(learning rate 0.001, iterative epochs 600, and batch size 100 yields the highest accuracy at 0.987).
Finally, a online FD deployment based on edge device, Jetson Nano, is developed and the real time
monitoring of aircraft is achieved. We believe that this method is instructive for addressing the
FD problems in other similar fields.

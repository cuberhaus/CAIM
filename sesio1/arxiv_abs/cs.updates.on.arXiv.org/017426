Context: Research collaborations between software engineering industry and academia can provide
significant benefits to both sides, including improved innovation capacity for industry, and
real-world environment for motivating and validating research ideas. However, building scalable
and effective research collaborations in software engineering is known to be challenging. While
such challenges can be varied and many, in this paper we focus on the challenges of achieving participative
knowledge creation supported by active dialog between industry and academia and continuous commitment
to joint problem solving. Objective: This paper aims to understand what are the elements of a successful
industry-academia collaboration that enable the culture of participative knowledge creation.
Method: We conducted participant observation collecting qualitative data spanning 8 years of
collaborative research between a software engineering research group on software V&V and the Norwegian
IT sector. The collected data was analyzed and synthesized into a practical collaboration model,
named the Certus Model. Results: The model is structured in seven phases, describing activities
from setting up research projects to the exploitation of research results. As such, the Certus model
advances other collaborations models from literature by delineating different phases covering
the complete life cycle of participative research knowledge creation. Conclusion: The Certus
model describes the elements of a research collaboration process between researchers and practitioners
in software engineering, grounded on the principles of research knowledge co-creation and continuous
commitment to joint problem solving. The model can be applied and tested in other contexts where
it may be adapted to the local context through experimentation.

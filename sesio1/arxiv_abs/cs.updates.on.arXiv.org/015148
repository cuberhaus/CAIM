Longevity and safety of lithium-ion batteries are facilitated by efficient monitoring and adjustment
of the battery operating conditions. Hence, it is crucial to implement fast and accurate algorithms
for State of Health (SoH) monitoring on the Battery Management System. The task is challenging due
to the complexity and multitude of the factors contributing to the battery degradation, especially
because the different degradation processes occur at various timescales and their interactions
play an important role. Data-driven methods bypass this issue by approximating the complex processes
with statistical or machine learning models. This paper proposes a data-driven approach which
is understudied in the context of battery degradation, despite its simplicity and ease of computation:
the Multivariable Fractional Polynomial (MFP) regression. Models are trained from historical
data of one exhausted cell and used to predict the SoH of other cells. The data are characterised by
varying loads simulating dynamic operating conditions. Two hypothetical scenarios are considered:
one assumes that a recent capacity measurement is known, the other is based only on the nominal capacity.
It was shown that the degradation behaviour of the batteries under examination is influenced by
their historical data, as supported by the low prediction errors achieved (root mean squared errors
from 1.2% to 7.22% when considering data up to the battery End of Life). Moreover, we offer a multi-factor
perspective where the degree of impact of each different factor is analysed. Finally, we compare
with a Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network and other works from the literature on the same dataset.
We conclude that the MFP regression is effective and competitive with contemporary works, and provides
several additional advantages e.g. in terms of interpretability, generalisability, and implementability.

Over the last year, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its variants
have highlighted the importance of screening tools with high diagnostic accuracy for new illnesses
such as COVID-19. To that regard, deep learning approaches have proven as effective solutions for
pneumonia classification, especially when considering chest-x-rays images. However, this lung
infection can also be caused by other viral, bacterial or fungi pathogens. Consequently, efforts
are being poured toward distinguishing the infection source to help clinicians to diagnose the
correct disease origin. Following this tendency, this study further explores the effectiveness
of established neural network architectures on the pneumonia classification task through the
transfer learning paradigm. To present a comprehensive comparison, 12 well-known ImageNet pre-trained
models were fine-tuned and used to discriminate among chest-x-rays of healthy people, and those
showing pneumonia symptoms derived from either a viral (i.e., generic or SARS-CoV-2) or bacterial
source. Furthermore, since a common public collection distinguishing between such categories
is currently not available, two distinct datasets of chest-x-rays images, describing the aforementioned
sources, were combined and employed to evaluate the various architectures. The experiments were
performed using a total of 6330 images split between train, validation and test sets. For all models,
common classification metrics were computed (e.g., precision, f1-score) and most architectures
obtained significant performances, reaching, among the others, up to 84.46% average f1-score
when discriminating the 4 identified classes. Moreover, confusion matrices and activation maps
computed via the Grad-CAM algorithm were also reported to present an informed discussion on the
networks classifications.

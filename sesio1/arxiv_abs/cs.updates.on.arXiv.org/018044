To limit the time, cost, and environmental impact associated with the acquisition of seismic data,
in recent decades considerable effort has been put into so-called simultaneous shooting acquisitions,
where seismic sources are fired at short time intervals between each other. As a consequence, waves
originating from consecutive shots are entangled within the seismic recordings, yielding so-called
blended data. For processing and imaging purposes, the data generated by each individual shot must
be retrieved. This process, called deblending, is achieved by solving an inverse problem which
is heavily underdetermined. Conventional approaches rely on transformations that render the
blending noise into burst-like noise, whilst preserving the signal of interest. Compressed sensing
type regularization is then applied, where sparsity in some domain is assumed for the signal of interest.
The domain of choice depends on the geometry of the acquisition and the properties of seismic data
within the chosen domain. In this work, we introduce a new concept that consists of embedding a self-supervised
denoising network into the Plug-and-Play (PnP) framework. A novel network is introduced whose
design extends the blind-spot network architecture of [28 ] for partially coherent noise (i.e.,
correlated in time). The network is then trained directly on the noisy input data at each step of the
PnP algorithm. By leveraging both the underlying physics of the problem and the great denoising
capabilities of our blind-spot network, the proposed algorithm is shown to outperform an industry-standard
method whilst being comparable in terms of computational cost. Moreover, being independent on
the acquisition geometry, our method can be easily applied to both marine and land data without any
significant modification.

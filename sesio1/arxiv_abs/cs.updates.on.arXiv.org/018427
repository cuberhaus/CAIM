Serverless computing is an emerging cloud computing paradigm. Moreover, it has become an attractive
development option for cloud-based applications for software developers. The most significant
advantage of serverless computing is to free software developers from the burden of complex underlying
management tasks and allow them to focus on only the application logic implementation. Based on
its benign characteristics and bright prospect, it has been an increasingly hot topic in various
scenarios, such as machine learning, scientific computing, video processing, and Internet of
Things. However, none of the studies focuses on a comprehensive analysis of the current research
state of the art of serverless computing from the research scope and depth. To fill this knowledge
gap, we present a comprehensive literature review to summarize the current research state of the
art of serverless computing. This review is based on selected 164 research papers to answer three
key aspects, i.e., research directions (What), existing solutions (How), and platforms and venues
(Where). Specifically, first, we construct a taxonomy linked to research directions about the
serverless computing literature. Our taxonomy has 18 research categories covering performance
optimization, programming framework, application migration, multi-cloud development, cost,
testing, debugging, etc. Second, we classify the related studies of each research direction and
elaborate on their specific solutions. Third, we investigate the distributions of experimental
platforms and publication venues for existing techniques. Finally, based on our analysis, we discuss
some key challenges and envision promising opportunities for future research on the serverless
platform side, serverless application side, and serverless computing community side.

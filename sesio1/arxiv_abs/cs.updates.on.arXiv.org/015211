Anomaly detection and localization is an important vision problem, having multiple applications.
Effective and generic semantic segmentation of anomalous regions on various different surfaces,
where most anomalous regions inherently do not have any obvious pattern, is still under active research.
Periodic health monitoring and fault (anomaly) detection in vast infrastructures, which is an
important safety-related task, is one such application area of vision-based anomaly segmentation.
However, the task is quite challenging due to large variations in surface faults, texture-less
construction material/background, lighting conditions etc. Cracks are critical and frequent
surface faults that manifest as extreme zigzag-shaped thin, elongated regions. They are among
the hardest faults to detect, even with deep learning. In this work, we address an open aspect of automatic
crack segmentation problem, that of generalizing and improving the performance of segmentation
across a variety of scenarios, by modeling the problem differently. We carefully study and abstract
the sub-problems involved and solve them in a broader context, making our solution generic. On a
variety of datasets related to surveillance of different infrastructures, under varying conditions,
our model consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms by a significant margin,
without any bells-and-whistles. This performance advantage easily carried over in two deployments
of our model, tested against industry-provided datasets. Even further, we could establish our
model's performance for two manufacturing quality inspection scenarios as well, where the defect
types are not just crack equivalents, but much more and different. Hence we hope that our model is
indeed a truly generic defect segmentation model.

Despite the long history of studying instant messaging usage, we know very little about how today's
people participate in group chat channels and interact with others inside a real-world organization.
In this short paper, we aim to update the existing knowledge on how group chat is used in the context
of today's organizations. The knowledge is particularly important for the new norm of remote works
under the COVID-19 pandemic. We have the privilege of collecting two valuable datasets: a total
of 4,300 group chat channels in Slack from an R&D department in a multinational IT company; and a total
of 117 groups' performance data. Through qualitative coding of 100 randomly sampled group channels
from the 4,300 channels dataset, we identified and reported 9 categories such as Project channels,
IT-Support channels, and Event channels. We further defined a feature metric with 21 meta features
(and their derived features) without looking at the message content to depict the group communication
style for these group chat channels, with which we successfully trained a machine learning model
that can automatically classify a given group channel into one of the 9 categories. In addition to
the descriptive data analysis, we illustrated how these communication metrics can be used to analyze
team performance. We cross-referenced 117 project teams and their team-based Slack channels and
identified 57 teams that appeared in both datasets, then we built a regression model to reveal the
relationship between these group communication styles and the project team performance. This
work contributes an updated empirical understanding of human-human communication practices
within the enterprise setting, and suggests design opportunities for the future of human-AI communication
experience.

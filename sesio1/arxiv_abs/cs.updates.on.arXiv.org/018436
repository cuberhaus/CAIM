With the rapid development of wireless communication technology, wireless access points (AP)
and internet of things (IoT) devices have been widely deployed in our surroundings. Various types
of wireless signals (e.g., Wi-Fi, LoRa, LTE) are filling out our living and working spaces. Previous
researches reveal the fact that radio waves are modulated by the spatial structure during the propagation
process (e.g., reflection, diffraction, and scattering) and superimposed on the receiver. This
observation allows us to reconstruct the surrounding environment based on received wireless signals,
called "wireless sensing". Wireless sensing is an emerging technology that enables a wide range
of applications, such as gesture recognition for human-computer interaction, vital signs monitoring
for health care, and intrusion detection for security management. Compared with other sensing
paradigms, such as vision-based and IMU-based sensing, wireless sensing solutions have unique
advantages such as high coverage, pervasiveness, low cost, and robustness under adverse light
and texture scenarios. Besides, wireless sensing solutions are generally lightweight in terms
of both computation overhead and device size. This tutorial takes Wi-Fi sensing as an example. It
introduces both the theoretical principles and the code implementation of data collection, signal
processing, features extraction, and model design. In addition, this tutorial highlights state-of-the-art
deep learning models (e.g., CNN, RNN, and adversarial learning models) and their applications
in wireless sensing systems. We hope this tutorial will help people in other research fields to break
into wireless sensing research and learn more about its theories, designs, and implementation
skills, promoting prosperity in the wireless sensing research field.

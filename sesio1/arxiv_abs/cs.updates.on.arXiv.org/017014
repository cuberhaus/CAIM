The automated analysis of digital human communication data often focuses on specific aspects such
as content or network structure in isolation. Thereby, it often suffers from a limited perspective
and makes cross-methodological analyses common in many domains, like investigative journalism,
difficult. Communication research in psychology and the digital humanities instead stresses
the importance of a holistic analysis approach to overcome these limiting factors. In this work,
we conduct an extensive survey on the properties of over forty current semi-automated communication
analysis systems and investigate how they cover concepts described in theoretical communication
research. From these investigations, we derive a design space and contribute a conceptual framework
based on communication research, technical considerations, and the surveyed approaches. The
framework describes the systems' properties, capabilities, and composition through a wide range
of criteria organized in the analysis dimensions (1) Data, (2) Processing and Models, (3) Visual
Interface, and (4) Knowledge Generation. These criteria enable a formalization of digital communication
analysis through visual analytics, which, we argue, is uniquely suited for this task by tackling
automation complexity while leveraging domain knowledge. With our framework, we identify shortcomings
and research challenges, such as group communication dynamics, trust and privacy considerations,
and holistic approaches, for which we discuss relevant design considerations. Simultaneously,
our framework supports the evaluation of systems and promotes the mutual exchange between researchers
through a common language and taxonomy, laying the foundations for future research on communication
analysis through visual analytics.

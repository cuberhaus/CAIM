Colleges and Universities have been established to provide educational services to the people.
Like any other organization, the school has processes and procedures similar to business or industry
that involve admissions, processing of data, and generation of reports. Those processes are made
possible through a centralized system in storing, processing, and retrieval of data and information.
The absence of a computer system and the complexity of the transactions of the college which makes
the personnel be loaded with paper works in storing and keeping student records and information
is the motivating factor why the School Management Information System has been designed and developed
for a community college in the northern part of Mindanao. This paper discusses the Major Functionalities
and Modules of the system through its implementation methodology which is the Agile Model and its
impact on the delivery of services and procedures in the overall operation of the college. The project
has been evaluated based on ISO 25010, a quality model used for product/software quality evaluation
systems. Based on the results of the evaluation, SMIS has been Functional, Usable, and Reliable
with an average for every criterion above 4.04 indicating very good performance based on a Likert
scale descriptive interpretation. Based on the preceding findings of the study, the respondents
agreed that the developed e-school system was functional and lifted the transaction process of
the school. The overall quality and performance of the system was very good in terms of functionality,
usability, and reliability. It is recommended that future development such as the smartphone and
tablet-based attendance monitoring should be integrated, a kiosk for grades and schedule viewing
should also be placed inside the campus that is connected to the database server.

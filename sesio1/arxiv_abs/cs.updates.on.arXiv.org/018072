Security and safety are intertwined concepts in the world of computing. In recent years, the terms
"sustainable security" and "sustainable safety" came into fashion and are being used referring
to a variety of systems properties ranging from efficiency to profitability, and sometimes meaning
that a product or service is good for people and planet. This leads to confusing perceptions of products
where customers might expect a sustainable product to be developed without child labour, while
the producer uses the term to signify that their new product uses marginally less power than the previous
generation of that products. Even in research on sustainably safe and secure ICT, these different
notions of terminology are prevalent. As researchers we often work towards optimising our subject
of study towards one specific sustainability metric - let's say energy consumption - while being
blissfully unaware of, e.g., social impacts, life-cycle impacts, or rebound effects of such optimisations.
In this paper I dissect the idea of sustainable safety and security, starting from the questions
of what we want to sustain, and for whom we want to sustain it. I believe that a general "people and planet"
answer is inadequate here because this form of sustainability cannot be the property of a single
industry sector but must be addressed by society as a whole. However, with sufficient understanding
of life-cycle impacts we may very well be able to devise research and development efforts, and inform
decision making processes towards the use of integrated safety and security solutions that help
us to address societal challenges in the context of the climate and ecological crises, and that are
aligned with concepts such as intersectionality and climate justice. Of course, these solutions
can only be effective if they are embedded in societal and economic change towards more frugal uses
of data and ICT.

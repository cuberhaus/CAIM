Time series data is used in a wide range of real world applications. In a variety of domains , detailed
analysis of time series data (via Forecasting and Anomaly Detection) leads to a better understanding
of how events associated with a specific time instance behave. Time Series Analysis (TSA) is commonly
performed with plots and traditional models. Machine Learning (ML) approaches , on the other hand
, have seen an increase in the state of the art for Forecasting and Anomaly Detection because they
provide comparable results when time and data constraints are met. A number of time series toolboxes
are available that offer rich interfaces to specific model classes (ARIMA/filters , neural networks)
or framework interfaces to isolated time series modelling tasks (forecasting , feature extraction
, annotation , classification). Nonetheless , open source machine learning capabilities for time
series remain limited , and existing libraries are frequently incompatible with one another. The
goal of this paper is to provide a concise and user friendly overview of the most important open source
tools for time series analysis. This article examines two related toolboxes (1) forecasting and
(2) anomaly detection. This paper describes a typical Time Series Analysis (TSA) framework with
an architecture and lists the main features of TSA framework. The tools are categorized based on
the criteria of analysis tasks completed , data preparation methods employed , and evaluation methods
for results generated. This paper presents quantitative analysis and discusses the current state
of actively developed open source Time Series Analysis frameworks. Overall , this article considered
60 time series analysis tools , and 32 of which provided forecasting modules , and 21 packages included
anomaly detection.

Goal: This work aims at developing a novel calibration-free fast parallel MRI (pMRI) reconstruction
method incorporate with discrete-time optimal control framework. The reconstruction model is
designed to learn a regularization that combines channels and extracts features by leveraging
the information sharing among channels of multi-coil images. We propose to recover both magnitude
and phase information by taking advantage of structured convolutional networks in image and Fourier
spaces. Methods: We develop a novel variational model with a learnable objective function that
integrates an adaptive multi-coil image combination operator and effective image regularization
in the image and Fourier spaces. We cast the reconstruction network as a structured discrete-time
optimal control system, resulting in an optimal control formulation of parameter training where
the parameters of the objective function play the role of control variables. We demonstrate that
the Lagrangian method for solving the control problem is equivalent to back-propagation, ensuring
the local convergence of the training algorithm. Results: We conduct a large number of numerical
experiments of the proposed method with comparisons to several state-of-the-art pMRI reconstruction
networks on real pMRI datasets. The numerical results demonstrate the promising performance of
the proposed method evidently. Conclusion: We conduct a large number of numerical experiments
of the proposed method with comparisons to several state-of-the-art pMRI reconstruction networks
on real pMRI datasets. The numerical results demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed
method evidently. Significance: By learning multi-coil image combination operator and performing
regularizations in both image domain and k-space domain, the proposed method achieves a highly
efficient image reconstruction network for pMRI.

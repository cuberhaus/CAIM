While user's perception & performance are predominantly examined independently in virtual reality,
the Action-Specific Perception (ASP) theory postulates that the performance of an individual
on a task modulates this individual's spatial & time perception pertinent to the task's components
& procedures. This paper examines the association between performance & perception & the potential
effects that tactile feedback modalities could generate. This paper reports a user study (N=24),
in which participants performed a Fitts's law target acquisition task by using three feedback modalities:
visual, visuo-electrotactile, & visuo-vibrotactile. The users completed 3 Target Sizes X 2 Distances
X 3 feedback modalities = 18 trials. The size perception, distance perception, & (movement) time
perception were assessed at the end of each trial. Performance-wise, the results showed that electrotactile
feedback facilitates a significantly better accuracy compared to vibrotactile & visual feedback,
while vibrotactile provided the worst accuracy. Electrotactile & visual feedback enabled a comparable
reaction time, while the vibrotactile offered a substantially slower reaction time than visual
feedback. Although amongst feedback types the pattern of differences in perceptual aspects were
comparable to performance differences, none of them was statistically significant. However,
performance indeed modulated perception. Significant action-specific effects on spatial & time
perception were detected. Changes in accuracy modulate both size perception & time perception,
while changes in movement speed modulate distance perception. Also, the index of difficulty was
found to modulate perception. These outcomes highlighted the importance of haptic feedback on
performance, & importantly the significance of action-specific effects on spatial & time perception
in VR, which should be considered in future VR studies.

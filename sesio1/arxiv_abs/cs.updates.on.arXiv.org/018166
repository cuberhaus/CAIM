Large medical imaging data sets are becoming increasingly available. A common challenge in these
data sets is to ensure that each sample meets minimum quality requirements devoid of significant
artefacts. Despite a wide range of existing automatic methods having been developed to identify
imperfections and artefacts in medical imaging, they mostly rely on data-hungry methods. In particular,
the lack of sufficient scans with artefacts available for training has created a barrier in designing
and deploying machine learning in clinical research. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel
framework having four main components: (1) a set of artefact generators inspired by magnetic resonance
physics to corrupt brain MRI scans and augment a training dataset, (2) a set of abstract and engineered
features to represent images compactly, (3) a feature selection process that depends on the class
of artefact to improve classification performance, and (4) a set of Support Vector Machine (SVM)
classifiers trained to identify artefacts. Our novel contributions are threefold: first, we use
the novel physics-based artefact generators to generate synthetic brain MRI scans with controlled
artefacts as a data augmentation technique. This will avoid the labour-intensive collection and
labelling process of scans with rare artefacts. Second, we propose a large pool of abstract and engineered
image features developed to identify 9 different artefacts for structural MRI. Finally, we use
an artefact-based feature selection block that, for each class of artefacts, finds the set of features
that provide the best classification performance. We performed validation experiments on a large
data set of scans with artificially-generated artefacts, and in a multiple sclerosis clinical
trial where real artefacts were identified by experts, showing that the proposed pipeline outperforms
traditional methods.

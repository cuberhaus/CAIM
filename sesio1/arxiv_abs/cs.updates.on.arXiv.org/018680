Steganography in multimedia aims to embed secret data into an innocent looking multimedia cover
object. This embedding introduces some distortion to the cover object and produces a corresponding
stego object. The embedding distortion is measured by a cost function that determines the detection
probability of the existence of the embedded secret data. A cost function related to the maximum
embedding rate is typically employed to evaluate a steganographic system. In addition, the distribution
of multimedia sources follows the Gibbs distribution which is a complex statistical model that
restricts analysis. Thus, previous multimedia steganographic approaches either assume a relaxed
distribution or presume a proposition on the maximum embedding rate and then try to prove it is correct.
Conversely, this paper introduces an analytic approach to determining the maximum embedding rate
in multimedia cover objects through a constrained optimization problem concerning the relationship
between the maximum embedding rate and the probability of detection by any steganographic detector.
The KL-divergence between the distributions for the cover and stego objects is used as the cost function
as it upper bounds the performance of the optimal steganographic detector. An equivalence between
the Gibbs and correlated-multivariate-quantized-Gaussian distributions is established to
solve this optimization problem. The solution provides an analytic form for the maximum embedding
rate in terms of the WrightOmega function. Moreover, it is proven that the maximum embedding rate
is in agreement with the commonly used Square Root Law (SRL) for steganography, but the solution
presented here is more accurate. Finally, the theoretical results obtained are verified experimentally.

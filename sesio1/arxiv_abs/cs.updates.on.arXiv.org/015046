The ever-increasing gap between compute and I/O performance in HPC platforms, together with the
development of novel NVMe storage devices (NVRAM), led to the emergence of the burst buffer concept
- an intermediate persistent storage layer logically positioned between random-access main memory
and a parallel file system. Since the appearance of this technology, numerous supercomputers have
been equipped with burst buffers exploring various architectures. Despite the development of
real-world architectures as well as research concepts, Resource and Job Management Systems, such
as Slurm, provide only marginal support for scheduling jobs with burst buffer requirements. This
research is primarily motivated by the alerting observation that burst buffers are omitted from
reservations in the procedure of backfilling in existing job schedulers. In this dissertation,
we forge a detailed supercomputer simulator based on Batsim and SimGrid, which is capable of simulating
I/O contention and I/O congestion effects. Due to the lack of publicly available workloads with
burst buffer requests, we create a burst buffer request distribution model derived from Parallel
Workload Archive logs. We investigate the impact of burst buffer reservations on the overall efficiency
of online job scheduling for canonical algorithms: First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) and Shortest-Job-First
(SJF) EASY-backfilling. Our results indicate that the lack of burst buffer reservations in backfilling
may significantly deteriorate the performance of scheduling. [...] Furthermore, this lack of
reservations may cause the starvation of medium-size and wide jobs. Finally, we propose a burst-buffer-aware
plan-based scheduling algorithm with simulated annealing optimisation, which improves the mean
waiting time by over 20% and mean bounded slowdown by 27% compared to the SJF EASY-backfilling.

We present a new Integrated Finite Element Neural Network framework (I-FENN), with the objective
to accelerate the numerical solution of nonlinear computational mechanics problems. We leverage
the swift predictive capability of neural networks (NNs) and we embed them inside the finite element
stiffness function, to compute element-level state variables and their derivatives within a nonlinear,
iterative numerical solution. This process is conducted jointly with conventional finite element
methods that involve shape functions: the NN receives input data that resembles the material point
deformation and its output is used to construct element-level field variables such as the element
Jacobian matrix and residual vector. Here we introduce I-FENN to the continuum damage analysis
of quasi-brittle materials, and we establish a new non-local gradient-based damage framework
which operates at the cost of a local damage approach. First, we develop a physics informed neural
network (PINN) to resemble the non-local gradient model and then we train the neural network offline.
The network learns to predict the non-local equivalent strain at each material point, as well as
its derivative with respect to the local strain. Then, the PINN is integrated in the element stiffness
definition and conducts the local to non-local strain transformation, whereas the two PINN outputs
are used to construct the element Jacobian matrix and residual vector. This process is carried out
within the nonlinear solver, until numerical convergence is achieved. The resulting method bears
the computational cost of the conventional local damage approach, but ensures mesh-independent
results and a diffused non-local strain and damage profile. As a result, the proposed method tackles
the vital drawbacks of both the local and non-local gradient method, respectively being the mesh-dependence
and additional computational cost.

Comparator circuits are a natural circuit model for studying bounded fan-out computation whose
power sits between nondeterministic branching programs and general circuits. Despite having
been studied for nearly three decades, the first superlinear lower bound against comparator circuits
was proved only recently by G\'al and Robere (ITCS 2020), who established a $\Omega((n/\log n)^{1.5})$
lower bound on the size of comparator circuits computing an explicit function of $n$ bits. In this
paper, we initiate the study of average-case complexity and circuit analysis algorithms for comparator
circuits. Departing from previous approaches, we exploit the technique of shrinkage under random
restrictions to obtain a variety of new results for this model. Among them, we show - Average-case
Lower Bounds. For every $k = k(n)$ with $k \geq \log n$, there exists a polynomial-time computable
function $f_k$ on $n$ bits such that, for every comparator circuit $C$ with at most $n^{1.5}/O(k\cdot
\sqrt{\log n})$ gates, we have \[ \text{Pr}_{x\in\left\{ 0,1 \right\}^n}\left[C(x)=f_k(x)\right]\leq
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2^{\Omega(k)}}. \] This average-case lower bound matches the worst-case
lower bound of G\'al and Robere by letting $k=O(\log n)$. - #SAT Algorithms. There is an algorithm
that counts the number of satisfying assignments of a given comparator circuit with at most $n^{1.5}/O\!\left(k\cdot
\sqrt{\log n}\right)$ gates, in time $2^{n-k}\cdot\text{poly}(n)$, for any $k\leq n/4$. The
running time is non-trivial when $k=\omega(\log n)$. - Pseudorandom Generators and MCSP Lower
Bounds. There is a pseudorandom generator of seed length $s^{2/3+o(1)}$ that fools comparator
circuits with $s$ gates. Also, using this PRG, we obtain an $n^{1.5-o(1)}$ lower bound for MCSP against
comparator circuits.

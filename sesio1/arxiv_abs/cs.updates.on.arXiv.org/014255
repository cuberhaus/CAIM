In recent years, the usage of indoor positioning systems for manufacturing processes became increasingly
popular. Typically, the production hall is equipped with satellites which receive position data
of sensors that can be pinned on components, load carriers or industrial trucks. This enables a company
e.g. to reduce search efforts and to optimize individual system processes. In our research context,
a sensor only sends position information when it is moved. However, various circumstances frequently
affect that data is undesirably sent, e.g. due to disrupting factors nearby. This has a negative
impact on the data quality, the energy consumption, and the reliability of the whole system. Motivated
by this, we aim to distinguish between actual movements and signals that were undesirably sent which
is in particular challenging due to the susceptibility of indoor systems in terms of noise and measuring
errors. Therefore, we propose two novel unsupervised classification algorithms suitable for
this task. Depending on the question of interest, they rely either on a distance-based or on a time-based
criterion, which allows to make use of all essential information. Furthermore, we propose an approach
to combine both classifications and to aggregate them on spatial production areas. This enables
us to generate a comprehensive map of the underlying production hall with the sole usage of the position
data. Aside from the analysis and detection of the underlying movement structure, the user benefits
from a better understanding of own system processes and from the detection of problematic system
areas which leads to a more efficient usage of positioning systems. Since all our approaches are
constructed with unsupervised techniques, they are handily applicable in practice and do not require
more information than the output data of the positioning system.

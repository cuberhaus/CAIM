Social media is extensively used in today's world. It facilitates quick and easy sharing of information
which makes it a good medium to advertize products. Influencers of a social media network, owing
to their massive popularity, provide a huge potential customer base. However, it is not straightforward
to decide which influencers should be selected for an advertizing campaign that can generate high
returns with low investment. In this work, we present an agent-based model (ABM) that can simulate
the dynamics of influencer advertizing campaigns in a variety of scenarios and can help to discover
the best influencer marketing strategy. Our system is a probabilistic graph-based model that provides
the additional advantage to incorporate real-world factors such as customers' interest in a product,
customer behavior, the willingness to pay, a brand's investment cap, influencers' engagement
with influence diffusion, and the nature of the product being advertized viz. luxury and non-luxury.
Using customer acquisition cost and conversion ratio as a unit economic, we evaluate the performance
of different kinds of influencers under a variety of circumstances that are simulated by varying
the nature of the product and the customers' interest. Our results exemplify the circumstance-dependent
nature of influencer marketing and provide insight into which kinds of influencers would be a better
strategy under respective circumstances. For instance, we show that as the nature of the product
varies from luxury to non-luxury, the performance of celebrities declines whereas the performance
of nano-influencers improves. In terms of the customers' interest, we find that the performance
of nano-influencers declines with the decrease in customers' interest whereas the performance
of celebrities improves.

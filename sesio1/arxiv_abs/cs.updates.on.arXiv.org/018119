In more recent years, there has been increasing research interest in exploiting the use of application
specific hardware for solving optimisation problems. Examples of solvers that use specialised
hardware are IBM's Quantum System One and D-wave's Quantum Annealer (QA) and Fujitsu's Digital
Annealer (DA). These solvers have been developed to optimise problems faster than traditional
meta-heuristics implemented on general purpose machines. Previous research has shown that these
solvers (can optimise many problems much quicker than exact solvers such as GUROBI and CPLEX. Such
conclusions have not been made when comparing hardware solvers with classical evolutionary algorithms.
Making a fair comparison between traditional evolutionary algorithms, such as Genetic Algorithm
(GA), and the DA (or other similar solvers) is challenging because the later benefits from the use
of application specific hardware while evolutionary algorithms are often implemented on general-purpose
machines. Moreover, quantum or quantum-inspired solvers are limited to solving problems in a specific
format. A common formulation used is Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimisation (QUBO). Many
optimisation problems are however constrained and have natural representations that are non-binary.
Converting such problems to QUBO can lead to more problem difficulty and/or larger search space.
The question addressed in this paper is whether quantum or quantum-inspired solvers can optimise
QUBO transformations of combinatorial optimisation problems faster than classical evolutionary
algorithms applied to the same problems in their natural representations. We show that the DA often
present better average objective function values than GA on Travelling Salesman, Quadratic Assignment
and Multi-dimensional Knapsack Problem instances.

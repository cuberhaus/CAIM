We explore the cryptographic power of arbitrary shared physical resources. The most general such
resource is access to a fresh entangled quantum state at the outset of each protocol execution. We
call this the Common Reference Quantum State (CRQS) model, in analogy to the well-known Common Reference
String (CRS). The CRQS model is a natural generalization of the CRS model but appears to be more powerful:
in the two-party setting, a CRQS can sometimes exhibit properties associated with a Random Oracle
queried once by measuring a maximally entangled state in one of many mutually unbiased bases. We
formalize this notion as a Weak One-Time Random Oracle (WOTRO), where we only ask of the m-bit output
to have some randomness when conditioned on the n-bit input. We show that WOTRO with $n - m \in {\omega}(\lg
n)$ is black-box impossible in the CRQS model, meaning that no protocol can have its security black-box
reduced to a cryptographic game. We define a (inefficient) quantum adversary against any WOTRO
protocol that can be efficiently simulated in polynomial time, ruling out any reduction to a secure
game that only makes black-box queries to the adversary. On the other hand, we introduce a non-game
quantum assumption for hash functions that implies WOTRO in the CRQ\$ model (where the CRQS consists
only of EPR pairs). We first build a statistically secure WOTRO protocol where $m = n$, then hash the
output. The impossibility of WOTRO has the following consequences. First, we show the black-box
impossibility of a quantum Fiat-Shamir transform, extending the impossibility result of Bitansky
et al. (TCC '13) to the CRQS model. Second, we show a black-box impossibility result for a strenghtened
version of quantum lightning (Zhandry, Eurocrypt '19) where quantum bolts have an additional parameter
that cannot be changed without generating new bolts.

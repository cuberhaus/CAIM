Recently, the boosting growth of computation-heavy applications raises great challenges for
the Fifth Generation (5G) and future wireless networks. As responding, the hybrid edge and cloud
computing (ECC) system has been expected as a promising solution to handle the increasing computational
applications with low-latency and on-demand services of computation offloading, which requires
new computing resource sharing and access control technology paradigms. This work establishes
a software-defined networking (SDN) based architecture for edge/cloud computing services in
5G heterogeneous networks (HetNets), which can support efficient and on-demand computing resource
management to optimize resource utilization and satisfy the time-varying computational tasks
uploaded by user devices. In addition, resulting from the information incompleteness, we design
an evolutionary game based service selection for users, which can model the replicator dynamics
of service subscription. Based on this dynamic access model, a Stackelberg differential game based
cloud computing resource sharing mechanism is proposed to facilitate the resource trading between
the cloud computing service provider (CCP) and different edge computing service providers (ECPs).
Then we derive the optimal pricing and allocation strategies of cloud computing resource based
on the replicator dynamics of users' service selection. These strategies can promise the maximum
integral utilities to all computing service providers (CPs), meanwhile the user distribution
can reach the evolutionary stable state at this Stackelberg equilibrium. Furthermore, simulation
results validate the performance of the designed resource sharing mechanism, and reveal the convergence
and equilibrium states of user selection, and computing resource pricing and allocation.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) is an enlargement in the lower part of the main artery Aorta by 1.5
times its normal diameter. AAA can cause death if rupture occurs. Elective surgeries are recommended
to prevent rupture based on geometrical measurements of AAA diameter and diameter growth rate.
Reliability of these geometric parameters to predict the AAA rupture risk has been questioned,
and biomechanical assessment has been proposed to distinguish between patients with high and low
risk of rupture. Stress in aneurysm wall is the main variable of interest in such assessment. Most
studies use finite element method to compute AAA stress. This requires discretising patient-specific
geometry (aneurysm wall and intraluminal thrombus ILT) into finite elements/meshes. Tetrahedral
elements are most commonly used as they can be generated in seemingly automated and effortless way.
In practice, however, due to complex aneurysm geometry, the process tends to require time consuming
mesh optimisation to ensure sufficiently high quality of tetrahedral elements. Furthermore,
ensuring solution convergence requires large number of tetrahedral elements, which leads to long
computation times. In this study, we focus on generation of hexahedral meshes as they are known to
provide converged solution for smaller number of elements than tetrahedral meshes. Generation
of hexahedral meshes for continua with complex/irregular geometry, such as aneurysms, requires
analyst interaction. We propose a procedure for generating high quality patient-specific hexahedral
discretisation of aneurysm wall using the algorithms available in commercial software package
for mesh generation. For aneurysm cases, we demonstrate that the procedure facilitates patient-specific
mesh generation within timeframe consistent with clinical workflow constraints while requiring
only limited input from the analyst.

Federated learning (FL), enabling different medical institutions or clients to train a model collaboratively
without data privacy leakage, has drawn great attention in medical imaging communities recently.
Though inter-client data heterogeneity has been thoroughly studied, the class imbalance problem
due to the existence of rare diseases still is under-explored. In this paper, we propose a novel FL
framework FedRare for medical image classification especially on dealing with data heterogeneity
with the existence of rare diseases. In FedRare, each client trains a model locally to extract highly-separable
latent features for classification via intra-client supervised contrastive learning. Considering
the limited data on rare diseases, we build positive sample queues for augmentation (i.e. data re-sampling).
The server in FedRare would collect the latent features from clients and automatically select the
most reliable latent features as guidance sent back to clients. Then, each client is jointly trained
by an inter-client contrastive loss to align its latent features to the federated latent features
of full classes. In this way, the parameter/feature variances across clients are effectively minimized,
leading to better convergence and performance improvements. Experimental results on the publicly-available
dataset for skin lesion diagnosis demonstrate FedRare's superior performance. Under the 10-client
federated setting where four clients have no rare disease samples, FedRare achieves an average
increase of 9.60% and 5.90% in balanced accuracy compared to the baseline framework FedAvg and the
state-of-the-art approach FedIRM respectively. Considering the board existence of rare diseases
in clinical scenarios, we believe FedRare would benefit future FL framework design for medical
image classification. The source code of this paper is publicly available at https://github.com/wnn2000/FedRare.

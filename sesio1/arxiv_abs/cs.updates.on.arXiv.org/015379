To improve the dynamic response performance of wave code communication in intelligent layered
water injection of oilfield, this paper proposes an output optimal fusion control method based
on MPC-PID. Firstly, depending on the well structure and the flow-pressure characteristics of
the layer, the steady-state model between the differential pressure and flow of the whole well and
different layer sections is established for layered water injection, and the corresponding wave
code amplitude at the steady-state operating point of different layer sections is solved, the numerical
calculation verifies that the increase of the nozzle opening in a single layer section will drive
the pressure and flow curve of the whole well downward. Secondly, combining the dynamic response
characteristics and steady-state model of the whole-well water distribution equipment, a dynamic
model of layered intelligent water injection is established, and the generation process of the
wave code is defined; Finally, the MPC-PID optimal fusion control algorithm structure is designed
to derive the fusion control law that minimizes the cost function under fixed weights, , and the optimal
weights are calculated by combining the internal model structure of controller, so the optimization
performance of each algorithm in the optimal fusion control is balanced. By analyzing the control
simulation results, the fast response characteristics of the fusion control method are verified.
Meanwhile, the simulation comparison experiments of fast wave code communication under different
methods are conducted with the actual working conditions, the results show that the fusion control
method has both fast tracking control capability and strong robustness, which effectively enhances
the efficiency of wave code communication and shortens the wave code operation time.

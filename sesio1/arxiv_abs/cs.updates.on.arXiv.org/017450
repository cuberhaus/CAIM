Among various aspects in optical network architectures, handling transit traffic at intermediate
nodes represents a defining characteristic for classification. In this context, the transition
from the first generation of optical-electrical-optical (O-E-O) mode to the second generation
of optical-bypass marked a paradigm shift in redesigning optical transport networks towards greater
network efficiency. Optical-bypass operation has then become the \textit{de facto} approach
adopted by the majority of carriers in both metro and backbone networks in the last two decades and
has remained basically unchanged. However, in optical-bypass network, the fact that in-transit
lightpaths crossing a common intermediate node must be separated in either time, frequency or spatial
domain to avoid adversarial interference appears to be a critical shortcoming as the interaction
of such lightpaths in optical domain may result in efficient computing and/or signal processing
operations for saving spectral resources. Inspired by the accelerated progresses in optical signal
processing technologies and the integration of computing and communications, we introduce in
this paper a new architectural paradigm for future optical networks and highlight how this new architecture
has the potential to shatter the \textit{status quo}. Indeed, our proposal is centered on exploiting
the superposition of in-transit lightpaths at intermediate nodes to generate more spectrally
efficient lightpaths and how to harness this opportunity from network design perspectives. We
present two case studies featuring optical aggregation and optical XOR encoding to demonstrate
the merit of optical-processing-enabled operation compared to its counterpart, optical-bypass.
Numerical results on realistic network typologies are provided, revealing that a spectral saving
up to $30\%$ could be achieved thanks to adopting optical-processing network.

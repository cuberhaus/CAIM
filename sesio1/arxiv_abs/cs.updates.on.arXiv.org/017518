These are the proceedings of the first teacher training of the Erasmus+ project No. 2020-1-PT01-KA203-078646
-- Sustrainable. The full title of this project is Promoting Sustainability as a Fundamental Driver
in Software Development Training and Education and the interested reader may know more about it
at: https://sustrainable.github.io The flagship contribution is the organization of two summer
schools on sustainable software production. The first summer school is moved due to the Corona pandemic.
It is now scheduled for July 2022 in Rijeka, Croatia. This summer school will consist of lectures
and practical work for master and PhD students in the area of computing science and closely related
fields. There will be contributions from Plovdiv University, University of Ko\v{s}ice, University
of Coimbra, University of Minho, E\"otv\"os Lor\'and University, University of Rijeka, Radboud
University Nijmegen, University of Pula, University of Amsterdam and Babe\c{s}-Bolyai University.
To prepare and streamline this summer school, the consortium organized a teacher training in Nijmegen,
the Netherlands. This was an event of five full days on November 1-5, 2022 organized by Ingrid Berenbroek,
Mart Lubbers and Pieter Koopman on the campus of the Radboud University Nijmegen, The Netherlands.
Sustainability is one of the themes within the strategy of the Radboud University called `A Significant
Impact', see https://www.ru.nl/sustainability/organisation/radboud-sustainable/. Sustainability
plays an important role in education, research, and management. The contributions were reviewed
and give a good overview of what can be expected from the summer school. Based on these papers and the
very positive and constructive atmosphere, we expect a high quality and pleasant summer school.
We are looking forward to contributing to a sustainable future.

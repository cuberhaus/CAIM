Objective: Leveraging machine learning methods, we aim to extract both explicit and implicit cause-effect
associations in patient-reported, diabetes-related tweets and provide a tool to better understand
opinion, feelings and observations shared within the diabetes online community from a causality
perspective. Materials and Methods: More than 30 million diabetes-related tweets in English were
collected between April 2017 and January 2021. Deep learning and natural language processing methods
were applied to focus on tweets with personal and emotional content. A cause-effect-tweet dataset
was manually labeled and used to train 1) a fine-tuned Bertweet model to detect causal sentences
containing a causal association 2) a CRF model with BERT based features to extract possible cause-effect
associations. Causes and effects were clustered in a semi-supervised approach and visualised
in an interactive cause-effect-network. Results: Causal sentences were detected with a recall
of 68% in an imbalanced dataset. A CRF model with BERT based features outperformed a fine-tuned BERT
model for cause-effect detection with a macro recall of 68%. This led to 96,676 sentences with cause-effect
associations. "Diabetes" was identified as the central cluster followed by "Death" and "Insulin".
Insulin pricing related causes were frequently associated with "Death". Conclusions: A novel
methodology was developed to detect causal sentences and identify both explicit and implicit,
single and multi-word cause and corresponding effect as expressed in diabetes-related tweets
leveraging BERT-based architectures and visualised as cause-effect-network. Extracting causal
associations on real-life, patient reported outcomes in social media data provides a useful complementary
source of information in diabetes research.

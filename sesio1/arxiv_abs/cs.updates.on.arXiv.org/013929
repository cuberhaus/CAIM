This article offers a new perspective for the mechanics of solids using moving Cartan's frame, specifically
discussing a mixed variational principle in non-linear elasticity. We treat quantities defined
on the co-tangent bundles of reference and deformed configurations as additional unknowns. Such
a treatment invites compatibility of the fields with base-space (configurations of the body),
so that the configuration can be realised as a subset of the Euclidean space. We first rewrite the
metric and connection using differential forms, which are further utilised to write the deformation
gradient and Cauchy-Green deformation tensor in terms of frame and co-frame fields. The geometric
understanding of stress as a co-vector valued 2-form fits squarely within our overall program.
We show that, for a hyperelastic solid, an equation similar to the Doyle-Erciksen formula may be
written for the co-vector part of stress. Using these, we write a mixed energy functional in terms
of differential forms, whose extremum leads to the compatibility of deformation, constitutive
rules and equations of equilibrium. Finite element exterior calculus is then utilised to construct
a finite dimensional approximation for the differential forms appearing in the variational principle.
These approximations are then used to construct a discrete functional which is then numerically
extremised. This discertization leads to a mixed method as it uses independent approximations
for differential forms related to stress and deformation gradient. The mixed variational principle
is then specialized for 2D case, whose discrete approximation is applied to problems in nonlinear
elasticity. An important feature of our FE technique is the lack of additional stabilization. From
the numerical study, it is found that the present discretization also does not suffer form locking
and related convergence issues.

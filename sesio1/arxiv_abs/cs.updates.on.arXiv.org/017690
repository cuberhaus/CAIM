Contemporary concerns over the governance of technological systems often run up against narratives
about the technical infeasibility of designing mechanisms for accountability. While in recent
AI ethics literature these concerns have been deliberated predominantly in relation to ML, other
instances in computing history also presented circumstances in which computer scientists needed
to un-muddle what it means to design accountable systems. One such compelling narrative can be found
in canonical histories of the Internet that highlight how its original designers' commitment to
the "End-to-End" architectural principle precluded other features from being implemented, resulting
in the fast-growing, generative, but ultimately unaccountable network we have today. This paper
offers a critique of such technologically essentialist notions of accountability and the characterization
of the "unaccountable Internet" as an unintended consequence. It explores the changing meaning
of accounting and its relationship to accountability in a selected corpus of requests for comments
(RFCs) concerning the early Internet's design from the 1970s and 80s. We characterize four ways
of conceptualizing accounting: as billing, as measurement, as management, and as policy, and demonstrate
how an understanding of accountability was constituted through these shifting meanings. We link
together the administrative and technical mechanisms of accounting for shared resources in a distributed
system and an emerging notion of accountability as a social, political, and technical category,
arguing that the former is constitutive of the latter. Recovering this history is not only important
for understanding the processes that shaped the Internet, but also serves as a starting point for
unpacking the complicated political choices that are involved in designing accountability mechanisms
for other technological systems today.

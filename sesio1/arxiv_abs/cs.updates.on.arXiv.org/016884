Suitable reduced order models (ROMs) are computationally efficient tools in characterizing key
dynamical and statistical features of nature. In this paper, a systematic multiscale stochastic
ROM framework is developed for complex systems with strong chaotic or turbulent behavior. The new
ROMs are fundamentally different from the traditional Galerkin ROM (G-ROM) or those deterministic
ROMs that aim at minimizing the path-wise errors and applying mainly to laminar systems. Here, the
new ROM focuses on recovering the large-scale dynamics to the maximum extent while it also exploits
cheap but effective conditional linear functions as the closure terms to capture the statistical
features of the medium-scale variables and its feedback to the large scales. In addition, physics
constraints are incorporated into the new ROM. One unique feature of the resulting ROM is that it
facilitates an efficient and accurate scheme for nonlinear data assimilation, the solution of
which is provided by closed analytic formulae. Such an analytic solvable data assimilation solution
significantly accelerates the computational efficiency and allows the new ROM to avoid many potential
numerical and sampling issues in recovering the unobserved states from partial observations.
The overall model calibration is efficient and systematic via explicit mathematical formulae.
The new ROM framework is applied to complex nonlinear systems, in which the intrinsic turbulent
behavior is either triggered by external random forcing or deterministic nonlinearity. It is shown
that the new ROM significantly outperforms the G-ROM in both scenarios in terms of reproducing the
dynamical and statistical features as well as recovering unobserved states via the associated
efficient data assimilation scheme.

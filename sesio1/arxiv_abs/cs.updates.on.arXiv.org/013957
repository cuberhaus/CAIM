A machine intelligence pipeline usually consists of six components: problem, representation,
model, loss, optimizer and metric. Researchers have worked hard trying to automate many components
of the pipeline. However, one key component of the pipeline--problem definition--is still left
mostly unexplored in terms of automation. Usually, it requires extensive efforts from domain experts
to identify, define and formulate important problems in an area. However, automatically discovering
research or application problems for an area is beneficial since it helps to identify valid and potentially
important problems hidden in data that are unknown to domain experts, expand the scope of tasks that
we can do in an area, and even inspire completely new findings. This paper describes Problem Learning,
which aims at learning to discover and define valid and ethical problems from data or from the machine's
interaction with the environment. We formalize problem learning as the identification of valid
and ethical problems in a problem space and introduce several possible approaches to problem learning.
In a broader sense, problem learning is an approach towards the free will of intelligent machines.
Currently, machines are still limited to solving the problems defined by humans, without the ability
or flexibility to freely explore various possible problems that are even unknown to humans. Though
many machine learning techniques have been developed and integrated into intelligent systems,
they still focus on the means rather than the purpose in that machines are still solving human defined
problems. However, proposing good problems is sometimes even more important than solving problems,
because a good problem can help to inspire new ideas and gain deeper understandings. The paper also
discusses the ethical implications of problem learning under the background of Responsible AI.

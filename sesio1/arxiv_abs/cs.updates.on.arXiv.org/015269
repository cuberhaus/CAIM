Facing the difficulty of expensive and trivial data collection and annotation, how to make a deep
learning-based short-term voltage stability assessment (STVSA) model work well on a small training
dataset is a challenging and urgent problem. Although a big enough dataset can be directly generated
by contingency simulation, this data generation process is usually cumbersome and inefficient;
while data augmentation provides a low-cost and efficient way to artificially inflate the representative
and diversified training datasets with label preserving transformations. In this respect, this
paper proposes a novel deep-learning intelligent system incorporating data augmentation for
STVSA of power systems. First, due to the unavailability of reliable quantitative criteria to judge
the stability status for a specific power system, semi-supervised cluster learning is leveraged
to obtain labeled samples in an original small dataset. Second, to make deep learning applicable
to the small dataset, conditional least squares generative adversarial networks (LSGAN)-based
data augmentation is introduced to expand the original dataset via artificially creating additional
valid samples. Third, to extract temporal dependencies from the post-disturbance dynamic trajectories
of a system, a bi-directional gated recurrent unit with attention mechanism based assessment model
is established, which bi-directionally learns the significant time dependencies and automatically
allocates attention weights. The test results demonstrate the presented approach manages to achieve
better accuracy and a faster response time with original small datasets. Besides classification
accuracy, this work employs statistical measures to comprehensively examine the performance
of the proposal.

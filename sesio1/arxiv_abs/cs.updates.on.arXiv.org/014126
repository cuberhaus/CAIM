Most people struggle with prioritizing work. While inexact heuristics have been developed over
time, there is still no tractable principled algorithm for deciding which of the many possible tasks
one should tackle in any given day, month, week, or year. Additionally, some people suffer from cognitive
biases such as the present bias, leading to prioritization of their immediate experience over long-term
consequences which manifests itself as procrastination and inefficient task prioritization.
Our method utilizes optimal gamification to help people overcome these problems by incentivizing
each task by a number of points that convey how valuable it is in the long-run. We extend the previous
version of our optimal gamification method with added services for helping people decide which
tasks should and should not be done when there is not enough time to do everything. To improve the efficiency
and scalability of the to-do list solver, we designed a hierarchical procedure that tackles the
problem from the top-level goals to fine-grained tasks. We test the accuracy of the incentivised
to-do list by comparing the performance of the strategy with the points computed exactly using Value
Iteration for a variety of case studies. These case studies were specifically designed to cover
the corner cases to get an accurate judge of performance. Our method yielded the same performance
as the exact method for all case studies. To demonstrate its functionality, we released an API that
makes it easy to deploy our method in Web and app services. We assessed the scalability of our method
by applying it to to-do lists with increasingly larger numbers of goals, sub-goals per goal, hierarchically
nested levels of subgoals. We found that the method provided through our API is able to tackle fairly
large to-do lists having a 576 tasks. This indicates that our method is suitable for real-world applications.

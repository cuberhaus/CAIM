Hybrid methods have been shown to outperform pure statistical and pure deep learning methods at
both forecasting tasks, and at quantifying the uncertainty associated with those forecasts (prediction
intervals). One example is Multivariate Exponential Smoothing Long Short-Term Memory (MES-LSTM),
a hybrid between a multivariate statistical forecasting model and a Recurrent Neural Network variant,
Long Short-Term Memory. It has also been shown that a model that ($i$) produces accurate forecasts
and ($ii$) is able to quantify the associated predictive uncertainty satisfactorily, can be successfully
adapted to a model suitable for anomaly detection tasks. With the increasing ubiquity of multivariate
data and new application domains, there have been numerous anomaly detection methods proposed
in recent years. The proposed methods have largely focused on deep learning techniques, which are
prone to suffer from challenges such as ($i$) large sets of parameters that may be computationally
intensive to tune, $(ii)$ returning too many false positives rendering the techniques impractical
for use, $(iii)$ requiring labeled datasets for training which are often not prevalent in real life,
and ($iv$) understanding of the root causes of anomaly occurrences inhibited by the predominantly
black-box nature of deep learning methods. In this article, an extension of MES-LSTM is presented,
an interpretable anomaly detection model that overcomes these challenges. With a focus on renewable
energy generation as an application domain, the proposed approach is benchmarked against the state-of-the-art.
The findings are that MES-LSTM anomaly detector is at least competitive to the benchmarks at anomaly
detection tasks, and less prone to learning from spurious effects than the benchmarks, thus making
it more reliable at root cause discovery and explanation.

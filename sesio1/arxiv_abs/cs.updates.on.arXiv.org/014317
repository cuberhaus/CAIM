Structures matter in single image super-resolution (SISR). Benefiting from generative adversarial
networks (GANs), recent studies have promoted the development of SISR by recovering photo-realistic
images. However, there are still undesired structural distortions in the recovered images. In
this paper, we propose a structure-preserving super-resolution (SPSR) method to alleviate the
above issue while maintaining the merits of GAN-based methods to generate perceptual-pleasant
details. Firstly, we propose SPSR with gradient guidance (SPSR-G) by exploiting gradient maps
of images to guide the recovery in two aspects. On the one hand, we restore high-resolution gradient
maps by a gradient branch to provide additional structure priors for the SR process. On the other
hand, we propose a gradient loss to impose a second-order restriction on the super-resolved images,
which helps generative networks concentrate more on geometric structures. Secondly, since the
gradient maps are handcrafted and may only be able to capture limited aspects of structural information,
we further extend SPSR-G by introducing a learnable neural structure extractor (NSE) to unearth
richer local structures and provide stronger supervision for SR. We propose two self-supervised
structure learning methods, contrastive prediction and solving jigsaw puzzles, to train the NSEs.
Our methods are model-agnostic, which can be potentially used for off-the-shelf SR networks. Experimental
results on five benchmark datasets show that the proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art
perceptual-driven SR methods under LPIPS, PSNR, and SSIM metrics. Visual results demonstrate
the superiority of our methods in restoring structures while generating natural SR images. Code

We introduce new features in the MathPartner service that have recently become available to users.
We highlight the functions for calculating both arithmetic-geometric mean and geometric-harmonic
mean. They allow calculating complete elliptic integrals of the first kind. They are useful for
solving many physics problems, for example, one can calculate the period of a simple pendulum. Next,
one can calculate the modified arithmetic-geometric mean proposed by Semjon Adlaj. Consequently,
one can calculate the complete elliptic integrals of the second kind as well as the circumference
of an ellipse. Furthermore, one can also calculate the Sylvester matrices of the first and the second
kind. Thus, by means of a few strings, one can calculate the resultant of two polynomials as well as
the discriminant of a binary form. Some new matrix functions are also added. So, today the list of
matrix functions includes the transpose, adjugate, conjugate, inverse, generalized inverse,
and pseudo inverse of a matrix, the matrix determinant, the kernel, the echelon form, the characteristic
polynomial, the Bruhat decomposition, the triangular LSU decomposition, which is an exact block
recursive LU decomposition, the QR block recursive decomposition, and the singular value decomposition.
In addition, two block-recursive functions have been implemented for calculating the Cholesky
decomposition of symmetric positive-definite matrices: one function for sparse matrices with
the standard multiplication algorithm and another function for dense matrices with multiplication
according to the Winograd--Strassen algorithm. The linear programming problems can be solved
too. So, the MathPartner service has become better and handy. It is freely available at this http

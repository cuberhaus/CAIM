Capturing the composition patterns of relations is a vital task in knowledge graph completion.
It also serves as a fundamental step towards multi-hop reasoning over learned knowledge. Previously,
several rotation-based translational methods have been developed to model composite relations
using the product of a series of complex-valued diagonal matrices. However, these methods tend
to make several oversimplified assumptions on the composite relations, e.g., forcing them to be
commutative, independent from entities and lacking semantic hierarchy. To systematically tackle
these problems, we have developed a novel knowledge graph embedding method, named DensE, to provide
an improved modeling scheme for the complex composition patterns of relations. In particular,
our method decomposes each relation into an SO(3) group-based rotation operator and a scaling operator
in the three dimensional (3-D) Euclidean space. This design principle leads to several advantages
of our method: (1) For composite relations, the corresponding diagonal relation matrices can be
non-commutative, reflecting a predominant scenario in real world applications; (2) Our model
preserves the natural interaction between relational operations and entity embeddings; (3) The
scaling operation provides the modeling power for the intrinsic semantic hierarchical structure
of entities; (4) The enhanced expressiveness of DensE is achieved with high computational efficiency
in terms of both parameter size and training time; and (5) Modeling entities in Euclidean space instead
of quaternion space keeps the direct geometrical interpretations of relational patterns. Experimental
results on multiple benchmark knowledge graphs show that DensE outperforms the current state-of-the-art
models for missing link prediction, especially on composite relations.

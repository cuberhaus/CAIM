This work presents a solution to the adaptive tracking control of Euler Lagrange systems with guaranteed
tracking and parameter estimation error convergence. Specifically a concurrent learning based
update rule fused by the filtered version of the desired system dynamics in conjunction with a desired
state based regression matrix has been utilized to ensure that both the position tracking error
and parameter estimation error terms converge to origin exponentially. As the regression matrix
used in proposed controller makes use of the desired versions of the system states, an initial, sufficiently
exciting memory stack can be formed from the knowledge of the desired system trajectory a priori,
thus removing the initial excitation condition required for the previously proposed concurrent
learning based controllers in the literature. The output feedback versions of the proposed method
where only the position measurements are available for the controller design, (for both gradient
and composite type adaptions) are also presented in order to illustrate the modularity of the proposed
method. The stability and boundedness of the closed loop signals for all the proposed controllers
are ensured via Lyapunov based analysis. %Trajectory tracking control of a class of fully actuated
Euler Lagrange systems is considered in this work. System dynamics is considered to be subject to
parametric uncertainties and on--line identification uncertain model parameters is also aimed.
When compared with the relevant past research, via a novel approach, desired states are proposed
to be used in forming the regression matrix and a desired compensation based concurrent learning
type adaptive update rule is designed. Via utilizing novel Lyapunov analysis, semi--global exponential
convergence of both tracking and parameter identification error to the origin is ensured.

To improve the viewer's Quality of Experience (QoE) and optimize computer graphics applications,
3D model quality assessment (3D-QA) has become an important task in the multimedia area. Point cloud
and mesh are the two most widely used digital representation formats of 3D models, the visual quality
of which is quite sensitive to lossy operations like simplification and compression. Therefore,
many related studies such as point cloud quality assessment (PCQA) and mesh quality assessment
(MQA) have been carried out to measure the visual quality degradations of 3D models. However, a large
part of previous studies utilize full-reference (FR) metrics, which indicates they can not predict
the quality level with the absence of the reference 3D model. Furthermore, few 3D-QA metrics consider
color information, which significantly restricts their effectiveness and scope of application.
In this paper, we propose a no-reference (NR) quality assessment metric for colored 3D models represented
by both point cloud and mesh. First, we project the 3D models from 3D space into quality-related geometry
and color feature domains. Then, the 3D natural scene statistics (3D-NSS) and entropy are utilized
to extract quality-aware features. Finally, machine learning is employed to regress the quality-aware
features into visual quality scores. Our method is validated on the colored point cloud quality
assessment database (SJTU-PCQA), the Waterloo point cloud assessment database (WPC), and the
colored mesh quality assessment database (CMDM). The experimental results show that the proposed
method outperforms most compared NR 3D-QA metrics with competitive computational resources and
greatly reduces the performance gap with the state-of-the-art FR 3D-QA metrics. The code of the
proposed model is publicly available now to facilitate further research.

We propose 2D Piezoelectric FET (PeFET) based compute-enabled non-volatile memory for ternary
deep neural networks (DNNs). PeFETs consist of a material with ferroelectric and piezoelectric
properties coupled with Transition Metal Dichalcogenide channel. We utilize (a) ferroelectricity
to store binary bits (0/1) in the form of polarization (-P/+P) and (b) polarization dependent piezoelectricity
to read the stored state by means of strain-induced bandgap change in Transition Metal Dichalcogenide
channel. The unique read mechanism of PeFETs enables us to expand the traditional association of
+P (-P) with low (high) resistance states to their dual high (low) resistance depending on read voltage.
Specifically, we demonstrate that +P (-P) stored in PeFETs can be dynamically configured in (a)
a low (high) resistance state for positive read voltages and (b) their dual high (low) resistance
states for negative read voltages, without afflicting a read disturb. Such a feature, which we name
as Polarization Preserved Piezoelectric Effect Reversal with Dual Voltage Polarity (PiER), is
unique to PeFETs and has not been shown in hitherto explored memories. We leverage PiER to propose
a Strain-enabled Ternary Precision Computation-in-Memory (STeP-CiM) cell with capabilities
of computing the scalar product of the stored weight and input, both of which are represented with
signed ternary precision. Further, using multi word-line assertion of STeP-CiM cells, we achieve
massively parallel computation of dot products of signed ternary inputs and weights. Our array
level analysis shows 91% lower delay and improvements of 15% and 91% in energy for in-memory multiply-and-accumulate
operations compared to near-memory design approaches based on SRAM and PeFET respectively. STeP-CiM
exhibits upto 8.91x improvement in performance and 6.07x average improvement in energy over SRAM/PeFET
based near-memory design.

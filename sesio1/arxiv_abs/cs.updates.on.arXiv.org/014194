Cities are complex products of human culture, characterised by a startling diversity of visible
traits. Their form is constantly evolving, reflecting changing human needs and local contingencies,
manifested in space by many urban patterns. Urban Morphology laid the foundation for understanding
many such patterns, largely relying on qualitative research methods to extract distinct spatial
identities of urban areas. However, the manual, labour-intensive and subjective nature of such
approaches represents an impediment to the development of a scalable, replicable and data-driven
urban form characterisation. Recently, advances in Geographic Data Science and the availability
of digital mapping products, open the opportunity to overcome such limitations. And yet, our current
capacity to systematically capture the heterogeneity of spatial patterns remains limited in terms
of spatial parameters included in the analysis and hardly scalable due to the highly labour-intensive
nature of the task. In this paper, we present a method for numerical taxonomy of urban form derived
from biological systematics, which allows the rigorous detection and classification of urban
types. Initially, we produce a rich numerical characterisation of urban space from minimal data
input, minimizing limitations due to inconsistent data quality and availability. These are street
network, building footprint, and morphological tessellation, a spatial unit derivative of Voronoi
tessellation, obtained from building footprints. Hence, we derive homogeneous urban tissue types
and, by determining overall morphological similarity between them, generate a hierarchical classification
of urban form. After framing and presenting the method, we test it on two cities - Prague and Amsterdam
- and discuss potential applications and further developments.

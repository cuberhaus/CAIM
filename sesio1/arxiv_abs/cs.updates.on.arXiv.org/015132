Existing disentangled-based methods for generalizable person re-identification aim at directly
disentangling person representations into domain-relevant interference and identity-relevant
feature. However, they ignore that some crucial characteristics are stubbornly entwined in both
the domain-relevant interference and identity-relevant feature, which are intractable to decompose
in an unsupervised manner. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Calibrated Feature Decomposition
(CFD) module that focuses on improving the generalization capacity for person re-identification
through a more judicious feature decomposition and reinforcement strategy. Specifically, a calibrated-and-standardized
Batch normalization (CSBN) is designed to learn calibrated person representation by jointly exploring
intra-domain calibration and inter-domain standardization of multi-source domain features.
CSBN restricts instance-level inconsistency of feature distribution for each domain and captures
intrinsic domain-level specific statistics. The calibrated person representation is subtly
decomposed into the identity-relevant feature, domain feature, and the remaining entangled one.
For enhancing the generalization ability and ensuring high discrimination of the identity-relevant
feature, a calibrated instance normalization (CIN) is introduced to enforce discriminative id-relevant
information, and filter out id-irrelevant information, and meanwhile the rich complementary
clues from the remaining entangled feature are further employed to strengthen it. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the strong generalization capability of our framework. Our models empowered by CFD
modules significantly outperform the state-of-the-art domain generalization approaches on
multiple widely-used benchmarks. Code will be made public: https://github.com/zkcys001/CFD.

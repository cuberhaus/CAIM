This proposes a novel ensemble deep learning-based model to accurately classify, detect and localize
different defect categories for aggressive pitches and thin resists (High NA applications).In
particular, we train RetinaNet models using different ResNet, VGGNet architectures as backbone
and present the comparison between the accuracies of these models and their performance analysis
on SEM images with different types of defect patterns such as bridge, break and line collapses. Finally,
we propose a preference-based ensemble strategy to combine the output predictions from different
models in order to achieve better performance on classification and detection of defects. As CDSEM
images inherently contain a significant level of noise, detailed feature information is often
shadowed by noise. For certain resist profiles, the challenge is also to differentiate between
a microbridge, footing, break, and zones of probable breaks. Therefore, we have applied an unsupervised
machine learning model to denoise the SEM images to remove the False-Positive defects and optimize
the effect of stochastic noise on structured pixels for better metrology and enhanced defect inspection.
We repeated the defect inspection step with the same trained model and performed a comparative analysis
for "robustness" and "accuracy" metric with conventional approach for both noisy/denoised image
pair. The proposed ensemble method demonstrates improvement of the average precision metric (mAP)
of the most difficult defect classes. In this work we have developed a novel robust supervised deep
learning training scheme to accurately classify as well as localize different defect types in SEM
images with high degree of accuracy. Our proposed approach demonstrates its effectiveness both
quantitatively and qualitatively.

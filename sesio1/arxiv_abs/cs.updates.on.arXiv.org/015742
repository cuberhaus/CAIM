Numerical models based on physics represent the state-of-the-art in earth system modeling and
comprise our best tools for generating insights and predictions. Despite rapid growth in computational
power, the perceived need for higher model resolutions overwhelms the latest-generation computers,
reducing the ability of modelers to generate simulations for understanding parameter sensitivities
and characterizing variability and uncertainty. Thus, surrogate models are often developed to
capture the essential attributes of the full-blown numerical models. Recent successes of machine
learning methods, especially deep learning, across many disciplines offer the possibility that
complex nonlinear connectionist representations may be able to capture the underlying complex
structures and nonlinear processes in earth systems. A difficult test for deep learning-based
emulation, which refers to function approximation of numerical models, is to understand whether
they can be comparable to traditional forms of surrogate models in terms of computational efficiency
while simultaneously reproducing model results in a credible manner. A deep learning emulation
that passes this test may be expected to perform even better than simple models with respect to capturing
complex processes and spatiotemporal dependencies. Here we examine, with a case study in satellite-based
remote sensing, the hypothesis that deep learning approaches can credibly represent the simulations
from a surrogate model with comparable computational efficiency. Our results are encouraging
in that the deep learning emulation reproduces the results with acceptable accuracy and often even
faster performance. We discuss the broader implications of our results in light of the pace of improvements
in high-performance implementations of deep learning as well as the growing desire for higher-resolution
simulations in the earth sciences.

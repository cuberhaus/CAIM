Building a successful community means governing active populations and limited resources. This
challenge often requires communities to design formal governance systems from scratch. But the
characteristics of successful institutional designs are unclear. Communities that are more mature
and established may have more elaborate formal policy systems. Alternatively, they may require
less formalization precisely because of their maturity. Indeed, scholars often downplay the role
that formal rules relative to unwritten rules, norms, and values. But in a community with formal
rules, decisions are more consistent, transparent, and legitimate. To understand the relationship
of formal institutions to community maturity and governance style, we conduct a large-scale quantitative
analysis applying institutional analysis frameworks of self-governance scholar Elinor Ostrom
to 80,000 communities across 3 platforms: the sandbox game Minecraft, the MMO game World of Warcraft,
and Reddit. We classify communities' written rules to test predictors of institutional formalization.
From this analysis we extract two major findings. First, institutional formalization, the size
and complexity of an online community's governance system, is generally positively associated
with maturity, as measured by age, population size, or degree of user engagement. Second, we find
that online communities employ similar governance styles across platforms, strongly favoring
"weak" norms to "strong" requirements. These findings suggest that designers and founders of online
communities converge on styles of governance practice that are correlated with successful self-governance.
With deeper insights into the patterns of successful self-governance, we can help more communities
overcome the challenges of self-governance and create for their members powerful experiences
of shared meaning and collective empowerment.

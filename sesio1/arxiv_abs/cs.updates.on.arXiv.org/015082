Software developers often look for solutions to their code-level problems using the Stack Overflow
Q&A website. To receive help, developers frequently submit questions containing sample code segments
and the description of the programming issue. Unfortunately, it is not always possible to reproduce
the issues from the code segments that may impede questions from receiving prompt and appropriate
solutions. We conducted an exploratory study on the reproducibility of issues discussed in 400
Java and 400 Python questions. We parsed, compiled, executed, and carefully examined the code segments
from these questions to reproduce the reported programming issues. The outcomes of our study are
three-fold. First, we found that we can reproduce approximately 68% of Java and 71% of Python issues,
whereas we were unable to reproduce approximately 22% of Java and 19% of Python issues using the code
segments. Of the issues that were reproducible, approximately 67% of the Java code segments and
20% of the Python code segments required minor or major modifications to reproduce the issues. Second,
we carefully investigated why programming issues could not be reproduced and provided evidence-based
guidelines for writing effective code examples for Stack Overflow questions. Third, we investigated
the correlation between the issue reproducibility status of questions and the corresponding answer
meta-data, such as the presence of an accepted answer. According to our analysis, a reproducible
question has at least two times higher chance of receiving an accepted answer than an irreproducible
question. Besides, the median time delay in receiving accepted answers is double if the issues reported
in questions could not be reproduced. We also investigate the confounding factors (e.g., reputation)
and find that confounding factors do not hurt the correlation between reproducibility status and
answer meta-data.

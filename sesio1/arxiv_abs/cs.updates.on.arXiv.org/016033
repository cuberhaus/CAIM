Novel and high-performance medical image classification pipelines are heavily utilizing ensemble
learning strategies. The idea of ensemble learning is to assemble diverse models or multiple predictions
and, thus, boost prediction performance. However, it is still an open question to what extent as
well as which ensemble learning strategies are beneficial in deep learning based medical image
classification pipelines. In this work, we proposed a reproducible medical image classification
pipeline for analyzing the performance impact of the following ensemble learning techniques:
Augmenting, Stacking, and Bagging. The pipeline consists of state-of-the-art preprocessing
and image augmentation methods as well as 9 deep convolution neural network architectures. It was
applied on four popular medical imaging datasets with varying complexity. Furthermore, 12 pooling
functions for combining multiple predictions were analyzed, ranging from simple statistical
functions like unweighted averaging up to more complex learning-based functions like support
vector machines. Our results revealed that Stacking achieved the largest performance gain of up
to 13% F1-score increase. Augmenting showed consistent improvement capabilities by up to 4% and
is also applicable to single model based pipelines. Cross-validation based Bagging demonstrated
to be the most complex ensemble learning method, which resulted in an F1-score decrease in all analyzed
datasets (up to -10%). Furthermore, we demonstrated that simple statistical pooling functions
are equal or often even better than more complex pooling functions. We concluded that the integration
of Stacking and Augmentation ensemble learning techniques is a powerful method for any medical
image classification pipeline to improve robustness and boost performance.

Dose volume histogram (DVH) metrics are widely accepted evaluation criteria in the clinic. However,
incorporating these metrics into deep learning dose prediction models is challenging due to their
non-convexity and non-differentiability. We propose a novel moment-based loss function for predicting
3D dose distribution for the challenging conventional lung intensity modulated radiation therapy
(IMRT) plans. The moment-based loss function is convex and differentiable and can easily incorporate
DVH metrics in any deep learning framework without computational overhead. The moments can also
be customized to reflect the clinical priorities in 3D dose prediction. For instance, using high-order
moments allows better prediction in high-dose areas for serial structures. We used a large dataset
of 360 (240 for training, 50 for validation and 70 for testing) conventional lung patients with 2Gy
$\times$ 30 fractions to train the deep learning (DL) model using clinically treated plans at our
institution. We trained a UNet like CNN architecture using computed tomography (CT), planning
target volume (PTV) and organ-at-risk contours (OAR) as input to infer corresponding voxel-wise
3D dose distribution. We evaluated three different loss functions: (1) The popular Mean Absolute
Error (MAE) Loss, (2) the recently developed MAE + DVH Loss, and (3) the proposed MAE + Moments Loss.
The quality of the predictions was compared using different DVH metrics as well as dose-score and
DVH-score, recently introduced by the AAPM knowledge-based planning grand challenge. Model with
(MAE + Moment) loss function outperformed the model with MAE loss by significantly improving the
DVH-score (11%, p$<$0.01) while having similar computational cost. It also outperformed the model
trained with (MAE+DVH) by significantly improving the computational cost (48%) and the DVH-score
(8%, p$<$0.01).

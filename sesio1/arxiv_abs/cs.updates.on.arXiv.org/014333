Intelligent data-driven fault diagnosis methods have been widely applied, but most of these methods
need a large number of high-quality labeled samples. It costs a lot of labor and time to label data
in actual industrial processes, which challenges the application of intelligent fault diagnosis
methods. To solve this problem, a multi-stage semi-supervised improved deep embedded clustering
(MS-SSIDEC) method is proposed for the bearing fault diagnosis under the insufficient labeled
samples situation. This method includes three stages: pre-training, deep clustering and enhanced
supervised learning. In the first stage, a skip-connection based convolutional auto-encoder
(SCCAE) is proposed and pre-trained to automatically learn low-dimensional representations.
In the second stage, a semi-supervised improved deep embedded clustering (SSIDEC) model that integrates
the pre-trained auto-encoder with a clustering layer is proposed for deep clustering. Additionally,
virtual adversarial training (VAT) is introduced as a regularization term to overcome the overfitting
in the model's training. In the third stage, high-quality clustering results obtained in the second
stage are assigned to unlabeled samples as pseudo labels. The labeled dataset is augmented by those
pseudo-labeled samples and used to train a bearing fault discriminative model. The effectiveness
of the method is evaluated on the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) bearing dataset. The results
show that the method can not only satisfy the semi-supervised learning under a small number of labeled
samples, but also solve the problem of unsupervised learning, and has achieved better results than
traditional diagnosis methods. This method provides a new research idea for fault diagnosis with
limited labeled samples by effectively using unsupervised data.

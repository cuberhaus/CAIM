In order to smoothly promote the establishment of scientific research projects, accurately identify
the excellent scientific research team, and intuitively and comprehensively describe the scientific
research team, it is of great significance for the scientific research management department to
comprehensively understand and objectively evaluate the scientific research team. At present,
the research work on the construction of accurate three-dimensional portrait of scientific research
team is relatively less. In view of the practical demand of scientific research management department,
this paper proposes an accurate stereo portrait generation algorithm of scientific research team.
The algorithm includes three modules: research team identification, research topic extraction
and research team portrait generation. Firstly, the leader of the scientific research team is identified
based on the iterative middle centrality ranking method, and the members of the scientific research
team are identified through the 2-faction and snowball methods, so as to realize the identification
of the scientific research team. Then, considering the statistical information of words and the
co-occurrence features of words in the research team, the research topics of the research team are
extracted to improve the accuracy of research topic extraction. Finally, the research team portrait
generation module generates the accurate three-dimensional portrait of the research team through
the generation of the research team profile, the construction of the research cooperation relationship,
and the construction of the research team topic cloud. The research team is identified on the data
set of scientific research achievements, and the accurate three-dimensional portraits of the
research team are generated and visualized. Experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed
algorithm.

Hybrid storage systems (HSS) use multiple different storage devices to provide high and scalable
storage capacity at high performance. Recent research proposes various techniques that aim to
accurately identify performance-critical data to place it in a "best-fit" storage device. Unfortunately,
most of these techniques are rigid, which (1) limits their adaptivity to perform well for a wide range
of workloads and storage device configurations, and (2) makes it difficult for designers to extend
these techniques to different storage system configurations (e.g., with a different number or
different types of storage devices) than the configuration they are designed for. We introduce
Sibyl, the first technique that uses reinforcement learning for data placement in hybrid storage
systems. Sibyl observes different features of the running workload as well as the storage devices
to make system-aware data placement decisions. For every decision it makes, Sibyl receives a reward
from the system that it uses to evaluate the long-term performance impact of its decision and continuously
optimizes its data placement policy online. We implement Sibyl on real systems with various HSS
configurations. Our results show that Sibyl provides 21.6%/19.9% performance improvement in
a performance-oriented/cost-oriented HSS configuration compared to the best previous data placement
technique. Our evaluation using an HSS configuration with three different storage devices shows
that Sibyl outperforms the state-of-the-art data placement policy by 23.9%-48.2%, while significantly
reducing the system architect's burden in designing a data placement mechanism that can simultaneously
incorporate three storage devices. We show that Sibyl achieves 80% of the performance of an oracle
policy that has complete knowledge of future access patterns while incurring a very modest storage
overhead of only 124.4 KiB.

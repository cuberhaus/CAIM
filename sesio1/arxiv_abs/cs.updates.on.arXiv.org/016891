In 2015, the United Nations developed 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with 169 targets
for a more sustainable future by 2030. This study seeks to evaluate and analyze intra- and inter-goal
SDG target interactions within the Philippine context to determine what to mitigate and what to
prioritize. To evaluate all 14196 target interactions, two methods are employed. First, experts
with over five years of SDG-related experience evaluated interactions using the 7-point scale.
Second, official indicator data is run through a Spearman rank correlation, with resulting coefficients
serving as interaction scores. Interaction scores are then interpreted to be indivisible, cancelling,
or consistent. Targets are modelled as nodes and interactions as edges. With 1256 evaluated interactions
under expert evaluation and 1914 under official indicator data, results were integrated to formulate
recommendations for concerned parties. This includes the mitigation of self-conflicting target
interactions under SDG 3 'Good Health and Well-Being' with an emphasis on targets 3.6 'Halve traffic
accident deaths' and 3.9 'Reduce pollution-related deaths'. These targets as well as 8.2 'Economic
productivity', and 16.1 'Reduce violence' also have multiple negative interactions that need
to be mitigated. Targets that reinforce their corresponding SDGs should be prioritized, including
1.1 'Eradicate extreme poverty', 1.2 'Halve poverty proportions', 3.2 'End preventable deaths',
3.5 'Prevent substance abuse', 3.9 'Reduce pollution-related deaths', 3.D 'EW risk reduction',
4.2 'Early education', 4.B 'Higher education scholarships', and 6.2 'Sanitation and hygiene'.
'Beautiful' targets (no negative interactions) should also be prioritized by score, namely, 3.D
'Early warning systems for health risks', 8.A 'Trade support aid', 15.B 'Sustainable forest management',
and 17.1 'Domestic revenue collection'.

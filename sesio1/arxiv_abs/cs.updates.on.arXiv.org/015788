Active inference is an account of cognition and behavior in complex systems which brings together
action, perception, and learning under the theoretical mantle of Bayesian inference. Active inference
has seen growing applications in academic research, especially in fields that seek to model human
or animal behavior. While in recent years, some of the code arising from the active inference literature
has been written in open source languages like Python and Julia, to-date, the most popular software
for simulating active inference agents is the DEM toolbox of SPM, a MATLAB library originally developed
for the statistical analysis and modelling of neuroimaging data. Increasing interest in active
inference, manifested both in terms of sheer number as well as diversifying applications across
scientific disciplines, has thus created a need for generic, widely-available, and user-friendly
code for simulating active inference in open-source scientific computing languages like Python.
The Python package we present here, pymdp (see https://github.com/infer-actively/pymdp), represents
a significant step in this direction: namely, we provide the first open-source package for simulating
active inference with partially-observable Markov Decision Processes or POMDPs. We review the
package's structure and explain its advantages like modular design and customizability, while
providing in-text code blocks along the way to demonstrate how it can be used to build and run active
inference processes with ease. We developed pymdp to increase the accessibility and exposure of
the active inference framework to researchers, engineers, and developers with diverse disciplinary
backgrounds. In the spirit of open-source software, we also hope that it spurs new innovation, development,
and collaboration in the growing active inference community.

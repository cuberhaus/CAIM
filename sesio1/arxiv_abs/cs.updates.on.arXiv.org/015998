It is nowadays widely acknowledged that optimal structural design should be robust with respect
to the uncertainties in loads and material parameters. However, there are several alternatives
to consider such uncertainties in structural optimization problems. This paper presents a comprehensive
comparison between the results of three different approaches to topology optimization under uncertain
loading, considering stress constraints: 1) the robust formulation, which requires only the mean
and standard deviation of stresses at each element; 2) the reliability-based formulation, which
imposes a reliability constraint on computed stresses; 3) the non-probabilistic formulation,
which considers a worst-case scenario for the stresses caused by uncertain loads. The information
required by each method, regarding the uncertain loads, and the uncertainty propagation approach
used in each case is quite different. The robust formulation requires only mean and standard deviation
of uncertain loads; stresses are computed via a first-order perturbation approach. The reliability-based
formulation requires full probability distributions of random loads, reliability constraints
are computed via a first-order performance measure approach. The non-probabilistic formulation
is applicable for bounded uncertain loads; only lower and upper bounds are used, and worst-case
stresses are computed via a nested optimization with anti-optimization. The three approaches
are quite different in the handling of uncertainties; however, the basic topology optimization
framework is the same: the traditional density approach is employed for material parameterization,
while the augmented Lagrangian method is employed to solve the resulting problem, in order to handle
the large number of stress constraints.

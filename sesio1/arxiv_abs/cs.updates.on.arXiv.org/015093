The Unlimited Sensing Framework (USF) was recently introduced to overcome the sensor saturation
bottleneck in conventional digital acquisition systems. At its core, the USF allows for high-dynamic-range
(HDR) signal reconstruction by converting a continuous-time signal into folded, low-dynamic-range
(LDR), modulo samples. HDR reconstruction is then carried out by algorithmic unfolding of the folded
samples. In hardware, however, implementing an ideal modulo folding requires careful calibration,
analog design and high precision. At the interface of theory and practice, this paper explores a
computational sampling strategy that relaxes strict hardware requirements by compensating them
via a novel, mathematically guaranteed recovery method. Our starting point is a generalized model
for USF. The generalization relies on two new parameters modeling hysteresis and folding transients}
in addition to the modulo threshold. Hysteresis accounts for the mismatch between the reset threshold
and the amplitude displacement at the folding time and we refer to a continuous transition period
in the implementation of a reset as folding transient. Both these effects are motivated by our hardware
experiments and also occur in previous, domain-specific applications. We show that the effect
of hysteresis is beneficial for the USF and we leverage it to derive the first recovery guarantees
in the context of our generalized USF model. Additionally, we show how the proposed recovery can
be directly generalized for the case of lower sampling rates. Our theoretical work is corroborated
by hardware experiments that are based on a hysteresis enabled, modulo ADC testbed comprising off-the-shelf
electronic components. Thus, by capitalizing on a collaboration between hardware and algorithms,
our paper enables an end-to-end pipeline for HDR sampling allowing more flexible hardware implementations.

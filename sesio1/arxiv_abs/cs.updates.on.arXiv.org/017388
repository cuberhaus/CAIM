In an IoT environment, which is characterized by a multitude of interconnected smart devices with
sensing and computational capabilities, many applications are (i) content-based, that is, they
are only interested in finding a given type of content rather than the location of data, and (ii) contextualized,
that is, the content is generated and consumed in the proximity of the user. In this context, the Information-Centric
Networking (ICN) paradigm is an appealing model for efficiently retrieving application data,
and the service decentralization towards the network edge helps to reduce the core network load
being the data produced by IoT devices mainly confined in the area where they are generated. MobCCN
is an ICN-based data delivery protocol that we designed for operating efficiently in such context
[1][2], where static and mobile IoT devices are enriched with ICN functions. Specifically, MobCCN
leverages an efficient routing and forwarding protocol, exploiting opportunistic contacts among
IoT mobile devices, to fill the Forwarding Interest Base (FIB) tables so as to correctly forward
Interest packets towards the intended data producers. In this paper, we aim to enhance the reliability
of MobCCN by exploring different retransmissions mechanisms, such as retransmissions based on
number of duplicate Interests that are received for the same requested content, periodic retransmissions,
single path versus disjoint multi-path forwarding, hysteresis mechanism and combinations of
them. Extensive simulation results show that, among the analysed MobCCN variants, the one that
implements both periodic retransmissions and a hysteresis-based retransmission process ensures
the highest delivery rates (up to 95\%) and the shortest network path, with a very limited traffic
overhead due to retransmissions.

While many efforts are currently devoted to vaccines development and administration, social distancing
measures, including severe restrictions such as lockdowns, remain fundamental tools to contain
the spread of COVID-19. A crucial point for any government is to understand, on the basis of the epidemic
curve, the right temporal instant to set up a lockdown and then to remove it. Different strategies
are being adopted with distinct shades of intensity. USA and Europe tend to introduce restrictions
of considerable temporal length. They vary in time: a severe lockdown may be reached and then gradually
relaxed. An interesting alternative is the Australian model where short and sharp responses have
repeatedly tackled the virus and allowed people a return to near normalcy. After a few positive cases
are detected, a lockdown is immediately set. In this paper we show that the Australian model can be
generalized and given a rigorous mathematical analysis, casting strategies of the type short-term
pain for collective gain in the context of sliding-mode control, an important branch of nonlinear
control theory. This allows us to gain important insights regarding how to implement short-term
lockdowns, obtaining a better understanding of their merits and possible limitations. Our model
predicts the duration of the severe lockdown to be set to maintain e.g. the number of people in intensive
care under a certain threshold. After tuning our strategy exploiting data collected in Italy, it
turns out that COVID-19 epidemic could be e.g. controlled by alternating one or two weeks of complete
lockdown with one or two months of freedom, respectively. Control strategies of this kind, where
the lockdown's duration is well circumscribed, could be important also to alleviate coronavirus
impact on economy.

We study a communication game between a sender and receiver where the sender has access to a set of
informative signals about a state of the world. The sender chooses one of her signals, called an ``anecdote''
and communicates it to the receiver. The receiver takes an action, yielding a utility for both players.
Sender and receiver both care about the state of the world but are also influenced by a personal preference
so that their ideal actions differ. We characterize perfect Bayesian equilibria when the sender
cannot commit to a particular communication scheme. In this setting the sender faces ``persuasion
temptation'': she is tempted to select a more biased anecdote to influence the receiver's action.
Anecdotes are still informative to the receiver but persuasion comes at the cost of precision. This
gives rise to ``informational homophily'' where the receiver prefers to listen to like-minded
senders because they provide higher-precision signals. In particular, we show that a sender with
access to many anecdotes will essentially send the minimum or maximum anecdote even though with
high probability she has access to an anecdote close to the state of the world that would almost perfectly
reveal it to the receiver. In contrast to the classic Crawford-Sobel model, full revelation is a
knife-edge equilibrium and even small differences in personal preferences will induce highly
polarized communication and a loss in utility for any equilibrium. We show that for fat-tailed anecdote
distributions the receiver might even prefer to talk to poorly informed senders with aligned preferences
rather than a knowledgeable expert whose preferences may differ from her own. We also show that under
commitment differences in personal preferences no longer affect communication and the sender
will generally report the most representative anecdote closest to the posterior mean for common
distributions.

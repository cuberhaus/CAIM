Automatically verifying the identity of a person by means of biometrics is an important application
in day-to-day activities such as accessing banking services and security control in airports.
To increase the system reliability, several biometric devices are often used. Such a combined system
is known as a multimodal biometric system. This paper reports a benchmarking study carried out within
the framework of the BioSecure DS2 (Access Control) evaluation campaign organized by the University
of Surrey, involving face, fingerprint, and iris biometrics for person authentication, targeting
the application of physical access control in a medium-size establishment with some 500 persons.
While multimodal biometrics is a well-investigated subject, there exists no benchmark for a fusion
algorithm comparison. Working towards this goal, we designed two sets of experiments: quality-dependent
and cost-sensitive evaluation. The quality-dependent evaluation aims at assessing how well fusion
algorithms can perform under changing quality of raw images principally due to change of devices.
The cost-sensitive evaluation, on the other hand, investigates how well a fusion algorithm can
perform given restricted computation and in the presence of software and hardware failures, resulting
in errors such as failure-to-acquire and failure-to-match. Since multiple capturing devices
are available, a fusion algorithm should be able to handle this nonideal but nevertheless realistic
scenario. In both evaluations, each fusion algorithm is provided with scores from each biometric
comparison subsystem as well as the quality measures of both template and query data. The response
to the call of the campaign proved very encouraging, with the submission of 22 fusion systems. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to benchmark quality-based multimodal fusion
algorithms.

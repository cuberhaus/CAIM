Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, and adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most
common subtype. Exploiting the potential value of the histopathology images can promote precision
medicine in oncology. Tissue segmentation is the basic upstream task of histopathology image analysis.
Existing deep learning models have achieved superior segmentation performance but require sufficient
pixel-level annotations, which is time-consuming and expensive. To enrich the label resources
of LUAD and to alleviate the annotation efforts, we organize this challenge WSSS4LUAD to call for
the outstanding weakly-supervised semantic segmentation techniques for histopathology images
of LUAD. Participants have to design the algorithm to segment tumor epithelial, tumor-associated
stroma and normal tissue with only patch-level labels. This challenge includes 10,091 patch-level
annotations (the training set) and over 130 million labeled pixels (the validation and test sets),
from 67 WSIs (47 from GDPH, 20 from TCGA). All the labels were generated by a pathologist-in-the-loop
pipeline with the help of AI models and checked by the label review board. Among 532 registrations,
28 teams submitted the results in the test phase with over 1,000 submissions. Finally, the first
place team achieved mIoU of 0.8413 (tumor: 0.8389, stroma: 0.7931, normal: 0.8919). According
to the technical reports of the top-tier teams, CAM is still the most popular approach in WSSS. Cutmix
data augmentation has been widely adopted to generate more reliable samples. With the success of
this challenge, we believe that WSSS approaches with patch-level annotations can replace the traditional
pixel annotations while reducing the annotation efforts. The entire dataset has been released
to encourage more researches on computational pathology in LUAD and more novel WSSS techniques.

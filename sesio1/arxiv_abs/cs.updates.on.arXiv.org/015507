Following the recent Internet of Things-induced trends on digitization in general, industrial
applications will further evolve as well. With a focus on the domains of manufacturing and production,
the Internet of Production pursues the vision of a digitized, globally interconnected, yet secure
environment by establishing a distributed knowledge base. Background. As part of our collaborative
research of advancing the scope of industrial applications through cybersecurity and privacy,
we identified a set of common challenges and pitfalls that surface in such applied interdisciplinary
collaborations. Aim. Our goal with this paper is to support researchers in the emerging field of
cybersecurity in industrial settings by formalizing our experiences as reference for other research
efforts, in industry and academia alike. Method. Based on our experience, we derived a process cycle
of performing such interdisciplinary research, from the initial idea to the eventual dissemination
and paper writing. This presented methodology strives to successfully bootstrap further research
and to encourage further work in this emerging area. Results. Apart from our newly proposed process
cycle, we report on our experiences and conduct a case study applying this methodology, raising
awareness for challenges in cybersecurity research for industrial applications. We further detail
the interplay between our process cycle and the data lifecycle in applied research data management.
Finally, we augment our discussion with an industrial as well as an academic view on this research
area and highlight that both areas still have to overcome significant challenges to sustainably
and securely advance industrial applications. Conclusions. With our proposed process cycle for
interdisciplinary research in the intersection of cybersecurity and industrial application,
we provide a foundation for further research.

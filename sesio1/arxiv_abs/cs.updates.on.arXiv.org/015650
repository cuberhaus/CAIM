To meet the growing mobility needs in intra-city transportation, the concept of urban air mobility
(UAM) has been proposed in which vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft are used to provide
a ride-hailing service. In UAM, aircraft can operate in designated air spaces known as corridors,
that link the aerodromes. A reliable communication network between GBSs and aircraft enables UAM
to adequately utilize the airspace and create a fast, efficient, and safe transportation system.
In this paper, to characterize the wireless connectivity performance for UAM, a spatial model is
proposed. For this setup, the distribution of the distance between an arbitrarily selected GBS
and its associated aircraft and the Laplace transform of the interference experienced by the GBS
are derived. Using these results, the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR)-based connectivity
probability is determined to capture the connectivity performance of the UAM aircraft-to-ground
communication network. Then, leveraging these connectivity results, a wireless-enabled asynchronous
federated learning (AFL) framework that uses a Fourier neural network is proposed to tackle the
challenging problem of turbulence prediction during UAM operations. For this AFL scheme, a staleness-aware
global aggregation scheme is introduced to expedite the convergence to the optimal turbulence
prediction model used by UAM aircraft. Simulation results validate the theoretical derivations
for the UAM wireless connectivity. The results also demonstrate that the proposed AFL framework
converges to the optimal turbulence prediction model faster than the synchronous federated learning
baselines and a staleness-free AFL approach. Furthermore, the results characterize the performance
of wireless connectivity and convergence of the aircraft's turbulence model under different parameter
settings, offering useful UAM design guidelines.

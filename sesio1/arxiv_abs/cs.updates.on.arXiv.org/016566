The goal of this study is an exploratory analysis concerning main sensor technologies applied in
cancer research to detect new directions in diagnosis and treatments. The study focused on types
of cancer having a high incidence and mortality worldwide: breast, lung, colorectal and prostate.
Data of the Web of Science (WOS) core collection database are used to retrieve articles related to
sensor technologies and cancer research over 1991-2021 period. We utilized Gephi software version
0.9.2 to visualize the co-word networks of the interaction between sensor technologies and cancers
under study. Results show main clusters of interaction per typology of cancer. Biosensor is the
only type of sensor that plays an essential role in all types of cancer: breast cancer, lung cancer,
prostate cancer, and colorectal cancer. Electrochemical sensor is applied in all types of cancer
under study except lung cancer. Electrochemical biosensor is used in breast cancer, lung cancer,
and prostate cancer research but not colorectal cancer. Optical sensor can also be considered one
of the sensor technologies that significantly is used in breast cancer, prostate cancer, and colorectal
cancer. This study shows that this type of sensor is applied in more diversified approaches. Moreover,
the oxygen sensor is mostly studied in lung cancer and breast cancer due to the usage in breath analysis
for the treatment process. Finally, Cmos sensor is a technology used mainly in lung cancer and colorectal
cancer. Results here suggest new directions for the evolution of science and technology of sensors
in cancer research to support innovation and research policy directed to new technological trajectories
having a potential of accelerated growth and positive social impact for diagnosis and treatments
of cancer.

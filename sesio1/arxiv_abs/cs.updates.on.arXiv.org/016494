This paper develops a framework that can perform denoising, dereverberation, and source separation
accurately by using a relatively small number of microphones. It has been empirically confirmed
that Independent Vector Analysis (IVA) can blindly separate N sources from their sound mixture
even with diffuse noise when a sufficiently large number (=M) of microphones are available (i.e.,
M>>N). However, the estimation accuracy seriously degrades as the number of microphones, or more
specifically M-N (>=0), decreases. To overcome this limitation of IVA, we propose switching IVA
(swIVA) in this paper. With swIVA, time frames of an observed signal with time-varying characteristics
are clustered into several groups, each of which can be well handled by IVA using a small number of
microphones, and thus accurate estimation can be achieved by applying IVA individually to each
of the groups. Conventionally, a switching mechanism was introduced into a beamformer; however,
no blind source separation algorithms with a switching mechanism have been successfully developed
until this paper. In order to incorporate dereverberation capability, this paper further extends
swIVA to blind Convolutional beamforming algorithm (swCIVA). It integrates swIVA and switching
Weighted Prediction Error-based dereverberation (swWPE) in a jointly optimal way. We show that
both swIVA and swCIVA can be optimized effectively based on blind signal processing, and that their
performance can be further improved using a spatial guide for the initialization. Experiments
show that both proposed methods largely outperform conventional IVA and its Convolutional beamforming
extension (CIVA) in terms of objective signal quality and automatic speech recognition scores
when using a relatively small number of microphones.

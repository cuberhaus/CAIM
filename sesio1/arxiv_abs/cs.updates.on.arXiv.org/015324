This review presents and reviews various solved and open problems in developing, analyzing, and
mitigating epidemic spreading processes under human decision-making. We provide a review of a
range of epidemic models and explain the pros and cons of different epidemic models. We exhibit the
art of coupling epidemic models and decision models in the existing literature. {More specifically,
we provide answers to fundamental questions in human decision-making amid epidemics, including
what interventions to take to combat the disease, who are decision-makers, when to take interventions,
and how to make interventions.} Among many decision models, game-theoretic models have become
increasingly crucial in modeling human responses/behavior amid epidemics in the last decade.
In this review, we motivate the game-theoretic approach to human decision-making amid epidemics.
This review provides an overview of the existing literature by developing a multi-dimensional
taxonomy, which categorizes existing literature based on multiple dimensions, including 1) types
of games, such as differential games, stochastic games, evolutionary games, and static games;
2) types of interventions, such as social distancing, vaccination, quarantine, taking antidotes,
etc.; 3) the types of decision-makers, such as individuals, adversaries, and central authorities
at different hierarchical levels. A fine-grained dynamic game framework is proposed to capture
the essence of game-theoretic decision-making amid epidemics. We showcase three representative
{frameworks} with unique ways of integrating game-theoretic decision-making into the epidemic
models from a vast body of literature. {Each of the three framework has a unique way of modeling, conducting
analytical analysis, and deriving results.} In the end, we identify several main open problems
and research gaps left to be addressed and filled.

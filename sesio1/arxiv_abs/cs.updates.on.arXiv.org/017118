Product market demand analysis plays a significant role for originating business strategies due
to its noticeable impact on the competitive business field. Furthermore, there are roughly 228
million native Bengali speakers, the majority of whom use Banglish text to interact with one another
on social media. Consumers are buying and evaluating items on social media with Banglish text as
social media emerges as an online marketplace for entrepreneurs. People use social media to find
preferred smartphone brands and models by sharing their positive and bad experiences with them.
For this reason, our goal is to gather Banglish text data and use sentiment analysis and named entity
identification to assess Bangladeshi market demand for smartphones in order to determine the most
popular smartphones by gender. We scraped product related data from social media with instant data
scrapers and crawled data from Wikipedia and other sites for product information with python web
scrapers. Using Python's Pandas and Seaborn libraries, the raw data is filtered using NLP methods.
To train our datasets for named entity recognition, we utilized Spacey's custom NER model, Amazon
Comprehend Custom NER. A tensorflow sequential model was deployed with parameter tweaking for
sentiment analysis. Meanwhile, we used the Google Cloud Translation API to estimate the gender
of the reviewers using the BanglaLinga library. In this article, we use natural language processing
(NLP) approaches and several machine learning models to identify the most in-demand items and services
in the Bangladeshi market. Our model has an accuracy of 87.99% in Spacy Custom Named Entity recognition,
95.51% in Amazon Comprehend Custom NER, and 87.02% in the Sequential model for demand analysis.
After Spacy's study, we were able to manage 80% of mistakes related to misspelled words using a mix
of Levenshtein distance and ratio algorithms.

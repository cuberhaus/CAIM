Dynamic graph embedding has gained great attention recently due to its capability of learning low
dimensional graph representations for complex temporal graphs with high accuracy. However, recent
advances mostly focus on learning node embeddings as deterministic "vectors" for static graphs
yet disregarding the key graph temporal dynamics and the evolving uncertainties associated with
node embedding in the latent space. In this work, we propose an efficient stochastic dynamic graph
embedding method (DynG2G) that applies an inductive feed-forward encoder trained with node triplet-based
contrastive loss. Every node per timestamp is encoded as a time-dependent probabilistic multivariate
Gaussian distribution in the latent space, hence we can quantify the node embedding uncertainty
on-the-fly. We adopted eight different benchmarks that represent diversity in size (from 96 nodes
to 87,626 and from 13,398 edges to 4,870,863) and diversity in dynamics. We demonstrate via extensive
experiments on these eight dynamic graph benchmarks that DynG2G achieves new state-of-the-art
performance in capturing the underlying temporal node embeddings. We also demonstrate that DynG2G
can predict the evolving node embedding uncertainty, which plays a crucial role in quantifying
the intrinsic dimensionality of the dynamical system over time. We obtain a universal relation
of the optimal embedding dimension, $L_o$, versus the effective dimensionality of uncertainty,
$D_u$, and we infer that $L_o=D_u$ for all cases. This implies that the uncertainty quantification
approach we employ in the DynG2G correctly captures the intrinsic dimensionality of the dynamics
of such evolving graphs despite the diverse nature and composition of the graphs at each timestamp.
Moreover, this $L_0 - D_u$ correlation provides a clear path to select adaptively the optimum embedding
size at each timestamp by setting $L \ge D_u$.

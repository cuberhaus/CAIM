The new generation of communication technologies are constantly being pushed to meet a diverse
range of user requirements such as high data rate, low power consumption, very low latency, very
high reliability and broad availability. To address all these demands, 5G radio access technologies
have been extended into a wide range of new services. However, there are still only a limited number
of applications for RF based wireless communications inside aircraft cabins that comply with the
5G vision. Potential interference and safety issues in on-board wireless communications pose
significant deployment challenges. By transforming each reading light into an optical wireless
AP, LiFi, could provide seamless on-board connectivity in dense cabin environments without RF
interference. Furthermore, the utilization of available reading lights allows for a relatively
simple, cost-effective deployment with the high energy and spectral efficiency. To successfully
implement the aeronautical cabin LiFi applications, comprehensive optical channel characterization
is required. In this paper, we propose a novel MCRT channel modelling technique to capture the details
of in-flight LiFi links. Accordingly, a realistic channel simulator, which takes the cabin models,
interior elements and measurement based optical source, receiver, surface material characteristics
into account is developed. The effect of the operation wavelength, cabin model accuracy and user
terminal mobility on the optical channel conditions is also investigated. As a final step, the on-board
DCO-OFDM performance is evaluated by using obtained in-flight LiFi channels. Numerical results
show that the location of a mobile terminal and accurate aircraft cabin modelling yield as much as
12 and 2 dB performance difference, respectively.

Objective: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune, and demyelinating disease that leads to lesions
in the central nervous system. This disease can be tracked and diagnosed using Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI). Up to now a multitude of multimodality automatic biomedical approaches is used to
segment lesions which are not beneficial for patients in terms of cost, time, and usability. The
authors of the present paper propose a method employing just one modality (FLAIR image) to segment
MS lesions accurately. Methods: A patch-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is designed,
inspired by 3D-ResNet and spatial-channel attention module, to segment MS lesions. The proposed
method consists of three stages: (1) the contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE)
is applied to the original images and concatenated to the extracted edges in order to create 4D images;
(2) the patches of size 80 * 80 * 80 * 2 are randomly selected from the 4D images; and (3) the extracted
patches are passed into an attention-based CNN which is used to segment the lesions. Finally, the
proposed method was compared to previous studies of the same dataset. Results: The current study
evaluates the model, with a test set of ISIB challenge data. Experimental results illustrate that
the proposed approach significantly surpasses existing methods in terms of Dice similarity and
Absolute Volume Difference while the proposed method use just one modality (FLAIR) to segment the
lesions. Conclusions: The authors have introduced an automated approach to segment the lesions
which is based on, at most, two modalities as an input. The proposed architecture is composed of convolution,
deconvolution, and an SCA-VoxRes module as an attention module. The results show, the proposed
method outperforms well compare to other methods.

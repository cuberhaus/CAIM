This paper presents karma mechanisms, a novel approach to the repeated allocation of a scarce resource
among competing agents over an infinite time. Examples of such resource allocation problems include
deciding which trip requests to serve in a ride-hailing platform during peak demand, granting the
right of way in intersections, or admitting internet content to a fast channel for improved quality
of service. We study a simplified yet insightful formulation of these problems where at every time
two agents from a large population get randomly matched to compete over the resource. The intuitive
interpretation of a karma mechanism is "If I give in now, I will be rewarded in the future." Agents
compete in an auction-like setting where they bid units of karma, which circulates directly among
them and is self-contained in the system. We demonstrate that this allows a society of self-interested
agents to achieve high levels of efficiency without resorting to a (possibly problematic) monetary
pricing of the resource. We model karma mechanisms as dynamic population games, in which agents
have private states - their urgency to acquire the resource and how much karma they have - that vary
in time based on their strategic decisions. We adopt the stationary Nash equilibrium as the solution
concept and prove its existence. We then analyze the performance at the stationary Nash equilibrium
numerically. For the case where the agents have homogeneous preferences, we compare different
mechanism design choices which allow to strike trade-offs between efficiency and fairness metrics,
showing how it is possible to achieve an efficient and ex-post fair allocation when the agents are
future aware. Finally, we test the robustness of the mechanisms against heterogeneity in the urgency
processes and the future awareness of the agents and propose remedies to some of the observed phenomena
via karma redistribution.

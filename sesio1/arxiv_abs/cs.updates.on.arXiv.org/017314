Many scientific problems focus on observed patterns of change or on how to design a system to achieve
particular dynamics. Those problems often require fitting differential equation models to target
trajectories. Fitting such models can be difficult because each evaluation of the fit must calculate
the distance between the model and target patterns at numerous points along a trajectory. The gradient
of the fit with respect to the model parameters can be challenging. Recent technical advances in
automatic differentiation through numerical differential equation solvers potentially change
the fitting process into a relatively easy problem, opening up new possibilities to study dynamics.
However, application of the new tools to real data may fail to achieve a good fit. This article illustrates
how to overcome a variety of common challenges, using the classic ecological data for oscillations
in hare and lynx populations. Models include simple ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and
neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), which use artificial neural networks to estimate
the derivatives of differential equation systems. Comparing the fits obtained with ODEs versus
NODEs, representing small and large parameter spaces, and changing the number of variable dimensions
provide insight into the geometry of the observed and model trajectories. To analyze the quality
of the models for predicting future observations, a Bayesian-inspired preconditioned stochastic
gradient Langevin dynamics (pSGLD) calculation of the posterior distribution of predicted model
trajectories clarifies the tendency for various models to underfit or overfit the data. Coupling
fitted differential equation systems with pSGLD sampling provides a powerful way to study the properties
of optimization surfaces, raising an analogy with mutation-selection dynamics on fitness landscapes.

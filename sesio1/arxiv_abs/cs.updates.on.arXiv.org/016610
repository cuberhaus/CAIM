A powerful approach, and one of the most common ones in structural health monitoring (SHM), is to
use data-driven models to make predictions and inferences about structures and their condition.
Such methods almost exclusively rely on the quality of the data. Within the SHM discipline, data
do not always suffice to build models with satisfactory accuracy for given tasks. Even worse, data
may be completely missing from one's dataset, regarding the behaviour of a structure under different
environmental conditions. In the current work, with a view to confronting such issues, the generation
of artificial data using a variation of the generative adversarial network (GAN) algorithm, is
used. The aforementioned variation is that of the conditional GAN or cGAN. The algorithm is not only
used to generate artificial data, but also to learn transformations of manifolds according to some
known parameters. Assuming that the structure's response is represented by points in a manifold,
part of the space will be formed due to variations in external conditions affecting the structure.
This idea proves efficient in SHM, as it is exploited to generate structural data for specific values
of environmental coefficients. The scheme is applied here on a simulated structure which operates
under different temperature and humidity conditions. The cGAN is trained on data for some discrete
values of the temperature within some range, and is able to generate data for every temperature in
this range with satisfactory accuracy. The novelty, compared to classic regression in similar
problems, is that the cGAN allows unknown environmental parameters to affect the structure and
can generate whole manifolds of data for every value of the known parameters, while the unknown ones
vary within the generated manifolds.

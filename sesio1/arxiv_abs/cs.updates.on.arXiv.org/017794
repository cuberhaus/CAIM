This paper presents a timing attack on the FIDO2 (Fast IDentity Online) authentication protocol
that allows attackers to link user accounts stored in vulnerable authenticators, a serious privacy
concern. FIDO2 is a new standard specified by the FIDO industry alliance for secure token online
authentication. It complements the W3C WebAuthn specification by providing means to use a USB token
or other authenticator as a second factor during the authentication process. From a cryptographic
perspective, the protocol is a simple challenge-response where the elliptic curve digital signature
algorithm is used to sign challenges. To protect the privacy of the user the token uses unique key
pairs per service. To accommodate for small memory, tokens use various techniques that make use
of a special parameter called a key handle sent by the service to the token. We identify and analyse
a vulnerability in the way the processing of key handles is implemented that allows attackers to
remotely link user accounts on multiple services. We show that for vulnerable authenticators there
is a difference between the time it takes to process a key handle for a different service but correct
authenticator, and for a different authenticator but correct service. This difference can be used
to perform a timing attack allowing an adversary to link user's accounts across services. We present
several real world examples of adversaries that are in a position to execute our attack and can benefit
from linking accounts. We found that two of the eight hardware authenticators we tested were vulnerable
despite FIDO level 1 certification. This vulnerability cannot be easily mitigated on authenticators
because, for security reasons, they usually do not allow firmware updates. In addition, we show
that due to the way existing browsers implement the WebAuthn standard, the attack can be executed
remotely.

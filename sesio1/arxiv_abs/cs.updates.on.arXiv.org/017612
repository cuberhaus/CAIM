This research developed a Kencorpus Swahili Question Answering Dataset KenSwQuAD from raw data
of Swahili language, which is a low resource language predominantly spoken in Eastern African and
also has speakers in other parts of the world. Question Answering datasets are important for machine
comprehension of natural language processing tasks such as internet search and dialog systems.
However, before such machine learning systems can perform these tasks, they need training data
such as the gold standard Question Answering (QA) set that is developed in this research. The research
engaged annotators to formulate question answer pairs from Swahili texts that had been collected
by the Kencorpus project, a Kenyan languages corpus that collected data from three Kenyan languages.
The total Swahili data collection had 2,585 texts, out of which we annotated 1,445 story texts with
at least 5 QA pairs each, resulting into a final dataset of 7,526 QA pairs. A quality assurance set
of 12.5% of the annotated texts was subjected to re-evaluation by different annotators who confirmed
that the QA pairs were all correctly annotated. A proof of concept on applying the set to machine learning
on the question answering task confirmed that the dataset can be used for such practical tasks. The
research therefore developed KenSwQuAD, a question-answer dataset for Swahili that is useful
to the natural language processing community who need training and gold standard sets for their
machine learning applications. The research also contributed to the resourcing of the Swahili
language which is important for communication around the globe. Updating this set and providing
similar sets for other low resource languages is an important research area that is worthy of further
research.

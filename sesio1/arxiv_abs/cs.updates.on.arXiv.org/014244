In many fields of science and engineering, models with different fidelities are available. Physical
experiments or detailed simulations that accurately capture the behavior of the system are regarded
as high-fidelity models with low model uncertainty, however, they are expensive to run. On the other
hand, simplified physical experiments or numerical models are seen as low-fidelity models that
are cheaper to evaluate. Although low-fidelity models are often not suitable for direct use in reliability
analysis due to their low accuracy, they can offer information about the trend of the high-fidelity
model thus providing the opportunity to explore the design space at a low cost. This study presents
a new approach called adaptive multi-fidelity Gaussian process for reliability analysis (AMGPRA).
Contrary to selecting training points and information sources in two separate stages as done in
state-of-the-art mfEGRA method, the proposed approach finds the optimal training point and information
source simultaneously using the novel collective learning function (CLF). CLF is able to assess
the global impact of a candidate training point from an information source and it accommodates any
learning function that satisfies a certain profile. In this context, CLF provides a new direction
for quantifying the impact of new training points and can be easily extended with new learning functions
to adapt to different reliability problems. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated
by three mathematical examples and one engineering problem concerning the wind reliability of
transmission towers. It is shown that the proposed method achieves similar or higher accuracy with
reduced computational costs compared to state-of-the-art single and multi-fidelity methods.
A key application of AMGPRA is high-fidelity fragility modeling using complex and costly physics-based
computational models.

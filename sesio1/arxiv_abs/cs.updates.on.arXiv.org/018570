Asthma is a common chronic disease of the respiratory system causing significant disability and
societal burden. It affects over 500 million people worldwide and generates costs exceeding $USD
56 billion in 2011 in the United States. Managing asthma involves controlling symptoms, preventing
exacerbations, and maintaining lung function. Improving asthma control affects the daily life
of patients and is associated with a reduced risk of exacerbations and lung function impairment,
reduces the cost of asthma care and indirect costs associated with reduced productivity. Understanding
the complex dynamics of the pulmonary system and the lung's response to disease, injury, and treatment
is fundamental to the advancement of Asthma treatment. Computational models of the respiratory
system seek to provide a theoretical framework to understand the interaction between structure
and function. Their application can improve pulmonary medicine by a patient-specific approach
to medicinal methodologies optimizing the delivery given the personalized geometry and personalized
ventilation patterns while introducing a patient-specific technique that maximizes drug delivery.
A three-fold objective addressed within this dissertation becomes prominent at this point. The
first part refers to the comprehension of pulmonary pathophysiology and the mechanics of Asthma
and subsequently of constrictive pulmonary conditions in general. The second part refers to the
design and implementation of tools that facilitate personalized medicine to improve delivery
and effectiveness. Finally, the third part refers to the self-management of the condition, meaning
that medical personnel and patients have access to tools and methods that allow the first party to
easily track the course of the condition and the second party, i.e. the patient to easily self-manage
it alleviating the significant burden from the health system.

Social media platforms play an important role in democratic processes. During the 2019 General
Elections of India, political parties and politicians widely used Twitter to share their ideals,
advocate their agenda and gain popularity. Twitter served as a ground for journalists, politicians
and voters to interact. The organic nature of these interactions can be upended by malicious accounts
on Twitter, which end up being suspended or deleted from the platform. Such accounts aim to modify
the reach of content by inorganically interacting with particular handles. These interactions
are a threat to the integrity of the platform, as such activity has the potential to affect entire
results of democratic processes. In this work, we design a feature extraction framework which compactly
captures potentially insidious interaction patterns. Our proposed features are designed to bring
out communities amongst the users that work to boost the content of particular accounts. We use Hyperbolic
Hierarchical Clustering (HypHC) which represents the features in the hyperbolic manifold to further
separate such communities. HypHC gives the added benefit of representing these features in a lower
dimensional space -- thus serving as a dimensionality reduction technique. We use these features
to distinguish between different classes of users that emerged in the aftermath of the 2019 General
Elections of India. Amongst the users active on Twitter during the elections, 2.8% of the users participating
were suspended and 1% of the users were deleted from the platform. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of our proposed features in differentiating between regular users (users who were neither suspended
nor deleted), suspended users and deleted users. By leveraging HypHC in our pipeline, we obtain
F1 scores of upto 93%.

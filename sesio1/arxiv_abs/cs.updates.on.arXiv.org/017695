Lung cancer is a severe menace to human health, due to which millions of people die because of late
diagnoses of cancer; thus, it is vital to detect the disease as early as possible. The Computerized
chest analysis Tomography of scan is assumed to be one of the efficient solutions for detecting and
classifying lung nodules. The necessity of high accuracy of analyzing C.T. scan images of the lung
is considered as one of the crucial challenges in detecting and classifying lung cancer. A new long-short-term-memory
(LSTM) based deep fusion structure, is introduced, where, the texture features computed from lung
nodules through new volumetric grey-level-co-occurrence-matrices (GLCM) computations are
applied to classify the nodules into: benign, malignant and ambiguous. An improved Otsu segmentation
method combined with the water strider optimization algorithm (WSA) is proposed to detect the lung
nodules. Otsu-WSA thresholding can overcome the restrictions present in previous thresholding
methods. Extended experiments are run to assess this fusion structure by considering 2D-GLCM computations
based 2D-slices fusion, and an approximation of this 3D-GLCM with volumetric 2.5D-GLCM computations-based
LSTM fusion structure. The proposed methods are trained and assessed through the LIDC-IDRI dataset,
where 94.4%, 91.6%, and 95.8% Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity are obtained, respectively
for 2D-GLCM fusion and 97.33%, 96%, and 98%, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, respectively,
for 2.5D-GLCM fusion. The yield of the same are 98.7%, 98%, and 99%, for the 3D-GLCM fusion. The obtained
results and analysis indicate that the WSA-Otsu method requires less execution time and yields
a more accurate thresholding process. It is found that 3D-GLCM based LSTM outperforms its counterparts.

Advertisers usually enjoy the flexibility to choose criteria like target audience, geographic
area and bid price when planning an campaign for online display advertising, while they lack forecast
information on campaign performance to optimize delivery strategies in advance, resulting in
a waste of labour and budget for feedback adjustments. In this paper, we aim to forecast key performance
indicators for new campaigns given any certain criteria. Interpretable and accurate results could
enable advertisers to manage and optimize their campaign criteria. There are several challenges
for this very task. First, platforms usually offer advertisers various criteria when they plan
an advertising campaign, it is difficult to estimate campaign performance unifiedly because of
the great difference among bidding types. Furthermore, complex strategies applied in bidding
system bring great fluctuation on campaign performance, making estimation accuracy an extremely
tough problem. To address above challenges, we propose a novel Campaign Performance Forecasting
framework, which firstly reproduces campaign performance on historical logs under various bidding
types with a unified replay algorithm, in which essential auction processes like match and rank
are replayed, ensuring the interpretability on forecast results. Then, we innovatively introduce
a multi-task learning method to calibrate the deviation of estimation brought by hard-to-reproduce
bidding strategies in replay. The method captures mixture calibration patterns among related
forecast indicators to map the estimated results to the true ones, improving both accuracy and efficiency
significantly. Experiment results on a dataset from Taobao.com demonstrate that the proposed
framework significantly outperforms other baselines by a large margin, and an online A/B test verifies
its effectiveness in the real world.

This work proposes a model-reduction approach for the material point method on nonlinear manifolds.
The technique approximates the $\textit{kinematics}$ by approximating the deformation map in
a manner that restricts deformation trajectories to reside on a low-dimensional manifold expressed
from the extrinsic view via a parameterization function. By explicitly approximating the deformation
map and its spatial-temporal gradients, the deformation gradient and the velocity can be computed
simply by differentiating the associated parameterization function. Unlike classical model
reduction techniques that build a subspace for a finite number of degrees of freedom, the proposed
method approximates the entire deformation map with infinite degrees of freedom. Therefore, the
technique supports resolution changes in the reduced simulation, attaining the challenging task
of zero-shot super-resolution by generating material points unseen in the training data. The ability
to generate material points also allows for adaptive quadrature rules for stress update. A family
of projection methods is devised to generate $\textit{dynamics}$, i.e., at every time step, the
methods perform three steps: (1) generate quadratures in the full space from the reduced space,
(2) compute position and velocity updates in the full space, and (3) perform a least-squares projection
of the updated position and velocity onto the low-dimensional manifold and its tangent space. Computational
speedup is achieved via hyper-reduction, i.e., only a subset of the original material points are
needed for dynamics update. Large-scale numerical examples with millions of material points illustrate
the method's ability to gain an order-of-magnitude computational-cost saving -- indeed $\textit{real-time
simulations}$ in some cases -- with negligible errors.

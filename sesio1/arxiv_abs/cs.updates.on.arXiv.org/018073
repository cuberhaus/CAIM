Dynamic Complexity was introduced by Immerman and Patnaik PI97 in the nineties and has seen a resurgence
of interest with the positive resolution of their conjecture on directed reachability in DynFO
DKMSZ18. Since then many natural problems related to reachability and matching have been placed
in DynFO and related classes DMVZ18,DKMTVZ20,DTV21. In this work, we place some dynamic problems
from group theory in DynFO. In particular, suppose we are given an arbitrary multiplication table
over n elements representing an unstructured binary operation (representing a structure called
a magma). Suppose the table evolves through a change in one of its n^2 entries in one step. For a set
S of magma elements which also changes one element at a time, we can maintain enough auxiliary information
so that when the magma is a group, we are able to answer the Cayley Group Membership (CGM) problem for
S and a target t (i.e. "Is t a product of elements from S? ") using an FO query at every step. This places
the dynamic CGM problem (for groups) when the ambient magma is specified via a table in DynFO. In contrast,
for the table setting, statically CGM was known to be in the class Logspace BarringtonM06. Building
on the dynamic CGM result, we can maintain the isomorphism of of two magmas, whenever both are Abelian
groups, in DynFO. Our techniques include a way to maintain the powers of the elements of a magma in
DynFO using left associative parenthesisation, the notion of cube independence to cube generate
a subgroup generated by a set, a way to maintain maximal cube independent sequences in a magma along
with some group theoretic machinery available from McKenzieCook. The notion of cube independent
sequences is new as far as we know and may be of independent interest. These techniques are very different
from the ones employed in Dynamic Complexity so far.

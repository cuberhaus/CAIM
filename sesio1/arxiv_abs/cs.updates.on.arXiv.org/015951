Bone Marrow Transplant, a gradational rescue for a wide range of disorders emanating from the bone
marrow, is an efficacious surgical treatment. Several risk factors, such as post-transplant illnesses,
new malignancies, and even organ damage, can impair long-term survival. Therefore, technologies
like Machine Learning are deployed for investigating the survival prediction of BMT receivers
along with the influences that limit their resilience. In this study, an efficient survival classification
model is presented in a comprehensive manner, incorporating the Chi-squared feature selection
method to address the dimensionality problem and Hyper Parameter Optimization (HPO) to increase
accuracy. A synthetic dataset is generated by imputing the missing values, transforming the data
using dummy variable encoding, and compressing the dataset from 59 features to the 11 most correlated
features using Chi-squared feature selection. The dataset was split into train and test sets at
a ratio of 80:20, and the hyperparameters were optimized using Grid Search Cross-Validation. Several
supervised ML methods were trained in this regard, like Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic
Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Gradient Boosting Classifier, Ada Boost, and XG Boost. The simulations
have been performed for both the default and optimized hyperparameters by using the original and
reduced synthetic dataset. After ranking the features using the Chi-squared test, it was observed
that the top 11 features with HPO, resulted in the same accuracy of prediction (94.73%) as the entire
dataset with default parameters. Moreover, this approach requires less time and resources for
predicting the survivability of children undergoing BMT. Hence, the proposed approach may aid
in the development of a computer-aided diagnostic system with satisfactory accuracy and minimal
computation time by utilizing medical data records.

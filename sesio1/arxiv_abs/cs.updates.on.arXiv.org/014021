Blockchain and distributed ledger technologies have received significant interest in various
areas beyond the financial sector, with profound applications in the Internet of Things (IoT),
providing the means for creating truly trustless and secure solutions for IoT applications. Taking
into account the weak security defences that the majority of IoT devices have, it is critical that
a blockchain-based solution targeting the IoT is not only capable of addressing the many challenges
IoT is facing, but also does not introduce other defects, in terms of performance, making its adoption
hard to achieve. This paper aims at addressing the above needs by providing a comprehensive and coherent
review of the available blockchain solutions to determine their ability to meet the requirements
and tackle the challenges of the IoT, using the smart home as the reference domain. Key architectural
aspects of blockchain solutions are examined in terms of their ability to withstand various types
of common IoT and blockchain attacks, deliver enhanced privacy features, and assure adequate performance
levels while processing large amounts of transactions being generated in an IoT environment. The
analysis carried out identified that the defences currently provided by blockchain platforms
are not sufficient to thwart all the prominent attacks against blockchains, with blockchain 1.0
and 2.0 platforms being susceptible to the majority of them. On the other side, privacy related mechanisms
are being supported, to varying degrees, by all platforms investigated; however, each of the them
tackles specific only privacy aspects, thus rendering the overall privacy evaluation a challenging
task which needs to be considered in an ad-hoc basis. If the underlying consensus protocols performance
and fault tolerance is also considered, then only a small number of platforms meet the requirements
of our reference IoT domain.

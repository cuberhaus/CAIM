Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a part of everyday conversation and our lives. It is considered
as the new electricity that is revolutionizing the world. AI is heavily invested in both industry
and academy. However, there is also a lot of hype in the current AI debate. AI based on so-called deep
learning has achieved impressive results in many problems, but its limits are already visible.
AI has been under research since the 1940s, and the industry has seen many ups and downs due to over-expectations
and related disappointments that have followed. The purpose of this book is to give a realistic picture
of AI, its history, its potential and limitations. We believe that AI is a helper, not a ruler of humans.
We begin by describing what AI is and how it has evolved over the decades. After fundamentals, we explain
the importance of massive data for the current mainstream of artificial intelligence. The most
common representations for AI, methods, and machine learning are covered. In addition, the main
application areas are introduced. Computer vision has been central to the development of AI. The
book provides a general introduction to computer vision, and includes an exposure to the results
and applications of our own research. Emotions are central to human intelligence, but little use
has been made in AI. We present the basics of emotional intelligence and our own research on the topic.
We discuss super-intelligence that transcends human understanding, explaining why such achievement
seems impossible on the basis of present knowledge,and how AI could be improved. Finally, a summary
is made of the current state of AI and what to do in the future. In the appendix, we look at the development
of AI education, especially from the perspective of contents at our own university.

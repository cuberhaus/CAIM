To ensure an efficient and environmentally friendly water resource management, water management
associations need means for efficient water monitoring as well as novel strategies to reduce the
pollution of surface and ground water. Traditionally, water management associations operate
large sensor networks to suffice their needs for hydrological and meteorological measurement
data to monitor and model physical processes within catchments. Implementing a comprehensive
monitoring system often suffers from sparse coverage of in-situ data. Due to the evolvement of the
Copernicus satellite platforms, the broader availability of satellite data provides a great potential
for deriving complementary information from Earth Observation data. Although the number of satellite
data platforms that provide online processing environments is growing, it is still a big challenge
to integrate those platforms into traditional workflows of users from environmental domains such
as hydrology. Thus, in this paper, we introduce a software architecture to facilitate the generation
of Earth Observation information targeted towards hydrology. The presented WaCoDiS System comprises
several microservices as well standardized interfaces that enable a platform-independent processing
of satellite data. First, we discuss the contribution of Earth Observation data to water monitoring
and derive several challenges regarding the facilitation of satellite data processing. We then
describe our system design with a brief overview about the different system components which form
an automated processing pipeline. The suitability of our system is proven as part of a pre-operational
deployment for a German water management association. In addition, we demonstrate how our system
is capable of integrating satellite data platforms, using the Copernicus Data and Exploitation
Platform - Deutschland (CODE-DE) as a reference example.

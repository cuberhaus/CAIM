In this paper, we propose a novel joint caching and massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
transmission scheme, referred to as \emph{cache-aided massive MIMO}, for multi-cell downlink
transmission to multiple cache-enabled receivers. With the proposed scheme, users who have cached
(a portion of) the files that they request are offloaded and, hence, (partially) inactive during
downlink transmission. The other users either benefit from the cache-enabled offloading for mitigating
pilot contamination or exploit the cached but unrequested files to cancel interference during
uplink channel estimation and downlink file reception. Moreover, by redesigning the transmit
precoders based on the cache status of the users and channel state information, we gain additional
degrees of freedom for massive MIMO transmission. For a given cache status, we analyze the equivalent
content delivery rates (ECDRs), i.e., the average rates of delivering a requested file via both
caching and massive MIMO transmission to the requesting user, for cache-aided massive MIMO employing
re-designed maximum ratio transmission (MRT), zero-forcing (ZF) precoding, and regularized
zero-forcing (RZF) precoding. Based on the derived results, the impact of (random) uncoded caching
and coded caching on the performance of the re-designed precoding schemes is investigated. Simulation
results validate our derivations and show that caching is beneficial for precoded downlink transmission
as it enhances the transmit power allocation, mitigates intra- and inter-cell interference, and
reduces the impairment caused by pilot contamination. Compared with conventional massive MIMO
without caching and with cache-oblivious precoding, the proposed cache-aided massive MIMO scheme
achieves a significantly higher ECDR even when the number of users approaches the number of transmit
antennas.

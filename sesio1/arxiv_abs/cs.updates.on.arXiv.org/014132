Despite the recent progress in the field of causal inference, to date there is no agreed upon methodology
to glean treatment effect estimation from observational data. The consequence on clinical practice
is that, when lacking results from a randomized trial, medical personnel is left without guidance
on what seems to be effective in a real-world scenario. This article showcases a pragmatic methodology
to obtain preliminary estimation of treatment effect from observational studies. Our approach
was tested on the estimation of treatment effect of the proning maneuver on oxygenation levels,
on a cohort of COVID-19 Intensive Care patients. We modeled our study design on a recent RCT for proning
(the PROSEVA trial). Linear regression, propensity score models such as blocking and DR-IPW, BART
and two versions of Counterfactual Regression were employed to provide estimates on observational
data comprising first wave COVID-19 ICU patient data from 25 Dutch hospitals. 6371 data points,
from 745 mechanically ventilated patients, were included in the study. Estimates for the early
effect of proning -- P/F ratio from 2 to 8 hours after proning -- ranged between 14.54 and 20.11 mm Hg
depending on the model. Estimates for the late effect of proning -- oxygenation from 12 to 24 hours
after proning -- ranged between 13.53 and 15.26 mm Hg. All confidence interval being strictly above
zero indicated that the effect of proning on oxygenation for COVID-19 patient was positive and comparable
in magnitude to the effect on non COVID-19 patients. These results provide further evidence on the
effectiveness of proning on the treatment of COVID-19 patients. This study, along with the accompanying
open-source code, provides a blueprint for treatment effect estimation in scenarios where RCT
data is lacking. Funding: SIDN fund, CovidPredict consortium, Pacmed.

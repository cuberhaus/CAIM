Bayesian estimation of short-time spectral amplitude is one of the most predominant approaches
for the enhancement of the noise corrupted speech. The performance of these estimators are usually
significantly improved when any perceptually relevant cost function is considered. On the other
hand, the recent progress in the phase-based speech signal processing have shown that the phase-only
enhancement based on spectral phase estimation methods can also provide joint improvement in the
perceived speech quality and intelligibility, even in low SNR conditions. In this paper, to take
advantage of both the perceptually motivated cost function involving STSAs of estimated and true
clean speech and utilizing the prior spectral phase information, we have derived a phase-aware
Bayesian STSA estimator. The parameters of the cost function are chosen based on the characteristics
of the human auditory system, namely, the dynamic compressive nonlinearity of the cochlea, the
perceived loudness theory and the simultaneous masking properties of the ear. This type of parameter
selection scheme results in more noise reduction while limiting the speech distortion. The derived
STSA estimator is optimal in the MMSE sense if the prior phase information is available. In practice,
however, typically only an estimate of the clean speech phase can be obtained via employing different
types of spectral phase estimation techniques which have been developed throughout the last few
years. In a blind setup, we have evaluated the proposed Bayesian STSA estimator with different types
of standard phase estimation methods available in the literature. Experimental results have shown
that the proposed estimator can achieve substantial improvement in performance than the traditional
phase-blind approaches.

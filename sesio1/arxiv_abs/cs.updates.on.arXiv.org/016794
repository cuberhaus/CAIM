Despite the success, the process of fine-tuning large-scale PLMs brings prohibitive adaptation
costs. In fact, fine-tuning all the parameters of a colossal model and retaining separate instances
for different tasks are practically infeasible. This necessitates a new branch of research focusing
on the parameter-efficient adaptation of PLMs, dubbed as delta tuning in this paper. In contrast
with the standard fine-tuning, delta tuning only fine-tunes a small portion of the model parameters
while keeping the rest untouched, largely reducing both the computation and storage costs. Recent
studies have demonstrated that a series of delta tuning methods with distinct tuned parameter selection
could achieve performance on a par with full-parameter fine-tuning, suggesting a new promising
way of stimulating large-scale PLMs. In this paper, we first formally describe the problem of delta
tuning and then comprehensively review recent delta tuning approaches. We also propose a unified
categorization criterion that divide existing delta tuning methods into three groups: addition-based,
specification-based, and reparameterization-based methods. Though initially proposed as an
efficient method to steer large models, we believe that some of the fascinating evidence discovered
along with delta tuning could help further reveal the mechanisms of PLMs and even deep neural networks.
To this end, we discuss the theoretical principles underlying the effectiveness of delta tuning
and propose frameworks to interpret delta tuning from the perspective of optimization and optimal
control, respectively. Furthermore, we provide a holistic empirical study of representative
methods, where results on over 100 NLP tasks demonstrate a comprehensive performance comparison
of different approaches. The experimental results also cover the analysis of combinatorial, scaling
and transferable properties of delta tuning.

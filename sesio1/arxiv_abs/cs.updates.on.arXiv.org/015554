Fine-grained IP geolocation algorithms often rely on some linear delay-distance rules. They are
not easy to generalize in network environments where the delay-distance relationship is non-linear.
Recently, researchers begin to pay attention to learning-based IP geolocation algorithms. These
data-driven algorithms leverage multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to model non-linear relationships.
However, MLP is not so suitable for modeling computer networks because networks are fundamentally
graph-typed data. MLP-based IP geolocation algorithms only treat IP addresses as isolated data
instances, forgoing the connection information between IP addresses. This would lead to sub-optimal
representations and limit the geolocation performance. Graph convolutional network (GCN) is
an emerging deep learning method for graph-typed data presentation.In this work, we research how
to model computer networks for fine-grained IP geolocation with GCN. First, we formulate the IP
geolocation task as an attributed graph node regression problem. Then, a GCN-based IP geolocation
framework named GCN-Geo is proposed to predict the location of each IP address. GCN-Geo consists
of a preprocessor, an encoder, graph convolutional (GC) layers and a decoder. The preprocessor
and the encoder transform raw measurement data into the initial graph embeddings. GC layers refine
the initial graph node embeddings by explicitly modeling the connection information between IP
addresses. The proposed decoder can relieve the converging problem of GCN-Geo by considering some
prior knowledge about target IP addresses. Finally, the experimental results in three real-world
datasets show that: GCN-Geo clearly outperforms the state-of-art rule-based and learning-based
baselines on all three datasets w.r.t. average, median and max error distances. This work verifies
the potential of GCN in fine-grained IP geolocation.

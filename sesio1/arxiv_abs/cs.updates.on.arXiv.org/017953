To further reduce the cost of semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) labeling, a more effective
way is to use active learning (AL) to annotate a selected subset with specific properties. However,
domain adaptation tasks are always addressed in two interactive aspects: domain transfer and the
enhancement of discrimination, which requires the selected data to be both uncertain under the
model and diverse in feature space. Contrary to active learning in classification tasks, it is usually
challenging to select pixels that contain both the above properties in segmentation tasks, leading
to the complex design of pixel selection strategy. To address such an issue, we propose a novel Active
Domain Adaptation scheme with Multi-level Contrastive Units (ADA-MCU) for semantic image segmentation.
A simple pixel selection strategy followed with the construction of multi-level contrastive units
is introduced to optimize the model for both domain adaptation and active supervised learning.
In practice, MCUs are constructed from intra-image, cross-image, and cross-domain levels by using
both labeled and unlabeled pixels. At each level, we define contrastive losses from center-to-center
and pixel-to-pixel manners, with the aim of jointly aligning the category centers and reducing
outliers near the decision boundaries. In addition, we also introduce a categories correlation
matrix to implicitly describe the relationship between categories, which are used to adjust the
weights of the losses for MCUs. Extensive experimental results on standard benchmarks show that
the proposed method achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art SSDA methods
with 50% fewer labeled pixels and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art with a large margin
by using the same level of annotation cost.

Over the last decade, surgical robots have risen in prominence and usage. For surgical robots, connectivity
is necessary to accept software updates, accept instructions, and transfer sensory data, but it
also exposes the robot to cyberattacks, which can damage the patient or the surgeon. These injuries
are normally caused by safety failures, as seen in accidents with industrial robots, but cyberattacks
are caused by security failures instead. We create a taxonomy for both types of failures in this paper
specifically for surgical robots. These robots are increasingly sold and used in the European Union
(EU); we therefore consider how surgical robots are viewed and treated by EU law. Specifically,
which rights regulators and manufacturers have, and which legal remedies and actions a patient
or manufacturer would have in a single national legal system in the union, if injuries were to occur
from a security failure caused by an adversary that cannot be unambiguously identified. We find
that the selected national legal system can adequately deal with attacks on surgical robots, because
it can on one hand efficiently compensate the patient. This is because of its flexibility; secondly,
a remarkable absence of distinction between safety vs security causes of failure and focusing instead
on the detrimental effects, thus benefiting the patient; and third, liability can be removed from
the manufacturer by withdrawing its status as party if the patient chooses a separate public law
measure to recover damages. Furthermore, we find that current EU law does consider both security
and safety aspects of surgical robots, without it mentioning it through literal wording, but it
also adds substantial liabilities and responsibilities to the manufacturers of surgical robots,
gives the patient special rights and confers immense powers on the regulators.

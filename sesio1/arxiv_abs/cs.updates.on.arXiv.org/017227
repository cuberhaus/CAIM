Large-amplitude chatter vibrations are one of the most important phenomena in machining processes.
It is often detrimental in cutting operations causing a poor surface finish and decreased tool life.
Therefore, chatter detection using machine learning has been an active research area over the last
decade. Three challenges can be identified in applying machine learning for chatter detection
at large in industry: an insufficient understanding of the universality of chatter features across
different processes, the need for automating feature extraction, and the existence of limited
data for each specific workpiece-machine tool combination. These three challenges can be grouped
under the umbrella of transfer learning. This paper studies automating chatter detection by evaluating
transfer learning of prominent as well as novel chatter detection methods. We investigate chatter
classification accuracy using a variety of features extracted from turning and milling experiments
with different cutting configurations. The studied methods include Fast Fourier Transform (FFT),
Power Spectral Density (PSD), the Auto-correlation Function (ACF), Wavelet Packet Transform
(WPT), and Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD). We also examine more recent approaches
based on Topological Data Analysis (TDA) and similarity measures of time series based on Discrete
Time Warping (DTW). We evaluate the transfer learning potential of each approach by training and
testing both within and across the turning and milling data sets. Our results show that carefully
chosen time-frequency features can lead to high classification accuracies albeit at the cost of
requiring manual pre-processing and the tagging of an expert user. On the other hand, we found that
the TDA and DTW approaches can provide accuracies and F1 scores on par with the time-frequency methods
without the need for manual preprocessing.

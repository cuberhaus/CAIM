Driven by climate change, rising environmental awareness, and financial incentives, more and
more commercial fleets transition to electric vehicles. However, this endeavor remains challenging
as time-inefficient charge operations and lack of public charging infrastructure require fleet
operators to invest into additional private on-premise charging stations. Here, grid capacity
constraints and investment cost limit the number of available charging stations such that charging
bottlenecks may arise. Accordingly, efficient scheduling of charge and service operations becomes
inevitable to realize profitable fleets. Creating the underlying schedules constitutes a challenging
optimization problem, especially when additional factors, such as battery degradation, variable
energy prices, and non-linear battery behavior need to be considered. In this paper, we study the
resulting joint charge and service operations scheduling problem, that combines the scheduling
of vehicle service operations and charge scheduling. We propose an exact algorithm based on branch
& price to solve this problem. This algorithm bases on an exact labeling algorithm developed for
a novel resource constrained shortest path problem, which models our pricing problem, and leverages
a custom branching rule and a primal heuristic to accelerate the branch & bound phase. We benchmark
our algorithm in a comprehensive numerical study and show that it can solve realistic problem instances
with computational times below one hour, thus enabling its application in practice. Additionally,
we analyze the benefit of jointly scheduling charging and service operations in practice. We find
that our integrated approach lowers the amount of charging infrastructure required for fleet operation
by up to 57% besides enabling cost savings of up to 5%.

In this article we introduce the notion of Split Variational Autoencoder (SVAE), whose output $\hat{x}$
is obtained as a weighted sum $\sigma \odot \hat{x_1} + (1-\sigma) \odot \hat{x_2}$ of two generated
images $\hat{x_1},\hat{x_2}$, and $\sigma$ is a {\em learned} compositional map. The composing
images $\hat{x_1},\hat{x_2}$, as well as the $\sigma$-map are automatically synthesized by the
model. The network is trained as a usual Variational Autoencoder with a negative loglikelihood
loss between training and reconstructed images. No additional loss is required for $\hat{x_1},\hat{x_2}$
or $\sigma$, neither any form of human tuning. The decomposition is nondeterministic, but follows
two main schemes, that we may roughly categorize as either \say{syntactic} or \say{semantic}.
In the first case, the map tends to exploit the strong correlation between adjacent pixels, splitting
the image in two complementary high frequency sub-images. In the second case, the map typically
focuses on the contours of objects, splitting the image in interesting variations of its content,
with more marked and distinctive features. In this case, according to empirical observations,
the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) of $\hat{x_1}$ and $\hat{x_2}$ is usually lower (hence
better) than that of $\hat{x}$, that clearly suffers from being the average of the former. In a sense,
a SVAE forces the Variational Autoencoder to make choices, in contrast with its intrinsic tendency
to {\em average} between alternatives with the aim to minimize the reconstruction loss towards
a specific sample. According to the FID metric, our technique, tested on typical datasets such as
Mnist, Cifar10 and CelebA, allows us to outperform all previous purely variational architectures
(not relying on normalization flows).

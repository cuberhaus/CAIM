Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is a trending topic which aims to navigate an intelligent
agent to an expected position through natural language instructions. This work addresses the task
of VLN from a previously-ignored aspect, namely the spatial route prior of the navigation scenes.
A critically enabling innovation of this work is explicitly considering the spatial route prior
under several different VLN settings. In a most information-rich case of knowing environment maps
and admitting shortest-path prior, we observe that given an origin-destination node pair, the
internal route can be uniquely determined. Thus, VLN can be effectively formulated as an ordinary
classification problem over all possible destination nodes in the scenes. Furthermore, we relax
it to other more general VLN settings, proposing a sequential-decision variant (by abandoning
the shortest-path route prior) and an explore-and-exploit scheme (for addressing the case of not
knowing the environment maps) that curates a compact and informative sub-graph to exploit. As reported
by [34], the performance of VLN methods has been stuck at a plateau in past two years. Even with increased
model complexity, the state-of-the-art success rate on R2R validation-unseen set has stayed around
62% for single-run and 73% for beam-search with model-ensemble. We have conducted comprehensive
evaluations on both R2R and R4R, and surprisingly found that utilizing the spatial route priors
may be the key of breaking above-mentioned performance ceiling. For example, on R2R validation-unseen
set, when the number of discrete nodes explored is about 40, our single-model success rate reaches
73%, and increases to 78% if a Speaker model is ensembled, which significantly outstrips previous
state-of-the-art VLN-BERT with 3 models ensembled.

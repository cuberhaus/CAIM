With the recent advances in A.I. methodologies and their application to medical imaging, there
has been an explosion of related research programs utilizing these techniques to produce state-of-the-art
classification performance. Ultimately, these research programs culminate in submission of
their work for consideration in peer reviewed journals. To date, the criteria for acceptance vs.
rejection is often subjective; however, reproducible science requires reproducible review.
The Machine Learning Education Sub-Committee of SIIM has identified a knowledge gap and a serious
need to establish guidelines for reviewing these studies. Although there have been several recent
papers with this goal, this present work is written from the machine learning practitioners standpoint.
In this series, the committee will address the best practices to be followed in an A.I.-based study
and present the required sections in terms of examples and discussion of what should be included
to make the studies cohesive, reproducible, accurate, and self-contained. This first entry in
the series focuses on the task of image classification. Elements such as dataset curation, data
pre-processing steps, defining an appropriate reference standard, data partitioning, model
architecture and training are discussed. The sections are presented as they would be detailed in
a typical manuscript, with content describing the necessary information that should be included
to make sure the study is of sufficient quality to be considered for publication. The goal of this
series is to provide resources to not only help improve the review process for A.I.-based medical
imaging papers, but to facilitate a standard for the information that is presented within all components
of the research study. We hope to provide quantitative metrics in what otherwise may be a qualitative
review process.

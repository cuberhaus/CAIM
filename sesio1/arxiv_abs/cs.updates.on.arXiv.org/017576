One approach with rising popularity in analyzing time-dependent problems in science and engineering
is the so-called space-time finite-element method that utilized finiteelements in both space
and time. A common ansatz in this context is to divide the mesh in temporal direction into so-called
space-time slabs, which are subsequently weakly connected in time with a Discontinuous Galerkin
approach. The corresponding jumpterm, which is responsible for imposing the weak continuity across
space-time slabs can be challenging to compute, in particular in the context of deforming domains.
Ensuring a conforming discretization of the space-time slab at the top and bottom in time direction
simplifies the handling of this term immensely. Otherwise, a computationally expensive and error
prone projection of the solution from one time-level to another is necessary. However, when it comes
to simulations with deformable domains, e.g. for free-surface flows, ensuring conforming meshes
is quite laborious. A possible solution to this challenge is to extrude a spatial mesh in time at each
time-step resulting in the so-called time-discontinuous prismatic space-time (D-PST) method.
However, this procedure is restricted to finite-elements of 1st order in time. We present a novel
algorithmic approach for arbitrarily discretized meshes by flipping the mesh in time-direction
for each time-step. This ansatz allows for a simple evaluation of the jump-term as the mesh is always
conforming. The cost of flipping the mesh around its symmetry plane in time scales with the number
of nodes, which makes it computationally cheaper than an additional update of the mesh to enforce
conformity or the evaluation of a projection. We validate the approach on various physical problems
with and without deforming domains.

We present a postprocessing layer for deformable image registration to make a registration field
more diffeomorphic by encouraging Jacobians of the transformation to be positive. Diffeomorphic
image registration is important for medical imaging studies because of the properties like invertibility,
smoothness of the transformation, and topology preservation/non-folding of the grid. Violation
of these properties can lead to destruction of the neighbourhood and the connectivity of anatomical
structures during image registration. Most of the recent deep learning methods do not explicitly
address this folding problem and try to solve it with a smoothness regularization on the registration
field. In this paper, we propose a differentiable layer, which takes any registration field as its
input, computes exponential of the Jacobian matrices of the input and reconstructs a new registration
field from the exponentiated Jacobian matrices using Poisson reconstruction. Our proposed Poisson
reconstruction loss enforces positive Jacobians for the final registration field. Thus, our method
acts as a post-processing layer without any learnable parameters of its own and can be placed at the
end of any deep learning pipeline to form an end-to-end learnable framework. We show the effectiveness
of our proposed method for a popular deep learning registration method Voxelmorph and evaluate
it with a dataset containing 3D brain MRI scans. Our results show that our post-processing can effectively
decrease the number of non-positive Jacobians by a significant amount without any noticeable deterioration
of the registration accuracy, thus making the registration field more diffeomorphic. Our code

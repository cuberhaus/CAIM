Parallel computing in Gaussian process calculations becomes necessary for avoiding computational
and memory restrictions associated with large-scale environmental data science applications.
The evaluation of the Gaussian log-likelihood function requires O(n^2) storage and O(n^3) operations
where n is the number of geographical locations. Thus, computing the log-likelihood function with
a large number of locations requires exploiting the power of existing parallel computing hardware
systems, such as shared-memory, possibly equipped with GPUs, and distributed-memory systems,
to solve this computational complexity. In this paper, we advocate the use of ExaGeoStatR, a package
for exascale Geostatistics in R that supports a parallel computation of the exact maximum likelihood
function on a wide variety of parallel architectures. Parallelization in ExaGeoStatR depends
on breaking down the numerical linear algebra operations in the log-likelihood function into a
set of tasks and rendering them for a task-based programming model. The package can be used directly
through the R environment on parallel systems. Currently, ExaGeoStatR supports several maximum
likelihood computation variants such as exact, Diagonal Super Tile (DST), Tile Low-Rank (TLR)
approximations, and Mixed-Precision (MP). ExaGeoStatR also provides a tool to simulate large-scale
synthetic datasets. These datasets can help to assess different implementations of the maximum
log-likelihood approximation methods. Here, we demonstrate ExaGeoStatR by illustrating its
implementation details, analyzing its performance on various parallel architectures, and assessing
its accuracy using synthetic datasets with up to 250K observations. We provide a hands-on tutorial
to analyze a sea surface temperature real dataset. The performance evaluation involves comparisons
with the popular packages geoR and fields for exact likelihood evaluation.

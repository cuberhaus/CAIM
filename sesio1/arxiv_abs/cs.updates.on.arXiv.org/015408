Background Sepsis is one of the most life-threatening circumstances for critically ill patients
in the US, while a standardized criteria for sepsis identification is still under development.
Disparities in social determinants of sepsis patients can interfere with the risk prediction performances
using machine learning. Methods Disparities in social determinants, including race, gender,
marital status, insurance types and languages, among patients identified by six available sepsis
criteria were revealed by forest plots. Sixteen machine learning classifiers were trained to predict
in-hospital mortality for sepsis patients. The performance of the trained model was tested on the
entire randomly conducted test set and each sub-population built based on each of the following
social determinants: race, gender, marital status, insurance type, and language. Results We analyzed
a total of 11,791 critical care patients from the MIMIC-III database. Within the population identified
by each sepsis identification method, significant differences were observed among sub-populations
regarding race, marital status, insurance type, and language. On the 5,783 sepsis patients identified
by the Sepsis-3 criteria statistically significant performance decreases for mortality prediction
were observed when applying the trained machine learning model on Asian and Hispanic patients.
With pairwise comparison, we detected performance discrepancies in mortality prediction between
Asian and White patients, Asians and patients of other races, as well as English-speaking and Spanish-speaking
patients. Conclusions Disparities in proportions of patients identified by various sepsis criteria
were detected among the different social determinant groups. To achieve accurate diagnosis, a
versatile diagnostic system for sepsis is needed to overcome the social determinant disparities
of patients.

Machine learning models based on sensitive data in the real-world promise advances in areas ranging
from medical screening to disease outbreaks, agriculture, industry, defense science, and more.
In many applications, learning participant communication rounds benefit from collecting their
own private data sets, teaching detailed machine learning models on the real data, and sharing the
benefits of using these models. Due to existing privacy and security concerns, most people avoid
sensitive data sharing for training. Without each user demonstrating their local data to a central
server, Federated Learning allows various parties to train a machine learning algorithm on their
shared data jointly. This method of collective privacy learning results in the expense of important
communication during training. Most large-scale machine-learning applications require decentralized
learning based on data sets generated on various devices and places. Such datasets represent an
essential obstacle to decentralized learning, as their diverse contexts contribute to significant
differences in the delivery of data across devices and locations. Researchers have proposed several
ways to achieve data privacy in Federated Learning systems. However, there are still challenges
with homogeneous local data. This research approach is to select nodes (users) to share their data
in Federated Learning for independent data-based equilibrium to improve accuracy, reduce training
time, and increase convergence. Therefore, this research presents a combined Deep-QReinforcement
Learning Ensemble based on Spectral Clustering called DQRE-SCnet to choose a subset of devices
in each communication round. Based on the results, it has been displayed that it is possible to decrease
the number of communication rounds needed in Federated Learning.

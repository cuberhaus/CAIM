Protein Structure Prediction (PSP) is an unsolved problem in the field of computational biology.
The problem of protein structure prediction is about predicting the native conformation of a protein,
while its sequence of amino acids is known. Regarding processing limitations of current computer
systems, all-atom simulations for proteins are typically unpractical; several reduced models
of proteins have been proposed. Additionally, due to intrinsic hardness of calculations even in
reduced models, many computational methods mainly based on artificial intelligence have been
proposed to solve the problem. Agent-based modeling is a relatively new method for modeling systems
composed of interacting items. In this paper we proposed a new approach for protein structure prediction
by using agent-based modeling (ABM) in two dimensional hydrophobic-hydrophilic model. We broke
the whole process of protein structure prediction into two steps: the first step, which was introduced
in our previous paper, is about biasing the linear sequence to gain a primary energy, and the next
step, which will be explained in this paper, is about using ABM with a predefined set of rules, to find
the best conformation in the least possible amount of time and steps. This method was implemented
in NETLOGO. We have tested this algorithm on several benchmark sequences ranging from 20 to 50-mers
in two dimensional Hydrophobic-Hydrophilic lattice models. Comparing to the result of the other
algorithms, our method is capable of finding the best known conformations in a significantly shorter
time. A major problem in PSP simulation is that as the sequence length increases the time consumed
to predict a valid structure will exponentially increase. In contrast, by using MAS2HP the effect
of increase in sequence length on spent time has changed from exponentially to linear.

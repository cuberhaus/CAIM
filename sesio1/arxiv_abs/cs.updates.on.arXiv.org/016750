Website fingerprinting attack (WFA) aims to deanonymize the website a user is visiting through
anonymous networks channels (e.g., Tor). Despite of remarkable progress in the past years, most
existing methods make implicitly a couple of artificial assumptions that (1) only a single website
(i.e., single-tab) is visited each time, and (2) website fingerprinting data are pre-trimmed into
a single trace per website manually. In reality, a user often open multiple tabs for multiple websites
spontaneously. Indeed, this multi-tab WFA (MT-WFA) setting has been studied in a few recent works,
but all of them still fail to fully respect the real-world situations. In particular, the overlapping
challenge between website fingerprinting has never been investigated in depth. In this work, we
redefine the problem of MT-WFA as detecting multiple monitored traces, given a natural untrimmed
traffic data including monitored traces, unmonitored traces, and potentially unconstrained
overlapping between them. This eliminates the above assumptions, going beyond the conventional
single website fingerprint classification perspective taken by all previous WFA methods. To tackle
this realistic MT-WFA problem, we formulate a novel Website Fingerprint Detection (WFD) model
capable of detecting accurately the start and end points of all the monitored traces and classifying
them jointly, given long, untrimmed raw traffic data. WFD is end-to-end, with the trace localization
and website classification integrated in a single unified pipeline. To enable quantitative evaluation
in our MT-WFA setting, we introduce new performance metrics. Extensive experiments on several
newly constructed benchmarks show that our WFD outperforms the state-of-the-art alternative
methods in both accuracy and efficiency by a large margin, even with a very small training set. Code

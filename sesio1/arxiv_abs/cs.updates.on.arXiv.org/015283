Communication noise is a common feature in several real-world scenarios where systems of agents
need to communicate in order to pursue some collective task. In particular, many biologically inspired
systems that try to achieve agreements on some opinion must implement resilient dynamics that are
not strongly affected by noisy communications. In this work, we study the popular 3-Majority dynamics,
an opinion dynamics which has been proved to be an efficient protocol for the majority consensus
problem, in which we introduce a simple feature of uniform communication noise, following (d'Amore
et al. 2020). We prove that in the fully connected communication network of n agents and in the binary
opinion case, the process induced by the 3-Majority dynamics exhibits a phase transition. For a
noise probability $p < 1/3$, the dynamics reaches in logarithmic time an almost-consensus metastable
phase which lasts for a polynomial number of rounds with high probability. Furthermore, departing
from previous analyses, we further characterize this phase by showing that there exists an attractive
equilibrium value $s_{\text{eq}} \in [n]$ for the bias of the system, i.e. the difference between
the majority community size and the minority one. Moreover, the agreement opinion turns out to be
the initial majority one if the bias towards it is of magnitude $\Omega(\sqrt{n\log n})$ in the initial
configuration. If, instead, $p > 1/3$, no form of consensus is possible, and any information regarding
the initial majority opinion is lost in logarithmic time with high probability. Despite more communications
per-round are allowed, the 3-Majority dynamics surprisingly turns out to be less resilient to noise
than the Undecided-State dynamics (d'Amore et al. 2020), whose noise threshold value is $p = 1/2$.

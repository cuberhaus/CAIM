A decentralized approach for joint frequency and phase synchronization in distributed antenna
arrays is presented. The nodes in the array share their frequencies and phases with their neighboring
nodes to align these parameters across the array. Our signal model includes the frequency drifts
and phase jitters of the local oscillators as well as the frequency and phase estimation errors at
the nodes and models them using practical statistics. A decentralized frequency and phase consensus
(DFPC) algorithm is proposed which uses an average consensus method in which each node in the array
iteratively updates its frequency and phase by computing an average of the frequencies and phases
of their neighboring nodes. Simulation results show that upon convergence the DFPC algorithm can
align the frequencies and phases of all the nodes up to a residual phase error that is governed by the
oscillators and the estimation errors. To reduce this residual phase error and thus improve the
synchronization between the nodes, a Kalman filter based decentralized frequency and phase consensus
(KF-DFPC) algorithm is presented. The total residual phase error at the convergence of the KF-DFPC
and DFPC algorithms is derived theoretically. The synchronization performances of these algorithms
are compared to each other in light of this theoretical residual phase error by varying the duration
of the signals, connectivity of the nodes, the number of nodes in the array, and signal to noise ratio
of the transmitted signals. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed KF-DFPC algorithm
converges in fewer iterations than the DFPC algorithm. Furthermore, for shorter intervals between
local information broadcasts, the KF-DFPC algorithm significantly outperforms the DFPC algorithm
in reducing the residual total phase error, irrespective of the signal to noise ratio of the received
signals.

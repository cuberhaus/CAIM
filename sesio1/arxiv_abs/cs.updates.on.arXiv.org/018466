Compared with chest X-ray (CXR) imaging, which is a single image projected from the front of the patient,
chest digital tomosynthesis (CDTS) imaging can be more advantageous for lung lesion detection
because it acquires multiple images projected from multiple angles of the patient. Various clinical
comparative analysis and verification studies have been reported to demonstrate this, but there
were no artificial intelligence (AI)-based comparative analysis studies. Existing AI-based
computer-aided detection (CAD) systems for lung lesion diagnosis have been developed mainly based
on CXR images; however, CAD-based on CDTS, which uses multi-angle images of patients in various
directions, has not been proposed and verified for its usefulness compared to CXR-based counterparts.
This study develops/tests a CDTS-based AI CAD system to detect lung lesions to demonstrate performance
improvements compared to CXR-based AI CAD. We used multiple projection images as input for the CDTS-based
AI model and a single-projection image as input for the CXR-based AI model to fairly compare and evaluate
the performance between models. The proposed CDTS-based AI CAD system yielded sensitivities of
0.782 and 0.785 and accuracies of 0.895 and 0.837 for the performance of detecting tuberculosis
and pneumonia, respectively, against normal subjects. These results show higher performance
than sensitivities of 0.728 and 0.698 and accuracies of 0.874 and 0.826 for detecting tuberculosis
and pneumonia through the CXR-based AI CAD, which only uses a single projection image in the frontal
direction. We found that CDTS-based AI CAD improved the sensitivity of tuberculosis and pneumonia
by 5.4% and 8.7% respectively, compared to CXR-based AI CAD without loss of accuracy. Therefore,
we comparatively prove that CDTS-based AI CAD technology can improve performance more than CXR,
enhancing the clinical applicability of CDTS.

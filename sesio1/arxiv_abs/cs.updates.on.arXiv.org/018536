To train robust deep neural networks (DNNs), we systematically study several target modification
approaches, which include output regularisation, self and non-self label correction (LC). Three
key issues are discovered: (1) Self LC is the most appealing as it exploits its own knowledge and requires
no extra models. However, how to automatically decide the trust degree of a learner as training goes
is not well answered in the literature. (2) Some methods penalise while the others reward low-entropy
predictions, prompting us to ask which one is better. (3) Using the standard training setting, a
trained network is of low confidence when severe noise exists, making it hard to leverage its high-entropy
self knowledge. To resolve the issue (1), taking two well-accepted propositions--deep neural
networks learn meaningful patterns before fitting noise and minimum entropy regularisation principle--we
propose a novel end-to-end method named ProSelfLC, which is designed according to learning time
and entropy. Specifically, given a data point, we progressively increase trust in its predicted
label distribution versus its annotated one if a model has been trained for enough time and the prediction
is of low entropy (high confidence). For the issue (2), according to ProSelfLC, we empirically prove
that it is better to redefine a meaningful low-entropy status and optimise the learner toward it.
This serves as a defence of entropy minimisation. To address the issue (3), we decrease the entropy
of self knowledge using a low temperature before exploiting it to correct labels, so that the revised
labels redefine a low-entropy target state. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ProSelfLC through
extensive experiments in both clean and noisy settings, and on both image and protein datasets.

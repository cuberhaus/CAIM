In this paper, we consider the restoration and reconstruction of piecewise constant objects in
two and three dimensions using PaLEnTIR, a significantly enhanced Parametric level set (PaLS)
model relative to the current state-of-the-art. The primary contribution of this paper is a new
PaLS formulation which requires only a single level set function to recover a scene with piecewise
constant objects possessing multiple unknown contrasts. Our model offers distinct advantages
over current approaches to the multi-contrast, multi-object problem, all of which require multiple
level sets and explicit estimation of the contrast magnitudes. Given upper and lower bounds on the
contrast, our approach is able to recover objects with any distribution of contrasts and eliminates
the need to know either the number of contrasts in a given scene or their values. We provide an iterative
process for finding these space-varying contrast limits. Relative to most PaLS methods which employ
radial basis functions (RBFs), our model makes use of non-isotropic basis functions, thereby expanding
the class of shapes that a PaLS model of a given complexity can approximate. Finally, PaLEnTIR improves
the conditioning of the Jacobian matrix required as part of the parameter identification process
and consequently accelerates the optimization methods by controlling the magnitude of the PaLS
expansion coefficients, fixing the centers of the basis functions, and the uniqueness of parametric
to image mappings provided by the new parameterization. We demonstrate the performance of the new
approach using both 2D and 3D variants of X-ray computed tomography, diffuse optical tomography
(DOT), denoising, deconvolution problems. Application to experimental sparse CT data and simulated
data with different types of noise are performed to further validate the proposed method.

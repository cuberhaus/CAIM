Motivated by potential financial gain, companies may hire fraudster groups to write fake reviews
to either demote competitors or promote their own businesses. Such groups are considerably more
successful in misleading customers, as people are more likely to be influenced by the opinion of
a large group. To detect such groups, a common model is to represent fraudster groups' static networks,
consequently overlooking the longitudinal behavior of a reviewer thus the dynamics of co-review
relations among reviewers in a group. Hence, these approaches are incapable of excluding outlier
reviewers, which are fraudsters intentionally camouflaging themselves in a group and genuine
reviewers happen to co-review in fraudster groups. To address this issue, in this work, we propose
to first capitalize on the effectiveness of the HIN-RNN in both reviewers' representation learning
while capturing the collaboration between reviewers, we first utilize the HIN-RNN to model the
co-review relations of reviewers in a group in a fixed time window of 28 days. We refer to this as spatial
relation learning representation to signify the generalisability of this work to other networked
scenarios. Then we use an RNN on the spatial relations to predict the spatio-temporal relations
of reviewers in the group. In the third step, a Graph Convolution Network (GCN) refines the reviewers'
vector representations using these predicted relations. These refined representations are then
used to remove outlier reviewers. The average of the remaining reviewers' representation is then
fed to a simple fully connected layer to predict if the group is a fraudster group or not. Exhaustive
experiments of the proposed approach showed a 5% (4%), 12% (5%), 12% (5%) improvement over three
of the most recent approaches on precision, recall, and F1-value over the Yelp (Amazon) dataset,
respectively.

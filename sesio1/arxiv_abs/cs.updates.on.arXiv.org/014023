In the recent decade, high-throughput plant phenotyping techniques, which combine non-invasive
image analysis and machine learning, have been successfully applied to identify and quantify plant
health and diseases. However, these techniques usually do not consider the progressive nature
of plant stress and often require images showing severe signs of stress to ensure high confidence
detection, thereby reducing the feasibility for early detection and recovery of plants under stress.
To overcome the problem mentioned above, we propose a deep learning pipeline for the temporal analysis
of the visual changes induced in the plant due to stress and apply it to the specific water stress identification
case in Chickpea plant shoot images. For this, we have considered an image dataset of two chickpea
varieties JG-62 and Pusa-372, under three water stress conditions; control, young seedling, and
before flowering, captured over five months. We have employed a variant of Convolutional Neural
Network - Long Short Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) network to learn spatio-temporal patterns from the
chickpea plant dataset and use them for water stress classification. Our model has achieved ceiling
level classification performance of 98.52% on JG-62 and 97.78% on Pusa-372 chickpea plant data
and has outperformed the best reported time-invariant technique by at least 14% for both JG-62 and
Pusa-372 species, to the best of our knowledge. Furthermore, our CNN-LSTM model has demonstrated
robustness to noisy input, with a less than 2.5% dip in average model accuracy and a small standard
deviation about the mean for both species. Lastly, we have performed an ablation study to analyze
the performance of the CNN-LSTM model by decreasing the number of temporal session data used for
training.

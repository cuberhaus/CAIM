Critical evaluation and understanding of ship responses in the ocean is important for not only the
design and engineering of future platforms but also the operation and safety of those that are currently
deployed. Simulations or experiments are typically performed in nominal sea conditions during
ship design or prior to deployment and the results may not be reflective of the instantaneous state
of the vessel and the ocean environment while deployed. Short-term temporal predictions of ship
responses given the current wave environment and ship state would enable enhanced decision-making
onboard for both manned and unmanned vessels. However, the current state-of-the-art in numerical
hydrodynamic simulation tools are too computationally expensive to be employed for real-time
ship motion forecasting and the computationally efficient tools are too low fidelity to provide
accurate responses. A methodology is developed with long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks
to represent the motions of a free running David Taylor Model Basin (DTMB) 5415 destroyer operating
at 20 knots in Sea State 7 stern-quartering irregular seas. Case studies are performed for both course-keeping
and turning circle scenarios. An estimate of the vessel's encounter frame is made with the trajectories
observed in the training dataset. Wave elevation time histories are given by artificial wave probes
that travel with the estimated encounter frame and serve as input into the neural network, while
the output is the 6-DOF temporal ship motion response. Overall, the neural network is able to predict
the temporal response of the ship due to unseen waves accurately, which makes this methodology suitable
for system identification and real-time ship motion forecasting. The methodology, the dependence
of model accuracy on wave probe and training data quantity and the estimated encounter frame are
all detailed.

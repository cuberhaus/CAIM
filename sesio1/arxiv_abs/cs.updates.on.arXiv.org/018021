Graph autoencoders (GAE) and variational graph autoencoders (VGAE) emerged as two powerful groups
of unsupervised node embedding methods, with various applications to graph-based machine learning
problems such as link prediction and community detection. Nonetheless, at the beginning of this
Ph.D. project, GAE and VGAE models were also suffering from key limitations, preventing them from
being adopted in the industry. In this thesis, we present several contributions to improve these
models, with the general aim of facilitating their use to address industrial-level problems involving
graph representations. Firstly, we propose two strategies to overcome the scalability issues
of previous GAE and VGAE models, permitting to effectively train these models on large graphs with
millions of nodes and edges. These strategies leverage graph degeneracy and stochastic subgraph
decoding techniques, respectively. Besides, we introduce Gravity-Inspired GAE and VGAE, providing
the first extensions of these models for directed graphs, that are ubiquitous in industrial applications.
We also consider extensions of GAE and VGAE models for dynamic graphs. Furthermore, we argue that
GAE and VGAE models are often unnecessarily complex, and we propose to simplify them by leveraging
linear encoders. Lastly, we introduce Modularity-Aware GAE and VGAE to improve community detection
on graphs, while jointly preserving good performances on link prediction. In the last part of this
thesis, we evaluate our methods on several graphs extracted from the music streaming service Deezer.
We put the emphasis on graph-based music recommendation problems. In particular, we show that our
methods can improve the detection of communities of similar musical items to recommend to users,
that they can effectively rank similar artists in a cold start setting, and that they permit modeling
the music genre perception across cultures.

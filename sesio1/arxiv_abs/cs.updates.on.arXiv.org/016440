In the clinical settings, during digital examination of histopathological slides, the pathologist
annotate the slides by marking the rough boundary around the suspected tumour region. The marking
or annotation is generally represented as a polygonal boundary that covers the extent of the tumour
in the slide. These polygonal markings are difficult to imitate through CAD techniques since the
tumour regions are heterogeneous and hence segmenting them would require exhaustive pixel wise
ground truth annotation. Therefore, for CAD analysis, the ground truths are generally annotated
by pathologist explicitly for research purposes. However, this kind of annotation which is generally
required for semantic or instance segmentation is time consuming and tedious. In this proposed
work, therefore, we have tried to imitate pathologist like annotation by segmenting tumour extents
by polygonal boundaries. For polygon like annotation or segmentation, we have used Active Contours
whose vertices or snake points move towards the boundary of the object of interest to find the region
of minimum energy. To penalize the Active Contour we used modified U-Net architecture for learning
penalization values. The proposed hybrid deep learning model fuses the modern deep learning segmentation
algorithm with traditional Active Contours segmentation technique. The model is tested against
both state-of-the-art semantic segmentation and hybrid models for performance evaluation against
contemporary work. The results obtained show that the pathologist like annotation could be achieved
by developing such hybrid models that integrate the domain knowledge through classical segmentation
methods like Active Contours and global knowledge through semantic segmentation deep learning
models.

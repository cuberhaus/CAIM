We study the complexity of determining the edge connectivity of a simple graph with cut queries.
We show that (i) there is a bounded-error randomized algorithm that computes edge connectivity
with $O(n)$ cut queries, and (ii) there is a bounded-error quantum algorithm that computes edge
connectivity with $\~O(\sqrt{n})$ cut queries. We prove these results using a new technique called
"star contraction" to randomly contract edges of a graph while preserving non-trivial minimum
cuts. In star contraction vertices randomly contract an edge incident on a small set of randomly
chosen vertices. In contrast to the related 2-out contraction technique of Ghaffari, Nowicki,
and Thorup [SODA'20], star contraction only contracts vertex-disjoint star subgraphs, which
allows it to be efficiently implemented via cut queries. The $O(n)$ bound from item (i) was not known
even for the simpler problem of connectivity, and improves the $O(n\log^3 n)$ bound by Rubinstein,
Schramm, and Weinberg [ITCS'18]. The bound is tight under the reasonable conjecture that the randomized
communication complexity of connectivity is $\Omega(n\log n)$, an open question since the seminal
work of Babai, Frankl, and Simon [FOCS'86]. The bound also excludes using edge connectivity on simple
graphs to prove a superlinear randomized query lower bound for minimizing a symmetric submodular
function. Item (ii) gives a nearly-quadratic separation with the randomized complexity and addresses
an open question of Lee, Santha, and Zhang [SODA'21]. The algorithm can also be viewed as making $\~O(\sqrt{n})$
matrix-vector multiplication queries to the adjacency matrix. Finally, we demonstrate the use
of star contraction outside of the cut query setting by designing a one-pass semi-streaming algorithm
for computing edge connectivity in the vertex arrival setting. This contrasts with the edge arrival
setting where two passes are required.

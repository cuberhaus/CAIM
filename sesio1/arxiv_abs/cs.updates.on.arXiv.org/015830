Many statistical machine approaches could ultimately highlight novel features of the etiology
of complex diseases by analyzing multi-omics data. However, they are sensitive to some deviations
in distribution when the observed samples are potentially contaminated with adversarial corrupted
outliers (e.g., a fictional data distribution). Likewise, statistical advances lag in supporting
comprehensive data-driven analyses of complex multi-omics data integration. We propose a novel
non-linear M-estimator-based approach, "robust kernel machine regression (RobKMR)," to improve
the robustness of statistical machine regression and the diversity of fictional data to examine
the higher-order composite effect of multi-omics datasets. We address a robust kernel-centered
Gram matrix to estimate the model parameters accurately. We also propose a robust score test to assess
the marginal and joint Hadamard product of features from multi-omics data. We apply our proposed
approach to a multi-omics dataset of osteoporosis (OP) from Caucasian females. Experiments demonstrate
that the proposed approach effectively identifies the inter-related risk factors of OP. With solid
evidence (p-value = 0.00001), biological validations, network-based analysis, causal inference,
and drug repurposing, the selected three triplets ((DKK1, SMTN, DRGX), (MTND5, FASTKD2, CSMD3),
(MTND5, COG3, CSMD3)) are significant biomarkers and directly relate to BMD. Overall, the top three
selected genes (DKK1, MTND5, FASTKD2) and one gene (SIDT1 at p-value= 0.001) significantly bond
with four drugs- Tacrolimus, Ibandronate, Alendronate, and Bazedoxifene out of 30 candidates
for drug repurposing in OP. Further, the proposed approach can be applied to any disease model where
multi-omics datasets are available.

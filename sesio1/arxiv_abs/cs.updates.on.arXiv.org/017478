Smart contracts are cryptographic protocols that are enforced without a judiciary. Smart contracts
are used occasionally in Bitcoin and are prevalent in Ethereum. Public quantum money improves upon
cash we use today, yet the current constructions do not enable smart contracts. In this work, we define
and introduce quantum payment schemes, and show how to implement prudent contracts -- a non-trivial
subset of the functionality that a network such as Ethereum provides. Examples discussed include:
multi-signature wallets in which funds can be spent by any 2-out-of-3 owners; restricted accounts
that can send funds only to designated destinations; and "colored coins" that can represent stocks
that can be freely traded, and their owner would receive dividends. Our approach is not as universal
as the one used in Ethereum since we do not reach a consensus regarding the state of a ledger. We call
our proposal prudent contracts to reflect this. The main building block is either quantum tokens
for digital signatures (Ben-David and Sattath QCrypt'17, Coladangelo et al. Crypto'21), semi-quantum
tokens for digital signatures (Shmueli'22) or one-shot signatures (Amos et al. STOC'20). The solution
has all the benefits of public quantum money: no mining is necessary, and the security model is standard
(e.g., it is not susceptible to 51\% attacks, as in Bitcoin). Our one-shot signature construction
can be used to upgrade the Bitcoin network to a quantum payment scheme. Notable advantages of this
approach are: transactions are locally verifiable and without latency, the throughput is unbounded,
and most importantly, it would remove the need for Bitcoin mining. Our approach requires a universal
large-scale quantum computer and long-term quantum memory; hence we do not expect it to be implementable
in the next few years.

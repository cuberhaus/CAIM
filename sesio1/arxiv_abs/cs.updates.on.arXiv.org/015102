Considering the rapidly increasing number of academic papers, searching for and citing appropriate
references has become a non-trial task during the wiring of papers. Recommending a handful of candidate
papers to a manuscript before publication could ease the burden of the authors, and help the reviewers
to check the completeness of the cited resources. Conventional approaches on citation recommendation
generally consider recommending one ground-truth citation for a query context from an input manuscript,
but lack of consideration on co-citation recommendations. However, a piece of context often needs
to be supported by two or more co-citation pairs. Here, we propose a novel scientific paper modeling
for citation recommendations, namely Multi-Positive BERT Model for Citation Recommendation
(MP-BERT4CR), complied with a series of Multi-Positive Triplet objectives to recommend multiple
positive citations for a query context. The proposed approach has the following advantages: First,
the proposed multi-positive objectives are effective to recommend multiple positive candidates.
Second, we adopt noise distributions which are built based on the historical co-citation frequencies,
so that MP-BERT4CR is not only effective on recommending high-frequent co-citation pairs; but
also the performances on retrieving the low-frequent ones are significantly improved. Third,
we propose a dynamic context sampling strategy which captures the ``macro-scoped'' citing intents
from a manuscript and empowers the citation embeddings to be content-dependent, which allow the
algorithm to further improve the performances. Single and multiple positive recommendation experiments
testified that MP-BERT4CR delivered significant improvements. In addition, MP-BERT4CR are also
effective in retrieving the full list of co-citations, and historically low-frequent co-citation
pairs compared with the prior works.

Blockchain systems come with a promise of decentralization that often stumbles on a roadblock when
key decisions about modifying the software codebase need to be made. This is attested by the fact
that both of the two major cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, have undergone hard forks that
resulted in the creation of alternative systems, creating confusion and opportunities for fraudulent
activities. These events, and numerous others, underscore the importance of Blockchain governance,
namely the set of processes that blockchain platforms utilize in order to perform decision-making
and converge to a widely accepted direction for the system to evolve. While a rich topic of study in
other areas, governance of blockchain platforms is lacking a well established set of methods and
practices that are adopted industry wide. This makes the topic of blockchain governance a fertile
domain for a thorough systematization that we undertake in this work. We start by distilling a comprehensive
array of properties for sound governance systems drawn from academic sources as well as grey literature
of election systems and blockchain white papers. These are divided into seven categories, confidentiality,
verifiability, accountability, sustainability, Pareto efficiency, suffrage and liveness that
capture the whole spectrum of desiderata of governance systems. We proceed to classify ten well-documented
blockchain systems. While all properties are satisfied, even partially, by at least one system,
no system that satisfies most of them. Our work lays out a foundation for assessing blockchain governance
processes. While it highlights shortcomings and deficiencies in currently deployed systems,
it can also be a catalyst for improving these processes to the highest possible standard with appropriate
trade-offs, something direly needed for blockchain platforms to operate effectively in the long
term.

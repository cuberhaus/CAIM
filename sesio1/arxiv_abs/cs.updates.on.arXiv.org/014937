A flexible treatment for gas- and aerosol-phase chemical processes has been developed for models
of diverse scale, from box models up to global models. At the core of this novel framework is an "abstracted
aerosol representation" that allows a given chemical mechanism to be solved in atmospheric models
with different aerosol representations (e.g., sectional, modal, or particle-resolved). This
is accomplished by treating aerosols as a collection of condensed phases that are implemented according
to the aerosol representation of the host model. The framework also allows multiple chemical processes
(e.g., gas- and aerosol-phase chemical reactions, emissions, deposition, photolysis, and mass-transfer)
to be solved simultaneously as a single system. The flexibility of the model is achieved by (1) using
an object-oriented design that facilitates extensibility to new types of chemical processes and
to new ways of representing aerosol systems; (2) runtime model configuration using JSON input files
that permits making changes to any part of the chemical mechanism without recompiling the model;
this widely used, human-readable format allows entire gas- and aerosol-phase chemical mechanisms
to be described with as much complexity as necessary; and (3) automated comprehensive testing that
ensures stability of the code as new functionality is introduced. Together, these design choices
enable users to build a customized multiphase mechanism, without having to handle pre-processors,
solvers or compilers. This new treatment compiles as a stand-alone library and has been deployed
in the particle-resolved PartMC model and in the MONARCH chemical weather prediction system for
use at regional and global scales. Results from the initial deployment will be discussed, along
with future extension to more complex gas-aerosol systems, and the integration of GPU-based solvers.

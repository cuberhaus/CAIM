Geoscience domain experts traditionally correlate formation tops in the subsurface using geophysical
well logs (known as well-log correlation) by-hand. Based on individual well log interpretation
and well-to-well comparisons, these correlations are done in the context of depositional models
within a stratigraphic framework. Recently, many researchers have focused on automatic well-log
correlation using a variety of warping algorithms that measure well similarity, and both unsupervised
and supervised machine learning methods that assign categorical labels based on known tops in many
other wells. These methods require a standardized suite of digital well logs (i.e. gamma ray logs
for every well) along with the depth to the top of the formations, which might not be available in many
cases. Herein, we propose a method that does not use geophysical well logs for correlation, but rather
uses already picked tops in multiple wells to recommend the depth to the remaining unpicked tops
in the wells. This recommender system calculates the depth to all formation tops in all the wells
for two different datasets in two different basins. The Teapot Dome dataset is composed of lithostratigraphic
formation tops, and the Mannville Group dataset is composed of sequence-stratigraphic (representing
multiple lithologic groups within a stratigraphic unit) formation tops. For the demonstration,
mean absolute error and root mean squared error of four-fold cross-validation compares the recommender
system predictions to the ground truth human interpretations. The recommender system is competitive
and often outperforms state of the art spline interpolation methods. Lastly, increasing the size
of the training dataset decreases the prediction error, and that variance in error decreases with
increasing formation tops picked in each formation and well for the lithostratigraphic top picks.

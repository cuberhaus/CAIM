This thesis introduces the wide multiple baseline stereo (WxBS) problem. WxBS, a generalization
of the standard wide baseline stereo problem, considers the matching of images that simultaneously
differ in more than one image acquisition factor such as viewpoint, illumination, sensor type,
or where object appearance changes significantly, e.g., over time. A new dataset with the ground
truth, evaluation metric and baselines has been introduced. The thesis presents the following
improvements of the WxBS pipeline. (i) A loss function, called HardNeg, for learning a local image
descriptor that relies on hard negative mining within a mini-batch and on the maximization of the
distance between the closest positive and the closest negative patches. (ii) The descriptor trained
with the HardNeg loss, called HardNet, is compact and shows state-of-the-art performance in standard
matching, patch verification and retrieval benchmarks. (iii) A method for learning the affine
shape, orientation, and potentially other parameters related to geometric and appearance properties
of local features. (iv) A tentative correspondences generation strategy which generalizes the
standard first to second closest distance ratio is presented. The selection strategy, which shows
performance superior to the standard method, is applicable to either hard-engineered descriptors
like SIFT, LIOP, and MROGH or deeply learned like HardNet. (v) A feedback loop is introduced for the
two-view matching problem, resulting in MODS -- matching with on-demand view synthesis -- algorithm.
MODS is an algorithm that handles a viewing angle difference even larger than the previous state-of-the-art
ASIFT algorithm, without a significant increase of computational cost over "standard" wide and
narrow baseline approaches. Last, but not least, a comprehensive benchmark for local features
and robust estimation algorithms is introduced.

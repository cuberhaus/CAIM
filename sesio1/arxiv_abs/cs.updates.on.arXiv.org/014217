With the onset of COVID-19 and the resulting shelter in place guidelines combined with remote working
practices, human mobility in 2020 has been dramatically impacted. Existing studies typically
examine whether mobility in specific localities increases or decreases at specific points in time
and relate these changes to certain pandemic and policy events. In this paper, we study mobility
change in the US through a five-step process using mobility footprint data. (Step 1) Propose the
delta Time Spent in Public Places (Delta-TSPP) as a measure to quantify daily changes in mobility
for each US county from 2019-2020. (Step 2) Conduct Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce
the Delta-TSPP time series of each county to lower-dimensional latent components of change in mobility.
(Step 3) Conduct clustering analysis to find counties that exhibit similar latent components.
(Step 4) Investigate local and global spatial autocorrelation for each component. (Step 5) Conduct
correlation analysis to investigate how various population characteristics and behavior correlate
with mobility patterns. Results show that by describing each county as a linear combination of the
three latent components, we can explain 59% of the variation in mobility trends across all US counties.
Specifically, change in mobility in 2020 for US counties can be explained as a combination of three
latent components: 1) long-term reduction in mobility, 2) no change in mobility, and 3) short-term
reduction in mobility. We observe significant correlations between the three latent components
of mobility change and various population characteristics, including political leaning, population,
COVID-19 cases and deaths, and unemployment. We find that our analysis provides a comprehensive
understanding of mobility change in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The number and diversity of consumer devices are growing rapidly, alongside their target applications'
memory consumption. Unfortunately, DRAM scalability is becoming a limiting factor to the available
memory capacity in consumer devices. As a potential solution, manufacturers have introduced emerging
non-volatile memories (NVMs) into the market, which can be used to increase the memory capacity
of consumer devices by augmenting or replacing DRAM. Since entirely replacing DRAM with NVM in consumer
devices imposes large system integration and design challenges, recent works propose extending
the total main memory space available to applications by using NVM as swap space for DRAM. However,
no prior work analyzes the implications of enabling a real NVM-based swap space in real consumer
devices. In this work, we provide the first analysis of the impact of extending the main memory space
of consumer devices using off-the-shelf NVMs. We extensively examine system performance and energy
consumption when the NVM device is used as swap space for DRAM main memory to effectively extend the
main memory capacity. For our analyses, we equip real web-based Chromebook computers with the Intel
Optane SSD, which is a state-of-the-art low-latency NVM-based SSD device. We compare the performance
and energy consumption of interactive workloads running on our Chromebook with NVM-based swap
space, where the Intel Optane SSD capacity is used as swap space to extend main memory capacity, against
two state-of-the-art systems: (i) a baseline system with double the amount of DRAM than the system
with the NVM-based swap space; and (ii) a system where the Intel Optane SSD is naively replaced with
a state-of-the-art (yet slower) off-the-shelf NAND-flash-based SSD, which we use as a swap space
of equivalent size as the NVM-based swap space.

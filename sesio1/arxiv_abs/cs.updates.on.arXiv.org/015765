During Australia's unprecedented bushfires in 2019-2020, misinformation blaming arson resurfaced
on Twitter using #ArsonEmergency. The extent to which bots were responsible for disseminating
and amplifying this misinformation has received scrutiny in the media and academic research. Here
we study Twitter communities spreading this misinformation during the population-level event,
and investigate the role of online communities and bots. Our in-depth investigation of the dynamics
of the discussion uses a phased approach -- before and after reporting of bots promoting the hashtag
was broadcast by the mainstream media. Though we did not find many bots, the most bot-like accounts
were social bots, which present as genuine humans. Further, we distilled meaningful quantitative
differences between two polarised communities in the Twitter discussion, resulting in the following
insights. First, Supporters of the arson narrative promoted misinformation by engaging others
directly with replies and mentions using hashtags and links to external sources. In response, Opposers
retweeted fact-based articles and official information. Second, Supporters were embedded throughout
their interaction networks, but Opposers obtained high centrality more efficiently despite their
peripheral positions. By the last phase, Opposers and unaffiliated accounts appeared to coordinate,
potentially reaching a broader audience. Finally, unaffiliated accounts shared the same URLs
as Opposers over Supporters by a ratio of 9:1 in the last phase, having shared mostly Supporter URLs
in the first phase. This foiled Supporters' efforts, highlighting the value of exposing misinformation
campaigns. We speculate that the communication strategies observed here could be discoverable
in other misinformation-related discussions and could inform counter-strategies.

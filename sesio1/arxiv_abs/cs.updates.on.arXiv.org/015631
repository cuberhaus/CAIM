Deep convolutional neural networks have been demonstrated to be effective for SISR in recent years.
On the one hand, residual connections and dense connections have been used widely to ease forward
information and backward gradient flows to boost performance. However, current methods use residual
connections and dense connections separately in most network layers in a sub-optimal way. On the
other hand, although various networks and methods have been designed to improve computation efficiency,
save parameters, or utilize training data of multiple scale factors for each other to boost performance,
it either do super-resolution in HR space to have a high computation cost or can not share parameters
between models of different scale factors to save parameters and inference time. To tackle these
challenges, we propose an efficient single image super-resolution network using dual path connections
with multiple scale learning named as EMSRDPN. By introducing dual path connections inspired by
Dual Path Networks into EMSRDPN, it uses residual connections and dense connections in an integrated
way in most network layers. Dual path connections have the benefits of both reusing common features
of residual connections and exploring new features of dense connections to learn a good representation
for SISR. To utilize the feature correlation of multiple scale factors, EMSRDPN shares all network
units in LR space between different scale factors to learn shared features and only uses a separate
reconstruction unit for each scale factor, which can utilize training data of multiple scale factors
to help each other to boost performance, meanwhile which can save parameters and support shared
inference for multiple scale factors to improve efficiency. Experiments show EMSRDPN achieves
better performance and comparable or even better parameter and inference efficiency over SOTA
methods.

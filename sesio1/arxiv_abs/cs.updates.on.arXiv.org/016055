Detection of unwanted (`foreign') objects within products is a common procedure in many branches
of industry for maintaining production quality. X-ray imaging is a fast, non-invasive and widely
applicable method for foreign object detection. Deep learning has recently emerged as a powerful
approach for recognizing patterns in radiographs (i.e., X-ray images), enabling automated X-ray
based foreign object detection. However, these methods require a large number of training examples
and manual annotation of these examples is a subjective and laborious task. In this work, we propose
a Computed Tomography (CT) based method for producing training data for supervised learning of
foreign object detection, with minimal labour requirements. In our approach, a few representative
objects are CT scanned and reconstructed in 3D. The radiographs that have been acquired as part of
the CT-scan data serve as input for the machine learning method. High-quality ground truth locations
of the foreign objects are obtained through accurate 3D reconstructions and segmentations. Using
these segmented volumes, corresponding 2D segmentations are obtained by creating virtual projections.
We outline the benefits of objectively and reproducibly generating training data in this way compared
to conventional radiograph annotation. In addition, we show how the accuracy depends on the number
of objects used for the CT reconstructions. The results show that in this workflow generally only
a relatively small number of representative objects (i.e., fewer than 10) are needed to achieve
adequate detection performance in an industrial setting. Moreover, for real experimental data
we show that the workflow leads to higher foreign object detection accuracies than with standard
radiograph annotation.

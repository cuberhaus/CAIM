We study streaming algorithms in the white-box adversarial model, where the stream is chosen adaptively
by an adversary who observes the entire internal state of the algorithm at each time step. We show
that nontrivial algorithms are still possible. We first give a randomized algorithm for the $L_1$-heavy
hitters problem that outperforms the optimal deterministic Misra-Gries algorithm on long streams.
If the white-box adversary is computationally bounded, we use cryptographic techniques to reduce
the memory of our $L_1$-heavy hitters algorithm even further and to design a number of additional
algorithms for graph, string, and linear algebra problems. The existence of such algorithms is
surprising, as the streaming algorithm does not even have a secret key in this model, i.e., its state
is entirely known to the adversary. One algorithm we design is for estimating the number of distinct
elements in a stream with insertions and deletions achieving a multiplicative approximation and
sublinear space; such an algorithm is impossible for deterministic algorithms. We also give a general
technique that translates any two-player deterministic communication lower bound to a lower bound
for {\it randomized} algorithms robust to a white-box adversary. In particular, our results show
that for all $p\ge 0$, there exists a constant $C_p>1$ such that any $C_p$-approximation algorithm
for $F_p$ moment estimation in insertion-only streams with a white-box adversary requires $\Omega(n)$
space for a universe of size $n$. Similarly, there is a constant $C>1$ such that any $C$-approximation
algorithm in an insertion-only stream for matrix rank requires $\Omega(n)$ space with a white-box
adversary. Our algorithmic results based on cryptography thus show a separation between computationally
bounded and unbounded adversaries. (Abstract shortened to meet arXiv limits.)

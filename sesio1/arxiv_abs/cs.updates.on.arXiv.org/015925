We study the allocative challenges that governmental and nonprofit organizations face when tasked
with equitable and efficient rationing of a social good among agents whose needs (demands) realize
sequentially and are possibly correlated. To better achieve their dual aims of equity and efficiency,
social planners intend to maximize the minimum fill rate across agents, where each agent's fill
rate is determined by a one-time allocation that must be irrevocably decided upon its arrival. For
an arbitrarily correlated sequence of demands, we establish upper bounds on both the expected minimum
fill rate (ex-post fairness) and the minimum expected fill rate (ex-ante fairness) achievable
by any policy. Our bounds are parameterized by the number of agents and the expected demand-to-supply
ratio. Further, we show that for any set of parameters, a simple adaptive policy of projected proportional
allocation achieves the best possible fairness guarantee, ex post as well as ex ante. We obtain the
performance guarantees of our proposed adaptive policy by inductively designing lower-bound
functions on its corresponding value-to-go. Our policy is transparent and easy to implement, as
it does not rely on distributional information beyond the first conditional moments. Despite our
policy's simplicity, we demonstrate that it provides significant improvement over the class of
non-adaptive target-fill-rate policies by characterizing the performance of the optimal such
policy. We complement our theoretical developments with a numerical study motivated by the rationing
of COVID-19 medical supplies based on a standard SEIR model approach that is commonly used to forecast
pandemic trajectories. In such a setting, our simple adaptive policy significantly outperforms
its theoretical guarantee as well as the optimal target-fill-rate policy.

A digital twin is a computer model that represents an individual, for example, a component, a patient
or a process. In many situations, we want to gain knowledge about an individual from its data while
incorporating imperfect physical knowledge and also learn from data from other individuals. In
this paper, we introduce and demonstrate a fully Bayesian methodology for learning between digital
twins in a setting where the physical parameters of each individual are of interest. For each individual,
the methodology is based on Bayesian calibration with model discrepancy. Through the discrepancy,
modelled as a Gaussian process, the imperfect low-fidelity physical model is accounted for. Using
ideas from Bayesian hierarchical models, a joint probabilistic model of digital twins is constructed
by connecting them through a new level in the hierarchy. For the physical parameters, the methodology
can be seen as using a prior distribution in the individual model that is the posterior of the corresponding
hyperparameter in the joint model. For learning the imperfect physics between individuals two
approaches are introduced, one that assumes the same discrepancy for all individuals and one that
can be seen as using a prior learned from all individuals for the parameters of the Gaussian processes
representing the discrepancies. Based on recent advances related to physics-informed priors,
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods and using these for inverse problems we set up an inference methodology
that allows our approach to be computational feasible also for physical models based on partial
differential equations and individual data that are not aligned. The methodology is demonstrated
in two synthetic case studies, a toy example previously used in the literature extended to more individuals
and an example based on a cardiovascular differential equation model relevant for the treatment
of hypertension.

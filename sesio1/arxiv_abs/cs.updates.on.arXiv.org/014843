Disease prediction is a well-known classification problem in medical applications. GCNs provide
a powerful tool for analyzing the patients' features relative to each other. This can be achieved
by modeling the problem as a graph node classification task, where each node is a patient. Due to the
nature of such medical datasets, class imbalance is a prevalent issue in the field of disease prediction,
where the distribution of classes is skewed. When the class imbalance is present in the data, the
existing graph-based classifiers tend to be biased towards the major class(es) and neglect the
samples in the minor class(es). On the other hand, the correct diagnosis of the rare positive cases
among all the patients is vital in a healthcare system. In conventional methods, such imbalance
is tackled by assigning appropriate weights to classes in the loss function which is still dependent
on the relative values of weights, sensitive to outliers, and in some cases biased towards the minor
class(es). In this paper, we propose a Re-weighted Adversarial Graph Convolutional Network (RA-GCN)
to prevent the graph-based classifier from emphasizing the samples of any particular class. This
is accomplished by associating a graph-based neural network to each class, which is responsible
for weighting the class samples and changing the importance of each sample for the classifier. Therefore,
the classifier adjusts itself and determines the boundary between classes with more attention
to the important samples. The parameters of the classifier and weighting networks are trained by
an adversarial approach. We show experiments on synthetic and three publicly available medical
datasets. RA-GCN demonstrates the superiority compared to recent methods in identifying the patient's
status on all three datasets. The detailed analysis is provided as quantitative and qualitative
experiments on synthetic datasets.

Digital and physical footprints are a trail of user activities collected over the use of software
applications and systems. As software becomes ubiquitous, protecting user privacy has become
challenging. With the increase of user privacy awareness and advent of privacy regulations and
policies, there is an emerging need to implement software systems that enhance the protection of
personal data processing. However, existing data protection and privacy regulations provide
key principles in high-level, making it difficult for software engineers to design and implement
privacy-aware systems. In this paper, we develop a taxonomy that provides a comprehensive set of
privacy requirements based on four well-established personal data protection regulations and
privacy frameworks, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), ISO/IEC 29100, Thailand Personal
Data Protection Act (Thailand PDPA) and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) privacy framework.
These requirements are extracted, refined and classified into a level that can be used to map with
issue reports. We have also performed a study on how two large open-source software projects (Google
Chrome and Moodle) address the privacy requirements in our taxonomy through mining their issue
reports. The paper discusses how the collected issues were classified, and presents the findings
and insights generated from our study. Mining and classifying privacy requirements in issue reports
can help organisations be aware of their state of compliance by identifying privacy requirements
that have not been addressed in their software projects. The taxonomy can also trace back to regulations,
standards and frameworks that the software projects have not complied with based on the identified
privacy requirements.

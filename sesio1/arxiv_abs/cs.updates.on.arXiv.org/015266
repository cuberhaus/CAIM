The decline of the number of newly discovered mineral deposits and increase in demand for different
minerals in recent years has led exploration geologists to look for more efficient and innovative
methods for processing different data types at each stage of mineral exploration. As a primary step,
various features, such as lithological units, alteration types, structures, and indicator minerals,
are mapped to aid decision-making in targeting ore deposits. Different types of remote sensing
datasets, such as satellite and airborne data, make it possible to overcome common problems associated
with mapping geological features. The rapid increase in the volume of remote sensing data obtained
from different platforms has encouraged scientists to develop advanced, innovative, and robust
data processing methodologies. Machine learning methods can help process a wide range of remote
sensing datasets and determine the relationship between components such as the reflectance continuum
and features of interest. These methods are robust in processing spectral and ground truth measurements
against noise and uncertainties. In recent years, many studies have been carried out by supplementing
geological surveys with remote sensing datasets, which is now prominent in geoscience research.
This paper provides a comprehensive review of the implementation and adaptation of some popular
and recently established machine learning methods for processing different types of remote sensing
data and investigates their applications for detecting various ore deposit types. We demonstrate
the high capability of combining remote sensing data and machine learning methods for mapping different
geological features that are critical for providing potential maps. Moreover, we find there is
scope for advanced methods to process the new generation of remote sensing data for creating improved
mineral prospectivity maps.

Improving software performance through configuration parameter tuning is a common activity during
software maintenance. Beyond traditional performance metrics like latency, mobile app developers
are interested in reducing app energy usage. Some mobile apps have centralized locations for parameter
tuning, similar to databases and operating systems, but it is common for mobile apps to have hundreds
of parameters scattered around the source code. The correlation between these "deep" parameters
and app energy usage is unclear. Researchers have studied the energy effects of deep parameters
in specific modules, but we lack a systematic understanding of the energy impact of mobile deep parameters.
In this paper we empirically investigate this topic, combining a developer survey with systematic
energy measurements. Our motivational survey of 25 Android developers suggests that developers
do not understand, and largely ignore, the energy impact of deep parameters. To assess the potential
implications of this practice, we propose a deep parameter energy profiling framework that can
analyze the energy impact of deep parameters in an app. Our framework identifies deep parameters,
mutates them based on our parameter value selection scheme, and performs reliable energy impact
analysis. Applying the framework to 16 popular Android apps, we discovered that deep parameter-induced
energy inefficiency is rare. We found only 2 out of 1644 deep parameters for which a different value
would significantly improve its app's energy efficiency. A detailed analysis found that most deep
parameters have either no energy impact, limited energy impact, or an energy impact only under extreme
values. Our study suggests that it is generally safe for developers to ignore the energy impact when
choosing deep parameter values in mobile apps.

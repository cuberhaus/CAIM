The deep neural networks (DNNs)based autonomous driving systems (ADSs) are expected to reduce
road accidents and improve safety in the transportation domain as it removes the factor of human
error from driving tasks. The DNN based ADS sometimes may exhibit erroneous or unexpected behaviors
due to unexpected driving conditions which may cause accidents. It is not possible to generalize
the DNN model performance for all driving conditions. Therefore, the driving conditions that were
not considered during the training of the ADS may lead to unpredictable consequences for the safety
of autonomous vehicles. This study proposes an autoencoder and time series analysis based anomaly
detection system to prevent the safety critical inconsistent behavior of autonomous vehicles
at runtime. Our approach called DeepGuard consists of two components. The first component, the
inconsistent behavior predictor, is based on an autoencoder and time series analysis to reconstruct
the driving scenarios. Based on reconstruction error and threshold it determines the normal and
unexpected driving scenarios and predicts potential inconsistent behavior. The second component
provides on the fly safety guards, that is, it automatically activates healing strategies to prevent
inconsistencies in the behavior. We evaluated the performance of DeepGuard in predicting the injected
anomalous driving scenarios using already available open sourced DNN based ADSs in the Udacity
simulator. Our simulation results show that the best variant of DeepGuard can predict up to 93 percent
on the CHAUFFEUR ADS, 83 percent on DAVE2 ADS, and 80 percent of inconsistent behavior on the EPOCH
ADS model, outperforming SELFORACLE and DeepRoad. Overall, DeepGuard can prevent up to 89 percent
of all predicted inconsistent behaviors of ADS by executing predefined safety guards.

The interpretation of the electrocardiogram (ECG) gives clinical information and helps in assessing
heart function. There are distinct ECG patterns associated with a specific class of arrythmia.
The convolutional neural network is currently one of the most commonly employed deep learning algorithms
for ECG processing. However, deep learning models require many hyperparameters to tune. Selecting
an optimal or best hyperparameter for the convolutional neural network algorithm is a highly challenging
task. Often, we end up tuning the model manually with different possible ranges of values until a
best fit model is obtained. Automatic hyperparameters tuning using Bayesian optimisation (BO)
and evolutionary algorithms can provide an effective solution to current labour-intensive manual
configuration approaches. In this paper, we propose to optimise the Residual one Dimensional Convolutional
Neural Network model (R-1D-CNN) at two levels. At the first level, a residual convolutional layer
and one-dimensional convolutional neural layers are trained to learn patient-specific ECG features
over which multilayer perceptron layers can learn to produce the final class vectors of each input.
This level is manual and aims to lower the search space. The second level is automatic and based on
our proposed BO-based algorithm. Our proposed optimised R-1D-CNN architecture is evaluated on
two publicly available ECG Datasets. Comparative experimental results demonstrate that our BO-based
algorithm achieves an optimal rate of 99.95%, while the baseline model achieves 99.70% for the MIT-BIH
database. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that the proposed architecture fine-tuned with
BO achieves a higher accuracy than the other proposed architectures. Our optimised architecture
achieves excellent results compared to previous works on benchmark datasets.

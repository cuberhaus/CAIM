Researchers collect large amounts of user interaction data with the goal of mapping user's workflows
and behaviors to their higher-level motivations, intuitions, and goals. Although the visual analytics
community has proposed numerous taxonomies to facilitate this mapping process, no formal methods
exist for systematically applying these existing theories to user interaction logs. This paper
seeks to bridge the gap between visualization task taxonomies and interaction log data by making
the taxonomies more actionable for interaction log analysis. To achieve this, we leverage structural
parallels between how people express themselves through interactions and language by reformulating
existing theories as regular grammars. We represent interactions as terminals within a regular
grammar, similar to the role of individual words in a language, and patterns of interactions or non-terminals
as regular expressions over these terminals to capture common language patterns. To demonstrate
our approach, we generate regular grammars for seven visualization taxonomies and develop code
to apply them to three interaction log datasets. In analyzing our results, we find that existing
taxonomies at the low-level (i.e., terminals) show mixed results in expressing multiple interaction
log datasets, and taxonomies at the high-level (i.e., regular expressions) have limited expressiveness,
due to primarily two challenges: inconsistencies in interaction log dataset granularity and structure,
and under-expressiveness of certain terminals. Based on our findings, we suggest new research
directions for the visualization community for augmenting existing taxonomies, developing new
ones, and building better interaction log recording processes to facilitate the data-driven development
of user behavior taxonomies.

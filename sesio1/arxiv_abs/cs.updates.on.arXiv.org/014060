Digitization of scanned Piping and Instrumentation diagrams(P&ID), widely used in manufacturing
or mechanical industries such as oil and gas over several decades, has become a critical bottleneck
in dynamic inventory management and creation of smart P&IDs that are compatible with the latest
CAD tools. Historically, P&ID sheets have been manually generated at the design stage, before being
scanned and stored as PDFs. Current digitization initiatives involve manual processing and are
consequently very time consuming, labour intensive and error-prone.Thanks to advances in image
processing, machine and deep learning techniques there are emerging works on P&ID digitization.
However, existing solutions face several challenges owing to the variation in the scale, size and
noise in the P&IDs, sheer complexity and crowdedness within drawings, domain knowledge required
to interpret the drawings. This motivates our current solution called Digitize-PID which comprises
of an end-to-end pipeline for detection of core components from P&IDs like pipes, symbols and textual
information, followed by their association with each other and eventually, the validation and
correction of output data based on inherent domain knowledge. A novel and efficient kernel-based
line detection and a two-step method for detection of complex symbols based on a fine-grained deep
recognition technique is presented in the paper. In addition, we have created an annotated synthetic
dataset, Dataset-P&ID, of 500 P&IDs by incorporating different types of noise and complex symbols
which is made available for public use (currently there exists no public P&ID dataset). We evaluate
our proposed method on this synthetic dataset and a real-world anonymized private dataset of 12
P&ID sheets. Results show that Digitize-PID outperforms the existing state-of-the-art for P&ID
digitization.

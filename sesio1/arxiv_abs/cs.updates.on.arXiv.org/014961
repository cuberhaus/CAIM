Drug resistance is a major threat to the global health and a significant concern throughout the clinical
treatment of diseases and drug development. The mutation in proteins that is related to drug binding
is a common cause for adaptive drug resistance. Therefore, quantitative estimations of how mutations
would affect the interaction between a drug and the target protein would be of vital significance
for the drug development and the clinical practice. Computational methods that rely on molecular
dynamics simulations, Rosetta protocols, as well as machine learning methods have been proven
to be capable of predicting ligand affinity changes upon protein mutation. However, the severely
limited sample size and heavy noise induced overfitting and generalization issues have impeded
wide adoption of machine learning for studying drug resistance. In this paper, we propose a robust
machine learning method, termed SPLDExtraTrees, which can accurately predict ligand binding
affinity changes upon protein mutation and identify resistance-causing mutations. Especially,
the proposed method ranks training data following a specific scheme that starts with easy-to-learn
samples and gradually incorporates harder and diverse samples into the training, and then iterates
between sample weight recalculations and model updates. In addition, we calculate additional
physics-based structural features to provide the machine learning model with the valuable domain
knowledge on proteins for this data-limited predictive tasks. The experiments substantiate the
capability of the proposed method for predicting kinase inhibitor resistance under three scenarios,
and achieves predictive accuracy comparable to that of molecular dynamics and Rosetta methods
with much less computational costs.

With this update of our previous publications, we publish the latest data of the market development
of battery storage systems (BSS) in Germany, one of the leading storage markets worldwide. For the
analyses of both stationary and mobile storage markets, we use the public registrations of the German
Federal Network Agency and the Federal Motor Transport Authority, our own databases from the monitoring
of subsidy programs, and bilateral exchange with large companies. In comparison to 2020, the market
for home storage systems (HSS) grew by 50% in terms of battery energy in 2021 and is by far the largest
stationary storage market in Germany. We estimate that about 145,000 HSS (1.27 GWh / 0.73 GW) were
installed solely in 2021. The average specific price for a medium-sized HSS was about 1,000 EUR/kWh
in 2021, showing a price decrease of 8% from 2020 to 2021. The emerging market for industrial storage
systems (ISS) grew by 15% in 2021, with a total of 900 ISS (0.06 GWh / 0.03 GW) installed, although industrial
PV installations decreased. The market growth for large-scale storage systems (LSS) remains on
a relatively low level with 11 LSS (0.03 GWh / 0.04 GW) commissioned. The market for battery electric
vehicles (EV) doubled in 2021 and new registrations raised to 680,000 EV (22.45 GWh / 31.18 GW). The
public charging infrastructure could not follow this growth and grew linearly with about 11,700
new installations to 50,000 charging points, most of which are up to 22 kW. The number of EV per charging
point grew from 10 in 2018 to 25 in 2021. In total, we estimate that over 430,000 stationary BSS with
a battery energy of 4.46 GWh and a power of 2.64 GW and 1,270,000 EV with a battery energy of 39.59 GWh,
a DC charging power of 51.84 GW, and an AC charging power of 7.71 GW were operated in Germany by the end
of 2021.

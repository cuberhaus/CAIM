Assessments help in evaluating the knowledge gained by a learner at any specific point as well as
in continuous improvement of the curriculum design and the whole learning process. However, with
the increase in students' enrollment at University level in either conventional or distance education
environment, traditional ways of assessing students' work are becoming insufficient in terms
of both time and effort. In distance education environment, such assessments become additionally
more challenging in terms of hefty remuneration for hiring large number of tutors. The availability
of automated tools to assist the evaluation of students' work and providing students with appropriate
and timely feedback can really help in overcoming these problems. We believe that building such
tools for assessing students' work for all kinds of courses in not yet possible. However, courses
that involve some formal language of expression can be automated, such as, programming courses
in Computer Science (CS) discipline. Instructors provide various practical exercises to students
as assignments to build these skills. Usually, instructors manually grade and provide feedbacks
on these assignments. Although in literature, various tools have been reported to automate this
process, but most of these tools have been developed by the host institutions themselves for their
own use. We at COMSATS Institute of Information Technology, Lahore are conducting a pioneer effort
in Pakistan to automate the marking of assignments of introductory programming courses that involve
C or C++ languages with the capability of associating appropriate feedbacks for students. In this
paper, we basically identify different components that we believe are necessary in building an
effective automated assessment system in the context of introductory programming courses that
involve C/C++ programming.

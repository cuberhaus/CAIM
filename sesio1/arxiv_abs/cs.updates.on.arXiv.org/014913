We consider the classical contention resolution problem where nodes arrive over time, each with
a message to send. In each synchronous slot, each node can send or remain idle. If in a slot one node
sends alone, it succeeds; otherwise, if multiple nodes send simultaneously, messages collide
and none succeeds. Nodes can differentiate collision and silence only if collision detection is
available. Ideally, a contention resolution algorithm should satisfy three criteria: low time
complexity (or high throughput); low energy complexity, meaning each node does not make too many
broadcast attempts; strong robustness, meaning the algorithm can maintain good performance even
if slots can be jammed. Previous work has shown, with collision detection, there are "perfect" contention
resolution algorithms satisfying all three criteria. On the other hand, without collision detection,
it was not until 2020 that an algorithm was discovered which can achieve optimal time complexity
and low energy cost, assuming there is no jamming. More recently, the trade-off between throughput
and robustness was studied. However, an intriguing and important question remains unknown: without
collision detection, are there robust algorithms achieving both low total time complexity and
low per-node energy cost? In this paper, we answer the above question affirmatively. Specifically,
we develop a new randomized algorithm for robust contention resolution without collision detection.
Lower bounds show that it has both optimal time and energy complexity. If all nodes start execution
simultaneously, we design another algorithm that is even faster, with similar energy complexity
as the first algorithm. The separation on time complexity suggests for robust contention resolution
without collision detection, ``batch'' instances (nodes start simultaneously) are inherently
easier than ``scattered'' ones (nodes arrive over time).

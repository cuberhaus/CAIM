Adversarial attacks against commercial black-box speech platforms, including cloud speech APIs
and voice control devices, have received little attention until recent years. The current "black-box"
attacks all heavily rely on the knowledge of prediction/confidence scores to craft effective adversarial
examples, which can be intuitively defended by service providers without returning these messages.
In this paper, we propose two novel adversarial attacks in more practical and rigorous scenarios.
For commercial cloud speech APIs, we propose Occam, a decision-only black-box adversarial attack,
where only final decisions are available to the adversary. In Occam, we formulate the decision-only
AE generation as a discontinuous large-scale global optimization problem, and solve it by adaptively
decomposing this complicated problem into a set of sub-problems and cooperatively optimizing
each one. Our Occam is a one-size-fits-all approach, which achieves 100% success rates of attacks
with an average SNR of 14.23dB, on a wide range of popular speech and speaker recognition APIs, including
Google, Alibaba, Microsoft, Tencent, iFlytek, and Jingdong, outperforming the state-of-the-art
black-box attacks. For commercial voice control devices, we propose NI-Occam, the first non-interactive
physical adversarial attack, where the adversary does not need to query the oracle and has no access
to its internal information and training data. We combine adversarial attacks with model inversion
attacks, and thus generate the physically-effective audio AEs with high transferability without
any interaction with target devices. Our experimental results show that NI-Occam can successfully
fool Apple Siri, Microsoft Cortana, Google Assistant, iFlytek and Amazon Echo with an average SRoA
of 52% and SNR of 9.65dB, shedding light on non-interactive physical attacks against voice control
devices.

Driving safety analysis has recently experienced unprecedented improvements thanks to technological
advances in precise positioning sensors, artificial intelligence (AI)-based safety features,
autonomous driving systems, connected vehicles, high-throughput computing, and edge computing
servers. Particularly, deep learning (DL) methods empowered volume video processing to extract
safety-related features from massive videos captured by roadside units (RSU). Safety metrics
are commonly used measures to investigate crashes and near-conflict events. However, these metrics
provide limited insight into the overall network-level traffic management. On the other hand,
some safety assessment efforts are devoted to processing crash reports and identifying spatial
and temporal patterns of crashes that correlate with road geometry, traffic volume, and weather
conditions. This approach relies merely on crash reports and ignores the rich information of traffic
videos that can help identify the role of safety violations in crashes. To bridge these two perspectives,
we define a new set of network-level safety metrics (NSM) to assess the overall safety profile of
traffic flow by processing imagery taken by RSU cameras. Our analysis suggests that NSMs show significant
statistical associations with crash rates. This approach is different than simply generalizing
the results of individual crash analyses, since all vehicles contribute to calculating NSMs, not
only the ones involved in crash incidents. This perspective considers the traffic flow as a complex
dynamic system where actions of some nodes can propagate through the network and influence the crash
risk for other nodes. We also provide a comprehensive review of surrogate safety metrics (SSM) in
the Appendix A.

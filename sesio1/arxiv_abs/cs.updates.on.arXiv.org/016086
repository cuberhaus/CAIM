A prompt severity assessment model of patients confirmed for having infectious diseases could
enable efficient diagnosis while alleviating burden on the medical system. This study aims to develop
a SARS-CoV-2 severity assessment model and establish a medical system that allows patients to check
the severity of their cases and informs them to visit the appropriate clinic center based on past
treatment data of other patients with similar severity levels. This paper provides the development
processes of a severity assessment model using machine learning techniques and its application
on SARS-CoV-2 patients. The proposed model is trained on a nationwide dataset provided by a Korean
government agency and only requires patients' basic personal data, allowing them to judge the severity
of their own cases. After modeling, the boosting-based decision tree model was selected as the classifier
while mortality rate was interpreted as the probability score. The dataset was collected from all
Korean citizens who were confirmed with COVID-19 between February, 2020 and July, 2021. The experiments
achieved high model performance with an approximate precision of $0{\cdot}923$ and AUROC score
of $0{\cdot}950$ [$95$% Tolerance Interval $0{\cdot}940$-$0{\cdot}958$, $95$% Confidence
Interval $0{\cdot}949$-$0{\cdot}950$]. Moreover, our experiments identified the most important
variables affecting the severity in the model via sensitivity analysis. The prompt severity assessment
model for managing infectious people has been attained through using a nationwide dataset. It has
demonstrated its superior performance by surpassing that of conventional risk assessments. With
the model's high performance and easily accessible features, the triage algorithm is expected
to be particularly useful when patients monitor their health status by themselves through smartphone
applications.

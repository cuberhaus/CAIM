Uncertainty quantification (UQ) of subsurface two-phase flow usually requires numerous executions
of forward simulations under varying conditions. In this work, a novel coupled theory-guided neural
network (TgNN) based surrogate model is built to facilitate computation efficiency under the premise
of satisfactory accuracy. The core notion of this proposed method is to bridge two separate blocks
on top of an overall network. They underlie the TgNN model in a coupled form, which reflects the coupling
nature of pressure and water saturation in the two-phase flow equation. The TgNN model not only relies
on labeled data, but also incorporates underlying scientific theory and experiential rules (e.g.,
governing equations, stochastic parameter fields, boundary and initial conditions, well conditions,
and expert knowledge) as additional components into the loss function. The performance of the TgNN-based
surrogate model for two-phase flow problems is tested by different numbers of labeled data and collocation
points, as well as the existence of data noise. The proposed TgNN-based surrogate model offers an
effective way to solve the coupled nonlinear two-phase flow problem and demonstrates good accuracy
and strong robustness when compared with the purely data-driven surrogate model. By combining
the accurate TgNN-based surrogate model with the Monte Carlo method, UQ tasks can be performed at
a minimum cost to evaluate statistical quantities. Since the heterogeneity of the random fields
strongly impacts the results of the surrogate model, corresponding variance and correlation length
are added to the input of the neural network to maintain its predictive capacity. The results show
that the TgNN-based surrogate model achieves satisfactory accuracy, stability, and efficiency
in UQ problems of subsurface two-phase flow.

Several distributed system paradigms utilize Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) to realize structured
peer-to-peer (P2P) overlays. DHT structures arise as the most commonly used organizations for
peers that can efficiently perform crucial services such as data storage, replication, query resolution,
and load balancing. With the advances in various distributed system technologies, novel and efficient
solutions based on DHTs emerge and play critical roles in system design. DHT-based methods and communications
have been proposed to address challenges such as scalability, availability, reliability and performance,
by considering unique characteristics of these technologies. In this article, we propose a classification
of the state-of-the-art DHT-based methods focusing on their system architecture, communication,
routing and technological aspects across various system domains. To the best of our knowledge,
there is no comprehensive survey on DHT-based applications from system architecture and communication
perspectives that spans various domains of recent distributed system technologies. We investigate
the recently emerged DHT-based solutions in the seven key domains of edge and fog computing, cloud
computing, blockchain, the Internet of Things (IoT), Online Social Networks (OSNs), Mobile Ad
Hoc Networks (MANETs), and Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs). In contrast to the existing surveys,
our study goes beyond the commonly known DHT methods such as storage, routing, and lookup, and identifies
diverse DHT-based solutions including but not limited to aggregation, task scheduling, resource
management and discovery, clustering and group management, federation, data dependency management,
and data transmission. Furthermore, we identify open problems and discuss future research guidelines
for each domain.

Lee Sedol is on a winning streak--does this legend rise again after the competition with AlphaGo?
Ke Jie is invincible in the world championship--can he still win the title this time? Go is one of the
most popular board games in East Asia, with a stable professional sports system that has lasted for
decades in China, Japan, and Korea. There are mature data-driven analysis technologies for many
sports, such as soccer, basketball, and esports. However, developing such technology for Go remains
nontrivial and challenging due to the lack of datasets, meta-information, and in-game statistics.
This paper creates the Professional Go Dataset (PGD), containing 98,043 games played by 2,148 professional
players from 1950 to 2021. After manual cleaning and labeling, we provide detailed meta-information
for each player, game, and tournament. Moreover, the dataset includes analysis results for each
move in the match evaluated by advanced AlphaZero-based AI. To establish a benchmark for PGD, we
further analyze the data and extract meaningful in-game features based on prior knowledge related
to Go that can indicate the game status. With the help of complete meta-information and constructed
in-game features, our results prediction system achieves an accuracy of 75.30%, much higher than
several state-of-the-art approaches (64%-65%). As far as we know, PGD is the first dataset for data-driven
analytics in Go and even in board games. Beyond this promising result, we provide more examples of
tasks that benefit from our dataset. The ultimate goal of this paper is to bridge this ancient game
and the modern data science community. It will advance research on Go-related analytics to enhance
the fan experience, help players improve their ability, and facilitate other promising aspects.
The dataset will be made publicly available.

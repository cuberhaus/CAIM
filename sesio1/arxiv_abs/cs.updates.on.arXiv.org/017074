Clique is one of the most fundamental models for cohesive subgraph mining in network analysis. Existing
clique model mainly focuses on unsigned networks. However, in real world, many applications are
modeled as signed networks with positive and negative edges. As the signed networks hold their own
properties different from the unsigned networks, the existing clique model is inapplicable for
the signed networks. Motivated by this, we propose the balanced clique model that considers the
most fundamental and dominant theory, structural balance theory, for signed networks. Following
the balanced clique model, we study the maximal balanced clique enumeration problem (MBCE) which
computes all the maximal balanced cliques in a given signed network and the maximum balanced clique
search problem (MBCS) which computes the balanced clique with maximum size. We show that MBCE problem
and MBCS problem are both NP-Hard. For the MBCE problem, a straightforward solution is to treat the
signed network as two unsigned networks and leverage the off-the-shelf techniques for unsigned
networks. However, such a solution is inefficient for large signed networks. To address this problem,
in this paper, we first propose a new maximal balanced clique enumeration algorithm by exploiting
the unique properties of signed networks. Based on the new proposed algorithm, we devise two optimization
strategies to further improve the efficiency of the enumeration. For the MBCS problem, we propose
a new search framework based on search space partition. To further improve the efficiency of the
new framework, we propose multiple optimization strategies regarding to redundant search branches
and invalid candidates. We conduct extensive experiments on large real datasets. The experimental
results demonstrate the efficiency, effectiveness and scalability of our proposed algorithms
for MBCE problem and MBCS problem.

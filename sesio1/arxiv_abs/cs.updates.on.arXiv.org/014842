The thermal radiative transfer (TRT) equations form an integro-differential system that describes
the propagation and collisional interactions of photons. Computing accurate and efficient numerical
solutions TRT are challenging for several reasons, the first of which is that TRT is defined on a high-dimensional
phase. In order to reduce the dimensionality of the phase space, classical approaches such as the
P$_N$ (spherical harmonics) or the S$_N$ (discrete ordinates) ansatz are often used in the literature.
In this work, we introduce a novel approach: the hybrid discrete (H$^T_N$) approximation to the
radiative thermal transfer equations. This approach acquires desirable properties of both P$_N$
and S$_N$, and indeed reduces to each of these approximations in various limits: H$^1_N$ $\equiv$
P$_N$ and H$^T_0$ $\equiv$ S$_T$. We prove that H$^T_N$ results in a system of hyperbolic equations
for all $T\ge 1$ and $N\ge 0$. Another challenge in solving the TRT system is the inherent stiffness
due to the large timescale separation between propagation and collisions, especially in the diffusive
(i.e., highly collisional) regime. This stiffness challenge can be partially overcome via implicit
time integration, although fully implicit methods may become computationally expensive due to
the strong nonlinearity and system size. On the other hand, explicit time-stepping schemes that
are not also asymptotic-preserving in the highly collisional limit require resolving the mean-free
path between collisions, making such schemes prohibitively expensive. In this work we develop
a numerical method that is based on a nodal discontinuous Galerkin discretization in space, coupled
with a semi-implicit discretization in time. We conduct several numerical experiments to verify
the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the H$^T_N$ ansatz and the numerical discretizations.

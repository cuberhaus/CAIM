Diabetes is a global raising pandemic. Diabetes patients are at risk of developing foot ulcer that
usually leads to limb amputation. In order to develop a self monitoring mobile application, in this
work, we propose a novel deep subspace analysis pipeline for semi-supervised diabetic foot ulcer
mulit-label classification. To avoid any chance of over-fitting, unlike recent state of the art
deep semi-supervised methods, the proposed pipeline dose not include any data augmentation. Whereas,
after extracting deep features, in order to make the representation shift invariant, we employ
variety of data augmentation methods on each image and generate an image-sets, which is then mapped
into a linear subspace. Moreover, the proposed pipeline reduces the cost of retraining when more
new unlabelled data become available. Thus, the first stage of the pipeline employs the concept
of transfer learning for feature extraction purpose through modifying and retraining a deep convolutional
network architect known as Xception. Then, the output of a mid-layer is extracted to generate an
image set representer of any given image with help of data augmentation methods. At this stage, each
image is transferred to a linear subspace which is a point on a Grassmann Manifold topological space.
Hence, to perform analyse them, the geometry of such manifold must be considered. As such, each labelled
image is represented as a vector of distances to number of unlabelled images using geodesic distance
on Grassmann manifold. Finally, Random Forest is trained for multi-label classification of diabetic
foot ulcer images. The method is then evaluated on the blind test set provided by DFU2021 competition,
and the result considerable improvement compared to using classical transfer learning with data
augmentation.

Motion estimation is a fundamental step in dynamic medical image processing for the assessment
of target organ anatomy and function. However, existing image-based motion estimation methods,
which optimize the motion field by evaluating the local image similarity, are prone to produce implausible
estimation, especially in the presence of large motion. In this study, we provide a novel motion
estimation framework of Dense-Sparse-Dense (DSD), which comprises two stages. In the first stage,
we process the raw dense image to extract sparse landmarks to represent the target organ anatomical
topology and discard the redundant information that is unnecessary for motion estimation. For
this purpose, we introduce an unsupervised 3D landmark detection network to extract spatially
sparse but representative landmarks for the target organ motion estimation. In the second stage,
we derive the sparse motion displacement from the extracted sparse landmarks of two images of different
time points. Then, we present a motion reconstruction network to construct the motion field by projecting
the sparse landmarks displacement back into the dense image domain. Furthermore, we employ the
estimated motion field from our two-stage DSD framework as initialization and boost the motion
estimation quality in light-weight yet effective iterative optimization. We evaluate our method
on two dynamic medical imaging tasks to model cardiac motion and lung respiratory motion, respectively.
Our method has produced superior motion estimation accuracy compared to existing comparative
methods. Besides, the extensive experimental results demonstrate that our solution can extract
well representative anatomical landmarks without any requirement of manual annotation. Our code
is publicly available online.

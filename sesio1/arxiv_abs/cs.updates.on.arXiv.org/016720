Cybersecurity has become one of the focuses of organisations. The number of cyberattacks keeps
increasing as Internet usage continues to grow. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is an alarm
system that helps to detect cyberattacks. As new types of cyberattacks continue to emerge, researchers
focus on developing machine learning (ML) based IDS to detect zero-day attacks. Researchers usually
remove some or all attack samples from the training dataset and only include them in the testing dataset
when evaluating the performance of an IDS on detecting zero-day attacks. Although this method may
show the ability of an IDs to detect unknown attacks; however, it does not reflect the long-term performance
of the IDS as it only shows the changes in the type of attacks. In this paper, we focus on evaluating
the long-term performance of ML based IDS. To achieve this goal, we propose evaluating the ML-based
IDS using a dataset that is created later than the training dataset. The proposed method can better
assess the long-term performance of an ML-based IDS, as the testing dataset reflects the changes
in the type of attack and the changes in network infrastructure over time. We have implemented six
of the most popular ML models that are used for IDS, including decision tree (DT), random forest (RF),
support vector machine (SVM), na\"ive Bayes (NB), artificial neural network (ANN) and deep neural
network (DNN). Our experiments using the CIC-IDS2017 and the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 datasets show that
SVM and ANN are most resistant to overfitting. Besides that, our experiment results also show that
DT and RF suffer the most from overfitting, although they perform well on the training dataset. On
the other hand, our experiments using the LUFlow dataset have shown that all models can perform well
when the difference between the training and testing datasets is small.

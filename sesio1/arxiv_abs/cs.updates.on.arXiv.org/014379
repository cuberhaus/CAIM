From ecology to atmospheric sciences, many academic disciplines deal with data characterized
by intricate spatio-temporal complexities, the modeling of which often requires specialized
approaches. Generative models of these data are of particular interest, as they enable a range of
impactful downstream applications like simulation or creating synthetic training data. Recent
work has highlighted the potential of generative adversarial nets (GANs) for generating spatio-temporal
data. A new GAN algorithm COT-GAN, inspired by the theory of causal optimal transport (COT), was
proposed in an attempt to better tackle this challenge. However, the task of learning more complex
spatio-temporal patterns requires additional knowledge of their specific data structures. In
this study, we propose a novel loss objective combined with COT-GAN based on an autoregressive embedding
to reinforce the learning of spatio-temporal dynamics. We devise SPATE (spatio-temporal association),
a new metric measuring spatio-temporal autocorrelation by using the deviance of observations
from their expected values. We compute SPATE for real and synthetic data samples and use it to compute
an embedding loss that considers space-time interactions, nudging the GAN to learn outputs that
are faithful to the observed dynamics. We test this new objective on a diverse set of complex spatio-temporal
patterns: turbulent flows, log-Gaussian Cox processes and global weather data. We show that our
novel embedding loss improves performance without any changes to the architecture of the COT-GAN
backbone, highlighting our model's increased capacity for capturing autoregressive structures.
We also contextualize our work with respect to recent advances in physics-informed deep learning
and interdisciplinary work connecting neural networks with geographic and geophysical sciences.

Due to the irregular shapes,various sizes and indistinguishable boundaries between the normal
and infected tissues, it is still a challenging task to accurately segment the infected lesions
of COVID-19 on CT images. In this paper, a novel segmentation scheme is proposed for the infections
of COVID-19 by enhancing supervised information and fusing multi-scale feature maps of different
levels based on the encoder-decoder architecture. To this end, a deep collaborative supervision
(Co-supervision) scheme is proposed to guide the network learning the features of edges and semantics.
More specifically, an Edge Supervised Module (ESM) is firstly designed to highlight low-level
boundary features by incorporating the edge supervised information into the initial stage of down-sampling.
Meanwhile, an Auxiliary Semantic Supervised Module (ASSM) is proposed to strengthen high-level
semantic information by integrating mask supervised information into the later stage. Then an
Attention Fusion Module (AFM) is developed to fuse multiple scale feature maps of different levels
by using an attention mechanism to reduce the semantic gaps between high-level and low-level feature
maps. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated on four various COVID-19
CT datasets. The results show that the proposed three modules are all promising. Based on the baseline
(ResUnet), using ESM, ASSM, or AFM alone can respectively increase Dice metric by 1.12\%, 1.95\%,1.63\%
in our dataset, while the integration by incorporating three models together can rise 3.97\%. Compared
with the existing approaches in various datasets, the proposed method can obtain better segmentation
performance in some main metrics, and can achieve the best generalization and comprehensive performance.

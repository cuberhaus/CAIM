This study compares different methods to predict the simultaneous effects of conductive and radiative
heat transfer in a Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) sample. PMMA is a kind of polymer utilized in various
sensors and actuator devices. One-dimensional combined heat transfer is considered in numerical
analysis. Computer implementation was obtained for the numerical solution of governing equation
with the implicit finite difference method in the case of discretization. Kirchhoff transformation
was used to get data from a non-linear equation of conductive heat transfer by considering monochromatic
radiation intensity and temperature conditions applied to the PMMA sample boundaries. For Deep
Neural Network (DNN) method, the novel Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) method was introduced to find
accurate results in the least processing time than the numerical method. A recent study derived
the combined heat transfers and their temperature profiles for the PMMA sample. Furthermore, the
transient temperature profile is validated by another study. A comparison proves a perfect agreement.
It shows the temperature gradient in the primary positions that makes a spectral amount of conductive
heat transfer from a PMMA sample. It is more straightforward when they are compared with the novel
DNN method. Results demonstrate that this artificial intelligence method is accurate and fast
in predicting problems. By analyzing the results from the numerical solution it can be understood
that the conductive and radiative heat flux is similar in the case of gradient behavior, but it is
also twice in its amount approximately. Hence, total heat flux has a constant value in an approximated
steady state condition. In addition to analyzing their composition, ROC curve and confusion matrix
were implemented to evaluate the algorithm performance.

Integrated simulation models are emerging as an alternative for analyzing large-scale interdependent
infrastructure networks due to their modeling advantages over traditional interdependency models.
This paper presents an open-source integrated simulation package for the asset-level analysis
of interdependent infrastructure systems. The simulation platform, named 'InfraRisk' and developed
in Python, can simulate disaster-induced infrastructure failures and subsequent post-disaster
restoration in interconnected water-, power-, and road networks. InfraRisk consists of an infrastructure
module, a hazard module, a recovery module, a simulation module, and a resilience quantification
module. The infrastructure module integrates existing infrastructure network packages (wntr
for water networks, pandapower for power systems, and a static traffic assignment model for transportation
networks) through an interface that facilitates the network-level simulation of interdependent
failures. The hazard module generates infrastructure component failure sequences based on various
disaster characteristics. The recovery module determines repair sequences and assigns repair
crews based on predefined heuristics-based recovery strategies or model predictive control (MPC)
based optimization. Based on the schedule, the simulation module implements the network-wide
simulation of the consequences of the disaster impacts and the recovery actions. The resilience
quantification module offers system-level and consumer-level metrics to quantify both the risks
and resilience of the integrated infrastructure networks against disaster events. InfraRisk
provides a virtual platform for decision-makers to experiment and develop region-specific pre-disaster
and post-disaster policies to enhance the overall resilience of interdependent urban infrastructure
networks.

Software projects use Issue Tracking Systems (ITS) like JIRA to track issues and organize the workflows
around them. Issues are often inter-connected via different links such as the default JIRA link
types Duplicate, Relate, Block, or Subtask. While previous research has mostly focused on analyzing
and predicting duplication links, this work aims at understanding the various other link types,
their prevalence, and characteristics towards a more reliable link type prediction. For this,
we studied 607,208 links connecting 698,790 issues in 15 public JIRA repositories. Besides the
default types, the custom types Depend, Incorporate, Split, and Cause were also common. We manually
grouped all 75 link types used in the repositories into five general categories: General Relation,
Duplication, Composition, Temporal / Causal, and Workflow. Comparing the structures of the corresponding
graphs, we observed several trends. For instance, Duplication links tend to represent simpler
issue graphs often with two components and Composition links present the highest amount of hierarchical
tree structures (97.7%). Surprisingly, General Relation links have a significantly higher transitivity
score than Duplication and Temporal / Causal links. Motivated by the differences between the link
types and by their popularity, we evaluated the robustness of two state-of-the-art duplicate detection
approaches from the literature on the JIRA dataset. We found that current deep-learning approaches
confuse between Duplication and other links in almost all repositories. On average, the classification
accuracy dropped by 6% for one approach and 12% for the other. Extending the training sets with other
link types seems to partly solve this issue. We discuss our findings and their implications for research
and practice.

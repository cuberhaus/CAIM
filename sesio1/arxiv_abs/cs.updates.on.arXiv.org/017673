Tracking is a highly privacy-invasive data collection practice that has been ubiquitous in mobile
apps for many years due to its role in supporting advertising-based revenue models. In response,
Apple introduced two significant changes with iOS 14: App Tracking Transparency (ATT), a mandatory
opt-in system for enabling tracking on iOS, and Privacy Nutrition Labels, which disclose what kinds
of data each app processes. So far, the impact of these changes on individual privacy and control
has not been well understood. This paper addresses this gap by analysing two versions of 1,759 iOS
apps from the UK App Store: one version from before iOS 14 and one that has been updated to comply with
the new rules. We find that Apple's new policies, as promised, prevent the collection of the Identifier
for Advertisers (IDFA), an identifier for cross-app tracking. Smaller data brokers that engage
in invasive data practices will now face higher challenges in tracking users - a positive development
for privacy. However, the number of tracking libraries has roughly stayed the same in the studied
apps. Many apps still collect device information that can be used to track users at a group level (cohort
tracking) or identify individuals probabilistically (fingerprinting). We find real-world evidence
of apps computing and agreeing on a fingerprinting-derived identifier through the use of server-side
code, thereby violating Apple's policies. We find that Apple itself engages in some forms of tracking
and exempts invasive data practices like first-party tracking and credit scoring. We also find
that the new Privacy Nutrition Labels are sometimes inaccurate and misleading. Overall, our findings
suggest that, while tracking individual users is more difficult now, the changes reinforce existing
market power of gatekeeper companies with access to large troves of first-party data and motivate
a countermovement.

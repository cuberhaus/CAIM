Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly used to build Decision Support Systems (DSS) across
many domains. This paper describes a series of experiments designed to observe human response to
different characteristics of a DSS such as accuracy and bias, particularly the extent to which participants
rely on the DSS, and the performance they achieve. In our experiments, participants play a simple
online game inspired by so-called "wildcat" (i.e., exploratory) drilling for oil. The landscape
has two layers: a visible layer describing the costs (terrain), and a hidden layer describing the
reward (oil yield). Participants in the control group play the game without receiving any assistance,
while in treatment groups they are assisted by a DSS suggesting places to drill. For certain treatments,
the DSS does not consider costs, but only rewards, which introduces a bias that is observable by users.
Between subjects, we vary the accuracy and bias of the DSS, and observe the participants' total score,
time to completion, the extent to which they follow or ignore suggestions. We also measure the acceptability
of the DSS in an exit survey. Our results show that participants tend to score better with the DSS,
that the score increase is due to users following the DSS advice, and related to the difficulty of
the game and the accuracy of the DSS. We observe that this setting elicits mostly rational behavior
from participants, who place a moderate amount of trust in the DSS and show neither algorithmic aversion
(under-reliance) nor automation bias (over-reliance).However, their stated willingness to
accept the DSS in the exit survey seems less sensitive to the accuracy of the DSS than their behavior,
suggesting that users are only partially aware of the (lack of) accuracy of the DSS.

It is well known that hyperspectral images (HSI) contain rich spatial-spectral contextual information,
and how to effectively combine both spectral and spatial information using DNN for HSI classification
has become a new research hotspot. Compared with CNN with square kernels, GCN have exhibited exciting
potential to model spatial contextual structure and conduct flexible convolution on arbitrarily
irregular image regions. However, current GCN only using first-order spectral-spatial signatures
can result in boundary blurring and isolated misclassification. To address these, we first designed
the graph-based second-order pooling (GSOP) operation to obtain contextual nodes information
in non-Euclidean space for GCN. Further, we proposed a novel multi-stream hybridized convolutional
network (MSHCNet) with combination of first and second order statistics in Euclidean/non-Euclidean
spaces to learn and fuse multi-view complementary information to segment HSIs. Specifically,
our MSHCNet adopted four parallel streams, which contained G-stream, utilizing the irregular
correlation between adjacent land covers in terms of first-order graph in non-Euclidean space;
C-stream, adopting convolution operator to learn regular spatial-spectral features in Euclidean
space; N-stream, combining first and second order features to learn representative and discriminative
regular spatial-spectral features of Euclidean space; S-stream, using GSOP to capture boundary
correlations and obtain graph representations from all nodes in graphs of non-Euclidean space.
Besides, these feature representations learned from four different streams were fused to integrate
the multi-view complementary information for HSI classification. Finally, we evaluated our proposed
MSHCNet on three hyperspectral datasets, and experimental results demonstrated that our method
significantly outperformed state-of-the-art eight methods.

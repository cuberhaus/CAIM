The rapid deployment of new Internet protocols over the last few years and the COVID-19 pandemic
more recently (2020) has resulted in a change in the Internet traffic composition. Consequently,
an updated microscopic view of traffic shares is needed to understand how the Internet is evolving
to capture both such shorter- and longer-term events. Toward this end, we observe traffic composition
at a research network in Japan and a Tier-1 ISP in the USA. We analyze the traffic traces passively
captured at two inter-domain links: MAWI (Japan) and CAIDA (New York-Sao Paulo), which cover 100GB
of data for MAWI traces and 4TB of data for CAIDA traces in total. We begin by studying the impact of
COVID-19 on the MAWI link: We find a substantial increase in the traffic volume of OpenVPN and rsync,
as well as increases in traffic volume from cloud storage and video conferencing services, which
shows that clients shift to remote work during the pandemic. For traffic traces between March 2018
to December 2018, we find that the use of IPv6 is increasing quickly on the CAIDA monitor: The IPv6
traffic volume increases from 1.1% in March 2018 to 6.1% in December 2018, while the IPv6 traffic
share remains stable in the MAWI dataset at around 9% of the traffic volume. Among other protocols
at the application layer, 60%-70% of IPv4 traffic on the CAIDA link is HTTP(S) traffic, out of which
two-thirds are encrypted; for the MAWI link, more than 90% of the traffic is Web, of which nearly 75%
is encrypted. Compared to previous studies, this depicts a larger increase in encrypted Web traffic
of up to a 3-to-1 ratio of HTTPS to HTTP. As such, our observations in this study further reconfirm
that traffic shares change with time and can vary greatly depending on the vantage point studied
despite the use of the same generalized methodology and analyses, which can also be applied to other
traffic monitoring datasets.

Photovoltaic (PV) energy is key to mitigating the current energy crisis. However, distributed
PV generation, which amounts to half of the PV energy generation, makes it increasingly difficult
for transmission system operators (TSOs) to balance the load and supply and avoid grid congestions.
Indeed, in the absence of measurements, estimating the distributed PV generation is tough. In recent
years, many remote sensing-based approaches have been proposed to map distributed PV installations.
However, to be applicable in industrial settings, one needs to assess the accuracy of the mapping
over the whole deployment area. We build on existing work to propose an automated PV registry pipeline.
This pipeline automatically generates a dataset recording all distributed PV installations'
location, area, installed capacity, and tilt angle. It only requires aerial orthoimagery and topological
data, both of which are freely accessible online. In order to assess the accuracy of the registry,
we propose an unsupervised method based on the {\it Registre national d'installation} (RNI), that
centralizes all individual PV systems aggregated at communal level, enabling practitioners to
assess the accuracy of the registry and eventually remove outliers. We deploy our model on 9 French
{\it d\'epartements} covering more than 50 000 square kilometers, providing the largest mapping
of distributed PV panels with this level of detail to date. We then demonstrate how practitioners
can use our unsupervised accuracy assessment method to assess the accuracy of the outputs. In particular,
we show how it can easily identify outliers in the detections. Overall, our approach paves the way
for a safer integration of deep learning-based pipelines for remote PV mapping. Code is available

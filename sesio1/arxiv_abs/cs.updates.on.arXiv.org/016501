Complex systems, such as pathophysiological processes, commonly exhibit chaotic, nonlinear,
and intermittent phenomena. Koopman operator theory and Hankel alternative view of Koopman (HAVOK)
model have been widely used to decompose the chaos of the complex system dynamics into an intermittent
forced linear system. Although the statistics of the intermittent forcing have been proposed to
characterize intermittencies in the HAVOK model, they were not adequate to attribute for the mode
switching of nonlinear dynamics and the fat-tailed non-Gaussian distribution originated from
high-frequency bursts and rarely-observed intermittent forcing. The paper proposed a new intermittency
dynamics analysis approach to characterize the intermittent phases, chaotic bursts, and local
spectral-temporal properties of various intermittent dynamics modes using spectral decomposition
and wavelet analysis. To validate our methods, the intermittency behavior of apneic events in obstructive
sleep apnea disorder was selected as the case, in which heart rate variability (HRV) features were
extracted. Next, we constructed the Hankel matrix from the HRV features and obtained the last eigen
time-delay coordinate by singular value decomposition of the Hankel matrix, which was modeled
as an intermittent forcing input. The statistics of the forcing in OSA demonstrated the fat-tailed
distribution of the intermittent forcing, which correspond to the intermittency of the underlying
OSA pathophysiological process. The pooled means and standard deviations of the burst duration
and the inter-burst duration across OSA patients were also calculated to be minutes and minutes.
Scalogram amplitude and spectral decomposition of the wavelet transform exhibited various predominant
frequencies and dynamics modes associated with apneic events.

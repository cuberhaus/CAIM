The combination of cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) and reconfigurable
intelligent surface (RIS) is envisioned as a promising paradigm to improve network capacity and
enhance coverage capability. However, to reap full benefits of RIS-aided CF-mMIMO, the main challenge
is to efficiently design cooperative beamforming (CBF) at base stations (BSs), RISs, and users.
Firstly, we investigate the fractional programing to convert the weighted sum-rate (WSR) maximization
problem into a tractable optimization problem. Then, the alternating optimization framework
is employed to decompose the transformed problem into a sequence of subproblems, i.e., hybrid BF
(HBF) at BSs, passive BF at RISs, and combining at users. In particular, the alternating direction
method of multipliers algorithm is utilized to solve the HBF subproblem at BSs. Concretely, the
analog BF design with unit-modulus constraints is solved by the manifold optimization (MO) while
we obtain a closed-form solution to the digital BF design that is essentially a convex least-square
problem. Additionally, the passive BF at RISs and the analog combining at users are designed by primal-dual
subgradient and MO methods. Moreover, considering heavy communication costs in conventional
CF-mMIMO systems, we propose a partially-connected CF-mMIMO (P-CF-mMIMO) framework to decrease
the number of connections among BSs and users. To better compromise WSR performance and network
costs, we formulate the BS selection problem in the P-CF-mMIMO system as a binary integer quadratic
programming (BIQP) problem, and develop a relaxed linear approximation algorithm to handle this
BIQP problem. Finally, numerical results demonstrate superiorities of our proposed algorithms
over baseline counterparts.

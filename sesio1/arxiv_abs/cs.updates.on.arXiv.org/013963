Qualitative research provides methodological guidelines for observing and studying communities
and cultures on online social media platforms. However, such methods demand considerable manual
effort from researchers and may be overly focused and narrowed to certain online groups. In this
work, we propose a complete solution to accelerate qualitative analysis of problematic online
speech -- with a specific focus on opinions emerging from online communities -- by leveraging machine
learning algorithms. First, we employ qualitative methods of deep observation for understanding
problematic online speech. This initial qualitative study constructs an ontology of problematic
speech, which contains social media postings annotated with their underlying opinions. The qualitative
study also dynamically constructs the set of opinions, simultaneous with labeling the postings.
Next, we collect a large dataset from three online social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter and
Youtube) using keywords. Finally, we introduce an iterative data exploration procedure to augment
the dataset. It alternates between a data sampler, which balances exploration and exploitation
of unlabeled data, the automatic labeling of the sampled data, the manual inspection by the qualitative
mapping team and, finally, the retraining of the automatic opinion classifier. We present both
qualitative and quantitative results. First, we present detailed case studies of the dynamics
of problematic speech in a far-right Facebook group, exemplifying its mutation from conservative
to extreme. Next, we show that our method successfully learns from the initial qualitatively labeled
and narrowly focused dataset, and constructs a larger dataset. Using the latter, we examine the
dynamics of opinion emergence and co-occurrence, and we hint at some of the pathways through which
extreme opinions creep into the mainstream online discourse.

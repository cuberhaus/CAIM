In this paper, we consider electric vehicle charging facilities that offer various levels of service
for varying prices such that rational users choose a level of service that minimizes the total cost
to themselves including an opportunity cost that incorporates users' value of time. In this setting,
we study the sensitivity of the expected occupancy at the facility to mischaracterizations of user
profiles and uncharacterized heterogeneity. For user profile mischaracterizations, we first
provide a fundamental upper bound for the difference between the expected occupancy under any two
different distributions on a user's impatience (i.e., value of time) that only depends on the minimum
and maximum charging rate offered by the charging facility. Next, we consider the case when a user's
impatience is a discrete random variable and study the sensitivity of the expected occupancy to
the probability masses and attained values of the random variable. We show that the expected occupancy
varies linearly with respect to the probability masses and is piecewise constant with respect to
the attained values. Furthermore, we study the effects on the expected occupancy from the occurrence
of heterogeneous user populations. In particular, we quantify the effect on the expected occupancy
from the existence of sub-populations that may only select a subset of the offered service levels.
Lastly, we quantify the variability of early departures on the expected occupancy. These results
demonstrate how the facility operator might design prices such that the expected occupancy does
not vary much under small changes in the distribution of a user's impatience, variable and limited
user service needs, or uncharacterized early departure, quantities which are generally difficult
to characterize accurately from data. We further demonstrate our results via examples.

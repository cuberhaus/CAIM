Risk-limiting audits or RLAs are rigorous statistical procedures meant to detect invalid election
results. In general, they call for an examination of paper ballots cast during the election to statistically
assess potential disagreements between the winner determined by the ballots and the winner reported
by tabulation. The design of an RLA must balance risk, the chance that the audit fails to detect such
a disagreement when one occurs, with efficiency, the total effort to prepare and conduct the audit.
The most efficient approaches-when measured in terms of the number of ballots that must be inspected-proceed
by ballot comparison. This technique, however, requires an untrusted declaration of the contents
of each cast ballot, rather than a simple tabulation of vote totals. This cast-vote record (CVR)
is then spot-checked against ballots for consistency. The cost of generating such a CVR dominates
the cost to conduct the audit in many practical settings which precludes adoption. We introduce
a new RLA procedure: a lazy ballot comparison audit. In this audit, a global CVR is never produced;
instead, when a ballot is selected for audit a three-stage procedure is followed: 1) the batch containing
the ballot is announced, 2) a CVR is produced for that batch, and 3) the ballot is announced and compared
with the CVR. The analysis of such an audit is complicated by the fact that the details of each CVR may
depend-perhaps adversarially-on the prior history of the audit. We present three main contributions:
(1) A formal adversarial model for RLAs; (2) Definition and analysis of a lazy audit procedure with
rigorous risk limits and an associated correctness analysis accounting for the incidental errors
arising in typical audits; and (3) An analysis of the relative time savings of these techniques.

Actual causality and a closely related concept of responsibility attribution are central to accountable
decision making. Actual causality focuses on specific outcomes and aims to identify decisions
(actions) that were critical in realizing an outcome of interest. Responsibility attribution
is complementary and aims to identify the extent to which decision makers (agents) are responsible
for this outcome. In this paper, we study these concepts under a widely used framework for multi-agent
sequential decision making under uncertainty: decentralized partially observable Markov decision
processes (Dec-POMDPs). Following recent works in RL that show correspondence between POMDPs
and Structural Causal Models (SCMs), we first establish a connection between Dec-POMDPs and SCMs.
This connection enables us to utilize a language for describing actual causality from prior work
and study existing definitions of actual causality in Dec-POMDPs. Given that some of the well-known
definitions may lead to counter-intuitive actual causes, we introduce a novel definition that
more explicitly accounts for causal dependencies between agents' actions. We then turn to responsibility
attribution based on actual causality, where we argue that in ascribing responsibility to an agent
it is important to consider both the number of actual causes in which the agent participates, as well
as its ability to manipulate its own degree of responsibility. Motivated by these arguments we introduce
a family of responsibility attribution methods that extends prior work, while accounting for the
aforementioned considerations. Finally, through a simulation-based experiment, we compare
different definitions of actual causality and responsibility attribution methods. The empirical
results demonstrate the qualitative difference between the considered definitions of actual
causality and their impact on attributed responsibility.

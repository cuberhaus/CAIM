In this paper, an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is introduced to assist an unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) communication system based on non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for serving
multiple ground users. We aim to minimize the average total system energy consumption by jointly
designing the resource allocation strategy, the three dimensional (3D) trajectory of the UAV,
as well as the phase control at the IRS. The design is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem
taking into account the maximum tolerable outage probability constraint and the individual minimum
data rate requirement. To circumvent the intractability of the design problem due to the altitude-dependent
Rician fading in UAV-to-user links, we adopt the deep neural network (DNN) approach to accurately
approximate the corresponding effective channel gains, which facilitates the development of
a low-complexity suboptimal iterative algorithm via dividing the formulated problem into two
subproblems and address them alternatingly. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm can converge to an effective solution within a small number of iterations and illustrate
some interesting insights: (1) IRS enables a highly flexible UAV's 3D trajectory design via recycling
the dissipated radio signal for improving the achievable system data rate and reducing the flight
power consumption of the UAV; (2) IRS provides a rich array gain through passive beamforming in the
reflection link, which can substantially reduce the required communication power for guaranteeing
the required quality-of-service (QoS); (3) Optimizing the altitude of UAV's trajectory can effectively
exploit the outage-guaranteed effective channel gain to save the total required communication
power enabling power-efficient UAV communications.

Radar-based materials detection received significant attention in recent years for its potential
inclusion in consumer and industrial applications like object recognition for grasping and manufacturing
quality assurance and control. Several radar publications were developed for material classification
under controlled settings with specific materials' properties and shapes. Recent literature
has challenged the earlier findings on radars-based materials classification claiming that earlier
solutions are not easily scaled to industrial applications due to a variety of real-world issues.
Published experiments on the impact of these factors on the robustness of the extracted radar-based
traditional features have already demonstrated that the application of deep neural networks can
mitigate, to some extent, the impact to produce a viable solution. However, previous studies lacked
an investigation of the usefulness of lower frequency radar units, specifically <10GHz, against
the higher range units around and above 60GHz. This research considers two radar units with different
frequency ranges: Walabot-3D (6.3-8 GHz) cm-wave and IMAGEVK-74 (62-69 GHz) mm-wave imaging units
by Vayyar Imaging. A comparison is presented on the applicability of each unit for material classification.
This work extends upon previous efforts, by applying deep wavelet scattering transform for the
identification of different materials based on the reflected signals. In the wavelet scattering
feature extractor, data is propagated through a series of wavelet transforms, nonlinearities,
and averaging to produce low-variance representations of the reflected radar signals. This work
is unique in comparison of the radar units and algorithms in material classification and includes
real-time demonstrations that show strong performance by both units, with increased robustness
offered by the cm-wave radar unit.

Steadily growing amounts of information, such as annually published scientific papers, have become
so large that they elude an extensive manual analysis. Hence, to maintain an overview, automated
methods for the mapping and visualization of knowledge domains are necessary and important, e.g.,
for scientific decision makers. Of particular interest in this field is the development of research
topics of different entities (e.g., scientific authors and venues) over time. However, existing
approaches for their analysis are only suitable for single entity types, such as venues, and they
often do not capture the research topics or the time dimension in an easily interpretable manner.
Hence, we propose a principled approach for \emph{mapping research trajectories}, which is applicable
to all kinds of scientific entities that can be represented by sets of published papers. For this,
we transfer ideas and principles from the geographic visualization domain, specifically trajectory
maps and interactive geographic maps. Our visualizations depict the research topics of entities
over time in a straightforward interpr. manner. They can be navigated by the user intuitively and
restricted to specific elements of interest. The maps are derived from a corpus of research publications
(i.e., titles and abstracts) through a combination of unsupervised machine learning methods.
In a practical demonstrator application, we exemplify the proposed approach on a publication corpus
from machine learning. We observe that our trajectory visualizations of 30 top machine learning
venues and 1000 major authors in this field are well interpretable and are consistent with background
knowledge drawn from the entities' publications. Next to producing interactive, interpr. visualizations
supporting different kinds of analyses, our computed trajectories are suitable for trajectory
mining applications in the future.

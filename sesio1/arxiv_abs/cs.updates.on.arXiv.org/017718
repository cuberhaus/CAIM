Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) monitors heart rate without requiring physical contact,
which allows for a wide variety of applications. Deep learning-based rPPG have demonstrated superior
performance over the traditional approaches in controlled context. However, the lighting situation
in indoor space is typically complex, with uneven light distribution and frequent variations in
illumination. It lacks a fair comparison of different methods under different illuminations using
the same dataset. In this paper, we present a public dataset, namely the BH-rPPG dataset, which contains
data from thirty five subjects under three illuminations: low, medium, and high illumination.
We also provide the ground truth heart rate measured by an oximeter. We evaluate the performance
of three deep learning-based methods (Deepphys, rPPGNet, and Physnet) to that of four traditional
methods (CHROM, GREEN, ICA, and POS) using two public datasets: the UBFC-rPPG dataset and the BH-rPPG
dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that traditional methods are generally more resistant
to fluctuating illuminations. We found that the Physnet achieves lowest mean absolute error (MAE)
among deep learning-based method under medium illumination, whereas the CHROM achieves 1.04 beats
per minute (BPM), outperforming the Physnet by 80$\%$. Additionally, we investigate potential
methods for improving performance of deep learning-based methods. We find that brightness augmentation
make model more robust to variation illumination. These findings suggest that while developing
deep learning-based heart rate estimation algorithms, illumination variation should be taken
into account. This work serves as a benchmark for rPPG performance evaluation and it opens a pathway
for future investigation into deep learning-based rPPG under illumination variations.

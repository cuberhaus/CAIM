Reducing traffic fatalities and serious injuries is a top priority of the US Department of Transportation.
The computer vision (CV)-based crash anticipation in the near-crash phase is receiving growing
attention. The ability to perceive fatal crash risks earlier is also critical because it will improve
the reliability of crash anticipation. Yet, annotated image data for training a reliable AI model
for the early visual perception of crash risks are not abundant. The Fatality Analysis Reporting
System contains big data of fatal crashes. It is a reliable data source for learning the relationship
between driving scene characteristics and fatal crashes to compensate for the limitation of CV.
Therefore, this paper develops a data analytics model, named scenario-wise, Spatio-temporal
attention guidance, from fatal crash report data, which can estimate the relevance of detected
objects to fatal crashes from their environment and context information. First, the paper identifies
five sparse variables that allow for decomposing the 5-year fatal crash dataset to develop scenario-wise
attention guidance. Then, exploratory analysis of location- and time-related variables of the
crash report data suggests reducing fatal crashes to spatially defined groups. The group's temporal
pattern is an indicator of the similarity of fatal crashes in the group. Hierarchical clustering
and K-means clustering merge the spatially defined groups into six clusters according to the similarity
of their temporal patterns. After that, association rule mining discovers the statistical relationship
between the temporal information of driving scenes with crash features, for each cluster. The paper
shows how the developed attention guidance supports the design and implementation of a preliminary
CV model that can identify objects of a possibility to involve in fatal crashes from their environment
and context information.

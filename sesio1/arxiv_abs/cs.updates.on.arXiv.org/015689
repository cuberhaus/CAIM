This paper considers the joint device activity detection and channel estimation problem in a massive
Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity system, where a large number of IoT devices exist but merely
a random subset of them become active for short-packet transmission in each coherence block. In
particular, we propose to leverage the temporal correlation in device activity, e.g., a device
active in the previous coherence block is more likely to be still active in the current coherence
block, to improve the detection and estimation performance. However, it is challenging to utilize
this temporal correlation as side information (SI), which relies on the knowledge about the exact
statistical relation between the estimated activity pattern for the previous coherence block
(which may be imperfect with unknown error) and the true activity pattern in the current coherence
block. To tackle this challenge, we establish a novel SI-aided multiple measurement vector approximate
message passing (MMV-AMP) framework. Specifically, thanks to the state evolution of the MMV-AMP
algorithm, the correlation between the activity pattern estimated by the MMV-AMP algorithm in
the previous coherence block and the real activity pattern in the current coherence block is quantified
explicitly. Based on the well-defined temporal correlation, we further manage to embed this useful
SI into the denoiser design under the MMV-AMP framework. Specifically, the SI-based soft-thresholding
denoisers with binary thresholds and the SI-based minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) denoisers
are characterized for the cases without and with the knowledge of the channel distribution, respectively.
Numerical results are given to show the significant gain in device activity detection and channel
estimation performance brought by our proposed SI-aided MMV-AMP framework.

Developing innovative informatics approaches aimed to enhance fetal monitoring is a burgeoning
field of study in reproductive medicine. Several reviews have been conducted regarding Artificial
intelligence (AI) techniques to improve pregnancy outcomes. They are limited by focusing on specific
data such as mother's care during pregnancy. This systematic survey aims to explore how artificial
intelligence (AI) can assist with fetal growth monitoring via Ultrasound (US) image. We used eight
medical and computer science bibliographic databases, including PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, ScienceDirect,
IEEE explore, ACM Library, Google Scholar, and the Web of Science. We retrieved studies published
between 2010 to 2021. Data extracted from studies were synthesized using a narrative approach.
Out of 1269 retrieved studies, we included 107 distinct studies from queries that were relevant
to the topic in the survey. We found that 2D ultrasound images were more popular (n=88) than 3D and
4D ultrasound images (n=19). Classification is the most used method (n=42), followed by segmentation
(n=31), classification integrated with segmentation (n=16) and other miscellaneous such as object-detection,
regression and reinforcement learning (n=18). The most common areas within the pregnancy domain
were the fetus head (n=43), then fetus body (n=31), fetus heart (n=13), fetus abdomen (n=10), and
lastly the fetus face (n=10). In the most recent studies, deep learning techniques were primarily
used (n=81), followed by machine learning (n=16), artificial neural network (n=7), and reinforcement
learning (n=2). AI techniques played a crucial role in predicting fetal diseases and identifying
fetus anatomy structures during pregnancy. More research is required to validate this technology
from a physician's perspective, such as pilot studies and randomized controlled trials on AI and
its applications in a hospital setting.

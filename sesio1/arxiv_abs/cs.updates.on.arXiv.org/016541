Enabling Cooperative Driving Automation (CDA) requires high-fidelity and real-time perception
information, which is available from onboard sensors or vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications.
Nevertheless, the accessibility of this information may suffer from the range and occlusion of
perception or limited penetration rates in connectivity. In this paper, we introduce the prototype
of Cyber Mobility Mirror (CMM), a next-generation real-time traffic surveillance system for 3D
object detection, classification, tracking, and reconstruction, to provide CAVs with wide-range
high-fidelity perception information in a mixed traffic environment. The CMM system consists
of six main components: 1) the data pre-processor to retrieve and pre-process raw data from the roadside
LiDAR; 2) the 3D object detector to generate 3D bounding boxes based on point cloud data; 3) the multi-objects
tracker to endow unique IDs to detected objects and estimate their dynamic states; 4) the global
locator to map positioning information from the LiDAR coordinate to geographic coordinate using
coordinate transformation; 5) the cloud-based communicator to transmit perception information
from roadside sensors to equipped vehicles; and 6) the onboard advisor to reconstruct and display
the real-time traffic conditions via Graphical User Interface (GUI). In this study, a field-operational
prototype system is deployed at a real-world intersection, University Avenue and Iowa Avenue in
Riverside, California to assess the feasibility and performance of our CMM system. Results from
field tests demonstrate that our CMM prototype system can provide satisfactory perception performance
with 96.99% precision and 83.62% recall. High-fidelity real-time traffic conditions (at the object
level) can be displayed on the GUI of the equipped vehicle with a frequency of 3-4 Hz.

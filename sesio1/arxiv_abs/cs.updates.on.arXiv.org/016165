Stock Market can be easily seen as one of the most attractive places for investors, but it is also very
complex in terms of making trading decisions. Predicting the market is a risky venture because of
the uncertainties and nonlinear nature of the market. Deciding on the right time to trade is key to
every successful trader as it can lead to either a huge gain of money or totally a loss in investment
that will be recorded as a careless trade. The aim of this research is to develop a prediction system
for stock market using Fuzzy Logic Type2 which will handle these uncertainties and complexities
of human behaviour in general when it comes to buy, hold or sell decision making in stock trading.
The proposed system was developed using VB.NET programming language as frontend and Microsoft
SQL Server as backend. A total of four different technical indicators were selected for this research.
The selected indicators are the Relative Strength Index, William Average, Moving Average Convergence
and Divergence, and Stochastic Oscillator. These indicators serve as input variable to the Fuzzy
System. The MACD and SO are deployed as primary indicators, while the RSI and WA are used as secondary
indicators. Fibonacci retracement ratio was adopted for the secondary indicators to determine
their support and resistance level in terms of making trading decisions. The input variables to
the Fuzzy System is fuzzified to Low, Medium, and High using the Triangular and Gaussian Membership
Function. The Mamdani Type Fuzzy Inference rules were used for combining the trading rules for each
input variable to the fuzzy system. The developed system was tested using sample data collected
from ten different companies listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange for a total of fifty two periods.
The dataset collected are Opening, High, Low, and Closing prices of each security.

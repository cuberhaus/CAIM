Class imbalance is a characteristic known for making learning more challenging for classification
models as they may end up biased towards the majority class. A promising approach among the ensemble-based
methods in the context of imbalance learning is Dynamic Selection (DS). DS techniques single out
a subset of the classifiers in the ensemble to label each given unknown sample according to their
estimated competence in the area surrounding the query. Because only a small region is taken into
account in the selection scheme, the global class disproportion may have less impact over the system's
performance. However, the presence of local class overlap may severely hinder the DS techniques'
performance over imbalanced distributions as it not only exacerbates the effects of the under-representation
but also introduces ambiguous and possibly unreliable samples to the competence estimation process.
Thus, in this work, we propose a DS technique which attempts to minimize the effects of the local class
overlap during the classifier selection procedure. The proposed method iteratively removes from
the target region the instance perceived as the hardest to classify until a classifier is deemed
competent to label the query sample. The known samples are characterized using instance hardness
measures that quantify the local class overlap. Experimental results show that the proposed technique
can significantly outperform the baseline as well as several other DS techniques, suggesting its
suitability for dealing with class under-representation and overlap. Furthermore, the proposed
technique still yielded competitive results when using an under-sampled, less overlapped version
of the labelled sets, specially over the problems with a high proportion of minority class samples
in overlap areas. Code available at https://github.com/marianaasouza/lords.

Dynamic MRI may capture temporal anatomical changes in soft tissue organs with high contrast but
the obtained sequences usually suffer from limited volume coverage which makes the high resolution
reconstruction of organ shape trajectories a major challenge in temporal studies. Because of the
variability of abdominal organ shapes across time and subjects, the objective of this study is to
go towards 3D dense velocity measurements to fully cover the entire surface and to extract meaningful
features characterizing the observed organ deformations and enabling clinical action or decision.
We present a pipeline for characterization of bladder surface dynamics during deep respiratory
movements. For a compact shape representation, the reconstructed temporal volumes were first
used to establish subject-specific dynamical 4D mesh sequences using the LDDMM framework. Then,
we performed a statistical characterization of organ dynamics from mechanical parameters such
as mesh elongations and distortions. Since we refer to organs as non flat surfaces, we have also used
the mean curvature changes as metric to quantify surface evolution. However, the numerical computation
of curvature is strongly dependant on the surface parameterization. To cope with this dependency,
we employed a new method for surface deformation analysis. Independent of parameterization and
minimizing the length of the geodesic curves, it stretches smoothly the surface curves towards
a sphere by minimizing a Dirichlet energy. An Eulerian PDE approach is used to derive a shape descriptor
from the curve-shortening flow. Intercorrelations between individual motion patterns are computed
using the Laplace Beltrami operator eigenfunctions for spherical mapping. Application to extracting
characterization correlation curves for locally controlled simulated shape trajectories demonstrates
the stability of the proposed shape descriptor.

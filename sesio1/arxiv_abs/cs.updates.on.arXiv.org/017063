With the growing demand for openness, scalability, and granularity, mobile network function virtualization
(NFV) has emerged as a key enabler for most mobile network operators. NFV decouples network functions
from hardware devices. This decoupling allows network services, referred to as Virtualized Network
Functions (VNFs), to be hosted on commodity hardware which simplifies and enhances service deployment
and management for providers, improves flexibility, and leads to efficient and scalable resource
usage, and lower costs. The proper placement of VNFs in the hosting infrastructures is one of the
main technical challenges. This placement significantly influences the network's performance,
reliability, and operating costs. The VNF placement is NP-Hard. Hence, there is a need for placement
methods that can scale with the issue's complexity and find appropriate solutions in a reasonable
duration. The primary purpose of this study is to provide a taxonomy of optimization techniques
used to tackle the VNF placement problems. We classify the studied papers based on performance metrics,
methods, algorithms, and environment. Virtualization is not limited to simply replacing physical
machines with virtual machines or VNFs, but may also include micro-services, containers, and cloud-native
systems. In this context, the second part of our article focuses on the placement of containers in
edge/fog computing. Many issues have been considered as traffic congestion, resource utilization,
energy consumption, performance degradation, security, etc. For each matter, various solutions
are proposed through different surveys and research papers in which each one addresses the placement
problem in a specific manner by suggesting single objective or multi-objective methods based on
different types of algorithms such as heuristic, meta-heuristic, and machine learning algorithms.

We present a framework for learning 3D object shapes and dense cross-object 3D correspondences
from just an unaligned category-specific image collection. The 3D shapes are generated implicitly
as deformations to a category-specific signed distance field and are learned in an unsupervised
manner solely from unaligned image collections and their poses without any 3D supervision. Generally,
image collections on the internet contain several intra-category geometric and topological variations,
for example, different chairs can have different topologies, which makes the task of joint shape
and correspondence estimation much more challenging. Because of this, prior works either focus
on learning each 3D object shape individually without modeling cross-instance correspondences
or perform joint shape and correspondence estimation on categories with minimal intra-category
topological variations. We overcome these restrictions by learning a topologically-aware implicit
deformation field that maps a 3D point in the object space to a higher dimensional point in the category-specific
canonical space. At inference time, given a single image, we reconstruct the underlying 3D shape
by first implicitly deforming each 3D point in the object space to the learned category-specific
canonical space using the topologically-aware deformation field and then reconstructing the
3D shape as a canonical signed distance field. Both canonical shape and deformation field are learned
end-to-end in an inverse-graphics fashion using a learned recurrent ray marcher (SRN) as a differentiable
rendering module. Our approach, dubbed TARS, achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction fidelity
on several datasets: ShapeNet, Pascal3D+, CUB, and Pix3D chairs. Result videos and code at https://shivamduggal4.github.io/tars-3D/

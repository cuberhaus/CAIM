Insects are the most important global pollinator of crops and play a key role in maintaining the sustainability
of natural ecosystems. Insect pollination monitoring and management are therefore essential
for improving crop production and food security. Computer vision facilitated pollinator monitoring
can intensify data collection over what is feasible using manual approaches. The new data it generates
may provide a detailed understanding of insect distributions and facilitate fine-grained analysis
sufficient to predict their pollination efficacy and underpin precision pollination. Current
computer vision facilitated insect tracking in complex outdoor environments is restricted in
spatial coverage and often constrained to a single insect species. This limits its relevance to
agriculture. Therefore, in this article we introduce a novel system to facilitate markerless data
capture for insect counting, insect motion tracking, behaviour analysis and pollination prediction
across large agricultural areas. Our system is comprised of Edge Computing multi-point video recording,
offline automated multi-species insect counting, tracking and behavioural analysis. We implement
and test our system on a commercial berry farm to demonstrate its capabilities. Our system successfully
tracked four insect varieties, at nine monitoring stations within a poly-tunnel, obtaining an
F-score above 0.8 for each variety. The system enabled calculation of key metrics to assess the relative
pollination impact of each insect variety. With this technological advancement, detailed, ongoing
data collection for precision pollination becomes achievable. This is important to inform growers
and apiarists managing crop pollination, as it allows data-driven decisions to be made to improve
food production and food security.

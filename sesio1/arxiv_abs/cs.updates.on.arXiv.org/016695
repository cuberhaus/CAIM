Accurate emotion classification for online reviews is vital for business organizations to gain
deeper insights into markets. Although deep learning has been successfully implemented in this
area, accuracy and processing time are still major problems preventing it from reaching its full
potential. This paper proposes an Enhanced Leaky Rectified Linear Unit activation and Weighted
Loss (ELReLUWL) algorithm for enhanced text emotion classification and faster parameter convergence
speed. This algorithm includes the definition of the inflection point and the slope for inputs on
the left side of the inflection point to avoid gradient saturation. It also considers the weight
of samples belonging to each class to compensate for the influence of data imbalance. Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) combined with the proposed algorithm to increase the classification accuracy
and decrease the processing time by eliminating the gradient saturation problem and minimizing
the negative effect of data imbalance, demonstrated on a binary sentiment problem. The results
show that the proposed solution achieves better classification performance in different data
scenarios and different review types. The proposed model takes less convergence time to achieve
model optimization with seven epochs against the current convergence time of 11.5 epochs on average.
The proposed solution improves accuracy and reduces the processing time of text emotion classification.
The solution provides an average class accuracy of 96.63% against a current average accuracy of
91.56%. It also provides a processing time of 23.3 milliseconds compared to the current average
processing time of 33.2 milliseconds. Finally, this study solves the issues of gradient saturation
and data imbalance. It enhances overall average class accuracy and decreases processing time.

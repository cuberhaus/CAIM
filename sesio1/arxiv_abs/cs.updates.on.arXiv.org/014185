Cine cardiac MRI is routinely acquired for the assessment of cardiac health, but the imaging process
is slow and typically requires several breath-holds to acquire sufficient k-space profiles to
ensure good image quality. Several undersampling-based reconstruction techniques have been
proposed during the last decades to speed up cine cardiac MRI acquisition. However, the undersampling
factor is commonly fixed to conservative values before acquisition to ensure diagnostic image
quality, potentially leading to unnecessarily long scan times. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end
quality-aware cine short-axis cardiac MRI framework that combines image acquisition and reconstruction
with downstream tasks such as segmentation, volume curve analysis and estimation of cardiac functional
parameters. The goal is to reduce scan time by acquiring only a fraction of k-space data to enable
the reconstruction of images that can pass quality control checks and produce reliable estimates
of cardiac functional parameters. The framework consists of a deep learning model for the reconstruction
of 2D+t cardiac cine MRI images from undersampled data, an image quality-control step to detect
good quality reconstructions, followed by a deep learning model for bi-ventricular segmentation,
a quality-control step to detect good quality segmentations and automated calculation of cardiac
functional parameters. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, we perform simulations
using a cohort of selected participants from the UK Biobank (n=270), 200 healthy subjects and 70
patients with cardiomyopathies. Our results show that we can produce quality-controlled images
in a scan time reduced from 12 to 4 seconds per slice, enabling reliable estimates of cardiac functional
parameters such as ejection fraction within 5% mean absolute error.

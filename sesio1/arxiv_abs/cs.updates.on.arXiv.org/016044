The availability of the sheer volume of Copernicus Sentinel-2 imagery has created new opportunities
for exploiting deep learning methods for land use land cover (LULC) mapping at large scales. However,
an extensive set of benchmark experiments is currently lacking, i.e. deep learning models tested
on the same dataset, with a common and consistent set of metrics, and in the same hardware. In this
work, we use the BigEarthNet Sentinel-2 multispectral dataset to benchmark for the first time different
state-of-the-art deep learning models for the multi-label, multi-class LULC classification
problem, contributing with an exhaustive zoo of 56 trained models. Our benchmark includes standard
Convolution Neural Network architectures, but we also test non-convolutional methods, such as
Multi-Layer Perceptrons and Vision Transformers. We put to the test EfficientNets and Wide Residual
Networks (WRN) architectures, and leverage classification accuracy, training time and inference
rate. Furthermore, we propose to use the EfficientNet framework for the compound scaling of a lightweight
WRN, by varying network depth, width, and input data resolution. Enhanced with an Efficient Channel
Attention mechanism, our scaled lightweight model emerged as the new state-of-the-art. It achieves
4.5% higher averaged F-Score classification accuracy for all 19 LULC classes compared to a standard
ResNet50 baseline model, with an order of magnitude less trainable parameters. We provide access
to all trained models, along with our code for distributed training on multiple GPU nodes. This model
zoo of pre-trained encoders can be used for transfer learning and rapid prototyping in different
remote sensing tasks that use Sentinel-2 data, instead of exploiting backbone models trained with
data from a different domain, e.g., from ImageNet.

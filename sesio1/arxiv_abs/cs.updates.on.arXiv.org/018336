As in-vehicle communication becomes more complex, the automotive community is exploring various
architectural options such as centralized and zonal architectures for their numerous benefits.
Zonal architecture reduces the wiring cost by physically locating related operations and ECUs
near their intended functions and the number of physical ECUs through function consolidation.
Centralized architectures consolidate the number of ECUs into few, powerful compute units. Common
characteristics of these architectures include the need for high-bandwidth communication and
security, which have been elusive with standard automotive architectures. Further, as automotive
communication technologies evolve, it is also likely that multiple link-layer technologies such
as CAN and Automotive Ethernet will co-exist. These alternative architectures promise to integrate
these diverse sets of technologies. However, architectures that allow such co-existence have
not been adequately explored. In this work we explore a new network architecture called Named Data
Networking (NDN) to achieve multiple goals: provide a foundational security infrastructure and
bridge different link layer protocols such as CAN, LIN, and automotive Ethernet into a unified communication
system. We created a proof-of-concept bench-top testbed using CAN HATS and Raspberry PIs that replay
real traffic over CAN and Ethernet to demonstrate how NDN can provide a secure, high-speed bridge
between different automotive link layers. We also show how NDN can support communication between
centralized or zonal high-power compute components. Security is achieved through digitally signing
all Data packets between these components, preventing unauthorized ECUs from injecting arbitrary
data into the network. We also demonstrate NDN's ability to prevent DoS and replay attacks between
different network segments connected through NDN.

Accurate and efficient pedestrian detection is crucial for the intelligent transportation system
regarding pedestrian safety and mobility, e.g., Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, and smart
pedestrian crosswalk systems. Among all pedestrian detection methods, vision-based detection
method is demonstrated to be the most effective in previous studies. However, the existing vision-based
pedestrian detection algorithms still have two limitations that restrict their implementations,
those being real-time performance as well as the resistance to the impacts of environmental factors,
e.g., low illumination conditions. To address these issues, this study proposes a lightweight
Illumination and Temperature-aware Multispectral Network (IT-MN) for accurate and efficient
pedestrian detection. The proposed IT-MN is an efficient one-stage detector. For accommodating
the impacts of environmental factors and enhancing the sensing accuracy, thermal image data is
fused by the proposed IT-MN with visual images to enrich useful information when visual image quality
is limited. In addition, an innovative and effective late fusion strategy is also developed to optimize
the image fusion performance. To make the proposed model implementable for edge computing, the
model quantization is applied to reduce the model size by 75% while shortening the inference time
significantly. The proposed algorithm is evaluated by comparing with the selected state-of-the-art
algorithms using a public dataset collected by in-vehicle cameras. The results show that the proposed
algorithm achieves a low miss rate and inference time at 14.19% and 0.03 seconds per image pair on
GPU. Besides, the quantized IT-MN achieves an inference time of 0.21 seconds per image pair on the
edge device, which also demonstrates the potentiality of deploying the proposed model on edge devices
as a highly efficient pedestrian detection algorithm.

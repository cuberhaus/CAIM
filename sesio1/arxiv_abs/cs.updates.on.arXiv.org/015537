Artificial Intelligence (AI) development has encouraged many new research areas, including AI-enabled
Internet of Things (IoT) network. AI analytics and intelligent paradigms greatly improve learning
efficiency and accuracy. Applying these learning paradigms to network scenarios provide technical
advantages of new networking solutions. In this paper, we propose an improved approach for IoT security
from data perspective. The network traffic of IoT devices can be analyzed using AI techniques. The
Adversary Learning (AdLIoTLog) model is proposed using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with attention
mechanism on sequences of network events in the network traffic. We define network events as a sequence
of the time series packets of protocols captured in the log. We have considered different packets
TCP packets, UDP packets, and HTTP packets in the network log to make the algorithm robust. The distributed
IoT devices can collaborate to cripple our world which is extending to Internet of Intelligence.
The time series packets are converted into structured data by removing noise and adding timestamps.
The resulting data set is trained by RNN and can detect the node pairs collaborating with each other.
We used the BLEU score to evaluate the model performance. Our results show that the predicting performance
of the AdLIoTLog model trained by our method degrades by 3-4% in the presence of attack in comparison
to the scenario when the network is not under attack. AdLIoTLog can detect adversaries because when
adversaries are present the model gets duped by the collaborative events and therefore predicts
the next event with a biased event rather than a benign event. We conclude that AI can provision ubiquitous
learning for the new generation of Internet of Things.

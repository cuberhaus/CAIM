By virtue of the message-passing that implicitly injects collaborative effect into the embedding
process, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successfully adopted in recommendation systems.
Nevertheless, most of existing message-passing mechanisms in recommendation are directly inherited
from GNNs without any recommendation-tailored modification. Although some efforts have been
made towards simplifying GNNs to improve the performance/efficiency of recommendation, no study
has comprehensively scrutinized how message-passing captures collaborative effect and whether
the captured effect would benefit the prediction of user preferences over items. Therefore, in
this work we aim to demystify the collaborative effect captured by message-passing in GNNs and develop
new insights towards customizing message-passing for recommendation. First, we theoretically
analyze how message-passing captures and leverages the collaborative effect in predicting user
preferences. Then, to determine whether the captured collaborative effect would benefit the prediction
of user preferences, we propose a recommendation-oriented topological metric, Common Interacted
Ratio (CIR), which measures the level of interaction between a specific neighbor of a node with the
rest of its neighborhood set. Inspired by our theoretical and empirical analysis, we propose a recommendation-tailored
GNN, Augmented Collaboration-Aware Graph Convolutional Network (CAGCN*), that extends upon
the LightGCN framework and is able to selectively pass information of neighbors based on their CIR
via the Collaboration-Aware Graph Convolution. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets
show that CAGCN* outperforms the most representative GNN-based recommendation model, LightGCN,
by 9% in Recall@20 and also achieves more than 79% speedup. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/YuWVandy/CAGCN.

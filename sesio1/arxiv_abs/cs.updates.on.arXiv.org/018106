With healthcare being critical aspect, health insurance has become an important scheme in minimizing
medical expenses. Following this, the healthcare industry has seen a significant increase in fraudulent
activities owing to increased insurance, and fraud has become a significant contributor to rising
medical care expenses, although its impact can be mitigated using fraud detection techniques.
To detect fraud, machine learning techniques are used. The Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services
(CMS) of the United States federal government released "Medicare Part D" insurance claims is utilized
in this study to develop fraud detection system. Employing machine learning algorithms on a class-imbalanced
and high dimensional medicare dataset is a challenging task. To compact such challenges, the present
work aims to perform feature extraction following data sampling, afterward applying various classification
algorithms, to get better performance. Feature extraction is a dimensionality reduction approach
that converts attributes into linear or non-linear combinations of the actual attributes, generating
a smaller and more diversified set of attributes and thus reducing the dimensions. Data sampling
is commonlya used to address the class imbalance either by expanding the frequency of minority class
or reducing the frequency of majority class to obtain approximately equal numbers of occurrences
for both classes. The proposed approach is evaluated through standard performance metrics. Thus,
to detect fraud efficiently, this study applies autoencoder as a feature extraction technique,
synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) as a data sampling technique, and various gradient
boosted decision tree-based classifiers as a classification algorithm. The experimental results
show the combination of autoencoders followed by SMOTE on the LightGBM classifier achieved best
results.

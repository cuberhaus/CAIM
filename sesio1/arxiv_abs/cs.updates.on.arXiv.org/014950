In this work we study the orbit recovery problem over $SO(3)$, where the goal is to recover a band-limited
function on the sphere from noisy measurements of randomly rotated copies of it. This is a natural
abstraction for the problem of recovering the three-dimensional structure of a molecule through
cryo-electron tomography. Symmetries play an important role: Recovering the function up to rotation
is equivalent to solving a system of polynomial equations that comes from the invariant ring associated
with the group action. Prior work investigated this system through computational algebra tools
up to a certain size. However many statistical and algorithmic questions remain: How many moments
suffice for recovery, or equivalently at what degree do the invariant polynomials generate the
full invariant ring? And is it possible to algorithmically solve this system of polynomial equations?
We revisit these problems from the perspective of smoothed analysis whereby we perturb the coefficients
of the function in the basis of spherical harmonics. Our main result is a quasi-polynomial time algorithm
for orbit recovery over $SO(3)$ in this model. We analyze a popular heuristic called frequency marching
that exploits the layered structure of the system of polynomial equations by setting up a system
of {\em linear} equations to solve for the higher-order frequencies assuming the lower-order ones
have already been found. The main questions are: Do these systems have a unique solution? And how
fast can the errors compound? Our main technical contribution is in bounding the condition number
of these algebraically-structured linear systems. Thus smoothed analysis provides a compelling
model in which we can expand the types of group actions we can handle in orbit recovery, beyond the
finite and/or abelian case.

Over the past decade, blockchain technology has attracted a huge attention from both industry and
academia because it can be integrated with a large number of everyday applications working over
features of modern information and communication technologies (ICT). Peer-to-peer (P2) architecture
of blockchain enhances these applications by providing strong security and trust-oriented guarantees,
such as immutability, verifiability, and decentralization. Despite of these incredible features
that blockchain technology brings to these ICT applications, modern research have indicated that
these strong guarantees are not sufficient enough and blockchain networks may still prone to various
security, privacy, and reliability related issues. In order to overcome these issues, it is important
to identify the anomalous behaviour within time. Therefore, nowadays anomaly detection models
are playing an important role in protection of modern blockchain networks. These anomaly detection
models autonomously detect and predict anomaly in the network in order to protect network from unexpected
attacks. In this article, we provide an in-depth survey regarding integration of anomaly detection
models in blockchain technology. For this, we first discuss that how anomaly detection can aid in
ensuring security of blockchain based applications. Then, we demonstrate certain fundamental
evaluation matrices and key requirements that can play a critical role while developing anomaly
detection models for blockchain. Afterwards, we present a thorough survey of various anomaly detection
models from perspective of each layer of blockchain to provide readers an in-depth overview of integration
that has been carried out till date. Finally, we conclude the article by highlighting certain important
challenges alongside discussing that how they can serve as a future research directions for new
researchers in the field.

In the last two decades, ICTs have played a pivotal role in empowering rural populations in India
by making knowledge more accessible. Digital Green (DG) is one such ICT that employs a participatory
approach with smallholder farmers to produce instructional videos that encompass content specific
to them. With help of human mediators, they disseminate these videos using projectors to improve
the adoption of agricultural practices. DG's web-based data tracker stores attendance and adoption
logs of millions of farmers, videos screened and their demographic information. We leverage this
data for a period of ten years between 2010-2020 across five states in India and use it to conduct a
holistic evaluation of the ICT. First, we find disparities in adoption rates of farmers, following
which we use statistical tests to identify different factors that lead to these disparities and
gender-based inequalities. Second, to provide assistance to farmers facing challenges, we model
the adoption of practices from a video as a prediction problem and experiment with different model
architectures. Our classifier achieves accuracies ranging from 79% to 90% across the five states,
demonstrating its potential for assisting future ethnographic investigations. Third, we use
SHAP values in conjunction with our model for explaining the impact of various network, content
and demographic features on adoption. Our research finds that farmers greatly benefit from past
adopters of a video from their group and village. We also discover that videos with a low content-specificity
benefit some farmers more than others. Next, we highlight the implications of our findings by translating
them into recommendations for community building, revisiting participatory approach and mitigating
inequalities. We conclude with a discussion on how our work can assist future investigations into
the lived experiences of farmers.

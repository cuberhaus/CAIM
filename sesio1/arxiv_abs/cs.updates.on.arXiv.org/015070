Longitudinal image registration is challenging and has not yet benefited from major performance
improvements thanks to deep-learning. Inspired by Deep Image Prior, this paper introduces a different
use of deep architectures as regularizers to tackle the image registration question. We propose
a subject-specific deformable registration method called MIRRBA, relying on a deep pyramidal
architecture to be the prior parametric model constraining the deformation field. Diverging from
the supervised learning paradigm, MIRRBA does not require a learning database, but only the pair
of images to be registered to optimize the network's parameters and provide a deformation field.
We demonstrate the regularizing power of deep architectures and present new elements to understand
the role of the architecture in deep learning methods for registration. Hence, to study the impact
of the network parameters, we ran our method with different architectural configurations on a private
dataset of 110 metastatic breast cancer full-body PET images with manual segmentations of the brain,
bladder and metastatic lesions. We compared it against conventional iterative registration approaches
and supervised deep learning-based models. Global and local registration accuracies were evaluated
using the detection rate and the Dice score respectively, while registration realism was evaluated
using the Jacobian's determinant. Moreover, we computed the ability of the different methods to
shrink vanishing lesions with the disappearing rate. MIRRBA significantly improves the organ
and lesion Dice scores of supervised models. Regarding the disappearing rate, MIRRBA more than
doubles the best performing conventional approach SyNCC score. Our work therefore proposes an
alternative way to bridge the performance gap between conventional and deep learning-based methods
and demonstrates the regularizing power of deep architectures.

Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is a preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD) which occurs
even before mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Progressive SCD will convert to MCI with the potential
of further evolving to AD. Therefore, early identification of progressive SCD with neuroimaging
techniques (e.g., structural MRI) is of great clinical value for early intervention of AD. However,
existing MRI-based machine/deep learning methods usually suffer the small-sample-size problem
which poses a great challenge to related neuroimaging analysis. The central question we aim to tackle
in this paper is how to leverage related domains (e.g., AD/NC) to assist the progression prediction
of SCD. Meanwhile, we are concerned about which brain areas are more closely linked to the identification
of progressive SCD. To this end, we propose an attention-guided autoencoder model for efficient
cross-domain adaptation which facilitates the knowledge transfer from AD to SCD. The proposed
model is composed of four key components: 1) a feature encoding module for learning shared subspace
representations of different domains, 2) an attention module for automatically locating discriminative
brain regions of interest defined in brain atlases, 3) a decoding module for reconstructing the
original input, 4) a classification module for identification of brain diseases. Through joint
training of these four modules, domain invariant features can be learned. Meanwhile, the brain
disease related regions can be highlighted by the attention mechanism. Extensive experiments
on the publicly available ADNI dataset and a private CLAS dataset have demonstrated the effectiveness
of the proposed method. The proposed model is straightforward to train and test with only 5-10 seconds
on CPUs and is suitable for medical tasks with small datasets.

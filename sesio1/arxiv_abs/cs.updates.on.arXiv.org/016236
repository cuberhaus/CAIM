In presenting an irrigation detection methodology that leverages multiscale satellite imagery
of vegetation abundance, this paper introduces a process to supplement limited ground-collected
labels and ensure classifier applicability in an area of interest. Spatiotemporal analysis of
MODIS 250m Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) timeseries characterizes native vegetation phenologies
at regional scale to provide the basis for a continuous phenology map that guides supplementary
label collection over irrigated and non-irrigated agriculture. Subsequently, validated dry
season greening and senescence cycles observed in 10m Sentinel-2 imagery are used to train a suite
of classifiers for automated detection of potential smallholder irrigation. Strategies to improve
model robustness are demonstrated, including a method of data augmentation that randomly shifts
training samples; and an assessment of classifier types that produce the best performance in withheld
target regions. The methodology is applied to detect smallholder irrigation in two states in the
Ethiopian highlands, Tigray and Amhara. Results show that a transformer-based neural network
architecture allows for the most robust prediction performance in withheld regions, followed
closely by a CatBoost random forest model. Over withheld ground-collection survey labels, the
transformer-based model achieves 96.7% accuracy over non-irrigated samples and 95.9% accuracy
over irrigated samples. Over a larger set of samples independently collected via the introduced
method of label supplementation, non-irrigated and irrigated labels are predicted with 98.3%
and 95.5% accuracy, respectively. The detection model is then deployed over Tigray and Amhara,
revealing crop rotation patterns and year-over-year irrigated area change. Predictions suggest
that irrigated area in these two states has decreased by approximately 40% from 2020 to 2021.

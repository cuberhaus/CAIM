Actual real-world domains are characterised by uncertain situations in which acting and use of
resources require embracing risk. Performing actions in such domains always entails costs of consuming
some resource, such as time, money, or energy, where the knowledge about these costs can range from
totally known to totally unknown and even unknowable probabilities of costs. Think of robotic domains,
where actions and their costs are non-deterministic due to uncertain factors like obstacles. Choosing
which action to perform considering its cost on the available resource requires taking a stance
on risk. Thus, these domains call for not only planning under uncertainty but also planning while
embracing risk. Taking Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning as a widely used planning technique
in real-world applications, one can observe that existing approaches do not account for risk. That
is, computing most probable or optimal plans using actions with single-valued costs is only enough
to express risk neutrality. In this work, we postulate that HTN planning can become risk aware by
considering expected utility theory, a representative concept of decision theory that enables
choosing actions considering a probability distribution of their costs and a given risk attitude
expressed using a utility function. In particular, we introduce a general framework for HTN planning
that allows modelling risk and uncertainty using a probability distribution of action costs upon
which we define risk-aware HTN planning as an approach that accounts for the different risk attitudes
and allows computing plans that go beyond risk neutrality. In fact, we layout that computing risk-aware
plans requires finding plans with the highest expected utility. Finally, we argue that it is possible
for HTN planning agents to solve specialised risk-aware HTN planning problems by adapting some
existing HTN planning approaches.

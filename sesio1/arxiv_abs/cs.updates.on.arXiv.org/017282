Objective: The effect of camera viewpoint was studied when performing visually obstructed psychomotor
targeting tasks. Background: Previous research in laparoscopy and robotic teleoperation found
that complex perceptual-motor adaptations associated with misaligned viewpoints corresponded
to degraded performance in manipulation. Because optimal camera positioning is often unavailable
in restricted environments, alternative viewpoints that might mitigate performance effects
are not obvious. Methods: A virtual keyboard-controlled targeting task was remotely distributed
to workers of Amazon Mechanical Turk. The experiment was performed by 192 subjects for a static viewpoint
with independent parameters of target direction, Fitts' law index of difficulty, viewpoint azimuthal
angle (AA), and viewpoint polar angle (PA). A dynamic viewpoint experiment was also performed by
112 subjects in which the viewpoint AA changed after every trial. Results: AA and target direction
had significant effects on performance for the static viewpoint experiment. Movement time and
travel distance increased while AA increased until there was a discrete improvement in performance
for 180{\deg}. Increasing AA from 225{\deg} to 315{\deg} linearly decreased movement time and
distance. There were significant main effects of current AA and magnitude of transition for the
dynamic viewpoint experiment. Orthogonal direction and no-change viewpoint transitions least
affected performance. Conclusions: Viewpoint selection should aim to minimize associated rotations
within the manipulation plane when performing targeting tasks whether implementing a static or
dynamic viewing solution. Because PA rotations had negligible performance effects, PA adjustments
may extend the space of viable viewpoints. Applications: These results can inform viewpoint-selection
for visual feedback during psychomotor tasks.

Cancer is the uncontrollable cell division of abnormal cells inside the human body, which can spread
to other body organs. It is one of the non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and NCDs accounts for 71%
of total deaths worldwide whereas lung cancer is the second most diagnosed cancer after female breast
cancer. Cancer survival rate of lung cancer is only 19%. There are various methods for the diagnosis
of lung cancer, such as X-ray, CT scan, PET-CT scan, bronchoscopy and biopsy. However, to know the
subtype of lung cancer based on the tissue type H and E staining is widely used, where the staining
is done on the tissue aspirated from a biopsy. Studies have reported that the type of histology is
associated with prognosis and treatment in lung cancer. Therefore, early and accurate detection
of lung cancer histology is an urgent need and as its treatment is dependent on the type of histology,
molecular profile and stage of the disease, it is most essential to analyse the histopathology images
of lung cancer. Hence, to speed up the vital process of diagnosis of lung cancer and reduce the burden
on pathologists, Deep learning techniques are used. These techniques have shown improved efficacy
in the analysis of histopathology slides of cancer. Several studies reported the importance of
convolution neural networks (CNN) in the classification of histopathological pictures of various
cancer types such as brain, skin, breast, lung, colorectal cancer. In this study tri-category classification
of lung cancer images (normal, adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma) are carried out by using
ResNet 50, VGG-19, Inception_ResNet_V2 and DenseNet for the feature extraction and triplet loss
to guide the CNN such that it increases inter-cluster distance and reduces intra-cluster distance.

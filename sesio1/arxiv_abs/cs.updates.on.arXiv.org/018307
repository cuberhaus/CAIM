In this paper, we give an overview of some recent work on applying tools from category theory in finite
model theory, descriptive complexity, constraint satisfaction, and combinatorics. The motivations
for this work come from Computer Science, but there may also be something of interest for model theorists
and other logicians. The basic setting involves studying the category of relational structures
via a resource-indexed family of adjunctions with some process category - which unfolds relational
structures into treelike forms, allowing natural resource parameters to be assigned to these unfoldings.
One basic instance of this scheme allows us to recover, in a purely structural, syntax-free way:
the Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse~game; the quantifier rank fragments of first-order logic; the equivalences
on structures induced by (i) the quantifier rank fragments, (ii) the restriction of this fragment
to the existential positive part, and (iii) the extension with counting quantifiers; and the combinatorial
parameter of tree-depth (Nesetril and Ossona de Mendez). Another instance recovers the k-pebble
game, the finite-variable fragments, the corresponding equivalences, and the combinatorial
parameter of treewidth. Other instances cover modal, guarded and hybrid fragments, generalized
quantifiers, and a wide range of combinatorial parameters. This whole scheme has been axiomatized
in a very general setting, of arboreal categories and arboreal covers. Beyond this basic level,
a landscape is beginning to emerge, in which structural features of the resource categories, adjunctions
and comonads are reflected in degrees of logical and computational tractability of the corresponding
languages. Examples include semantic characterisation and preservation theorems, and Lovasz-type
results on counting homomorphisms.

We consider information dissemination over a network of gossiping agents (nodes). In this model,
a source keeps the most up-to-date information about a time-varying binary state of the world, and
$n$ receiver nodes want to follow the information at the source as accurately as possible. When the
information at the source changes, the source first sends updates to a subset of $m\leq n$ nodes.
After that, the nodes share their local information during the gossiping period to disseminate
the information further. The nodes then estimate the information at the source using the majority
rule at the end of the gossiping period. To analyze information dissemination, we introduce a new
error metric to find the average percentage of nodes that can accurately obtain the most up-to-date
information at the source. We characterize the equations necessary to obtain the steady-state
distribution for the average error and then analyze the system behavior under both high and low gossip
rates. In the high gossip rate, in which each node can access other nodes' information more frequently,
we show that the nodes update their information based on the majority of the information in the network.
In the low gossip rate, we introduce and analyze the gossip gain, which is the reduction at the average
error due to gossiping. In particular, we develop an adaptive policy that the source can use to determine
its current transmission capacity $m$ based on its past transmission rates and the accuracy of the
information at the nodes. In numerical results, we show that when the source's transmission capacity
$m$ is limited, gossiping can be harmful as it causes incorrect information to disseminate. We then
find the optimal gossip rates to minimize the average error for a fixed $m$. Finally, we illustrate
the outperformance of our adaptive policy compared to the constant $m$-selection policy even for
the high gossip rates.

We say that a random variable is $light$-$tailed$ if moments of order $2+\epsilon$ are finite for
some $\epsilon>0$; otherwise, we say that it is $heavy$-$tailed$. We study queueing networks that
operate under the Max-Weight scheduling policy, for the case where some queues receive heavy-tailed
traffic, while some other queues receive light-tailed traffic. We say that a queue is $delay$ $stable$
if its expected size (and hence its expected delay) is uniformly bounded over time. It is well-known
that a queue with heavy-tailed arrivals is always delay unstable. Queues with light-tailed arrivals
are often delay stable, as long as their arrival rate does not exceed the service capacity, but can
also become delay unstable because of resource-sharing with other delay unstable queues. Within
this context, and for any given "tail exponents" of the input traffic, we develop tight (necessary
and sufficient) conditions under which a queue with light-tailed arrivals is robustly delay stable,
in terms of $jumping$ $fluid$ (JF) models-an extension of traditional fluid models that allows
for jumps along coordinates associated with heavy-tailed flows. In particular, we show that a queue
is robustly delay stable if and only if all JF trajectories in a certain class, and whose number of
jumps is limited by a certain "budget," keep the queue of interest at zero. This result elucidates
the precise mechanism that leads to delay instability, through a coordination of multiple abnormally
large arrivals at possibly different times and queues. Moreover, it shows that traditional fluid
models are intrinsically unable to provide tight conditions for delay stability and settles an
earlier open question on the sufficiency of a particular fluid-based criterion. We also explore
the power of Lyapunov functions in the study of robust delay stability.

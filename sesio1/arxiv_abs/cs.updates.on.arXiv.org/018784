In recent years, hardware accelerators based on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have been
widely adopted, thanks to FPGAs' extraordinary flexibility. However, with the high flexibility
comes the difficulty in design and optimization. Conventionally, these accelerators are designed
with low-level hardware descriptive languages, which means creating large designs with complex
behavior is extremely difficult. Therefore, high-level synthesis (HLS) tools were created to
simplify hardware designs for FPGAs. They enable the user to create hardware designs using high-level
languages and provide various optimization directives to help to improve the performance of the
synthesized hardware. However, applying these optimizations to achieve high performance is time-consuming
and usually requires expert knowledge. To address this difficulty, we present an automated design
space exploration tool for applying HLS optimization directives, called Chimera, which significantly
reduces the human effort and expertise needed for creating high-performance HLS designs. It utilizes
a novel multi-objective exploration method that seamlessly integrates active learning, evolutionary
algorithm, and Thompson sampling, making it capable of finding a set of optimized designs on a Pareto
curve with only a small number of design points evaluated during the exploration. In the experiments,
in less than 24 hours, this hybrid method explored design points that have the same or superior performance
compared to highly optimized hand-tuned designs created by expert HLS users from the Rosetta benchmark
suite. In addition to discovering the extreme points, it also explores a Pareto frontier, where
the elbow point can potentially save up to 26\% of Flip-Flop resource with negligibly higher latency.

Within clinical, biomedical, and translational science, an increasing number of projects are
adopting graphs for knowledge representation. Graph-based data models elucidate the interconnectedness
between core biomedical concepts, enable data structures to be easily updated, and support intuitive
queries, visualizations, and inference algorithms. However, knowledge discovery across these
"knowledge graphs" (KGs) has remained difficult. Data set heterogeneity and complexity; the proliferation
of ad hoc data formats; poor compliance with guidelines on findability, accessibility, interoperability,
and reusability; and, in particular, the lack of a universally-accepted, open-access model for
standardization across biomedical KGs has left the task of reconciling data sources to downstream
consumers. Biolink Model is an open source data model that can be used to formalize the relationships
between data structures in translational science. It incorporates object-oriented classification
and graph-oriented features. The core of the model is a set of hierarchical, interconnected classes
(or categories) and relationships between them (or predicates), representing biomedical entities
such as gene, disease, chemical, anatomical structure, and phenotype. The model provides class
and edge attributes and associations that guide how entities should relate to one another. Here,
we highlight the need for a standardized data model for KGs, describe Biolink Model, and compare
it with other models. We demonstrate the utility of Biolink Model in various initiatives, including
the Biomedical Data Translator Consortium and the Monarch Initiative, and show how it has supported
easier integration and interoperability of biomedical KGs, bringing together knowledge from
multiple sources and helping to realize the goals of translational science.

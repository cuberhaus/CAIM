The intractability of deterministic solutions in solving $\mathcal{NP}$-Hard Combinatorial
Optimisation Problems (COP) is well reported in the literature. One mechanism for overcoming this
difficulty has been the use of efficient COP non-deterministic approaches. However, with the advent
of quantum technology, these modern devices' potential to overcome this tractability limitation
requires exploration. This paper juxtaposes classical and quantum optimisation algorithms'
performance to solve two common COP, the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the Quadratic Assignment
Problem (QAP). Two accepted classical optimisation methods, Branch and Bound (BNB) and Simulated
Annealing (SA), are compared to two quantum optimisation methods, Variational Quantum Eigensolver
(VQE) algorithm and Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA). These algorithms are
respectively executed on both classical devices and IBM's suite of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum
(NISQ) devices. We have encoded the COP problems for the respective technologies and algorithms
and provided the computational encodings for the NISQ devices. Our experimental results show that
current classical devices significantly outperform the presently available NISQ devices, which
agrees and extends with findings in the literature. Further, we introduce additional performance
metrics to better compare the two approaches concerning computational time, feasibility and solution
quality. Our results show that the VQE performs better than QAOA for these metrics, and we infer that
this is due to the increased number of operations required. Additionally, we investigate the impact
of a new set of basis gates on the quantum optimisation techniques and show they yield no notable improvement
in the results. Finally, we present the shortcomings of state-of-the-art NISQ IBM quantum devices
and argue for potential future work and investigation.

Current research on users` perspectives of cyber security and privacy related to traditional and
smart devices at home is very active, but the focus is often more on specific modern devices such as
mobile and smart IoT devices in a home context. In addition, most were based on smaller-scale empirical
studies such as online surveys and interviews. We endeavour to fill these research gaps by conducting
a larger-scale study based on a real-world dataset of 413,985 tweets posted by non-expert users
on Twitter in six months of three consecutive years (January and February in 2019, 2020 and 2021).
Two machine learning-based classifiers were developed to identify the 413,985 tweets. We analysed
this dataset to understand non-expert users` cyber security and privacy perspectives, including
the yearly trend and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We applied topic modelling, sentiment
analysis and qualitative analysis of selected tweets in the dataset, leading to various interesting
findings. For instance, we observed a 54% increase in non-expert users` tweets on cyber security
and/or privacy related topics in 2021, compared to before the start of global COVID-19 lockdowns
(January 2019 to February 2020). We also observed an increased level of help-seeking tweets during
the COVID-19 pandemic. Our analysis revealed a diverse range of topics discussed by non-expert
users across the three years, including VPNs, Wi-Fi, smartphones, laptops, smart home devices,
financial security, and security and privacy issues involving different stakeholders. Overall
negative sentiment was observed across almost all topics non-expert users discussed on Twitter
in all the three years. Our results confirm the multi-faceted nature of non-expert users` perspectives
on cyber security and privacy and call for more holistic, comprehensive and nuanced research on
different facets of such perspectives.

In this paper, we for the first time obtain characterization of four fundamental notions of detectability
for general labeled weighted automata over monoids (denoted by $\mathcal{A}^{\mathfrak{M}}$
for short), where the four notions are strong (periodic) detectability (SD and SPD) and weak (periodic)
detectability (WD and WPD). Firstly, we formulate the notions of concurrent composition, observer,
and detector for $\mathcal{A}^{\mathfrak{M}}$. Secondly, we use the concurrent composition
to give an equivalent condition for SD, use the detector to give an equivalent condition for SPD,
and use the observer to give equivalent conditions for WD and WPD, all for general $\mathcal{A}^{\mathfrak{M}}$
without any assumption. Thirdly, we prove that for a labeled weighted automaton over monoid $(\mathbb{Q}^k,+)$
(denoted by $\mathcal{A}^{\mathbb{Q}^k}$), its concurrent composition, observer, and detector
can be computed in NP, $2$-EXPTIME, and $2$-EXPTIME, respectively, by developing novel connections
between $\mathcal{A}^{\mathbb{Q}^k}$ and the NP-complete exact path length problem (proved
by [Nyk\"{a}nen and Ukkonen, 2002]) and a subclass of Presburger arithmetic. As a result, we prove
that for $\mathcal{A}^{\mathbb{Q}^k}$, SD can be verified in coNP, while SPD, WD, and WPD can be
verified in $2$-EXPTIME. Finally, we prove that the problems of verifying SD and SPD of deterministic,
deadlock-free, and divergence-free $\mathcal{A}^{\mathbb{N}}$ over monoid $(\mathbb{N},+)$
are both coNP-hard. The developed original methods will provide foundations for characterizing
other fundamental properties (e.g., diagnosability, opacity) for $\mathcal{A}^{\mathfrak{M}}$.
We also initially explore detectability in labeled timed automata, and prove that the SD verification
problem is PSPACE-complete, while WD and WPD are undecidable.

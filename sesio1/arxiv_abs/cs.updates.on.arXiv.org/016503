The bin packing problem exists widely in real logistic scenarios (e.g., packing pipeline, express
delivery), with its goal to improve the packing efficiency and reduce the transportation cost.
In this NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, the position and quantity of each item in the
box are strictly restricted by complex constraints and special customer requirements. Existing
approaches are hard to obtain the optimal solution since rigorous constraints cannot be handled
within a reasonable computation load. In this paper, for handling this difficulty, the packing
knowledge is extracted from historical data collected from the packing pipeline of Huawei. First,
by fully exploiting the relationship between historical packing records and input orders(orders
to be packed) , the problem is reformulated as a set cover problem. Then, two novel strategies, the
constraint handling and process acceleration strategies are applied to the classic column generation
approach to solve this set cover problem. The cost of solving pricing problem for generating new
columns is high due to the complex constraints and customer requirements. The proposed constraints
handling strategy exploits the historical packing records with the most negative value of the reduced
cost. Those constraints have been implicitly satisfied in these historical packing records so
that there is no need to conduct further evaluation on constraints, thus the computational load
is saved. To further eliminate the iteration process of column generation algorithm and accelerate
the optimization process, a Learning to Price approach called Modified Pointer Network is proposed,
by which we can determine which historical packing records should be selected directly. Through
experiments on realworld datasets, we show our proposed method can improve the packing success
rate and decrease the computation time simultaneously.

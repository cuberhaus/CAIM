Releasing all pairwise shortest path (APSP) distances between vertices on general graphs under
weight Differential Privacy (DP) is known as a challenging task. In the previous attempt of (Sealfon
2016}, by adding Laplace noise to each edge weight or to each output distance, to achieve DP with some
fixed budget, with high probability the maximal absolute error among all published pairwise distances
is roughly $O(n)$ where $n$ is the number of nodes. It was shown that this error could be reduced for
some special graphs, which, however, is hard for general graphs. Therefore, whether the approximation
error can be reduced to sublinear in $n$ is posted as an interesting open problem. We break the linear
barrier on the distance approximation error of previous result, by proposing an algorithm that
releases a constructed synthetic graph privately. Computing all pairwise distances on the constructed
graph only introduces $\tilde O(n^{1/2})$ error in answering all pairwise shortest path distances
for fixed privacy parameter. Our method is based on a novel graph diameter (link length) augmentation
via constructing "shortcuts" for the paths. By adding a set of shortcut edges to the original graph,
we show that any node pair has a shortest path with link length $\tilde O(n^{1/2})$. Then by adding
noises with some positive mean to the edge weights, we show that the new graph is differentially private
and can be published to answer all pairwise shortest path distances with $\tilde O(n^{1/2})$ approximation
error using standard APSP computation. Additionally, we consider the graph with small feedback
vertex set number. A feedback vertex set (FVS) of a graph is a set of vertices whose removal leaves
a graph without cycles, and the feedback vertex set number of a graph, $k$, is the size of a smallest
feedback vertex set. We propose a DP algorithm with error rate $\tilde O(k)$.

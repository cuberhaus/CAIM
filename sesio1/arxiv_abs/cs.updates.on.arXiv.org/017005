Multi-label classification has attracted much attention in the machine learning community to
address the problem of assigning single samples to more than one class at the same time. We propose
an evolving multi-label fuzzy classifier (EFC-ML) which is able to self-adapt and self-evolve
its structure with new incoming multi-label samples in an incremental, single-pass manner. It
is based on a multi-output Takagi-Sugeno type architecture, where for each class a separate consequent
hyper-plane is defined. The learning procedure embeds a locally weighted incremental correlation-based
algorithm combined with (conventional) recursive fuzzily weighted least squares and Lasso-based
regularization. The correlation-based part ensures that the interrelations between class labels,
a specific well-known property in multi-label classification for improved performance, are preserved
properly; the Lasso-based regularization reduces the curse of dimensionality effects in the case
of a higher number of inputs. Antecedent learning is achieved by product-space clustering and conducted
for all class labels together, which yields a single rule base, allowing a compact knowledge view.
Furthermore, our approach comes with an online active learning (AL) strategy for updating the classifier
on just a number of selected samples, which in turn makes the approach applicable for scarcely labelled
streams in applications, where the annotation effort is typically expensive. Our approach was
evaluated on several data sets from the MULAN repository and showed significantly improved classification
accuracy compared to (evolving) one-versus-rest or classifier chaining concepts. A significant
result was that, due to the online AL method, a 90\% reduction in the number of samples used for classifier
updates had little effect on the accumulated accuracy trend lines compared to a full update in most
data set cases.

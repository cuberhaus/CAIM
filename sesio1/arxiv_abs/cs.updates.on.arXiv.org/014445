As Mobile Networks (MNs) are advancing towards meeting mobile users requirements, the rural-urban
divide still remains a major challenge. While areas within the urban space (metropolitan mobile
space) are being developed, rural areas are left behind. Due to challenges of low population density,
low income, difficult terrain, non-existent infrastructure, lack of power grid, remote areas
have low digital penetration. This situation makes remote areas less attractive towards investments
and to operate connectivity networks, thus failing to achieve universal access to the Internet.
In addressing this issue, this paper proposes a new BS deployment and resource management method
for remote and rural areas. Here, two MN operators share their resources towards the procurement
and deployment of green energy-powered BSs equipped with computing capabilities. Then, the network
infrastructure is shared between the mobile operators, with the main goal of enabling energy-efficient
infrastructure sharing, i.e., BS and its co-located computing platform. Using this resource management
strategy in rural communication sites guarantees a Quality of Service (QoS) comparable to that
of urban communication sites. The performance evaluation conducted through simulations validates
our analysis as the prediction variations observed shows greater accuracy between the harvested
energy and the traffic load. Also, the energy savings decrease as the number of mobile users (50 users
in our case) connected to the remote site increases. Lastly, the proposed algorithm achieves 51%
energy savings when compared with the 43% obtained by our benchmark algorithm. The proposed method
demonstrates superior performance over the benchmark algorithm as it uses foresighted optimization
where the harvested energy and the expected load are predicted over a given short-term horizon.

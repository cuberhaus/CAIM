Recognizing human locomotion intent and activities is important for controlling the wearable
robots while walking in complex environments. However, human-robot interface signals are usually
user-dependent, which causes that the classifier trained on source subjects performs poorly on
new subjects. To address this issue, this paper designs the ensemble diverse hypotheses and knowledge
distillation (EDHKD) method to realize unsupervised cross-subject adaptation. EDH mitigates
the divergence between labeled data of source subjects and unlabeled data of target subjects to
accurately classify the locomotion modes of target subjects without labeling data. Compared to
previous domain adaptation methods based on the single learner, which may only learn a subset of
features from input signals, EDH can learn diverse features by incorporating multiple diverse
feature generators and thus increases the accuracy and decreases the variance of classifying target
data, but it sacrifices the efficiency. To solve this problem, EDHKD (student) distills the knowledge
from the EDH (teacher) to a single network to remain efficient and accurate. The performance of the
EDHKD is theoretically proved and experimentally validated on a 2D moon dataset and two public human
locomotion datasets. Experimental results show that the EDHKD outperforms all other methods.
The EDHKD can classify target data with 96.9%, 94.4%, and 97.4% average accuracy on the above three
datasets with a short computing time (1 ms). Compared to a benchmark (BM) method, the EDHKD increases
1.3% and 7.1% average accuracy for classifying the locomotion modes of target subjects. The EDHKD
also stabilizes the learning curves. Therefore, the EDHKD is significant for increasing the generalization
ability and efficiency of the human intent prediction and human activity recognition system, which
will improve human-robot interactions.

Pooling and unpooling are two essential operations in constructing hierarchical spherical convolutional
neural networks (HS-CNNs) for comprehensive feature learning in the spherical domain. Most existing
models employ downsampling-based pooling, which will inevitably incur information loss and cannot
adapt to different spherical signals and tasks. Besides, the preserved information after pooling
cannot be well restored by the subsequent unpooling to characterize the desirable features for
a task. In this paper, we propose a novel framework of HS-CNNs with a lifting structure to learn adaptive
spherical wavelets for pooling and unpooling, dubbed LiftHS-CNN, which ensures a more efficient
hierarchical feature learning for both image- and pixel-level tasks. Specifically, adaptive
spherical wavelets are learned with a lifting structure that consists of trainable lifting operators
(i.e., update and predict operators). With this learnable lifting structure, we can adaptively
partition a signal into two sub-bands containing low- and high-frequency components, respectively,
and thus generate a better down-scaled representation for pooling by preserving more information
in the low-frequency sub-band. The update and predict operators are parameterized with graph-based
attention to jointly consider the signal's characteristics and the underlying geometries. We
further show that particular properties are promised by the learned wavelets, ensuring the spatial-frequency
localization for better exploiting the signal's correlation in both spatial and frequency domains.
We then propose an unpooling operation that is invertible to the lifting-based pooling, where an
inverse wavelet transform is performed by using the learned lifting operators to restore an up-scaled
representation. Extensive empirical evaluations on various spherical domain tasks validate
the superiority of the proposed LiftHS-CNN.

When the global rollout of the DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) began in 2005, it started a first-of-its-kind
trial: increasing complexity of a core Internet protocol in favor of better security for the overall
Internet. The necessary cryptographic key management is made particularly challenging by DNS'
loosely-federated delegation substrate and unprecedented cryptographic scale. Though fundamental
for current and future operational success, our community lacks a clear notion of how to empirically
evaluate the process of securely changing (or transitioning) keys. In this paper, we propose two
building blocks to fundamentally understand and assess key transitions. First, the anatomy of
key transitions: measurable and well-defined properties of key changes; and second a novel classification
model based on this anatomy to describe key transitions practices in abstract terms. Our anatomy
enables the evaluation of cryptographic keys' life cycles in general, and comparison of operational
practices with prescribed key management processes, e.g., RFC key rollover guidelines. The fine-grained
transition anatomy is then abstracted through our classification model to characterize transitions
in abstract terms which rather describe a transition's behavior than its specific features. The
applicability and utility of our proposed transition anatomy and transition classes are exemplified
for the global DNSSEC deployment. Specifically, we use measurements from the first 15 years of the
DNSSEC rollout to detect and measure which key rollover/transitions have been used, to what degree,
and what their rates of errors and warnings have been. Our results show measurable gaps between prescribed
key management processes and key transitions in the wild. We also find evidence that such noncompliant
transitions are inevitable in the wild.

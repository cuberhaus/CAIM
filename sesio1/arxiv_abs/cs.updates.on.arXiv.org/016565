Fundus photography has been routinely used to document the presence and severity of various retinal
degenerative diseases such as age-related macula degeneration, glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy,
for which the fovea, optic disc (OD), and optic cup (OC) are important anatomical landmarks. Identification
of those anatomical landmarks is of great clinical importance. However, the presence of lesions,
drusen, and other abnormalities during retinal degeneration severely complicates automatic
landmark detection and segmentation. Most existing works treat the identification of each landmark
as a single task and typically do not make use of any clinical prior information. In this paper, we
present a novel method, named JOINED, for prior guided multi-task learning for joint OD/OC segmentation
and fovea detection. An auxiliary branch for distance prediction, in addition to a segmentation
branch and a detection branch, is constructed to effectively utilize the distance information
from each image pixel to landmarks of interest. Our proposed JOINED pipeline consists of a coarse
stage and a fine stage. At the coarse stage, we obtain the OD/OC coarse segmentation and the heatmap
localization of fovea through a joint segmentation and detection module. Afterwards, we crop the
regions of interest for subsequent fine processing and use predictions obtained at the coarse stage
as additional information for better performance and faster convergence. Experimental results
reveal that our proposed JOINED outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on the publicly-available
GAMMA, PALM, and REFUGE datasets of fundus images. Furthermore, JOINED ranked the 5th on the OD/OC
segmentation and fovea detection tasks in the GAMMA challenge hosted by the MICCAI2021 workshop
OMIA8.

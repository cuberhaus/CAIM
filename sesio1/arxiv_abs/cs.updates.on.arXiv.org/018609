Energy efficiency is at the core of sustainability solutions for 5/6G networks. We argue this is
a too narrow perspective on sustainability, as it ignores the effects of the increased traffic demand
these networks stimulate and the need for additional equipment that this demand requires. The hope
is that techniques to reduce the network's energy consumption in operation will be able to compensate
for increases in traffic demand. However, there are more challenges than just reducing the energy
that the network requires to function and it is not clear whether higher energy efficiency will be
able to cope with increasing demand. The need for more equipment related to deployment of 5/6G networks
may result in important environmental impacts: i) increased pressures on material extraction,
which imply socio-environmental conflicts, ecosystem destruction and displacement, ii) more
manufacturing and shipment, with effects on greenhouse gas emissions and pollution; iii) increased
disposal complexities and challenges to recycle components of such equipments. By extending our
view on sustainability to include the aforementioned often ignored implications, we are able to
identify design requirements and technical pillars of 5/6G networks that need to be rethought.
We also devise new paths forward to address these challenges. We argue that it is crucial to think
of alternative applications and requirements that aim to serve user demands explicitly, instead
of incessantly creating new needs. We also claim that acknowledging material limitations in the
production of new hardware is critical, promoting retrofitting and modular design in future network
development. The conclusions of this article show that it is time to start rethinking the course
of mobile network development in order to align it to current environmental objectives to tackle
the climate emergency the world is experiencing.

This paper presents the design, development, and testing of hardware-software systems by the IISc-TCS
team for Challenge 1 of the Mohammed Bin Zayed International Robotics Challenge 2020. The goal of
Challenge 1 was to grab a ball suspended from a moving and maneuvering UAV and pop balloons anchored
to the ground, using suitable manipulators. The important tasks carried out to address this challenge
include the design and development of a hardware system with efficient grabbing and popping mechanisms,
considering the restrictions in volume and payload, design of accurate target interception algorithms
using visual information suitable for outdoor environments, and development of a software architecture
for dynamic multi-agent aerial systems performing complex dynamic missions. In this paper, a single
degree of freedom manipulator attached with an end-effector is designed for grabbing and popping,
and robust algorithms are developed for the interception of targets in an uncertain environment.
Vision-based guidance and tracking laws are proposed based on the concept of pursuit engagement
and artificial potential function. The software architecture presented in this work proposes
an Operation Management System (OMS) architecture that allocates static and dynamic tasks collaboratively
among multiple UAVs to perform any given mission. An important aspect of this work is that all the
systems developed were designed to operate in completely autonomous mode. A detailed description
of the architecture along with simulations of complete challenge in the Gazebo environment and
field experiment results are also included in this work. The proposed hardware-software system
is particularly useful for counter-UAV systems and can also be modified in order to cater to several
other applications.

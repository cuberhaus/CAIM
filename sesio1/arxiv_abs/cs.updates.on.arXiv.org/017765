This paper studies the computation of error and correct decoding probability exponents in channel
coding and lossy source coding. For channel coding, we show that the recently proposed algorithm
of Tridenski and Zamir for computing strong converse exponent has the attractive property that
the objective function alternately takes the forms appearing in Arimoto's and Dueck and K\"orner's
exponents. Because of this property, the convergence of the algorithm directly implies the match
of the two exponents. Then, we consider a special case of Tridenski et al.'s generalized algorithm
of that has not been examined in depth. We show that the objective function of this algorithm also
has the interesting property that it takes the forms of Dueck and K\"orner's exponent and another
representation of the strong converse exponent derived by Arimoto's algorithm. This particular
case is important because the objective function in this case can be used to prove that the Gallager
and Csisz\'ar and K\"orner error exponents agree. For lossy source coding, we propose two new algorithms
for computing the Csisz\'ar and K\"orner's strong converse exponent. We also define a function
similar to Blahut's error exponent with a negative slope parameter for source coding. We show that
one of the proposed algorithms has the property that the objective function alternately takes the
forms of Csisz\'ar and K\"orner's exponent and the newly defined exponent function. The convergence
of the algorithm proves that the new exponent function coincides with the Csisz\'ar and K\"orner
exponent. We also prove that Arimoto algorithm for computing error exponent of lossy source coding
can work for negative $\rho \in [-1,0)$. and thus can be used to compute the new exponent function.
Computation of Arikan and Merhav's guessing exponent is also discussed.

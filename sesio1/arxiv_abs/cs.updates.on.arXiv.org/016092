The characterization of an exoplanet's interior is an inverse problem, which requires statistical
methods such as Bayesian inference in order to be solved. Current methods employ Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) sampling to infer the posterior probability of planetary structure parameters for
a given exoplanet. These methods are time consuming since they require the calculation of a large
number of planetary structure models. To speed up the inference process when characterizing an
exoplanet, we propose to use conditional invertible neural networks (cINNs) to calculate the posterior
probability of the internal structure parameters. cINNs are a special type of neural network which
excel in solving inverse problems. We constructed a cINN using FrEIA, which was then trained on a
database of $5.6\cdot 10^6$ internal structure models to recover the inverse mapping between internal
structure parameters and observable features (i.e., planetary mass, planetary radius and composition
of the host star). The cINN method was compared to a Metropolis-Hastings MCMC. For that we repeated
the characterization of the exoplanet K2-111 b, using both the MCMC method and the trained cINN.
We show that the inferred posterior probability of the internal structure parameters from both
methods are very similar, with the biggest differences seen in the exoplanet's water content. Thus
cINNs are a possible alternative to the standard time-consuming sampling methods. Indeed, using
cINNs allows for orders of magnitude faster inference of an exoplanet's composition than what is
possible using an MCMC method, however, it still requires the computation of a large database of
internal structures to train the cINN. Since this database is only computed once, we found that using
a cINN is more efficient than an MCMC, when more than 10 exoplanets are characterized using the same
cINN.

Photovoltaic and wind power forecasts in power systems with a high share of renewable energy are
essential in several applications. These include stable grid operation, profitable power trading,
and forward-looking system planning. However, there is a lack of publicly available datasets for
research on machine learning based prediction methods. This paper provides an openly accessible
time series dataset with realistic synthetic power data. Other publicly and non-publicly available
datasets often lack precise geographic coordinates, timestamps, or static power plant information,
e.g., to protect business secrets. On the opposite, this dataset provides these. The dataset comprises
120 photovoltaic and 273 wind power plants with distinct sides all over Germany from 500 days in hourly
resolution. This large number of available sides allows forecasting experiments to include spatial
correlations and run experiments in transfer and multi-task learning. It includes side-specific,
power source-dependent, non-synthetic input features from the ICON-EU weather model. A simulation
of virtual power plants with physical models and actual meteorological measurements provides
realistic synthetic power measurement time series. These time series correspond to the power output
of virtual power plants at the location of the respective weather measurements. Since the synthetic
time series are based exclusively on weather measurements, possible errors in the weather forecast
are comparable to those in actual power data. In addition to the data description, we evaluate the
quality of weather-prediction-based power forecasts by comparing simplified physical models
and a machine learning model. This experiment shows that forecasts errors on the synthetic power
data are comparable to real-world historical power measurements.

Modern computation based on the von Neumann architecture is today a mature cutting-edge science.
In the Von Neumann architecture, processing and memory units are implemented as separate blocks
interchanging data intensively and continuously. This data transfer is responsible for a large
part of the power consumption. The next generation computer technology is expected to solve problems
at the exascale with 1018 calculations each second. Even though these future computers will be incredibly
powerful, if they are based on von Neumann type architectures, they will consume between 20 and 30
megawatts of power and will not have intrinsic physically built-in capabilities to learn or deal
with complex data as our brain does. These needs can be addressed by neuromorphic computing systems
which are inspired by the biological concepts of the human brain. This new generation of computers
has the potential to be used for the storage and processing of large amounts of digital information
with much lower power consumption than conventional processors. Among their potential future
applications, an important niche is moving the control from data centers to edge devices. The aim
of this Roadmap is to present a snapshot of the present state of neuromorphic technology and provide
an opinion on the challenges and opportunities that the future holds in the major areas of neuromorphic
technology, namely materials, devices, neuromorphic circuits, neuromorphic algorithms, applications,
and ethics. The Roadmap is a collection of perspectives where leading researchers in the neuromorphic
community provide their own view about the current state and the future challenges. We hope that
this Roadmap will be a useful resource to readers outside this field, for those who are just entering
the field, as well as providing future perspectives for those who are well established in the neuromorphic
computing community.

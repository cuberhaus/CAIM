Shared-account Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation (SCSR) task aims to recommend the next
item via leveraging the mixed user behaviors in multiple domains. It is gaining immense research
attention as more and more users tend to sign up on different platforms and share accounts with others
to access domain-specific services. Existing works on SCSR mainly rely on mining sequential patterns
via Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based models, which suffer from the following limitations:
1) RNN-based methods overwhelmingly target discovering sequential dependencies in single-user
behaviors. They are not expressive enough to capture the relationships among multiple entities
in SCSR. 2) All existing methods bridge two domains via knowledge transfer in the latent space, and
ignore the explicit cross-domain graph structure. 3) None existing studies consider the time interval
information among items, which is essential in the sequential recommendation for characterizing
different items and learning discriminative representations for them. In this work, we propose
a new graph-based solution, namely TiDA-GCN, to address the above challenges. Specifically, we
first link users and items in each domain as a graph. Then, we devise a domain-aware graph convolution
network to learn userspecific node representations. To fully account for users' domainspecific
preferences on items, two effective attention mechanisms are further developed to selectively
guide the message passing process. Moreover, to further enhance item- and account-level representation
learning, we incorporate the time interval into the message passing, and design an account-aware
self-attention module for learning items' interactive characteristics. Experiments demonstrate
the superiority of our proposed method from various aspects.

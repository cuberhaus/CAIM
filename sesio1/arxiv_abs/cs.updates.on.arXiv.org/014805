With the rapid development of the mobile communication technology, mobile trajectories of humans
are massively collected by Internet service providers (ISPs) and application service providers
(ASPs). On the other hand, the rising paradigm of knowledge graph (KG) provides us a promising solution
to extract structured "knowledge" from massive trajectory data. In this paper, we focus on modeling
users' spatio-temporal mobility patterns based on knowledge graph techniques, and predicting
users' future movement based on the ``knowledge'' extracted from multiple sources in a cohesive
manner. Specifically, we propose a new type of knowledge graph, i.e., spatio-temporal urban knowledge
graph (STKG), where mobility trajectories, category information of venues, and temporal information
are jointly modeled by the facts with different relation types in STKG. The mobility prediction
problem is converted to the knowledge graph completion problem in STKG. Further, a complex embedding
model with elaborately designed scoring functions is proposed to measure the plausibility of facts
in STKG to solve the knowledge graph completion problem, which considers temporal dynamics of the
mobility patterns and utilizes PoI categories as the auxiliary information and background knowledge.
Extensive evaluations confirm the high accuracy of our model in predicting users' mobility, i.e.,
improving the accuracy by 5.04% compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms. In addition, PoI
categories as the background knowledge and auxiliary information are confirmed to be helpful by
improving the performance by 3.85% in terms of accuracy. Additionally, experiments show that our
proposed method is time-efficient by reducing the computational time by over 43.12% compared with
existing methods.

A cloud service provider strives to provide a high Quality of Service (QoS) to client jobs. Such jobs
vary in computational and Service-Level-Agreement (SLA) obligations, as well as differ with respect
to tolerating delays and SLA violations. The job scheduling plays a critical role in servicing cloud
demands by allocating appropriate resources to execute client jobs. The response to such jobs is
optimized by the cloud provider on a multi-tier cloud computing environment. Typically, the complex
and dynamic nature of multi-tier environments incurs difficulties in meeting such demands, because
tiers are dependent on each other which in turn makes bottlenecks of a tier shift to escalate in subsequent
tiers. However, the optimization process of existing approaches produces single-tier-driven
schedules that do not employ the differential impact of SLA violations in executing client jobs.
Furthermore, the impact of schedules optimized at the tier level on the performance of schedules
formulated in subsequent tiers tends to be ignored, resulting in a less than optimal performance
when measured at the multi-tier level. Thus, failing in committing job obligations incurs SLA penalties
that often take the form of either financial compensations, or losing future interests and motivations
of unsatisfied clients in the service provided. In this paper, a scheduling and allocation approach
is proposed to formulate schedules that account for differential impacts of SLA violation penalties
and, thus, produce schedules that are optimal in financial performance. A queue virtualization
scheme is designed to facilitate the formulation of optimal schedules at the tier and multi-tier
levels of the cloud environment. Because the scheduling problem is NP-hard, a biologically inspired
approach is proposed to mitigate the complexity of finding optimal schedules.

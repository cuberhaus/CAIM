In future IoT environments it is expected that the role of personal devices of mobile users in the
physical area where IoT devices are deployed will become more and more important. In particular,
due to the push towards decentralisation of services towards the edge, it is likely that a significant
share of data generated by IoT devices will be needed by other (mobile) nodes nearby, while global
Internet access will be limited only to a small fraction of data. In this context, opportunistic
networking schemes can be adopted to build efficient content-centric protocols, through which
data generated by IoT devices (or by mobile nodes themselves) can be accessed by the other nodes nearby.
In this paper, we propose MobCCN, which is an ICN-compliant protocol for this heterogeneous environment.
MobCCN is designed to implement the routing and forwarding mechanisms of the main ICN realisations,
such as CCN. The original aspect of MobCCN is to implement an efficient opportunistic networking
routing scheme to populate the Forwarding Interest Base (FIB) tables of the nodes, in order to guide
the propagation of Interest packets towards nodes that store the required data. Specifically,
MobCCN defines the utility of each node as a forwarder of Interest packets for a certain type of content,
such that Interest packets can be propagated along a positive utility gradient, until reaching
some node storing the data. We evaluate MobCCN against protocols representing two possible endpoints
of the spectrum, respectively in terms of minimising the data delivery delay and the resource consumption.
Performance results show that MobCCN is very effective and efficient, as it guarantees very high
delivery rates and low delays, while keeping the total generated traffic at a reasonable level and
also saving local resources.

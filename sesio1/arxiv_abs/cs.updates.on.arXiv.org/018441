This paper proposes a real-time neural network (NN) stochastic filter-based controller on the
Lie Group of the Special Orthogonal Group $SO(3)$ as a novel approach to the attitude tracking problem.
The introduced solution consists of two parts: a filter and a controller. Firstly, an adaptive NN-based
stochastic filter is proposed that estimates attitude components and dynamics using measurements
supplied by onboard sensors directly. The filter design accounts for measurement uncertainties
inherent to the attitude dynamics, namely unknown bias and noise corrupting angular velocity measurements.
The closed loop signals of the proposed NN-based stochastic filter have been shown to be semi-globally
uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). Secondly, a novel control law on $SO(3)$ coupled with the
proposed estimator is presented. The control law addresses unknown disturbances. In addition,
the closed loop signals of the proposed filter-based controller have been shown to be SGUUB. The
proposed approach offers robust tracking performance by supplying the required control signal
given data extracted from low-cost inertial measurement units. While the filter-based controller
is presented in continuous form, the discrete implementation is also presented. Additionally,
the unit-quaternion form of the proposed approach is given. The effectiveness and robustness of
the proposed filter-based controller is demonstrated using its discrete form and considering
low sampling rate, high initialization error, high-level of measurement uncertainties, and unknown
disturbances. Keywords: Neuro-adaptive, estimator, filter, observer, control system, trajectory

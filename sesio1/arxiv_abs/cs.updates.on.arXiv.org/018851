A variety of statistical and machine learning methods are used to model crash frequency on specific
roadways with machine learning methods generally having a higher prediction accuracy. Recently,
heterogeneous ensemble methods (HEM), including stacking, have emerged as more accurate and robust
intelligent techniques and are often used to solve pattern recognition problems by providing more
reliable and accurate predictions. In this study, we apply one of the key HEM methods, Stacking,
to model crash frequency on five lane undivided segments (5T) of urban and suburban arterials. The
prediction performance of Stacking is compared with parametric statistical models (Poisson and
negative binomial) and three state of the art machine learning techniques (Decision tree, random
forest, and gradient boosting), each of which is termed as the base learner. By employing an optimal
weight scheme to combine individual base learners through stacking, the problem of biased predictions
in individual base-learners due to differences in specifications and prediction accuracies is
avoided. Data including crash, traffic, and roadway inventory were collected and integrated from
2013 to 2017. The data are split into training, validation, and testing datasets. Estimation results
of statistical models reveal that besides other factors, crashes increase with density (number
per mile) of different types of driveways. Comparison of out-of-sample predictions of various
models confirms the superiority of Stacking over the alternative methods considered. From a practical
standpoint, stacking can enhance prediction accuracy (compared to using only one base learner
with a particular specification). When applied systemically, stacking can help identify more
appropriate countermeasures.

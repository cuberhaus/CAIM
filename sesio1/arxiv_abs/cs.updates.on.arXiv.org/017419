Current tractography methods use the local orientation information to propagate streamlines
from seed locations. Many such seeds provide streamlines that stop prematurely or fail to map the
true pathways because some white matter bundles are "harder-to-track" than others. This results
in tractography reconstructions with poor white and gray matter spatial coverage. In this work,
we propose a generative, autoencoder-based method, named GESTA (Generative Sampling in Tractography
using Autoencoders), that produces streamlines with better spatial coverage. Compared to other
deep learning methods, our autoencoder-based framework is not constrained by any prior or a fixed
set of bundles. GESTA produces new and complete streamlines for any white matter bundle. GESTA is
shown to be effective on both synthetic and human brain in vivo data. Our streamline evaluation framework
ensures that the streamlines produced by GESTA are anatomically plausible and fit well to the local
diffusion signal. The streamline evaluation criteria assess anatomy (white matter coverage),
local orientation alignment (direction), geometry features of streamlines, and optionally,
gray matter connectivity. The GESTA framework offers considerable gains in bundle coverage using
a reduced set of seeding streamlines with a 1.5x improvement for the "Fiber Cup", and 6x for the ISMRM
2015 Tractography Challenge datasets. Similarly, it provides a 4x white matter volume increase
on the BIL&GIN callosal homotopic dataset. It also successfully generates new streamlines in poorly
populated bundles, such as the fornix and other hard-to-track bundles, on in vivo data. GESTA is
thus the first deep tractography generative method that can improve white matter reconstruction
of hard-to-track bundles.

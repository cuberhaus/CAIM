System optimum (SO) routing, wherein the total travel time of all users is minimized, is a holy grail
for transportation authorities. However, SO routing may discriminate against users who incur
much larger travel times than others to achieve high system efficiency, i.e., low total travel times.
To address the inherent unfairness of SO routing, we study the ${\beta}$-fair SO problem whose goal
is to minimize the total travel time while guaranteeing a ${\beta\geq 1}$ level of unfairness, which
specifies the maximum possible ratio between the travel times of different users with shared origins
and destinations. To obtain feasible solutions to the ${\beta}$-fair SO problem while achieving
high system efficiency, we develop a new convex program, the Interpolated Traffic Assignment Problem
(I-TAP), which interpolates between a fairness-promoting and an efficiency-promoting traffic-assignment
objective. We evaluate the efficacy of I-TAP through theoretical bounds on the total system travel
time and level of unfairness in terms of its interpolation parameter, as well as present a numerical
comparison between I-TAP and a state-of-the-art algorithm on a range of transportation networks.
The numerical results indicate that our approach is faster by several orders of magnitude as compared
to the benchmark algorithm, while achieving higher system efficiency for all desirable levels
of unfairness. We further leverage the structure of I-TAP to develop two pricing mechanisms to collectively
enforce the I-TAP solution in the presence of selfish homogeneous and heterogeneous users, respectively,
that independently choose routes to minimize their own travel costs. We mention that this is the
first study of pricing in the context of fair routing for general road networks (as opposed to, e.g.,
parallel road networks).

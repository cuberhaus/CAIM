The paper quantifies the impact of race, poverty, politics, and age on COVID-19 vaccination rates
in counties in the continental US. Both, OLS regression analysis and Random Forest machine learning
algorithms are applied to quantify factors for county-level vaccination hesitancy. The machine
learning model considers joint effects of variables (race/ethnicity, partisanship, age, etc.)
simultaneously to capture the unique combination of these factors on the vaccination rate. By implementing
a state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence Explanations (AIX) algorithm, it is possible to solve
the black box problem with machine learning models and provide answers to the "how much" question
for each measured impact factor in every county. For most counties, a higher percentage vote for
Republicans, a greater African American population share, and a higher poverty rate lower the vaccination
rate. While a higher Asian population share increases the predicted vaccination rate. The impact
on the vaccination rate from the Hispanic population proportion is positive in the OLS model, but
only positive for counties with a high Hispanic population (>65%) in the Random Forest model. Both
the proportion of seniors and the one for young people in a county have a significant impact in the
OLS model - positive and negative, respectively. In contrast, the impacts are ambiguous in the Random
Forest model. Because results vary between geographies and since the AIX algorithm is able to quantify
vaccine impacts individually for each county, this research can be tailored to local communities.
An interactive online mapping dashboard that identifies impact factors for individual U.S. counties
is available at https://www.cpp.edu/~clange/vacmap.html. It is apparent that the influence
of impact factors is not universally the same across different geographies.

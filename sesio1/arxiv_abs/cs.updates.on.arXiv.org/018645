Reviews play a crucial role in a product's visibility and eventually customers' buying decisions
on e-commerce sites. While there is suspicion and anecdotal reports about the prevalence of fake
reviews on popular e-commerce sites, little is known about how reputation manipulation services
continue to operate despite attempts to thwart them. We investigate an emerging fraud ecosystem
of incentivized reviews -- fake reviews written by real customers. In this kind of review fraud,
sellers give away products for free to complicit buyers in exchange for a positive review. Like other
fraud services, these incentivized review services are operated through specialized agents that
mediate the exchange between buyers and sellers. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth quantitative
and qualitative study of such services for Amazon.com. We infiltrate Facebook groups that are used
for recruitment. We are able to identify more than 1600 products seeking incentivized reviews.
We first evaluate off-the-shelf machine learning classifiers as well as Amazon's own countermeasures
against incentivized reviews and corresponding products. Our results demonstrate the ineffectiveness
of these countermeasures -- even when incentivized reviews are removed, new ones are promptly added
back to make up for the removed reviews. To better understand the inner workings of incentivized
reviews services, we survey 38 agents and 36 buyers. Our analysis reveals that the reviews service
spans multiple countries, with sellers typically in China, agents in Pakistan and Bangladesh,
and buyers in the US, UK, Canada, France, and Germany. We find that groups of agents work together
using sophisticated training materials, incentive structures, and reporting mechanisms. Buyers
intentionally use tactics such as spreading out the reviews over time and simulating an organic
search to circumvent detection.

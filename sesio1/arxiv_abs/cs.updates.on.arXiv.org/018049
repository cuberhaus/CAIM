To satisfy varying customer needs, device vendors and OS providers often rely on the open-source
nature of the Android OS and offer customized versions of the Android OS. When a new version of the
Android OS is released, device vendors and OS providers need to merge the changes from the Android
OS into their customizations to account for its bug fixes, security patches, and new features. Because
developers of customized OSs might have made changes to code locations that were also modified by
the developers of the Android OS, the merge task can be characterized by conflicts, which can be time-consuming
and error-prone to resolve. To provide more insight into this critical aspect of the Android ecosystem,
we present an empirical study that investigates how eight open-source customizations of the Android
OS merge the changes from the Android OS into their projects. The study analyzes how often the developers
from the customized OSs merge changes from the Android OS, how often the developers experience textual
merge conflicts, and the characteristics of these conflicts. Furthermore, to analyze the effect
of the conflicts, the study also analyzes how the conflicts can affect a randomly selected sample
of 1,000 apps. After analyzing 1,148 merge operations, we identified that developers perform these
operations for 9.7\% of the released versions of the Android OS, developers will encounter at least
one conflict in 41.3\% of the merge operations, 58.1\% of the conflicts required developers to change
the customized OSs, and 64.4\% of the apps considered use at least one method affected by a conflict.
In addition to detailing our results, the paper also discusses the implications of our findings
and provides insights for researchers and practitioners working with Android and its customizations.

Given the computational cost and technical expertise required to train machine learning models,
users may delegate the task of learning to a service provider. We show how a malicious learner can
plant an undetectable backdoor into a classifier. On the surface, such a backdoored classifier
behaves normally, but in reality, the learner maintains a mechanism for changing the classification
of any input, with only a slight perturbation. Importantly, without the appropriate "backdoor
key", the mechanism is hidden and cannot be detected by any computationally-bounded observer.
We demonstrate two frameworks for planting undetectable backdoors, with incomparable guarantees.
First, we show how to plant a backdoor in any model, using digital signature schemes. The construction
guarantees that given black-box access to the original model and the backdoored version, it is computationally
infeasible to find even a single input where they differ. This property implies that the backdoored
model has generalization error comparable with the original model. Second, we demonstrate how
to insert undetectable backdoors in models trained using the Random Fourier Features (RFF) learning
paradigm or in Random ReLU networks. In this construction, undetectability holds against powerful
white-box distinguishers: given a complete description of the network and the training data, no
efficient distinguisher can guess whether the model is "clean" or contains a backdoor. Our construction
of undetectable backdoors also sheds light on the related issue of robustness to adversarial examples.
In particular, our construction can produce a classifier that is indistinguishable from an "adversarially
robust" classifier, but where every input has an adversarial example! In summary, the existence
of undetectable backdoors represent a significant theoretical roadblock to certifying adversarial
robustness.

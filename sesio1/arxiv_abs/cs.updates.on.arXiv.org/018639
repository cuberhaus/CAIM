We consider prophet inequalities under general downward-closed constraints. In a prophet inequality
problem, a decision-maker sees a series of online elements and needs to decide immediately and irrevocably
whether or not to select each element upon its arrival, subject to an underlying feasibility constraint.
Traditionally, the decision-maker's expected performance has been compared to the expected performance
of the \emph{prophet}, i.e., the expected offline optimum. We refer to this measure as the \textit{Ratio
of Expectations} (or, in short, \textsf{RoE}). However, a major limitation of the \textsf{RoE}
measure is that it only gives a guarantee against what the optimum would be on average, while, in theory,
algorithms still might perform poorly compared to the realized ex-post optimal value. Hence, we
study alternative performance measures. In particular, we suggest the \textit{Expected Ratio}
(or, in short, \textsf{EoR}), which is the expectation of the ratio between the value of the algorithm
and the value of the prophet. This measure yields desirable guarantees, e.g., a constant \textsf{EoR}
implies achieving a constant fraction of the ex-post offline optimum with constant probability.
Moreover, in the single-choice setting, we show that the \textsf{EoR} is equivalent (in the worst
case) to the probability of selecting the maximum, a well-studied measure in the literature. This
is no longer the case for combinatorial constraints (beyond single-choice), which is the main focus
of this paper. Our main goal is to understand the relation between \textsf{RoE} and \textsf{EoR}
in combinatorial settings. Specifically, we establish a two-way black-box reduction: for every
feasibility constraint, the \textsf{RoE} and the \textsf{EoR} are at most a constant factor apart.
This implies a wealth of \textsf{EoR} results in multiple settings where \textsf{RoE} results
are known.

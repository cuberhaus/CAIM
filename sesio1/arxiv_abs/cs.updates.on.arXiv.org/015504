A promising approach to improve cloud parameterizations within climate models and thus climate
projections is to use deep learning in combination with training data from storm-resolving model
(SRM) simulations. The Icosahedral Non-Hydrostatic (ICON) modeling framework permits simulations
ranging from numerical weather prediction to climate projections, making it an ideal target to
develop neural network (NN) based parameterizations for sub-grid scale processes. Within the
ICON framework, we train NN based cloud cover parameterizations with coarse-grained data based
on realistic regional and global ICON SRM simulations. We set up three different types of NNs that
differ in the degree of vertical locality they assume for diagnosing cloud cover from coarse-grained
atmospheric state variables. The NNs accurately estimate sub-grid scale cloud cover from coarse-grained
data that has similar geographical characteristics as their training data. Additionally, globally
trained NNs can reproduce sub-grid scale cloud cover of the regional SRM simulation. Using the game-theory
based interpretability library SHapley Additive exPlanations, we identify an overemphasis on
specific humidity and cloud ice as the reason why our column-based NN cannot perfectly generalize
from the global to the regional coarse-grained SRM data. The interpretability tool also helps visualize
similarities and differences in feature importance between regionally and globally trained column-based
NNs, and reveals a local relationship between their cloud cover predictions and the thermodynamic
environment. Our results show the potential of deep learning to derive accurate yet interpretable
cloud cover parameterizations from global SRMs, and suggest that neighborhood-based models may
be a good compromise between accuracy and generalizability.

Purpose: Automated liver tumor segmentation from Computed Tomography (CT) images is a necessary
prerequisite in the interventions of hepatic abnormalities and surgery planning. However, accurate
liver tumor segmentation remains challenging due to the large variability of tumor sizes and inhomogeneous
texture. Recent advances based on Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) for medical image segmentation
drew on the success of learning discriminative pyramid features. In this paper, we propose a Decoupled
Pyramid Correlation Network (DPC-Net) that exploits attention mechanisms to fully leverage both
low- and high-level features embedded in FCN to segment liver tumor. Methods: We first design a powerful
Pyramid Feature Encoder (PFE) to extract multi-level features from input images. Then we decouple
the characteristics of features concerning spatial dimension (i.e., height, width, depth) and
semantic dimension (i.e., channel). On top of that, we present two types of attention modules, Spatial
Correlation (SpaCor) and Semantic Correlation (SemCor) modules, to recursively measure the correlation
of multi-level features. The former selectively emphasizes global semantic information in low-level
features with the guidance of high-level ones. The latter adaptively enhance spatial details in
high-level features with the guidance of low-level ones. Results: We evaluate the DPC-Net on MICCAI
2017 LiTS Liver Tumor Segmentation (LiTS) challenge dataset. Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC)
and Average Symmetric Surface Distance (ASSD) are employed for evaluation. The proposed method
obtains a DSC of 76.4% and an ASSD of 0.838 mm for liver tumor segmentation, outperforming the state-of-the-art
methods. It also achieves a competitive results with a DSC of 96.0% and an ASSD of 1.636 mm for liver
segmentation.

In recent years, number of edge computing devices and artificial intelligence applications on
them have advanced excessively. In edge computing, decision making processes and computations
are moved from servers to edge devices. Hence, cheap and low power devices are required. FPGAs are
very low power, inclined to do parallel operations and deeply suitable devices for running Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNN) which are the fundamental unit of an artificial intelligence application.
Face detection on surveillance systems is the most expected application on the security market.
In this work, TinyYolov3 architecture is redesigned and deployed for face detection. It is a CNN
based object detection method and developed for embedded systems. PYNQ-Z2 is selected as a target
board which has low-end Xilinx Zynq 7020 System-on-Chip (SoC) on it. Redesigned TinyYolov3 model
is defined in numerous bit width precisions with Brevitas library which brings fundamental CNN
layers and activations in integer quantized form. Then, the model is trained in a quantized structure
with WiderFace dataset. In order to decrease latency and power consumption, onchip memory of the
FPGA is configured as a storage of whole network parameters and the last activation function is modified
as rescaled HardTanh instead of Sigmoid. Also, high degree of parallelism is applied to logical
resources of the FPGA. The model is converted to an HLS based application with using FINN framework
and FINN-HLS library which includes the layer definitions in C++. Later, the model is synthesized
and deployed. CPU of the SoC is employed with multithreading mechanism and responsible for preprocessing,
postprocessing and TCP/IP streaming operations. Consequently, 2.4 Watt total board power consumption,
18 Frames-Per-Second (FPS) throughput and 0.757 mAP accuracy rate on Easy category of the WiderFace
are achieved with 4 bits precision model.

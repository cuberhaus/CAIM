Model driven development envisages the use of model transformations to evolve models. Model transformation
languages, developed for this task, are touted with many benefits over general purpose programming
languages. However, a large number of these claims have not yet been substantiated. They are also
made without the context necessary to be able to critically assess their merit or built meaningful
empirical studies around them. The objective of our work is to elicit the reasoning, influences
and background knowledge that lead people to assume benefits or drawbacks of model transformation
languages. We conducted a large-scale interview study involving 56 participants from research
and industry. Interviewees were presented with claims about model transformation languages and
were asked to provide reasons for their assessment thereof. We qualitatively analysed the responses
to find factors that influence he properties of model transformation languages as well as explanations
as to how exactly they do so. Our interviews show, that general purpose expressiveness of GPLs, domain
specific capabilities of MTLs as well as tooling all have strong influences on how people view properties
of model transformation languages. Moreover, the Choice of MTL, the Use Case for which a transformation
should be developed as well as the Skills of involved stakeholders have a moderating effect on the
influences, by changing the context to consider. There is a broad body of experience, that suggests
positive and negative influences for properties of MTLs. Our data suggests, that much needs to be
done in order to convey the viability of model transformation languages. Efforts to provide more
empirical substance need to be undergone and lacklustre language capabilities and tooling need
to be improved upon. We suggest several approaches for this that can be based on the results of the
presented study.

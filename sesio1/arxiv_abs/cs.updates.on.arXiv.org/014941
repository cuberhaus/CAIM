Multipoint evaluation is the computational task of evaluating a polynomial given as a list of coefficients
at a given set of inputs. And while \emph{nearly linear time} algorithms have been known for the univariate
instance of multipoint evaluation for close to five decades due to a work of Borodin and Moenck \cite{BM74},
fast algorithms for the multivariate version have been much harder to come by. In a significant improvement
to the state of art for this problem, Umans \cite{Umans08} and Kedlaya \& Umans \cite{Kedlaya11}
gave nearly linear time algorithms for this problem over field of small characteristic and over
all finite fields respectively, provided that the number of variables $n$ is at most $d^{o(1)}$
where the degree of the input polynomial in every variable is less than $d$. They also stated the question
of designing fast algorithms for the large variable case (i.e. $n \notin d^{o(1)}$) as an open problem.
In this work, we show that there is a deterministic algorithm for multivariate multipoint evaluation
over a field $\F_{q}$ of characteristic $p$ which evaluates an $n$-variate polynomial of degree
less than $d$ in each variable on $N$ inputs in time $$\left((N + d^n)^{1 + o(1)}\poly(\log q, d, p,
n)\right) \, ,$$ provided that $p$ is at most $d^{o(1)}$, and $q$ is at most $(\exp(\exp(\exp(\cdots
(\exp(d)))))$, where the height of this tower of exponentials is fixed. When the number of variables
is large (e.g. $n \notin d^{o(1)}$), this is the first {nearly linear} time algorithm for this problem
over any (large enough) field.Our algorithm is based on elementary algebraic ideas and this algebraic
structure naturally leads to the applications to data structure upper bounds for polynomial evaluation
and to an upper bound on the rigidity of Vandermonde matrices.

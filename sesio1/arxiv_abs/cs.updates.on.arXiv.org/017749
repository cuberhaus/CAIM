Owing to the rapid development of sensor technology, hyperspectral (HS) remote sensing (RS) imaging
has provided a significant amount of spatial and spectral information for the observation and analysis
of the Earth's surface at a distance of data acquisition devices, such as aircraft, spacecraft,
and satellite. The recent advancement and even revolution of the HS RS technique offer opportunities
to realize the full potential of various applications, while confronting new challenges for efficiently
processing and analyzing the enormous HS acquisition data. Due to the maintenance of the 3-D HS inherent
structure, tensor decomposition has aroused widespread concern and research in HS data processing
tasks over the past decades. In this article, we aim at presenting a comprehensive overview of tensor
decomposition, specifically contextualizing the five broad topics in HS data processing, and
they are HS restoration, compressed sensing, anomaly detection, super-resolution, and spectral
unmixing. For each topic, we elaborate on the remarkable achievements of tensor decomposition
models for HS RS with a pivotal description of the existing methodologies and a representative exhibition
on the experimental results. As a result, the remaining challenges of the follow-up research directions
are outlined and discussed from the perspective of the real HS RS practices and tensor decomposition
merged with advanced priors and even with deep neural networks. This article summarizes different
tensor decomposition-based HS data processing methods and categorizes them into different classes
from simple adoptions to complex combinations with other priors for the algorithm beginners. We
also expect this survey can provide new investigations and development trends for the experienced
researchers who understand tensor decomposition and HS RS to some extent.

Low latency and reliable information transfer are highly demanded in 5G and beyond 5G wireless communications.
However, the conventional media access control (MAC) protocol for local wireless networks sometimes
unexpectedly yields significant delays due to its stochastic arbitration mechanism, resulting
in the incapability of limiting the maximum delay. In the meantime, the latest precise time synchronization
technology, especially wireless two-way interferometry (Wi-Wi), paves a new way to overcome such
fundamental difficulties. Indeed, Yamasaki et al. proposed a new delay-bounded wireless MAC protocol
named Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Arbitration Point (CSMA/AP), exploiting precise time
synchronization among all devices in the network. CSMA/AP enables collision-free and delay-bounded
communications with a simple autonomous arbitration mechanism, unlike conventional methods
such as CSMA/CA. The former study, however, was limited only to numerical examinations. Experimental
demonstration and verification in wireless environments are one of the most critical steps. This
paper experimentally demonstrates the fundamental principles of CSMA/AP by constructing a star-topology
wireless network using software-defined radio terminals combined with precise time synchronization
devices. We show that CSMA/AP is successfully operated, including the dynamic change of the spatial
position of the terminal or the capability to accommodate mobility, thanks to the real-time adaption
to the dynamically changing environment by Wi-Wi. We also experimentally confirm that the proposed
CSMA/AP principle cannot be executed without Wi-Wi, which validates the impact of precise time
synchronization. This study paves a way toward realizing delay-bounded wireless communications
for future low-latency and highly reliable critical applications.

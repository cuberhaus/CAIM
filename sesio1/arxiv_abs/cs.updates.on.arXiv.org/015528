The malware has been being one of the most damaging threats to computers that span across multiple
operating systems and various file formats. To defend against the ever-increasing and ever-evolving
threats of malware, tremendous efforts have been made to propose a variety of malware detection
methods that attempt to effectively and efficiently detect malware. Recent studies have shown
that, on the one hand, existing ML and DL enable the superior detection of newly emerging and previously
unseen malware. However, on the other hand, ML and DL models are inherently vulnerable to adversarial
attacks in the form of adversarial examples, which are maliciously generated by slightly and carefully
perturbing the legitimate inputs to confuse the targeted models. Basically, adversarial attacks
are initially extensively studied in the domain of computer vision, and some quickly expanded to
other domains, including NLP, speech recognition and even malware detection. In this paper, we
focus on malware with the file format of portable executable (PE) in the family of Windows operating
systems, namely Windows PE malware, as a representative case to study the adversarial attack methods
in such adversarial settings. To be specific, we start by first outlining the general learning framework
of Windows PE malware detection based on ML/DL and subsequently highlighting three unique challenges
of performing adversarial attacks in the context of PE malware. We then conduct a comprehensive
and systematic review to categorize the state-of-the-art adversarial attacks against PE malware
detection, as well as corresponding defenses to increase the robustness of PE malware detection.
We conclude the paper by first presenting other related attacks against Windows PE malware detection
beyond the adversarial attacks and then shedding light on future research directions and opportunities.

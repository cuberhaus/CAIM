This paper concerns differentially private Bayesian estimation of the parameters of a population
distribution, when a statistic of a sample from that population is shared in noise to provide differential
privacy. This work mainly addresses two problems: (1) What statistic of the sample should be shared
privately? For the first question, i.e., the one about statistic selection, we promote using the
Fisher information. We find out that, the statistic that is most informative in a non-privacy setting
may not be the optimal choice under the privacy restrictions. We provide several examples to support
that point. We consider several types of data sharing settings and propose several Monte Carlo-based
numerical estimation methods for calculating the Fisher information for those settings. The second
question concerns inference: (2) Based on the shared statistics, how could we perform effective
Bayesian inference? We propose several Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for sampling
from the posterior distribution of the parameter given the noisy statistic. The proposed MCMC algorithms
can be preferred over one another depending on the problem. For example, when the shared statistics
is additive and added Gaussian noise, a simple Metropolis-Hasting algorithm that utilizes the
central limit theorem is a decent choice. We propose more advanced MCMC algorithms for several other
cases of practical relevance. Our numerical examples involve comparing several candidate statistics
to be shared privately. For each statistic, we perform Bayesian estimation based on the posterior
distribution conditional on the privatized version of that statistic. We demonstrate that, the
relative performance of a statistic, in terms of the mean squared error of the Bayesian estimator
based on the corresponding privatized statistic, is adequately predicted by the Fisher information
of the privatized statistic.

This paper introduces an efficient algorithm for persistence diagram computation, given an input
piecewise linear scalar field f defined on a d-dimensional simplicial complex K, with $d \leq 3$.
Our method extends the seminal "PairCells" algorithm by introducing three main accelerations.
First, we express this algorithm within the setting of discrete Morse theory, which considerably
reduces the number of input simplices to consider. Second, we introduce a stratification approach
to the problem, that we call "sandwiching". Specifically, minima-saddle persistence pairs ($D_0(f)$)
and saddle-maximum persistence pairs ($D_{d-1}(f)$) are efficiently computed by respectively
processing with a Union-Find the unstable sets of 1-saddles and the stable sets of (d-1)-saddles.
This fast processing of the dimensions 0 and (d-1) further reduces, and drastically, the number
of critical simplices to consider for the computation of $D_1(f)$, the intermediate layer of the
sandwich. Third, we document several performance improvements via shared-memory parallelism.
We provide an open-source implementation of our algorithm for reproducibility purposes. We also
contribute a reproducible benchmark package, which exploits three-dimensional data from a public
repository and compares our algorithm to a variety of publicly available implementations. Extensive
experiments indicate that our algorithm improves by two orders of magnitude the time performance
of the seminal "PairCells" algorithm it extends. Moreover, it also improves memory footprint and
time performance over a selection of 14 competing approaches, with a substantial gain over the fastest
available approaches, while producing a strictly identical output. We illustrate the utility
of our contributions with an application to the fast and robust extraction of persistent 1-dimensional
generators on surfaces, volume data and high-dimensional point clouds.

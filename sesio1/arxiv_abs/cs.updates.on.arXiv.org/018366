Ethereum is one of the most popular platforms for the development of blockchain-powered applications.
These applications are known as Dapps. When engineering Dapps, developers need to translate requests
captured in the front-end of their application into one or more smart contract transactions. Developers
need to pay for these transactions and, the more they pay (i.e., the higher the gas price), the faster
the transaction is likely to be processed. Therefore developers need to optimize the balance between
cost (transaction fees) and user experience (transaction processing times). Online services
have been developed to provide transaction issuers (e.g., Dapp developers) with an estimate of
how long transactions will take to be processed given a certain gas price. These estimation services
are crucial in the Ethereum domain and several popular wallets such as Metamask rely on them. However,
their accuracy has not been empirically investigated so far. In this paper, we quantify the transaction
processing times in Ethereum, investigate the relationship between processing times and gas prices,
and determine the accuracy of state-of-the-practice estimation services. We find that transactions
are processed in a median of 57s and that 90% of the transactions are processed within 8m. The higher
gas prices result in faster transaction processing times with diminishing returns. In particular,
we observe no practical difference in processing time between expensive and very expensive transactions.
In terms of accuracy of processing time estimation services, we note that they are equivalent. However,
when stratifying transactions by gas prices, Etherscan's Gas Tracker is the most accurate estimation
service for very cheap and cheap transaction. EthGasStation's Gas Price API, in turn, is the most
accurate estimation service for regular, expensive, and very expensive transactions.

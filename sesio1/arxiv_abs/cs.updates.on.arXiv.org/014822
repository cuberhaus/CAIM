Desert locust outbreaks threaten the food security of a large part of Africa and have affected the
livelihoods of millions of people over the years. Machine learning (ML) has been demonstrated as
an effective approach to locust distribution modelling which could assist in early warning. ML
requires a significant amount of labelled data to train. Most publicly available labelled data
on locusts are presence-only data, where only the sightings of locusts being present at a location
are recorded. Therefore, prior work using ML have resorted to pseudo-absence generation methods
as a way to circumvent this issue. The most commonly used approach is to randomly sample points in
a region of interest while ensuring that these sampled pseudo-absence points are at least a specific
distance away from true presence points. In this paper, we compare this random sampling approach
to more advanced pseudo-absence generation methods, such as environmental profiling and optimal
background extent limitation, specifically for predicting desert locust breeding grounds in
Africa. Interestingly, we find that for the algorithms we tested, namely logistic regression,
gradient boosting, random forests and maximum entropy, all popular in prior work, the logistic
model performed significantly better than the more sophisticated ensemble methods, both in terms
of prediction accuracy and F1 score. Although background extent limitation combined with random
sampling boosted performance for ensemble methods, for LR this was not the case, and instead, a significant
improvement was obtained when using environmental profiling. In light of this, we conclude that
a simpler ML approach such as logistic regression combined with more advanced pseudo-absence generation,
specifically environmental profiling, can be a sensible and effective approach to predicting
locust breeding grounds across Africa.

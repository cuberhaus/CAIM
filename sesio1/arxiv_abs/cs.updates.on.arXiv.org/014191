Requirements Engineering (RE) requires the collaboration of various roles in SE, such as requirements
engineers, stakeholders and other developers, and it is thus a highly human dependent process in
software engineering (SE). Identifying how human aspects such as personality, motivation, emotions,
communication, gender, culture and geographic distribution might impact RE would assist us in
better supporting successful RE. The main objective of this paper is to systematically review primary
studies that have investigated the effects of various human aspects on RE. A systematic literature
review (SLR) was conducted and identified 474 initial primary research studies. These were eventually
filtered down to 74 relevant, high-quality primary studies. Among the studies, the effects of communication
have been considered in many RE studies. Other human aspects such as personality, motivation and
gender have mainly been investigated to date related to SE studies including RE as one phase. Findings
show that studying more than one human aspect together is beneficial, as this reveals relationships
between various human aspects and how they together impact the RE process. However, the majority
of these studied combinations of human aspects are unique. From 56.8% of studies that identified
the effects of human aspects on RE, 40.5% identified the positive impact, 30.9% negative, 26.2%
identified both impacts whereas 2.3% mentioned that there was no impact. This implies that a variety
of human aspects positively or negatively affects the RE process and a well-defined theoretical
analysis on the effects of different human aspects on RE remains to be defined and practically evaluated.
Findings of this SLR help researchers who are investigating the impact of various human aspects
on RE by identifying well-studied research areas, and highlight new areas that should be focused
on in future research.

In the intelligent communication field, deep learning (DL) has attracted much attention due to
its strong fitting ability and data-driven learning capability. Compared with the typical DL feedforward
network structures, an enhancement structure with direct data feedback have been studied and proved
to have better performance than the feedfoward networks. However, due to the above simple feedback
methods lack sufficient analysis and learning ability on the feedback data, it is inadequate to
deal with more complicated nonlinear systems and therefore the performance is limited for further
improvement. In this paper, a novel multi-agent feedback enabled neural network (MAFENN) framework
is proposed, which make the framework have stronger feedback learning capabilities and more intelligence
on feature abstraction, denoising or generation, etc. Furthermore, the MAFENN framework is theoretically
formulated into a three-player Feedback Stackelberg game, and the game is proved to converge to
the Feedback Stackelberg equilibrium. The design of MAFENN framework and algorithm are dedicated
to enhance the learning capability of the feedfoward DL networks or their variations with the simple
data feedback. To verify the MAFENN framework's feasibility in wireless communications, a multi-agent
MAFENN based equalizer (MAFENN-E) is developed for wireless fading channels with inter-symbol
interference (ISI). Experimental results show that when the quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK)
modulation scheme is adopted, the SER performance of our proposed method outperforms that of the
traditional equalizers by about 2 dB in linear channels. When in nonlinear channels, the SER performance
of our proposed method outperforms that of either traditional or DL based equalizers more significantly,
which shows the effectiveness and robustness of our proposal in the complex channel environment.

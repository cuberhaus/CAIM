Video recording is a widely used method for documenting infant and child behaviours in research
and clinical practice. Video data has rarely been shared due to ethical concerns of confidentiality,
although the need of shared large-scaled datasets remains increasing. This demand is even more
imperative when data-driven computer-based approaches are involved, such as screening tools
to complement clinical assessments. To share data while abiding by privacy protection rules, a
critical question arises whether efforts at data de-identification reduce data utility? We addressed
this question by showcasing the Prechtl's general movements assessment (GMA), an established
and globally practised video-based diagnostic tool in early infancy for detecting neurological
deficits, such as cerebral palsy. To date, no shared expert-annotated large data repositories
for infant movement analyses exist. Such datasets would massively benefit training and recalibration
of human assessors and the development of computer-based approaches. In the current study, sequences
from a prospective longitudinal infant cohort with a total of 19451 available general movements
video snippets were randomly selected for human clinical reasoning and computer-based analysis.
We demonstrated for the first time that pseudonymisation by face-blurring video recordings is
a viable approach. The video redaction did not affect classification accuracy for either human
assessors or computer vision methods, suggesting an adequate and easy-to-apply solution for sharing
movement video data. We call for further explorations into efficient and privacy rule-conforming
approaches for deidentifying video data in scientific and clinical fields beyond movement assessments.
These approaches shall enable sharing and merging stand-alone video datasets into large data pools
to advance science and public health.

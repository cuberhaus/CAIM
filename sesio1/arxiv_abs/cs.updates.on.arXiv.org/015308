\emph{Threshold aggregation} reporting systems collect measurements sent by clients and reveal
clusters of data of size $\kappa$, while keeping smaller clusters private. In practice and research,
existing reporting systems incur significant implementation hurdles, including: i) usage of
trusted servers and hardware; ii) making unrealistic compromises in provided functionality;
iii) requiring complex and expensive coordination between clients to ensure records are not identifying;
and iv) are costly in terms of computation, network use, or both. In this work, we present \textsf{STAR}
(Distributed Secret Sharing for Threshold Aggregation Reporting): a highly efficient protocol
allowing secure threshold aggregation of collected data by untrusted entities, using techniques
taken from $\kappa$-out-of-$n$ threshold secret sharing. We propose a two-server model that categorically
improves on trust assumptions made in prior work, requiring only a single-server to perform aggregation,
and with leakage that can be eliminated at higher application layers. In terms of performance, server-side
aggregation takes only $20$ seconds for messages received from $1,000,000$ clients, with per-client
communication as small as 233 bytes, and no client-to-client interaction. Additionally, \textsf{STAR}{}
is extensible in allowing arbitrary additional data to be sent with each message, which is only revealed
if the threshold check is satisfied. Finally, a single-server variant of \textsf{STAR}, known
as \textsf{STARLite}, can be used for high-entropy client input distributions. In order to construct
\textsf{STAR}, we develop novel cryptographic contributions in defining and constructing \emph{puncturable}
partially oblivious PRF (PPOPRF) protocols, which we expect to be useful in wider applications.

Collaboration networks, where nodes represent authors and edges coauthorships among them, are
key to understanding the consumption, production, and diffusion of knowledge. Due to social mechanisms,
biases, and constraints at play, these networks are organized in tight communities with different
levels of segregation. Here, we aim to quantify the extent and impact of segregation in collaboration
networks. We study the field of Computer Science via the Semantic Scholar Open Research Corpus.
We measure the segregation of communities using the Spectral Segregation Index (SSI) and find three
categories: non-segregated, moderately segregated, and highly segregated communities. We focus
our attention on non-segregated and highly segregated communities, quantifying and comparing
their structural topology and core location. When we consider communities of both categories in
the same size range, our results show no differences in density and clustering, but evident variability
in their core position. As community size increases, communities are more likely to occupy a core
closer to the network nucleus. However, controlling for size, highly segregated communities tend
to be located closer to the network periphery than non-segregated communities. Finally, we analyse
differences in citations gained by researchers depending on their community segregation level.
Interestingly, researchers in highly segregated communities gain more citations per publication
when located in the periphery. They have a higher chance of receiving citations from members of their
same community in all cores. Researchers in non-segregated communities accrue more citations
per publication in intermediary and central cores. To our knowledge, our work is the first to characterise
segregated communities in scientific collaboration networks and to investigate their relationship
with the impact measured in terms of citations.

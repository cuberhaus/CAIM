Agriculture is the foundation of human civilization. However, the rapid increase of the global
population poses a challenge on this cornerstone by demanding more food. Modern autonomous greenhouses,
equipped with sensors and actuators, provide a promising solution to the problem by empowering
precise control for high-efficient food production. However, the optimal control of autonomous
greenhouses is challenging, requiring decision-making based on high-dimensional sensory data,
and the scaling of production is limited by the scarcity of labor capable of handling this task. With
the advances of artificial intelligence (AI), the internet of things (IoT), and cloud computing
technologies, we are hopeful to provide a solution to automate and smarten greenhouse control to
address the above challenges. In this paper, we propose a smart agriculture solution named iGrow,
for autonomous greenhouse control (AGC): (1) for the first time, we formulate the AGC problem as
a Markov decision process (MDP) optimization problem; (2) we design a neural network-based simulator
incorporated with the incremental mechanism to simulate the complete planting process of an autonomous
greenhouse, which provides a testbed for the optimization of control strategies; (3) we propose
a closed-loop bi-level optimization algorithm, which can dynamically re-optimize the greenhouse
control strategy with newly observed data during real-world production. We not only conduct simulation
experiments but also deploy iGrow in real scenarios, and experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of iGrow in autonomous greenhouse simulation and optimal control.
Particularly, compelling results from the tomato pilot project in real autonomous greenhouses
show that our solution significantly increases crop yield (+10.15\%) and net profit (+92.70\%)
with statistical significance compared to planting experts.

In cone-beam X-ray transmission imaging, due to the divergence of X-rays, imaged structures with
different depths have different magnification factors on an X-ray detector, which results in perspective
deformation. Perspective deformation causes difficulty in direct, accurate geometric assessments
of anatomical structures. In this work, to reduce perspective deformation in X-ray images acquired
from regular cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) systems, we investigate on learning perspective
deformation, i.e., converting perspective projections into orthogonal projections. Directly
converting a single perspective projection image into an orthogonal projection image is extremely
challenging due to the lack of depth information. Therefore, we propose to utilize one additional
perspective projection, a complementary (180-degree) or orthogonal (90-degree) view, to provide
a certain degree of depth information. Furthermore, learning perspective deformation in different
spatial domains is investigated. Our proposed method is evaluated on numerical spherical bead
phantoms as well as patients' chest and head X-ray data. The experiments on numerical bead phantom
data demonstrate that learning perspective deformation in polar coordinates has significant
advantages over learning in Cartesian coordinates, as root-mean-square error (RMSE) decreases
from 5.31 to 1.40, while learning in log-polar coordinates has no further considerable improvement
(RMSE = 1.85). In addition, using a complementary view (RMSE = 1.40) is better than an orthogonal
view (RMSE = 3.87). The experiments on patients' chest and head data demonstrate that learning perspective
deformation using dual complementary views is also applicable in anatomical X-ray data, allowing
accurate cardiothoracic ratio measurements in chest X-ray images and cephalometric analysis
in synthetic cephalograms from cone-beam X-ray projections.

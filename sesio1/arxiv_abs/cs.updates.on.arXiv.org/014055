While there was great progress regarding the technology and its implementation for vehicles equipped
with automated driving systems (ADS), the problem of how to proof their safety as a necessary precondition
prior to market launch remains unsolved. One promising solution are scenario-based test approaches;
however, there is no commonly accepted way of how to systematically generate and extract the set
of relevant scenarios to be tested to sufficiently capture the real-world traffic dynamics, especially
for urban operational design domains. Within the scope of this paper, the overall concept of a novel
simulation-based toolchain for the development and testing of ADS-equipped vehicles in urban
environments is presented. Based on previous work regarding highway environments, the developed
novel enhancements aim at empowering the toolchain to be able to deal with the increased complexity
due to the more complex road networks with multi-modal interactions of various traffic participants.
Based on derived requirements, a thorough explanation of different modules constituting the toolchain
is given, showing first results and identified research gaps, respectively. A closer look is taken
on two use cases: First, it is investigated whether the toolchain is capable to serve as synthetic
data source within the development phase of ADS-equipped vehicles to enrich a scenario database
in terms of extent, complexity and impacts of different what-if-scenarios for future mixed traffic.
Second, it is analyzed how to combine the individual advantages of real recorded data and an agent-based
simulation within a so-called adaptive replay-to-sim approach to support the testing phase of
an ADS-equipped vehicle. The developed toolchain contributes to the overarching goal of a commonly
accepted methodology for the validation and safety proof of ADS-equipped vehicles, especially
in urban environments.

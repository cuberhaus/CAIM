Learning-to-rank, a machine learning technique widely used in information retrieval, has recently
been applied to the problem of ligand-based virtual screening, to accelerate the early stages of
new drug development. Ranking prediction models learn based on ordinal relationships, making
them suitable for integrating assay data from various environments. Existing studies of rank prediction
in compound screening have generally used a learning-to-rank method called RankSVM. However,
they have not been compared with or validated against the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT)-based
learning-to-rank methods that have gained popularity recently. Furthermore, although the ranking
metric called Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) is widely used in information retrieval,
it only determines whether the predictions are better than those of other models. In other words,
NDCG is incapable of recognizing when a prediction model produces worse than random results. Nevertheless,
NDCG is still used in the performance evaluation of compound screening using learning-to-rank.
This study used the GBDT model with ranking loss functions, called lambdarank and lambdaloss, for
ligand-based virtual screening; results were compared with existing RankSVM methods and GBDT
models using regression. We also proposed a new ranking metric, Normalized Enrichment Discounted
Cumulative Gain (NEDCG), which aims to properly evaluate the goodness of ranking predictions.
Results showed that the GBDT model with learning-to-rank outperformed existing regression methods
using GBDT and RankSVM on diverse datasets. Moreover, NEDCG showed that predictions by regression
were comparable to random predictions in multi-assay, multi-family datasets, demonstrating
its usefulness for a more direct assessment of compound screening performance.

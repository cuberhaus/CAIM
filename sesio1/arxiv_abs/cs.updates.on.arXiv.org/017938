Treatments for breast cancer have continued to evolve and improve in recent years, resulting in
a substantial increase in survival rates, with approximately 80\% of patients having a 10-year
survival period. Given the serious impact that breast cancer treatments can have on a patient's
body image, consequently affecting her self-confidence and sexual and intimate relationships,
it is paramount to ensure that women receive the treatment that optimizes both survival and aesthetic
outcomes. Currently, there is no gold standard for evaluating the aesthetic outcome of breast cancer
treatment. In addition, there is no standard way to show patients the potential outcome of surgery.
The presentation of similar cases from the past would be extremely important to manage women's expectations
of the possible outcome. In this work, we propose a deep neural network to perform the aesthetic evaluation.
As a proof-of-concept, we focus on a binary aesthetic evaluation. Besides its use for classification,
this deep neural network can also be used to find the most similar past cases by searching for nearest
neighbours in the highly semantic space before classification. We performed the experiments on
a dataset consisting of 143 photos of women after conservative treatment for breast cancer. The
results for accuracy and balanced accuracy showed the superior performance of our proposed model
compared to the state of the art in aesthetic evaluation of breast cancer treatments. In addition,
the model showed a good ability to retrieve similar previous cases, with the retrieved cases having
the same or adjacent class (in the 4-class setting) and having similar types of asymmetry. Finally,
a qualitative interpretability assessment was also performed to analyse the robustness and trustworthiness
of the model.

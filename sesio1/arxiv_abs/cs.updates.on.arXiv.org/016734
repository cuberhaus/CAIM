Purpose: Long scan time in phase encoding for forming complete K-space matrices is a critical drawback
of MRI, making patients uncomfortable and wasting important time for diagnosing emergent diseases.
This paper aims to reducing the scan time by actively and sequentially selecting partial phases
in a short time so that a slice can be accurately reconstructed from the resultant slice-specific
incomplete K-space matrix. Methods: A transformer based deep reinforcement learning framework
is proposed for actively determining a sequence of partial phases according to reconstruction-quality
based Q-value (a function of reward), where the reward is the improvement degree of reconstructed
image quality. The Q-value is efficiently predicted from binary phase-indicator vectors, incomplete
K-space matrices and their corresponding undersampled images with a light-weight transformer
so that the sequential information of phases and global relationship in images can be used. The inverse
Fourier transform is employed for efficiently computing the undersampled images and hence gaining
the rewards of selecting phases. Results: Experimental results on the fastMRI dataset with original
K-space data accessible demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy superiorities of proposed method.
Compared with the state-of-the-art reinforcement learning based method proposed by Pineda et
al., the proposed method is roughly 150 times faster and achieves significant improvement in reconstruction
accuracy. Conclusions: We have proposed a light-weight transformer based deep reinforcement
learning framework for generating high-quality slice-specific trajectory consisting of a small
number of phases. The proposed method, called TITLE (Transformer Involved Trajectory LEarning),
has remarkable superiority in phase-encode selection efficiency and image reconstruction accuracy.

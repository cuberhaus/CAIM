A Machine-Critical Application is a system that is fundamentally necessary to the success of specific
and sensitive operations such as search and recovery, rescue, military, and emergency management
actions. Recent advances in Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, voice recognition,
and speech processing technologies have naturally allowed the development and deployment of speech-based
conversational interfaces to interact with various machine-critical applications. While these
conversational interfaces have allowed users to give voice commands to carry out strategic and
critical activities, their robustness to adversarial attacks remains uncertain and unclear.
Indeed, Adversarial Artificial Intelligence (AI) which refers to a set of techniques that attempt
to fool machine learning models with deceptive data, is a growing threat in the AI and machine learning
research community, in particular for machine-critical applications. The most common reason
of adversarial attacks is to cause a malfunction in a machine learning model. An adversarial attack
might entail presenting a model with inaccurate or fabricated samples as it's training data, or
introducing maliciously designed data to deceive an already trained model. While focusing on speech
recognition for machine-critical applications, in this paper, we first review existing speech
recognition techniques, then, we investigate the effectiveness of adversarial attacks and defenses
against these systems, before outlining research challenges, defense recommendations, and future
work. This paper is expected to serve researchers and practitioners as a reference to help them in
understanding the challenges, position themselves and, ultimately, help them to improve existing
models of speech recognition for mission-critical applications. Keywords: Mission-Critical

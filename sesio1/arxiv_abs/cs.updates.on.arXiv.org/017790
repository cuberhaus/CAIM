Planning the defossilization of energy systems by facilitating high penetration of renewables
and maintaining access to abundant and affordable primary energy resources is a nontrivial multi-objective
problem. However, so far, most long-term policies to decrease the carbon footprint of our societies
consider the cost of the system as the leading indicator in the energy system models. This paper is
the first to develop a novel approach by adding the energy return on investment (EROI) to a whole energy
system optimization model. We built the database with all EROI technologies and resources considered.
In addition, moving away from fossil-based to carbon-neutral energy systems raises the issue of
the uncertainty of low-carbon technologies and resource data. Thus, we conducted a global sensitivity
analysis to identify the main parameters driving the variations in the EROI of the system. This novel
approach can be applied to any energy system, and we use a real-world case study to illustrate the
model: the 2035 Belgian energy system for several greenhouse gas emissions targets. The main results
are threefold: (i) the EROI of the system decreases from 8.9 to 3.9 when greenhouse gas emissions
are reduced by 5; (ii) the renewable fuels - mainly imported renewable gas - represent the largest
share of the system primary energy mix; (iii) in the sensitivity analysis, the renewable fuels drive
67% of the variation of the EROI of the system for low greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. The decrease
in the EROI raises questions about meeting the climate targets without adverse socio-economic
impact. Most countries rely massively on fossil fuels, and they could encounter an EROI decline
when shifting to carbon neutrality. Thus, this study demonstrates the importance of considering
other criteria, such as EROI, in energy system models.

The creation or manipulation of facial appearance through deep generative approaches, known as
DeepFake, have achieved significant progress and promoted a wide range of benign and malicious
applications, e.g., visual effect assistance in movie and misinformation generation by faking
famous persons. The evil side of this new technique poses another popular study, i.e., DeepFake
detection aiming to identify the fake faces from the real ones. With the rapid development of the
DeepFake-related studies in the community, both sides have formed the relationship of battleground,
pushing the improvements of each other and inspiring new directions, e.g., the evasion of DeepFake
detection. Nevertheless, the overview of such battleground and the new direction is unclear and
neglected by recent surveys due to the rapid increase of related publications, limiting the in-depth
understanding of the tendency and future works. To fill this gap, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive
overview and detailed analysis of the research work on the topic of DeepFake generation, DeepFake
detection as well as evasion of DeepFake detection, with more than 318 research papers carefully
surveyed. We present the taxonomy of various DeepFake generation methods and the categorization
of various DeepFake detection methods, and more importantly, we showcase the battleground between
the two parties with detailed interactions between the adversaries (DeepFake generation) and
the defenders (DeepFake detection). The battleground allows fresh perspective into the latest
landscape of the DeepFake research and can provide valuable analysis towards the research challenges
and opportunities as well as research trends and future directions. We also elaborately design
interactive diagrams (this http URL) to allow researchers to explore their own interests on popular
DeepFake generators or detectors.

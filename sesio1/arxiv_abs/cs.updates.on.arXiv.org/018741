We present a general technique, based on parametric search with some twist, for solving a variety
of optimization problems on a set of semi-algebraic geometric objects of constant complexity.
The common feature of these problems is that they involve a `growth parameter' $r$ and a semi-algebraic
predicate $\Pi(o,o';r)$ of constant complexity on pairs of input objects, which depends on $r$
and is monotone in $r$. One then defines a graph $G(r)$ whose edges are all the pairs $(o,o')$ for which
$\Pi(o,o';r)$ is true, and seeks the smallest value of $r$ for which some monotone property holds
for $G(r)$. Problems that fit into this context include (i) the reverse shortest path problem in
unit-disk graphs, recently studied by Wang and Zhao, (ii) the same problem for weighted unit-disk
graphs, with a decision procedure recently provided by Wang and Xue, (iii) extensions of these problems
to three and higher dimensions, (iv) the discrete Fr\'echet distance with one-sided shortcuts
in higher dimensions, extending the study by Ben Avraham et al., (v) perfect matchings in intersection
graphs: given, e.g., a set of fat ellipses of roughly the same size, find the smallest value $r$ such
that if we expand each of the ellipses by $r$, the resulting intersection graph contains a perfect
matching, (vi) generalized distance selection problems: given, e.g., a set of disjoint segments,
find the $k$'th smallest distance among the pairwise distances determined by the segments, for
a given (sufficiently small but superlinear) parameter $k$, and (vii) the maximum-height independent
towers problem, in which we want to erect vertical towers of maximum height over a 1.5-dimensional
terrain so that no pair of tower tips are mutually visible. We obtain significantly improved solutions
for problems (i), (ii) and (vi), and new efficient solutions to the other problems.

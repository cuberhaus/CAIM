In today's digital world, interaction with online platforms is ubiquitous, and thus content moderation
is important for protecting users from content that do not comply with pre-established community
guidelines. Having a robust content moderation system throughout every stage of planning is particularly
important. We study the short-term planning problem of allocating human content reviewers to different
harmful content categories. We use tools from fair division and study the application of competitive
equilibrium and leximin allocation rules. Furthermore, we incorporate, to the traditional Fisher
market setup, novel aspects that are of practical importance. The first aspect is the forecasted
workload of different content categories. We show how a formulation that is inspired by the celebrated
Eisenberg-Gale program allows us to find an allocation that not only satisfies the forecasted workload,
but also fairly allocates the remaining reviewing hours among all content categories. The resulting
allocation is also robust as the additional allocation provides a guardrail in cases where the actual
workload deviates from the predicted workload. The second practical consideration is time dependent
allocation that is motivated by the fact that partners need scheduling guidance for the reviewers
across days to achieve efficiency. To address the time component, we introduce new extensions of
the various fair allocation approaches for the single-time period setting, and we show that many
properties extend in essence, albeit with some modifications. Related to the time component, we
additionally investigate how to satisfy markets' desire for smooth allocation (e.g., partners
for content reviewers prefer an allocation that does not vary much from time to time, to minimize
staffing switch). We demonstrate the performance of our proposed approaches through real-world
data obtained from Meta.

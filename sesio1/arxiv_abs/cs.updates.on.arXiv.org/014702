In this contribution we investigate in mathematical modeling and efficient simulation of biological
cells with a particular emphasis on effective modeling of structural properties that originate
from active forces generated from polymerization and depolymerization of cytoskeletal components.
In detail, we propose a nonlinear continuum approach to model microtubule-based forces which have
recently been established as central components of cell mechanics during early fruit fly wing development.
The model is discretized in space using the finite-element method. Although the individual equations
are decoupled by a semi-implicit time discretization, the discrete model is still computationally
demanding. In addition, the parameters needed for the effective model equations are not easily
available and have to be estimated or determined by repeatedly solving the model and fitting the
results to measurements. This drastically increases the computational cost. Reduced basis methods
have been used successfully to speed up such repeated solves, often by several orders of magnitude.
However, for the complex nonlinear models regarded here, the application of these model order reduction
methods is not always straight-forward and comes with its own set of challenges. In particular,
subspace construction using the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) becomes prohibitively
expensive for reasonably fine grids. We thus propose to combine the Hierarchical Approximate POD,
which is a general, easy-to-implement approach to compute an approximate POD, with an Empirical
Interpolation Method to efficiently generate a fast to evaluate reduced order model. Numerical
experiments are given to demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of the proposed modeling
and simulation approach.

In multiple academic disciplines, having a perceived gender of `woman' is associated with a lower
than expected rate of citations. In some fields, that disparity is driven primarily by the citations
of men and is increasing over time despite increasing diversification of the profession. It is likely
that complex social interactions and individual ideologies shape these disparities. Computational
models of select factors that reproduce empirical observations can help us understand some of the
minimal driving forces behind these complex phenomena and therefore aid in their mitigation. Here,
we present a simple agent-based model of citation practices within academia, in which academics
generate citations based on three factors: their estimate of the collaborative network of the field,
how they sample that estimate, and how open they are to learning about their field from other academics.
We show that increasing homophily -- or the tendency of people to interact with others more like themselves
-- in these three domains is sufficient to reproduce observed biases in citation practices. We find
that homophily in sampling an estimate of the field influences total citation rates, and openness
to learning from new and unfamiliar authors influences the change in those citations over time.
We next model a real-world intervention -- the citation diversity statement -- which has the potential
to influence both of these parameters. We determine a parameterization of our model that matches
the citation practices of academics who use the citation diversity statement. This parameterization
paired with an openness to learning from many new authors can result in citation practices that are
equitable and stable over time. Ultimately, our work underscores the importance of homophily in
shaping citation practices and provides evidence that specific actions may mitigate biased citation
practices in academia.

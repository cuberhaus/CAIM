As the importance of intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPSs) increases, great costs
are incurred to manage the signatures that are generated by malicious communication pattern files.
Experts in network security need to classify signatures by importance for an IDPS to work. We propose
and evaluate a machine learning signature classification model with a reject option (RO) to reduce
the cost of setting up an IDPS. To train the proposed model, it is essential to design features that
are effective for signature classification. Experts classify signatures with predefined if-then
rules. An if-then rule returns a label of low, medium, high, or unknown importance based on keyword
matching of the elements in the signature. Therefore, we first design two types of features, symbolic
features (SFs) and keyword features (KFs), which are used in keyword matching for the if-then rules.
Next, we design web information and message features (WMFs) to capture the properties of signatures
that do not match the if-then rules. The WMFs are extracted as term frequency-inverse document frequency
(TF-IDF) features of the message text in the signatures. The features are obtained by web scraping
from the referenced external attack identification systems described in the signature. Because
failure needs to be minimized in the classification of IDPS signatures, as in the medical field,
we consider introducing a RO in our proposed model. The effectiveness of the proposed classification
model is evaluated in experiments with two real datasets composed of signatures labeled by experts:
a dataset that can be classified with if-then rules and a dataset with elements that do not match an
if-then rule. In the experiment, the proposed model is evaluated. In both cases, the combined SFs
and WMFs performed better than the combined SFs and KFs. In addition, we also performed feature analysis.

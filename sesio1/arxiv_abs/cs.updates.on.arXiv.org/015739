The Asymmetric Numeral Systems (ANS) is a class of entropy encoders by Duda that had an immense impact
on the data compression, substituting arithmetic and Huffman coding. The optimality of ANS was
studied by Duda et al. but the precise asymptotic behaviour of its redundancy (in comparison to the
entropy) was not completely understood. In this paper we establish an optimal bound on the redundancy
for the tabled ANS (tANS), the most popular ANS variant. Given a sequence $a_1,\ldots,a_n$ of letters
from an alphabet $\{0,\ldots,\sigma-1\}$ such that each letter $a$ occurs in it $f_a$ times and
$n=2^r$, the tANS encoder using Duda's ``precise initialization'' to fill tANS tables transforms
this sequence into a bit string of length (frequencies are not included in the encoding size): $$
\sum\limits_{a\in [0..\sigma)}f_a\cdot\log\frac{n}{f_a}+O(\sigma+r), $$ where $O(\sigma
+ r)$ can be bounded by $\sigma\log e+r$. The $r$-bit term is an encoder artifact indispensable to
ANS; the rest incurs a redundancy of $O(\frac{\sigma}{n})$ bits per letter. We complement this
bound by a series of examples showing that an $\Omega(\sigma+r)$ redundancy is necessary when $\sigma
> n/3$, where $\Omega(\sigma + r)$ is at least $\frac{\sigma-1}{4}+r-2$. We argue that similar
examples exist for any methods that distribute letters in tANS tables using only the knowledge about
frequencies. Thus, we refute Duda's conjecture that the redundancy is $O(\frac{\sigma}{n^2})$
bits per letter. We also propose a new variant of range ANS (rANS), called rANS with fixed accuracy,
that is parameterized by $k \ge 1$. In this variant the integer division, which is unavoidable in
rANS, is performed only in cases when its result belongs to $[2^k..2^{k+1})$. Hence, the division
can be computed by faster methods provided $k$ is small. We bound the redundancy for the rANS with
fixed accuracy $k$ by $\frac{n}{2^k-1}\log e+r$.

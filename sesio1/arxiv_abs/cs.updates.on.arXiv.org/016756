Improving hurricane preparedness is essential to reduce hurricane impacts. Inherent in traditional
methods for quantifying and monitoring hurricane preparedness are significant lags. This study
establishes a methodological framework to quantify the extent, timing, and spatial variation
of hurricane preparedness at the CBG level using high-resolution location intelligence data.
Anonymized cell phone data on visits to POIs for each CBG before 2017 Hurricane Harvey were used to
examine hurricane preparedness. Four categories of POI, grocery stores, gas stations, pharmacies
and home improvement stores, were identified as having close relationship with hurricane preparedness,
and the daily number of visits from each CBG to these four categories of POIs were calculated during
preparation period. Two metrics, extent of preparedness and proactivity, were calculated based
on the daily visit percentage change compared to the baseline period. The results show that peak
visits to pharmacies often occurred in the early stage, whereas the peak of visits to gas stations
happened closer to landfall. The spatial and temporal patterns of visits to grocery stores and home
improvement stores were quite similar. However, correlation analysis demonstrates that extent
of preparedness and proactivity are independent of each other. Combined with synchronous evacuation
data, CBGs were divided into four clusters in terms of extent of preparedness and evacuation rate.
The clusters with low preparedness and low evacuation rate were identified as hotspots of vulnerability
for shelter-in-place households that would need urgent attention during response. The study advances
data-driven understanding of human protective actions and provide emergency response managers
with novel insights to proactively monitor disaster preparedness, facilitating identifying
under-prepared areas and better allocating resources timely.

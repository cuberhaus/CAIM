In the last decade, researchers working in the domain of computer vision and Artificial Intelligence
(AI) have beefed up their efforts to come up with the automated framework that not only detects but
also identifies stage of breast cancer. The reason for this surge in research activities in this
direction are mainly due to advent of robust AI algorithms (deep learning), availability of hardware
that can train those robust and complex AI algorithms and accessibility of large enough dataset
required for training AI algorithms. Different imaging modalities that have been exploited by
researchers to automate the task of breast cancer detection are mammograms, ultrasound, magnetic
resonance imaging, histopathological images or any combination of them. This article analyzes
these imaging modalities and presents their strengths, limitations and enlists resources from
where their datasets can be accessed for research purpose. This article then summarizes AI and computer
vision based state-of-the-art methods proposed in the last decade, to detect breast cancer using
various imaging modalities. Generally, in this article we have focused on to review frameworks
that have reported results using mammograms as it is most widely used breast imaging modality that
serves as first test that medical practitioners usually prescribe for the detection of breast cancer.
Second reason of focusing on mammogram imaging modalities is the availability of its labeled datasets.
Datasets availability is one of the most important aspect for the development of AI based frameworks
as such algorithms are data hungry and generally quality of dataset affects performance of AI based
algorithms. In a nutshell, this research article will act as a primary resource for the research
community working in the field of automated breast imaging analysis.

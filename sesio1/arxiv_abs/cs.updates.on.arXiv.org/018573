This paper describes the fourth Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild (ABAW) Competition,
held in conjunction with European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2022. The 4th ABAW Competition
is a continuation of the Competitions held at IEEE CVPR 2022, ICCV 2021, IEEE FG 2020 and IEEE CVPR
2017 Conferences, and aims at automatically analyzing affect. In the previous runs of this Competition,
the Challenges targeted Valence-Arousal Estimation, Expression Classification and Action Unit
Detection. This year the Competition encompasses two different Challenges: i) a Multi-Task-Learning
one in which the goal is to learn at the same time (i.e., in a multi-task learning setting) all the three
above mentioned tasks; and ii) a Learning from Synthetic Data one in which the goal is to learn to recognise
the basic expressions from artificially generated data and generalise to real data. The Aff-Wild2
database is a large scale in-the-wild database and the first one that contains annotations for valence
and arousal, expressions and action units. This database is the basis for the above Challenges.
In more detail: i) s-Aff-Wild2 -- a static version of Aff-Wild2 database -- has been constructed
and utilized for the purposes of the Multi-Task-Learning Challenge; and ii) some specific frames-images
from the Aff-Wild2 database have been used in an expression manipulation manner for creating the
synthetic dataset, which is the basis for the Learning from Synthetic Data Challenge. In this paper,
at first we present the two Challenges, along with the utilized corpora, then we outline the evaluation
metrics and finally present the baseline systems per Challenge, as well as their derived results.

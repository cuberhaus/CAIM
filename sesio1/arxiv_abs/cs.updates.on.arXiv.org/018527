Background and Objective: The contrast of cryo-EM images varies from one to another, primarily
due to the uneven thickness of the ice layer. This contrast variation can affect the quality of 2-D
class averaging, 3-D ab-initio modeling, and 3-D heterogeneity analysis. Contrast estimation
is currently performed during 3-D iterative refinement. As a result, the estimates are not available
at the earlier computational stages of class averaging and ab-initio modeling. This paper aims
to solve the contrast estimation problem directly from the picked particle images in the ab-initio
stage, without estimating the 3-D volume, image rotations, or class averages. Methods: The key
observation underlying our analysis is that the 2-D covariance matrix of the raw images is related
to the covariance of the underlying clean images, the noise variance, and the contrast variability
between images. We show that the contrast variability can be derived from the 2-D covariance matrix
and we apply the existing Covariance Wiener Filtering (CWF) framework to estimate it. We also demonstrate
a modification of CWF to estimate the contrast of individual images. Results: Our method improves
the contrast estimation by a large margin, compared to the previous CWF method. Its estimation accuracy
is often comparable to that of an oracle that knows the ground truth covariance of the clean images.
The more accurate contrast estimation also improves the quality of image restoration as demonstrated
in both synthetic and experimental datasets. Conclusions: This paper proposes an effective method
for contrast estimation directly from noisy images without using any 3-D volume information. It
enables contrast correction in the earlier stage of single particle analysis, and may improve the
accuracy of downstream processing.

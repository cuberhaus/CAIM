Protein-ligand interactions (PLIs) are fundamental to biochemical research and their identification
is crucial for estimating biophysical and biochemical properties for rational therapeutic design.
Currently, experimental characterization of these properties is the most accurate method, however,
this is very time-consuming and labor-intensive. A number of computational methods have been developed
in this context but most of the existing PLI prediction heavily depends on 2D protein sequence data.
Here, we present a novel parallel graph neural network (GNN) to integrate knowledge representation
and reasoning for PLI prediction to perform deep learning guided by expert knowledge and informed
by 3D structural data. We develop two distinct GNN architectures, GNNF is the base implementation
that employs distinct featurization to enhance domain-awareness, while GNNP is a novel implementation
that can predict with no prior knowledge of the intermolecular interactions. The comprehensive
evaluation demonstrated that GNN can successfully capture the binary interactions between ligand
and proteins 3D structure with 0.979 test accuracy for GNNF and 0.958 for GNNP for predicting activity
of a protein-ligand complex. These models are further adapted for regression tasks to predict experimental
binding affinities and pIC50 is crucial for drugs potency and efficacy. We achieve a Pearson correlation
coefficient of 0.66 and 0.65 on experimental affinity and 0.50 and 0.51 on pIC50 with GNNF and GNNP,
respectively, outperforming similar 2D sequence-based models. Our method can serve as an interpretable
and explainable artificial intelligence (AI) tool for predicted activity, potency, and biophysical
properties of lead candidates. To this end, we show the utility of GNNP on SARS-Cov-2 protein targets
by screening a large compound library and comparing our prediction with the experimentally measured
data.

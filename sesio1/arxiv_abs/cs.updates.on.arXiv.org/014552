There is currently a large interest in understanding the potential advantages quantum devices
can offer for probabilistic modelling. In this work we investigate, within two different oracle
models, the probably approximately correct (PAC) learnability of quantum circuit Born machines,
i.e., the output distributions of local quantum circuits. We first show a negative result, namely,
that the output distributions of super-logarithmic depth Clifford circuits are not sample-efficiently
learnable in the statistical query model, i.e., when given query access to empirical expectation
values of bounded functions over the sample space. This immediately implies the hardness, for both
quantum and classical algorithms, of learning from statistical queries the output distributions
of local quantum circuits using any gate set which includes the Clifford group. As many practical
generative modelling algorithms use statistical queries -- including those for training quantum
circuit Born machines -- our result is broadly applicable and strongly limits the possibility of
a meaningful quantum advantage for learning the output distributions of local quantum circuits.
As a positive result, we show that in a more powerful oracle model, namely when directly given access
to samples, the output distributions of local Clifford circuits are computationally efficiently
PAC learnable by a classical learner. Our results are equally applicable to the problems of learning
an algorithm for generating samples from the target distribution (generative modelling) and learning
an algorithm for evaluating its probabilities (density modelling). They provide the first rigorous
insights into the learnability of output distributions of local quantum circuits from the probabilistic
modelling perspective.

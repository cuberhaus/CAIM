Background: Arterial blood pressure (ABP) waveform evolves across each consecutive pulse during
the liver transplant surgery. We hypothesized that the quantification of the waveform evolution
reflects 1) the acuity of the recipient undergoing liver transplant and 2) the intraoperative dynamics
that forecasts short-term surgical outcomes. Methods: In this prospective observational single
cohort study on living donor liver transplant surgery, we extracted the waveform morphological
evolution from the ABP data with the unsupervised manifold learning waveform analysis. Two quantitative
indices, trend movement and fluctuation movement, were developed to represent the slow-varying
and fast-varying dynamics respectively. We investigated the associations with the liver disease
acuity represented with the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score and the primary outcomes,
the early allograft failure (EAF), as well as the recently developed EAF scores, including the Liver
Graft Assessment Following Transplantation (L-GrAFT) score, the Early Allograft Failure Simplified
Estimation (EASE) score, and the Model for Early Allograft Function (MEAF) score. Results: Sixty
recipients were enrolled. The presurgical trend movement was correlated with the MELD scores.
It decreased in the anhepatic phase. The neohepatic trend movement correlated with the L-GrAFT
scores, the EASE score, and the MEAF score. Regarding the constituent of the EAF scores, the trend
movement most correlated with the postoperative day 7 bilirubin. Conclusions: The ABP waveform
evolution intricacy in the presurgical phase reflects recipients' acuity condition while that
in the neohepatic phase reveal the short-term surgical outcome calculated from laboratory data
in postoperative day 7-10. The waveform evolution reflects the intraoperative contribution to
the early outcome.

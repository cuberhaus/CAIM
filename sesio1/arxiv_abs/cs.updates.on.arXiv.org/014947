Cryptographic protocols have been widely used to protect the user's privacy and avoid exposing
private information. QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections), including the version originally
designed by Google (GQUIC) and the version standardized by IETF (IQUIC), as alternatives to the
traditional HTTP, demonstrate their unique transmission characteristics: based on UDP for encrypted
resource transmitting, accelerating web page rendering. However, existing encrypted transmission
schemes based on TCP are vulnerable to website fingerprinting (WFP) attacks, allowing adversaries
to infer the users' visited websites by eavesdropping on the transmission channel. Whether GQUIC
and IQUIC can effectively resist such attacks is worth investigating. In this paper, we study the
vulnerabilities of GQUIC, IQUIC, and HTTPS to WFP attacks from the perspective of traffic analysis.
Extensive experiments show that, in the early traffic scenario, GQUIC is the most vulnerable to
WFP attacks among GQUIC, IQUIC, and HTTPS, while IQUIC is more vulnerable than HTTPS, but the vulnerability
of the three protocols is similar in the normal full traffic scenario. Features transferring analysis
shows that most features are transferable between protocols when on normal full traffic scenario.
However, combining with the qualitative analysis of latent feature representation, we find that
the transferring is inefficient when on early traffic, as GQUIC, IQUIC, and HTTPS show the significantly
different magnitude of variation in the traffic distribution on early traffic. By upgrading the
one-time WFP attacks to multiple WFP Top-a attacks, we find that the attack accuracy on GQUIC and
IQUIC reach 95.4% and 95.5%, respectively, with only 40 packets and just using simple features,
whereas reach only 60.7% when on HTTPS. We also demonstrate that the vulnerability of IQUIC is only
slightly dependent on the network environment.

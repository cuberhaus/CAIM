Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has been identified as a viable method for determining
the importance of features when making predictions using Machine Learning (ML) models. In this
study, we created models that take an individual's health information (e.g. their drug history
and comorbidities) as inputs, and predict the probability that the individual will have an Acute
Coronary Syndrome (ACS) adverse outcome. Using XAI, we quantified the contribution that specific
drugs had on these ACS predictions, thus creating an XAI-based technique for pharmacovigilance
monitoring, using ACS as an example of the adverse outcome to detect. Individuals aged over 65 who
were supplied Musculo-skeletal system (anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) class M) or Cardiovascular
system (ATC class C) drugs between 1993 and 2009 were identified, and their drug histories, comorbidities,
and other key features were extracted from linked Western Australian datasets. Multiple ML models
were trained to predict if these individuals would have an ACS related adverse outcome (i.e., death
or hospitalisation with a discharge diagnosis of ACS), and a variety of ML and XAI techniques were
used to calculate which features -- specifically which drugs -- led to these predictions. The drug
dispensing features for rofecoxib and celecoxib were found to have a greater than zero contribution
to ACS related adverse outcome predictions (on average), and it was found that ACS related adverse
outcomes can be predicted with 72% accuracy. Furthermore, the XAI libraries LIME and SHAP were found
to successfully identify both important and unimportant features, with SHAP slightly outperforming
LIME. ML models trained on linked administrative health datasets in tandem with XAI algorithms
can successfully quantify feature importance, and with further development, could potentially
be used as pharmacovigilance monitoring techniques.

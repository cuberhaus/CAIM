Does everyone equally benefit from computer vision systems? Answers to this question become more
and more important as computer vision systems are deployed at large scale, and can spark major concerns
when they exhibit vast performance discrepancies between people from various demographic and
social backgrounds. Systematic diagnosis of fairness, harms, and biases of computer vision systems
is an important step towards building socially responsible systems. To initiate an effort towards
standardized fairness audits, we propose three fairness indicators, which aim at quantifying
harms and biases of visual systems. Our indicators use existing publicly available datasets collected
for fairness evaluations, and focus on three main types of harms and bias identified in the literature,
namely harmful label associations, disparity in learned representations of social and demographic
traits, and biased performance on geographically diverse images from across the world.We define
precise experimental protocols applicable to a wide range of computer vision models. These indicators
are part of an ever-evolving suite of fairness probes and are not intended to be a substitute for a
thorough analysis of the broader impact of the new computer vision technologies. Yet, we believe
it is a necessary first step towards (1) facilitating the widespread adoption and mandate of the
fairness assessments in computer vision research, and (2) tracking progress towards building
socially responsible models. To study the practical effectiveness and broad applicability of
our proposed indicators to any visual system, we apply them to off-the-shelf models built using
widely adopted model training paradigms which vary in their ability to whether they can predict
labels on a given image or only produce the embeddings. We also systematically study the effect of
data domain and model size.

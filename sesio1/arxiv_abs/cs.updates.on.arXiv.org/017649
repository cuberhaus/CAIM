Data-driven algorithms are studied in diverse domains to support critical decisions, directly
impacting people's well-being. As a result, a growing community of researchers has been investigating
the equity of existing algorithms and proposing novel ones, advancing the understanding of risks
and opportunities of automated decision-making for historically disadvantaged populations.
Progress in fair Machine Learning hinges on data, which can be appropriately used only if adequately
documented. Unfortunately, the algorithmic fairness community suffers from a collective data
documentation debt caused by a lack of information on specific resources (opacity) and scatteredness
of available information (sparsity). In this work, we target data documentation debt by surveying
over two hundred datasets employed in algorithmic fairness research, and producing standardized
and searchable documentation for each of them. Moreover we rigorously identify the three most popular
fairness datasets, namely Adult, COMPAS and German Credit, for which we compile in-depth documentation.
This unifying documentation effort supports multiple contributions. Firstly, we summarize the
merits and limitations of Adult, COMPAS and German Credit, adding to and unifying recent scholarship,
calling into question their suitability as general-purpose fairness benchmarks. Secondly, we
document and summarize hundreds of available alternatives, annotating their domain and supported
fairness tasks, along with additional properties of interest for fairness researchers. Finally,
we analyze these datasets from the perspective of five important data curation topics: anonymization,
consent, inclusivity, sensitive attributes, and transparency. We discuss different approaches
and levels of attention to these topics, making them tangible, and distill them into a set of best
practices for the curation of novel resources.

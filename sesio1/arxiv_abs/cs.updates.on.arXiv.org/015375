For unweighted graphs, finding isometric embeddings is closely related to decompositions of $G$
into Cartesian products of smaller graphs. When $G$ is isomorphic to a Cartesian graph product,
we call the factors of this product a factorization of $G$. When $G$ is isomorphic to an isometric
subgraph of a Cartesian graph product, we call those factors a pseudofactorization of $G$. Prior
work has shown that an unweighted graph's pseudofactorization can be used to generate a canonical
isometric embedding into a product of the smallest possible pseudofactors. However, for arbitrary
weighted graphs, which represent a richer variety of metric spaces, methods for finding isometric
embeddings or determining their existence remain elusive, and indeed pseudofactorization and
factorization have not previously been extended to this context. In this work, we address the problem
of finding the factorization and pseudofactorization of a weighted graph $G$, where $G$ satisfies
the property that every edge constitutes a shortest path between its endpoints. We term such graphs
minimal graphs, noting that every graph can be made minimal by removing edges not affecting its path
metric. We generalize pseudofactorization and factorization to minimal graphs and develop new
proof techniques that extend the previously proposed algorithms due to Graham and Winkler [Graham
and Winkler, '85] and Feder [Feder, '92] for pseudofactorization and factorization of unweighted
graphs. We show that any $m$-edge, $n$-vertex graph with positive integer edge weights can be factored
in $O(m^2)$ time, plus the time to find all pairs shortest paths (APSP) distances in a weighted graph,
resulting in an overall running time of $O(m^2+n^2\log\log n)$ time. We also show that a pseudofactorization
for such a graph can be computed in $O(mn)$ time, plus the time to solve APSP, resulting in an $O(mn+n^2\log\log
n)$ running time.

It was found when reviewing the ransomware detection research literature that almost no proposal
provided enough detail on how the test data set was created, or sufficient description of its actual
content, to allow it to be recreated by other researchers interested in reconstructing their environment
and validating the research results. A modern cybersecurity mixed file data set called NapierOne
is presented, primarily aimed at, but not limited to, ransomware detection and forensic analysis
research. NapierOne was designed to address this deficiency in reproducibility and improve consistency
by facilitating research replication and repeatability. The methodology used in the creation
of this data set is also described in detail. The data set was inspired by the Govdocs1 data set and
it is intended that NapierOne be used as a complement to this original data set. An investigation
was performed with the goal of determining the common files types currently in use. No specific research
was found that explicitly provided this information, so an alternative consensus approach was
employed. This involved combining the findings from multiple sources of file type usage into an
overall ranked list. After which 5000 real-world example files were gathered, and a specific data
subset created, for each of the common file types identified. In some circumstances, multiple data
subsets were created for a specific file type, each subset representing a specific characteristic
for that file type. For example, there are multiple data subsets for the ZIP file type with each subset
containing examples of a specific compression method. Ransomware execution tends to produce files
that have high entropy, so examples of file types that naturally have this attribute are also present.

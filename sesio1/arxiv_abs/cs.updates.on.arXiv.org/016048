Microblogging sites, like Twitter, have emerged as ubiquitous sources of information. Two important
tasks related to the automatic extraction and analysis of information in Microblogs are Entity
Mention Detection (EMD) and Entity Detection (ED). The state-of-the-art EMD systems aim to model
the non-literary nature of microblog text by training upon offline static datasets. They extract
a combination of surface-level features -- orthographic, lexical, and semantic -- from individual
messages for noisy text modeling and entity extraction. But given the constantly evolving nature
of microblog streams, detecting all entity mentions from such varying yet limited context of short
messages remains a difficult problem. To this end, we propose a framework named EMD Globalizer,
better suited for the execution of EMD learners on microblog streams. It deviates from the processing
of isolated microblog messages by existing EMD systems, where learned knowledge from the immediate
context of a message is used to suggest entities. After an initial extraction of entity candidates
by an EMD system, the proposed framework leverages occurrence mining to find additional candidate
mentions that are missed during this first detection. Aggregating the local contextual representations
of these mentions, a global embedding is drawn from the collective context of an entity candidate
within a stream. The global embeddings are then utilized to separate entities within the candidates
from false positives. All mentions of said entities from the stream are produced in the framework's
final outputs. Our experiments show that EMD Globalizer can enhance the effectiveness of all existing
EMD systems that we tested (on average by 25.61%) with a small additional computational overhead.

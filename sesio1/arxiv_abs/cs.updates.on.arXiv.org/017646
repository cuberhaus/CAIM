The quasi-dynamic energy flow calculation of the heat and electricity integrated energy systems
(HE-IESs) faces the challenges of inefficiency and divergence. This is because traditional iteration
solvers cannot guarantee to find exact solutions of these nonlinear equations in prescribed number
of steps. This paper presents a novel non-iterative solver for the nonlinear partial differential
algebraic equations of the quasi-dynamic energy flow models. The kernel of the proposed method
consists of: 1) first, discretizing the spatial derivative of partial differential equations
(PDEs), which converts the PDEs into ordinary differential equations, and 2) second, deriving
explicit closed-form time-polynomial solutions, which are called semi-analytical solutions
(SASs), of each unknown variable in the resulting nonlinear ordinary differential algebraic equations.
For the first step, we use a scheme with total variation decreasing (TVD) property to eliminate the
dissipative and dispersive errors that are often overlooked in previous researches. For the second
step, we establish an efficient SAS-derivation framework based on differential transformation
(DT). The framework derives SASs to any given order in a non-iterative way and, after deriving these
SASs, we can draw smooth trajectories of variables by substituting time-series into these time-polynomials,
which greatly accelerates the energy flow calculation. To ensure convergence, we also propose
to control the temporal step sizes adaptively by estimating the simulation errors. Case studies
on an HE-IES with 225 heating nodes and 118 electrical buses show that: 1) the proposed method achieves
speed-up 1036.6% and 624.2%, and error reduction 30% and 41% in the two simulation scenarios respectively
compared with the finite-difference-based iteration solver, and 2) the proposed method displays
strong robustness under loading level variations.

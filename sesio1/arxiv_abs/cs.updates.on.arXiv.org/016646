Epistemic modals have peculiar logical features that are challenging to account for in a broadly
classical framework. For instance, while a sentence of the form $p\wedge\Diamond\neg p$ ('$p$,
but it might be that not $p$') appears to be a contradiction, $\Diamond\neg p$ does not entail $\neg
p$, which would follow in classical logic. Likewise, the classical laws of distributivity and disjunctive
syllogism fail for epistemic modals. Existing attempts to account for these facts generally either
under- or over-correct. Some predict that $p\wedge\Diamond\neg p$, a so-called epistemic contradiction,
is a contradiction only in an etiolated sense, under a notion of entailment that does not always allow
us to replace $p\wedge\Diamond\neg p$ with a contradiction; these theories underpredict the infelicity
of embedded epistemic contradictions. Other theories savage classical logic, eliminating not
just rules that intuitively fail but also rules like non-contradiction, excluded middle, De Morgan's
laws, and disjunction introduction, which intuitively remain valid for epistemic modals. In this
paper, we aim for a middle ground, developing a semantics and logic for epistemic modals that makes
epistemic contradictions genuine contradictions and that invalidates distributivity and disjunctive
syllogism but that otherwise preserves classical laws that intuitively remain valid. We start
with an algebraic semantics, based on ortholattices instead of Boolean algebras, and then propose
a more concrete possibility semantics, based on partial possibilities related by compatibility.
Both semantics yield the same consequence relation, which we axiomatize. Then we show how to extend
our semantics to explain parallel phenomena involving probabilities and conditionals. The goal
throughout is to retain what is desirable about classical logic while accounting for the non-classicality
of epistemic vocabulary.

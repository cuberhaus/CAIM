Background: The increasing adoption of electronic health records (EHR) across the US has created
troves of computable data, to which machine learning methods have been applied to extract useful
insights. EHR data, represented as a three-dimensional analogue of a matrix (tensor), is decomposed
into two-dimensional factors that can be interpreted as computational phenotypes. Methods: We
apply constrained tensor factorization to derive computational phenotypes and predict mortality
in cohorts of patients with breast, prostate, colorectal, or lung cancer in the Northwestern Medicine
Enterprise Data Warehouse from 2000 to 2015. In our experiments, we examined using a supervised
term in the factorization algorithm, filtering tensor co-occurrences by medical indication,
and incorporating additional social determinants of health (SDOH) covariates in the factorization
process. We evaluated the resulting computational phenotypes qualitatively and by assessing
their ability to predict five-year mortality using the area under the curve (AUC) statistic. Results:
Filtering by medical indication led to more concise and interpretable phenotypes. Mortality prediction
performance (AUC) varied under the different experimental conditions and by cancer type (breast:
0.623 - 0.694, prostate: 0.603 - 0.750, colorectal: 0.523 - 0.641, and lung: 0.517 - 0.623). Generally,
prediction performance improved with the use of a supervised term and the incorporation of SDOH
covariates. Conclusion: Constrained tensor factorization, applied to sparse EHR data of patients
with cancer, can discover computational phenotypes predictive of five-year mortality. The incorporation
of SDOH variables into the factorization algorithm is an easy-to-implement and effective way to
improve prediction performance.

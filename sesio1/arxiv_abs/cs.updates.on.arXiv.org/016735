A critical step in virtual dental treatment planning is to accurately delineate all tooth-bone
structures from CBCT with high fidelity and accurate anatomical information. Previous studies
have established several methods for CBCT segmentation using deep learning. However, the inherent
resolution discrepancy of CBCT and the loss of occlusal and dentition information largely limited
its clinical applicability. Here, we present a Deep Dental Multimodal Analysis (DDMA) framework
consisting of a CBCT segmentation model, an intraoral scan (IOS) segmentation model (the most accurate
digital dental model), and a fusion model to generate 3D fused crown-root-bone structures with
high fidelity and accurate occlusal and dentition information. Our model was trained with a large-scale
dataset with 503 CBCT and 28,559 IOS meshes manually annotated by experienced human experts. For
CBCT segmentation, we use a five-fold cross validation test, each with 50 CBCT, and our model achieves
an average Dice coefficient and IoU of 93.99% and 88.68%, respectively, significantly outperforming
the baselines. For IOS segmentations, our model achieves an mIoU of 93.07% and 95.70% on the maxillary
and mandible on a test set of 200 IOS meshes, which are 1.77% and 3.52% higher than the state-of-art
method. Our DDMA framework takes about 20 to 25 minutes to generate the fused 3D mesh model following
the sequential processing order, compared to over 5 hours by human experts. Notably, our framework
has been incorporated into a software by a clear aligner manufacturer, and real-world clinical
cases demonstrate that our model can visualize crown-root-bone structures during the entire orthodontic
treatment and can predict risks like dehiscence and fenestration. These findings demonstrate
the potential of multi-modal deep learning to improve the quality of digital dental models and help
dentists make better clinical decisions.

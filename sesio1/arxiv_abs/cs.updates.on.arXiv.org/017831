Deep learning (DL) models for medical image segmentation are highly influenced by intensity variations
of input images and lack generalization due to primarily utilizing pixels' intensity information
for inference. Acquiring sufficient training data is another challenge limiting models' applications.
We proposed to leverage the consistency of organs' anatomical shape and position information in
medical images. We introduced a framework leveraging recurring anatomical patterns through global
binary masks for organ segmentation. Two scenarios were studied.1) Global binary masks were the
only model's (i.e. U-Net) input, forcing exclusively encoding organs' position and shape information
for segmentation/localization.2) Global binary masks were incorporated as an additional channel
functioning as position/shape clues to mitigate training data scarcity. Two datasets of the brain
and heart CT images with their ground-truth were split into (26:10:10) and (12:3:5) for training,
validation, and test respectively. Training exclusively on global binary masks led to Dice scores
of 0.77(0.06) and 0.85(0.04), with the average Euclidian distance of 3.12(1.43)mm and 2.5(0.93)mm
relative to the center of mass of the ground truth for the brain and heart structures respectively.
The outcomes indicate that a surprising degree of position and shape information is encoded through
global binary masks. Incorporating global binary masks led to significantly higher accuracy relative
to the model trained on only CT images in small subsets of training data; the performance improved
by 4.3-125.3% and 1.3-48.1% for 1-8 training cases of the brain and heart datasets respectively.
The findings imply the advantages of utilizing global binary masks for building generalizable
models and to compensate for training data scarcity.

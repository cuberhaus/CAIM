Multi-behavior recommendation exploits multiple types of user-item interactions to alleviate
the data sparsity problem faced by the traditional models that often utilize only one type of interaction
for recommendation. In real scenarios, users often take a sequence of actions to interact with an
item, in order to get more information about the item and thus accurately evaluate whether an item
fits personal preference. Those interaction behaviors often obey a certain order, and different
behaviors reveal different information or aspects of user preferences towards the target item.
Most existing multi-behavior recommendation methods take the strategy to first extract information
from different behaviors separately and then fuse them for final prediction. However, they have
not exploited the connections between different behaviors to learn user preferences. Besides,
they often introduce complex model structures and more parameters to model multiple behaviors,
largely increasing the space and time complexity. In this work, we propose a lightweight multi-behavior
recommendation model named Cascading Residual Graph Convolutional Network (CRGCN for short),
which can explicitly exploit the connections between different behaviors into the embedding learning
process without introducing any additional parameters. In particular, we design a cascading residual
graph convolutional network structure, which enables our model to learn user preferences by continuously
refining user embeddings across different types of behaviors. The multi-task learning method
is adopted to jointly optimize our model based on different behaviors. Extensive experimental
results on two real-world benchmark datasets show that CRGCN can substantially outperform state-of-the-art
methods. Further studies also analyze the effects of leveraging multi-behaviors in different
numbers and orders on the final performance.

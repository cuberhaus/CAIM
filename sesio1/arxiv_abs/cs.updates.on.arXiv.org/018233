Offline reinforcement learning leverages previously-collected offline datasets to learn optimal
policies with no necessity to access the real environment. Such a paradigm is also desirable for
multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) tasks, given the increased interactions among agents
and with the enviroment. Yet, in MARL, the paradigm of offline pre-training with online fine-tuning
has not been studied, nor datasets or benchmarks for offline MARL research are available. In this
paper, we facilitate the research by providing large-scale datasets, and use them to examine the
usage of the Decision Transformer in the context of MARL. We investigate the generalisation of MARL
offline pre-training in the following three aspects: 1) between single agents and multiple agents,
2) from offline pretraining to the online fine-tuning, and 3) to that of multiple downstream tasks
with few-shot and zero-shot capabilities. We start by introducing the first offline MARL dataset
with diverse quality levels based on the StarCraftII environment, and then propose the novel architecture
of multi-agent decision transformer (MADT) for effective offline learning. MADT leverages transformer's
modelling ability of sequence modelling and integrates it seamlessly with both offline and online
MARL tasks. A crucial benefit of MADT is that it learns generalisable policies that can transfer
between different types of agents under different task scenarios. On StarCraft II offline dataset,
MADT outperforms the state-of-the-art offline RL baselines. When applied to online tasks, the
pre-trained MADT significantly improves sample efficiency, and enjoys strong performance both
few-short and zero-shot cases. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that studies and demonstrates
the effectiveness of offline pre-trained models in terms of sample efficiency and generalisability
enhancements in MARL.

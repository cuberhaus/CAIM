Adding renewable energy sources and storage units to an electric grid has led to a change in the way
energy is generated and billed. This shift cannot be managed without a unified view of energy systems
and their components. This unified view is captured within the idea of a Smart Local Energy System
(SLES). Currently, various isolated control and market elements are proposed to resolve network
constraints, demand side response and utility optimisation. They rely on topology estimations,
forecasting and fault detection methods to complete their tasks. This disjointed design has led
to most systems being capable of fulfilling only a single role or being resistant to change and extensions
in functionality. By allocating roles, functional responsibilities and technical requirements
to bounded systems a more unified view of energy systems can be achieved. This is made possible by
representing an energy system as a distributed peer-to-peer (P2P) environment where each individual
demand energy resource (DER) on the consumer's side of the meter is responsible for their portion
of the network and can facilitate trade with numerous entities including the grid. Advances in control
engineering, markets and services such as forecasting, topology identification and cyber-security
can enable such trading and communication to be done securely and robustly. To enable this advantage
however, we need to redefine how we view the design of the sub-systems and interconnections within
smart local energy systems (SLES). In this paper we describe a way in which whole system design could
be achieved by integrating control, markets and analytics into each system. We propose the use of
physical, control, market and service layers to create system of systems representation.

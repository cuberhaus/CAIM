Personal data is an attractive source of insights for a diverse field of research and business. While
our data is highly valuable, it is often privacy-sensitive. Thus, regulations like the GDPR restrict
what data can be legally published, and what a buyer may do with this sensitive data. While personal
data must be protected, we can still sell some insights gathered from our data that do not hurt our
privacy. A data marketplace is a platform that helps users to sell their data while assisting buyers
in discovering relevant datasets. The major challenge such a marketplace faces is balancing between
offering valuable insights into data while preserving privacy requirements. Private data marketplaces
try to solve this challenge by offering privacy-preserving computations on personal data. Such
computations allow for calculating statistics or training machine learning models on personal
data without accessing the data in plain. However, the user selling the data cannot restrict who
can buy or what type of computation the data is allowed. We close the latter gap by proposing a flexible
access control architecture for private data marketplaces, which can be applied to existing data
markets. Our architecture enables data sellers to define detailed policies restricting who can
buy their data. Furthermore, a seller can control what computation a specific buyer can purchase
on the data, and make constraints on its parameters to mitigate privacy breaches. The data market's
computation system then enforces the policies before initiating a computation. To demonstrate
the feasibility of our approach, we provide an implementation for the KRAKEN marketplace, a distributed
data market using MPC. We show that our approach is practical since it introduces a negligible performance
overhead and is secure against several adversaries.

Stability and safety are two important aspects in safety-critical control of dynamical systems.
It has been a well established fact in control theory that stability properties can be characterized
by Lyapunov functions. Reachability properties can also be naturally captured by Lyapunov functions
for finite-time stability. Motivated by safety-critical control applications, such as in autonomous
systems and robotics, there has been a recent surge of interests in characterizing safety properties
using barrier functions. Lyapunov and barrier functions conditions, however, are sometimes viewed
as competing objectives. In this paper, we provide a unified theoretical treatment of Lyapunov
and barrier functions in terms of converse theorems for stability properties with safety guarantees
and reach-avoid-stay type specifications. We show that if a system (modeled as a dynamical system
with measurable perturbations) possesses a stability with safety property, then there exists
a smooth Lyapunov function to certify such a property. This Lyapunov function is shown to be defined
on the entire set of initial conditions from which solutions satisfy this property. A similar but
slightly weaker statement is made for reach-avoid-stay specifications. We show by a simple example
that the latter statement cannot be strengthened without additional assumptions. We further extend
the results for systems with control inputs and prove existence of converse Lyapunov-barrier functions
for reach-and-avoid specifications. While the converse Lyapunov-barrier theorems are not constructive,
as with classical converse Lyapunov theorems, we believe that the unified necessary and sufficient
conditions with a single Lyapunov-barrier function are of theoretical interest and can hopefully
shed some light on computational approaches.

With the growth of 5G, Internet of Things (IoT), edge computing and cloud computing technologies,
the infrastructure (compute and network) available to emerging applications (AR/VR, autonomous
driving, industry 4.0, etc.) has become quite complex. There are multiple tiers of computing (IoT
devices, near edge, far edge, cloud, etc.) that are connected with different types of networking
technologies (LAN, LTE, 5G, MAN, WAN, etc.). Deployment and management of applications in such
an environment is quite challenging. In this paper, we propose ROMA, which performs resource orchestration
for microservices-based 5G applications in a dynamic, heterogeneous, multi-tiered compute and
network fabric. We assume that only application-level requirements are known, and the detailed
requirements of the individual microservices in the application are not specified. As part of our
solution, ROMA identifies and leverages the coupling relationship between compute and network
usage for various microservices and solves an optimization problem in order to appropriately identify
how each microservice should be deployed in the complex, multi-tiered compute and network fabric,
so that the end-to-end application requirements are optimally met. We implemented two real-world
5G applications in video surveillance and intelligent transportation system (ITS) domains. Through
extensive experiments, we show that ROMA is able to save up to 90%, 55% and 44% compute and up to 80%,
95% and 75% network bandwidth for the surveillance (watchlist) and transportation application
(person and car detection), respectively. This improvement is achieved while honoring the application
performance requirements, and it is over an alternative scheme that employs a static and overprovisioned
resource allocation strategy by ignoring the resource coupling relationships.

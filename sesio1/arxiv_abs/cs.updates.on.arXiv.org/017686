Context: Novel plant communities reshape landscapes and pose challenges for land cover classification
and mapping that can constrain research and stewardship efforts. In the US Northeast, emergence
of low-statured woody vegetation, or 'shrublands', instead of secondary forests in post-agricultural
landscapes is well-documented by field studies, but poorly understood from a landscape perspective,
which limits the ability to systematically study and manage these lands. Objectives: To address
gaps in classification/mapping of low-statured cover types where they have been historically
rare, we developed models to predict 'shrubland' distributions at 30m resolution across New York
State (NYS), using machine learning and model ensembling techniques to integrate remote sensing
of structural (airborne LIDAR) and optical (satellite imagery) properties of vegetation cover.
We first classified a 1m canopy height model (CHM), derived from a "patchwork" of available LIDAR
coverages, to define shrubland presence/absence. Next, these non-contiguous maps were used to
train a model ensemble based on temporally-segmented imagery to predict 'shrubland' probability
for the entire study landscape (NYS). Results: Approximately 2.5% of the CHM coverage area was classified
as shrubland. Models using Landsat predictors trained on the classified CHM were effective at identifying
shrubland (test set AUC=0.893, real-world AUC=0.904), in discriminating between shrub/young
forest and other cover classes, and produced qualitatively sensible maps, even when extending
beyond the original training data. Conclusions: After ground-truthing, we expect these shrubland
maps and models will have many research and stewardship applications including wildlife conservation,
invasive species mitigation and natural climate solutions.

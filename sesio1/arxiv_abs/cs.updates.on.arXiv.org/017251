Introduction: Large-scale electronic health record(EHR) datasets often include simple informative
features like patient age and complex data like care history that are not easily represented as individual
features. Such complex data have the potential to both improve the quality of risk assessment and
to enable a better understanding of causal factors leading to those risks. We propose a hybrid feature-
and similarity-based model for supervised learning that combines feature and kernel learning
approaches to take advantage of rich but heterogeneous observational data sources to create interpretable
models for prediction and for investigation of causal relationships. Methods: The proposed hybrid
model is fit by convex optimization with a sparsity-inducing penalty on the kernel portion. Feature
and kernel coefficients can be fit sequentially or simultaneously. We compared our models to solely
feature- and similarity-based approaches using synthetic data and using EHR data from a primary
health care organization to predict risk of loneliness or social isolation. We also present a new
strategy for kernel construction that is suited to high-dimensional indicator-coded EHR data.
Results: The hybrid models had comparable or better predictive performance than the feature- and
kernel-based approaches in both the synthetic and clinical case studies. The inherent interpretability
of the hybrid model is used to explore client characteristics stratified by kernel coefficient
direction in the clinical case study; we use simple examples to discuss opportunities and cautions
of the two hybrid model forms when causal interpretations are desired. Conclusion: Hybrid feature-
and similarity-based models provide an opportunity to capture complex, high-dimensional data
within an additive model structure that supports improved prediction and interpretation relative
to simple models and opaque complex models.

In resource allocation, it is common to assume that agents have a utility for their allocated items
and zero utility for unallocated ones. We refer to such valuation domain as 1-D. This assumption
of zero utility for unallocated items is not always valid. For example, in the pandemic, allocation
of ventilators, oxygen beds, and critical medical help yields dis-utility to an agent when not received
in time, i.e., a setting where people consume resources at the cost of others' utility. Various externalities
affect an agent's utility, i.e., when an agent doesn't receive an item, it can result in their gain
(positive externalities) or loss (negative externalities). The existing preference models lack
capturing the setting with these externalities. We conduct a study on a 2-D domain, where each agent
has a utility ($v$) for an item assigned to it and utility ($v'$) for an item not allocated to it. We
consider a generalized model, i.e., goods and chores. There is a vast literature to allocate fairly
and efficiently. We observe that adapting the existing notions of fairness and efficiency to the
2-D domain is non-trivial. We propose a utility transformation ($T_u$) and valuation transformation
($T_v$) to convert from the 2-D domain to 1-D. We study the retention of fairness and efficiency property
given this transformation, i.e., an allocation with property $\mathcal{P}$ in a 1-D domain also
satisfies property $\mathcal{P}$ in 2-D, and vice versa. If a property is retainable, we can apply
the transformation, and all the existing approaches are valid for the 2-D domain. Further, we study
whether we can apply current results in a 2-D domain when they do not retain. We explore fairness notions
such as Envy-freeness (EF), Equitability (EQ), Maxmin Share (MMS), and Proportionality and efficiency
notions such as Pareto Optimality, Utilitarian Welfare, Nash Welfare, and Egalitarian Welfare.

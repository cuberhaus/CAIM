In the early stages of human life, babies develop their skills by exploring different scenarios
motivated by their inherent satisfaction rather than by extrinsic rewards from the environment.
This behavior, referred to as intrinsic motivation, has emerged as one solution to address the exploration
challenge derived from reinforcement learning environments with sparse rewards. Diverse exploration
approaches have been proposed to accelerate the learning process over single- and multi-agent
problems with homogeneous agents. However, scarce studies have elaborated on collaborative learning
frameworks between heterogeneous agents deployed into the same environment, but interacting
with different instances of the latter without any prior knowledge. Beyond the heterogeneity,
each agent's characteristics grant access only to a subset of the full state space, which may hide
different exploration strategies and optimal solutions. In this work we combine ideas from intrinsic
motivation and transfer learning. Specifically, we focus on sharing parameters in actor-critic
model architectures and on combining information obtained through intrinsic motivation with
the aim of having a more efficient exploration and faster learning. We test our strategies through
experiments performed over a modified ViZDooM's My Way Home scenario, which is more challenging
than its original version and allows evaluating the heterogeneity between agents. Our results
reveal different ways in which a collaborative framework with little additional computational
cost can outperform an independent learning process without knowledge sharing. Additionally,
we depict the need for modulating correctly the importance between the extrinsic and intrinsic
rewards to avoid undesired agent behaviors.

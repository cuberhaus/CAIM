With the rapid development of big data and cloud computing, data management has become increasingly
challenging. Over the years, a number of frameworks for data management and storage with various
characteristics and features have become available. Most of these are highly efficient, but ultimately
create data silos. It becomes difficult to move and work coherently with data as new requirements
emerge as no single framework can efficiently fulfill the data management needs of diverse applications.
A possible solution is to design smart and efficient hierarchical (multi-tier) storage solutions.
A hierarchical storage system (HSS) is a meta solution that consists of different storage frameworks
organized as a jointly constructed large storage pool. It brings a number of benefits including
better utilization of the storage, cost-efficiency, and use of different features provided by
the underlying storage frameworks. In order to maximize the gains of hierarchical storage solutions,
it is important that they include intelligent and autonomous mechanisms for data management grounded
in the features of the different underlying frameworks. These decisions should be made according
to the characteristics of the dataset, tier status, and access patterns. These are highly dynamic
parameters and defining a policy based on the mentioned parameters is a non-trivial task. This paper
presents an open-source hierarchical storage framework with a dynamic migration policy based
on reinforcement learning (RL). We present a mathematical model, a software architecture, and
an implementation based on both simulations and a live cloud-based environment. We compare the
proposed RL-based strategy to a baseline of three rule-based policies, showing that the RL-based
policy achieves significantly higher efficiency and optimal data distribution in different scenarios
compared to the dynamic rule-based policies.

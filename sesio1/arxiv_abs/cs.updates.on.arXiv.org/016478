The reason of significantly higher transmissibility of SARS Covid (2019 CoV-2) compared to SARS
Covid (2003 CoV) and MERS Covid (2012 MERS) can be attributed to mutations reported in structural
proteins, and the role played by non-structural proteins (nsps) and accessory proteins (ORFs)
for viral replication, assembly, and shedding. Envelope protein E is one of the four structural
proteins of minimum length. Recent studies have confirmed critical role played by the envelope
protein in the viral life cycle including assembly of virion exported from infected cell for its
transmission. However, the determinants of the highly complex viral - host interactions of envelope
protein, particularly with host Golgi complex, have not been adequately characterized. CoV-2
and CoV Envelope proteins of length 75 and 76 amino acids differ in four amino acid locations. The
additional amino acid Gly (G) at location 70 makes CoV length 76. The amino acid pair EG at location
69-70 of CoV in place of amino acid R in location 69 of CoV-2, has been identified as a major determining
factor in the current investigation. This paper concentrates on the design of computational model
to compare the structure/function of wild and mutants of CoV-2 with wild and mutants of CoV in the
functionally important region of the protein chain pair. We hypothesize that differences of CAML
model parameter of CoV-2 and CoV characterize the deviation in structure and function of envelope
proteins in respect of interaction of virus with host Golgi complex; and this difference gets reflected
in the difference of their transmissibility. The hypothesis has been validated from single point
mutational study on- (i) human HBB beta-globin hemoglobin protein associated with sickle cell
anemia, (ii) mutants of envelope protein of Covid-2 infected patients reported in recent publications.

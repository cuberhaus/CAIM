Non-contact technology for monitoring multiple people's vital signs, such as respiration and
heartbeat, has been investigated in recent years due to the rising cardiopulmonary morbidity,
the risk of transmitting diseases, and the heavy burden on the medical staff. Frequency modulated
continuous wave (FMCW) radars have shown great promise in meeting these needs. However, contemporary
techniques for non-contact vital signs monitoring (NCVSM) via FMCW radars, are based on simplistic
models, and present difficulties coping with noisy environments containing multiple objects.
In this work, we develop an extended model of FMCW radar signals in a noisy setting containing multiple
people and clutter. By utilizing the sparse nature of the modeled signals in conjunction with human-typical
cardiopulmonary features, we can accurately localize humans and reliably monitor their vital
signs, using only a single channel and a single-input-single-output setup. To this end, we first
show that spatial sparsity allows for both accurate detection of multiple people and computationally
efficient extraction of their Doppler samples, using a joint sparse recovery approach. Given the
extracted samples, we develop a method named Vital Signs based Dictionary Recovery (VSDR), which
uses a dictionary-based approach to search for the desired rates of respiration and heartbeat over
high-resolution grids corresponding to normal cardiopulmonary activity. The advantages of the
proposed method are illustrated through examples that combine the proposed model with real data
of $30$ monitored individuals. We demonstrate accurate human localization in a clutter-rich scenario
that includes both static and vibrating objects, and show that our VSDR approach outperforms existing
techniques, based on several statistical metrics. The findings support the widespread use of FMCW
radars with the proposed algorithms in healthcare.

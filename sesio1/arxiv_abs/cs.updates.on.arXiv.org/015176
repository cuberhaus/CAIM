Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved unprecedented success in learning graph representations
to identify categorical labels of graphs. However, most existing graph classification problems
with GNNs follow a balanced data splitting protocol, which is misaligned with many real-world scenarios
in which some classes have much fewer labels than others. Directly training GNNs under this imbalanced
situation may lead to uninformative representations of graphs in minority classes, and compromise
the overall performance of downstream classification, which signifies the importance of developing
effective GNNs for handling imbalanced graph classification. Existing methods are either tailored
for non-graph structured data or designed specifically for imbalance node classification while
few focus on imbalance graph classification. To this end, we introduce a novel framework, Graph-of-Graph
Neural Networks (G$^2$GNN), which alleviates the graph imbalance issue by deriving extra supervision
globally from neighboring graphs and locally from graphs themselves. Globally, we construct a
graph of graphs (GoG) based on kernel similarity and perform GoG propagation to aggregate neighboring
graph representations, which are initially obtained by node-level propagation with pooling via
a GNN encoder. Locally, we employ topological augmentation via masking nodes or dropping edges
to improve the model generalizability in discerning topology of unseen testing graphs. Extensive
graph classification experiments conducted on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate our proposed
G$^2$GNN outperforms numerous baselines by roughly 5\% in both F1-macro and F1-micro scores. The
implementation of G$^2$GNN is available at \href{https://github.com/YuWVandy/G2GNN}{https://github.com/YuWVandy/G2GNN}.

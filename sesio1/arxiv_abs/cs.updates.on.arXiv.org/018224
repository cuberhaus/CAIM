The human cultural repertoire relies on innovation: our ability to continuously and hierarchically
explore how existing elements can be combined to create new ones. Innovation is not solitary, it
relies on collective accumulation and merging of previous solutions. Machine learning approaches
commonly assume that fully connected multi-agent networks are best suited for innovation. However,
human laboratory and field studies have shown that hierarchical innovation is more robustly achieved
by dynamic communication topologies. In dynamic topologies, humans oscillate between innovating
individually or in small clusters, and then sharing outcomes with others. To our knowledge, the
role of multi-agent topology on innovation has not been systematically studied in machine learning.
It remains unclear a) which communication topologies are optimal for which innovation tasks, and
b) which properties of experience sharing improve multi-level innovation. Here we use a multi-level
hierarchical problem setting (WordCraft), with three different innovation tasks. We systematically
design networks of DQNs sharing experiences from their replay buffers in varying topologies (fully
connected, small world, dynamic, ring). Comparing the level of innovation achieved by different
experience-sharing topologies across different tasks shows that, first, consistent with human
findings, experience sharing within a dynamic topology achieves the highest level of innovation
across tasks. Second, experience sharing is not as helpful when there is a single clear path to innovation.
Third, two metrics we propose, conformity and diversity of shared experience, can explain the success
of different topologies on different tasks. These contributions can advance our understanding
of optimal AI-AI, human-human, and human-AI collaborative networks, inspiring future tools for
fostering collective innovation in large organizations.

We study a pricing setting where each customer is offered a contextualized price based on customer
and/or product features that are predictive of the customer's valuation for that product. Often
only historical sales records are available, where we observe whether each customer purchased
a product at the price prescribed rather than the customer's true valuation. As such, the data is
influenced by the historical sales policy which introduces difficulties in a) estimating future
loss/regret for pricing policies without the possibility of conducting real experiments and b)
optimizing new policies for downstream tasks such as revenue management. We study how to formulate
loss functions which can be used for optimizing pricing policies directly, rather than going through
an intermediate demand estimation stage, which can be biased in practice due to model misspecification,
regularization or poor calibration. While existing approaches have been proposed when valuation
data is available, we propose loss functions for the observational data setting. To achieve this,
we adapt ideas from machine learning with corrupted labels, where we can consider each observed
customer's outcome (purchased or not for a prescribed price), as a (known) probabilistic transformation
of the customer's valuation. From this transformation we derive a class of suitable unbiased loss
functions. Within this class we identify minimum variance estimators, those which are robust to
poor demand function estimation, and provide guidance on when the estimated demand function is
useful. Furthermore, we also show that when applied to our contextual pricing setting, estimators
popular in the off-policy evaluation literature fall within this class of loss functions, and also
offer managerial insights on when each estimator is likely to perform well in practice.

We consider an approach for improving the efficiency of column generation (CG) methods for solving
vehicle routing problems. We introduce Local Area (LA) route relaxations, an alternative/complement
to the commonly used ng-route relaxations and Decremental State Space Relaxations (DSSR) inside
of CG formulations. LA routes are a subset of ng-routes and a super-set of elementary routes. Normally,
the pricing stage of CG must produce elementary routes, which are routes without repeated customers,
using processes which can be computationally expensive. Non-elementary routes visit at least
one customer more than once, creating a cycle. LA routes relax the constraint of being an elementary
route in such a manner as to permit efficient pricing. LA routes are best understood in terms of ng-route
relaxations. Ng-routes are routes which are permitted to have non-localized cycles in space; this
means that at least one intermediate customer (called a breaker) in the cycle must consider the starting
customer in the cycle to be spatially far away. LA routes are described using a set of special indexes
corresponding to customers on the route ordered from the start to the end of the route. LA route relaxations
further restrict the set of permitted cycles beyond that of ng-routes by additionally enforcing
that the breaker must be a located at a special index where the set of special indexes is defined recursively
as follows. The first special index in the route is at index 1 meaning that it is associated with the
first customer in the route. The k'th special index corresponds to the first customer after the k-1'th
special index, that is not considered to be a neighbor of (considered spatially far from) the customer
located at the k-1'th special index. We demonstrate that LA route relaxations can significantly
improve the computational speed of pricing when compared to the standard DSSR.

The aim of this paper is to describe a novel non-parametric noise reduction technique from the point
of view of Bayesian inference that may automatically improve the signal-to-noise ratio of one-
and two-dimensional data, such as e.g. astronomical images and spectra. The algorithm iteratively
evaluates possible smoothed versions of the data, the smooth models, obtaining an estimation of
the underlying signal that is statistically compatible with the noisy measurements. Iterations
stop based on the evidence and the $\chi^2$ statistic of the last smooth model, and we compute the
expected value of the signal as a weighted average of the whole set of smooth models. In this paper,
we explain the mathematical formalism and numerical implementation of the algorithm, and we evaluate
its performance in terms of the peak signal to noise ratio, the structural similarity index, and
the time payload, using a battery of real astronomical observations. Our Fully Adaptive Bayesian
Algorithm for Data Analysis (FABADA) yields results that, without any parameter tuning, are comparable
to standard image processing algorithms whose parameters have been optimized based on the true
signal to be recovered, something that is impossible in a real application. State-of-the-art non-parametric
methods, such as BM3D, offer slightly better performance at high signal-to-noise ratio, while
our algorithm is significantly more accurate for extremely noisy data (higher than $20-40\%$ relative
errors, a situation of particular interest in the field of astronomy). In this range, the standard
deviation of the residuals obtained by our reconstruction may become more than an order of magnitude
lower than that of the original measurements. The source code needed to reproduce all the results
presented in this report, including the implementation of the method, is publicly available at

Three-dimensional point clouds learning is widely applied, but the point clouds are still unable
to deal with classification and recognition tasks satisfactorily in the cases of irregular geometric
structures and high-dimensional space. In 3D space, point clouds tend to have regular Euclidean
structure because of their density. On the contrary, due to the high dimensionality, the spatial
structure of high-dimensional space is more complex, and point clouds are mostly presented in non-European
structure. Furthermore, among current 3D point clouds classification algorithms, Canonical
Capsules algorithm based on Euclidean distance is difficult to decompose and identify non-Euclidean
structures effectively. Thus, aiming at the point clouds classification task of non-Euclidean
structure in 3D and high-dimensional space, this paper refers to the LLE algorithm based on geodesic
distance for optimizing and proposes the unsupervised algorithm of high-dimensional point clouds
capsule. In this paper, the geometric features of point clouds are considered in the extraction
process, so as to transform the high-dimensional non-Euclidean structure into a lower-dimensional
Euclidean structure with retaining spatial geometric features. To verify the feasibility of the
unsupervised algorithm of high-dimensional point clouds capsule, experiments are conducted
in Swiss Roll dataset, point clouds MNIST dataset and point clouds LFW dataset. The results show
that (1) non-Euclidean structures can be can effectively identified by this model in Swiss Roll
dataset; (2) a significant unsupervised learning effect is realized in point clouds MNIST dataset.
In conclusion, the high-dimensional point clouds capsule unsupervised algorithm proposed in
this paper is conducive to expand the application scenarios of current point clouds classification
and recognition tasks.

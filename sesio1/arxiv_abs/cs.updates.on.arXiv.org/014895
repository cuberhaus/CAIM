Background: Prokaryotic viruses, which infect bacteria and archaea, are the most abundant and
diverse biological entities in the biosphere. To understand their regulatory roles in various
ecosystems and to harness the potential of bacteriophages for use in therapy, more knowledge of
viral-host relationships is required. High-throughput sequencing and its application to the
microbiome have offered new opportunities for computational approaches for predicting which
hosts particular viruses can infect. However, there are two main challenges for computational
host prediction. First, the empirically known virus-host relationships are very limited. Second,
although sequence similarity between viruses and their prokaryote hosts have been used as a major
feature for host prediction, the alignment is either missing or ambiguous in many cases. Thus, there
is still a need to improve the accuracy of host prediction. Results: In this work, we present a semi-supervised
learning model, named HostG, to conduct host prediction for novel viruses. We construct a knowledge
graph by utilizing both virus-virus protein similarity and virus-host DNA sequence similarity.
Then graph convolutional network (GCN) is adopted to exploit viruses with or without known hosts
in training to enhance the learning ability. During the GCN training, we minimize the expected calibrated
error (ECE) to ensure the confidence of the predictions. We tested HostG on both simulated and real
sequencing data and compared its performance with other state-of-the-art methods specifcally
designed for virus host classification (VHM-net, WIsH, PHP, HoPhage, RaFAH, vHULK, and VPF-Class).
Conclusion: HostG outperforms other popular methods, demonstrating the efficacy of using a GCN-based
semi-supervised learning approach. A particular advantage of HostG is its ability to predict hosts
from new taxa.

We study the asymptotic convergence of AA($m$), i.e., Anderson acceleration with window size $m$
for accelerating fixed-point methods $x_{k+1}=q(x_{k})$, $x_k \in R^n$. Convergence acceleration
by AA($m$) has been widely observed but is not well understood. We consider the case where the fixed-point
iteration function $q(x)$ is differentiable and the convergence of the fixed-point method itself
is root-linear. We identify numerically several conspicuous properties of AA($m$) convergence:
First, AA($m$) sequences $\{x_k\}$ converge root-linearly but the root-linear convergence factor
depends strongly on the initial condition. Second, the AA($m$) acceleration coefficients $\beta^{(k)}$
do not converge but oscillate as $\{x_k\}$ converges to $x^*$. To shed light on these observations,
we write the AA($m$) iteration as an augmented fixed-point iteration $z_{k+1} =\Psi(z_k)$, $z_k
\in R^{n(m+1)}$ and analyze the continuity and differentiability properties of $\Psi(z)$ and
$\beta(z)$. We find that the vector of acceleration coefficients $\beta(z)$ is not continuous
at the fixed point $z^*$. However, we show that, despite the discontinuity of $\beta(z)$, the iteration
function $\Psi(z)$ is Lipschitz continuous and directionally differentiable at $z^*$ for AA(1),
and we generalize this to AA($m$) with $m>1$ for most cases. Furthermore, we find that $\Psi(z)$
is not differentiable at $z^*$. We then discuss how these theoretical findings relate to the observed
convergence behaviour of AA($m$). The discontinuity of $\beta(z)$ at $z^*$ allows $\beta^{(k)}$
to oscillate as $\{x_k\}$ converges to $x^*$, and the non-differentiability of $\Psi(z)$ allows
AA($m$) sequences to converge with root-linear convergence factors that strongly depend on the
initial condition. Additional numerical results illustrate our findings.

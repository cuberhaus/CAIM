In the Cumulative Advantage(CA) model, which is one of the most fundamental approaches to understand
the mechanism of citation dynamics, papers receive citations depending on how much they have been
already cited. On the other hand, a substantial effect not included in CA is that some surprising
discoveries suddenly acquire citations after a long time from publishing. This phenomenon is known
as Sleeping Beauty(SB). Since disrupting discoveries need long-time discussion by the research
community to accept, SBs can capture innovative findings and reveal the nature of disruptive scientific
knowledge production. To research SBs citation burst mechanism, bibliometricians consider the
existence of the Prince(PR) for each SBs, which can be the trigger of SBs awakeness. For example,
the discovery of Green Fluorescent Protein(GFP), which got Nobel prize in chemistry, had been overlooked
for 30 years until Chalfie and Tsien, who also received the prize, developed a method to use GFP as
a marker protein in genetic engineering. However, how does Chalfies and Tsiens research relight
the hidden knowledge in the research community? If we can clarify such a mechanism rediscovering
from nearly nothing, it can be helpful in science support and policy decision-making. This study
proposes a Storyteller that focuses on the connection between SB and PR before SB gets citation burst
by co-citation. PR is found to be the paper awakening SB in retrospect, but it is not easy to detect
it as the trigger of SBs awakeness at the time of PR submission. We named the papers which co-cites
SB and PR before the citation burst of SB as Storyteller(ST) and analyze (1) how ST contributes to
broadening the novelty of SB&PR connections and (2) how much ST leads the citation burst after awakening.

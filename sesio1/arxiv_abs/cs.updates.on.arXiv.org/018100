Recent studies have shown that heavy tails can emerge in stochastic optimization and that the heaviness
of the tails has links to the generalization error. While these studies have shed light on interesting
aspects of the generalization behavior in modern settings, they relied on strong topological and
statistical regularity assumptions, which are hard to verify in practice. Furthermore, it has
been empirically illustrated that the relation between heavy tails and generalization might not
always be monotonic in practice, contrary to the conclusions of existing theory. In this study,
we establish novel links between the tail behavior and generalization properties of stochastic
gradient descent (SGD), through the lens of algorithmic stability. We consider a quadratic optimization
problem and use a heavy-tailed stochastic differential equation as a proxy for modeling the heavy-tailed
behavior emerging in SGD. We then prove uniform stability bounds, which reveal the following outcomes:
(i) Without making any exotic assumptions, we show that SGD will not be stable if the stability is
measured with the squared-loss $x\mapsto x^2$, whereas it in turn becomes stable if the stability
is instead measured with a surrogate loss $x\mapsto |x|^p$ with some $p<2$. (ii) Depending on the
variance of the data, there exists a \emph{`threshold of heavy-tailedness'} such that the generalization
error decreases as the tails become heavier, as long as the tails are lighter than this threshold.
This suggests that the relation between heavy tails and generalization is not globally monotonic.
(iii) We prove matching lower-bounds on uniform stability, implying that our bounds are tight in
terms of the heaviness of the tails. We support our theory with synthetic and real neural network
experiments.

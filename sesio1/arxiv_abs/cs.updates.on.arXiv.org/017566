Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) have achieved state-of-art results on single text classification
tasks like sentiment analysis, emotion detection, etc. However, the performance is achieved by
testing and reporting on resource-rich languages like English. Applying GCN for multi-task text
classification is an unexplored area. Moreover, training a GCN or adopting an English GCN for Indian
languages is often limited by data availability, rich morphological variation, syntax, and semantic
differences. In this paper, we study the use of GCN for the Telugu language in single and multi-task
settings for four natural language processing (NLP) tasks, viz. sentiment analysis (SA), emotion
identification (EI), hate-speech (HS), and sarcasm detection (SAR). In order to evaluate the performance
of GCN with one of the Indian languages, Telugu, we analyze the GCN based models with extensive experiments
on four downstream tasks. In addition, we created an annotated Telugu dataset, TEL-NLP, for the
four NLP tasks. Further, we propose a supervised graph reconstruction method, Multi-Task Text
GCN (MT-Text GCN) on the Telugu that leverages to simultaneously (i) learn the low-dimensional
word and sentence graph embeddings from word-sentence graph reconstruction using graph autoencoder
(GAE) and (ii) perform multi-task text classification using these latent sentence graph embeddings.
We argue that our proposed MT-Text GCN achieves significant improvements on TEL-NLP over existing
Telugu pretrained word embeddings, and multilingual pretrained Transformer models: mBERT, and
XLM-R. On TEL-NLP, we achieve a high F1-score for four NLP tasks: SA (0.84), EI (0.55), HS (0.83) and
SAR (0.66). Finally, we show our model's quantitative and qualitative analysis on the four NLP tasks
in Telugu.

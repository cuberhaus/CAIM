In the era of the Internet of Things (IoT), massive computing devices surrounding us operate and
interact with each other to provide several significant services in industries, medical as well
as in daily life activities at home, office, education sectors, and so on. The participating devices
in an IoT network usually have resource constraints and the devices are prone to different cyber
attacks, leading to the loopholes in the security and authentication. As a revolutionized and innovated
technology, blockchain, that is applied in cryptocurrency, market prediction, etc., uses a distributed
ledger that records transactions securely and efficiently. To utilize the great potential of blockchain,
both industries and academia have paid a significant attention to integrate it with the IoT, as reported
by several existing literature. On the other hand, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is able to embed
intelligence in a system, and thus the AI can be integrated with IoT devices in order to automatically
cope with different environments according to the demands. Furthermore, both blockchain and AI
can be integrated with the IoT to design an automated secure and robust IoT model, as mentioned by
numerous existing works. In this survey, we present a discussion on the IoT, blockchain, and AI,
along with the descriptions of several research works that apply blockchain and AI in the IoT. In
this direction, we point out strengths and limitations of the related existing researches. We also
discuss different open challenges to exploit the full capacities of blockchain and AI in designing
an IoT-based model. Therefore, the highlighted challenging issues can open the door for the development
of future IoT models which will be intelligent and secure based on the integration of blockchain
and AI with the IoT.

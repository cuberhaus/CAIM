Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of visual impairment among elderly
in the world. Early detection of AMD is of great importance, as the vision loss caused by this disease
is irreversible and permanent. Color fundus photography is the most cost-effective imaging modality
to screen for retinal disorders. Cutting edge deep learning based algorithms have been recently
developed for automatically detecting AMD from fundus images. However, there are still lack of
a comprehensive annotated dataset and standard evaluation benchmarks. To deal with this issue,
we set up the Automatic Detection challenge on Age-related Macular degeneration (ADAM), which
was held as a satellite event of the ISBI 2020 conference. The ADAM challenge consisted of four tasks
which cover the main aspects of detecting and characterizing AMD from fundus images, including
detection of AMD, detection and segmentation of optic disc, localization of fovea, and detection
and segmentation of lesions. As part of the challenge, we have released a comprehensive dataset
of 1200 fundus images with AMD diagnostic labels, pixel-wise segmentation masks for both optic
disc and AMD-related lesions (drusen, exudates, hemorrhages and scars, among others), as well
as the coordinates corresponding to the location of the macular fovea. A uniform evaluation framework
has been built to make a fair comparison of different models using this dataset. During the challenge,
610 results were submitted for online evaluation, with 11 teams finally participating in the onsite
challenge. This paper introduces the challenge, the dataset and the evaluation methods, as well
as summarizes the participating methods and analyzes their results for each task. In particular,
we observed that the ensembling strategy and the incorporation of clinical domain knowledge were
the key to improve the performance of the deep learning models.

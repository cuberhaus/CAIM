An urban tactical wireless network is considered wherein the base stations are situated on unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) that provide connectivity to ground assets such as vehicles located on city
streets. The UAVs are assumed to be randomly deployed at a fixed height according to a two-dimensional
point process. Millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequencies are used to avail of large available bandwidths
and spatial isolation due to beamforming. In urban environments, mmWave signals are prone to blocking
of the line-of-sight (LoS) by buildings. While reflections are possible, the desire for consistent
connectivity places a strong preference on the existence of an unblocked LoS path. As such, the key
performance metric considered in this paper is the connectivity probability, which is the probability
of an unblocked LoS path to at least one UAV within some maximum transmission distance. By leveraging
tools from stochastic geometry, the connectivity probability is characterized as a function of
the city type (e.g., urban, dense urban, suburban), density of UAVs (average number of UAVs per square
km), and height of the UAVs. The city streets are modeled as a Manhattan Poisson Line Process (MPLP)
and the building heights are randomly distributed. The analysis first finds the connectivity probability
conditioned on a particular network realization (location of the UAVs) and then removes the conditioning
to uncover the distribution of the connectivity; i.e., the fraction of network realizations that
will fail to meet an outage threshold. While related work has applied an MPLP to networks with a single
UAV, the contributions of this paper are that it (1) considers networks of multiple UAVs, (2) characterizes
the performance by a connectivity distribution, and (3) identifies the optimal altitude for the
UAVs.

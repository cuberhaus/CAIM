Wireless communication networks have been witnessing an unprecedented demand due to the increasing
number of connected devices and emerging bandwidth-hungry applications. Albeit many competent
technologies for capacity enhancement purposes, such as millimeter wave communications and network
densification, there is still room and need for further capacity enhancement in wireless communication
networks, especially for the cases of unusual people gatherings, such as sport competitions, musical
concerts, etc. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been identified as one of the promising options
to enhance the capacity due to their easy implementation, pop up fashion operation, and cost-effective
nature. The main idea is to deploy base stations on UAVs and operate them as flying base stations,
thereby bringing additional capacity to where it is needed. However, because the UAVs mostly have
limited energy storage, their energy consumption must be optimized to increase flight time. In
this survey, we investigate different energy optimization techniques with a top-level classification
in terms of the optimization algorithm employed; conventional and machine learning (ML). Such
classification helps understand the state of the art and the current trend in terms of methodology.
In this regard, various optimization techniques are identified from the related literature, and
they are presented under the above mentioned classes of employed optimization methods. In addition,
for the purpose of completeness, we include a brief tutorial on the optimization methods and power
supply and charging mechanisms of UAVs. Moreover, novel concepts, such as reflective intelligent
surfaces and landing spot optimization, are also covered to capture the latest trend in the literature.

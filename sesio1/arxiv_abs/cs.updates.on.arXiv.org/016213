In presence of multiple objectives to be optimized in Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE),
Pareto search has been commonly adopted. It searches for a good approximation of the problem's Pareto
optimal solutions, from which the stakeholders choose the most preferred solution according to
their preferences. However, when clear preferences of the stakeholders (e.g., a set of weights
which reflect relative importance between objectives) are available prior to the search, weighted
search is believed to be the first choice since it simplifies the search via converting the original
multi-objective problem into a single-objective one and enable the search to focus on what only
the stakeholders are interested in. This paper questions such a "weighted search first" belief.
We show that the weights can, in fact, be harmful to the search process even in the presence of clear
preferences. Specifically, we conduct a large scale empirical study which consists of 38 systems/projects
from three representative SBSE problems, together with two types of search budget and nine sets
of weights, leading to 604 cases of comparisons. Our key finding is that weighted search reaches
a certain level of solution quality by consuming relatively less resources at the early stage of
the search; however, Pareto search is at the majority of the time (up to 77% of the cases) significantly
better than its weighted counterpart, as long as we allow a sufficient, but not unrealistic search
budget. This, together with other findings and actionable suggestions in the paper, allows us to
codify pragmatic and comprehensive guidance on choosing weighted and Pareto search for SBSE under
the circumstance that clear preferences are available. All code and data can be accessed at: https://github.com/ideas-labo/pareto-vs-weight-for-sbse.

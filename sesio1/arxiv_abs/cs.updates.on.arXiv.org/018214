$\mathbf{Purpose}$: To use artificial intelligence (AI) to: (1) exploit biomechanical knowledge
of the optic nerve head (ONH) from a relatively large population; (2) assess ONH robustness from
a single optical coherence tomography (OCT) scan of the ONH; (3) identify what critical three-dimensional
(3D) structural features make a given ONH robust. $\mathbf{Design}$: Retrospective cross-sectional
study. $\mathbf{Methods}$: 316 subjects had their ONHs imaged with OCT before and after acute intraocular
pressure (IOP) elevation through ophthalmo-dynamometry. IOP-induced lamina-cribrosa deformations
were then mapped in 3D and used to classify ONHs. Those with LC deformations superior to 4% were considered
fragile, while those with deformations inferior to 4% robust. Learning from these data, we compared
three AI algorithms to predict ONH robustness strictly from a baseline (undeformed) OCT volume:
(1) a random forest classifier; (2) an autoencoder; and (3) a dynamic graph CNN (DGCNN). The latter
algorithm also allowed us to identify what critical 3D structural features make a given ONH robust.
$\mathbf{Results}$: All 3 methods were able to predict ONH robustness from 3D structural information
alone and without the need to perform biomechanical testing. The DGCNN (area under the receiver
operating curve [AUC]: 0.76 $\pm$ 0.08) outperformed the autoencoder (AUC: 0.70 $\pm$ 0.07) and
the random forest classifier (AUC: 0.69 $\pm$ 0.05). Interestingly, to assess ONH robustness,
the DGCNN mainly used information from the scleral canal and the LC insertion sites. $\mathbf{Conclusions}$:
We propose an AI-driven approach that can assess the robustness of a given ONH solely from a single
OCT scan of the ONH, and without the need to perform biomechanical testing. Longitudinal studies
should establish whether ONH robustness could help us identify fast visual field loss progressors.

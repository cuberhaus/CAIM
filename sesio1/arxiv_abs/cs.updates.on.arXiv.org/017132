We study the Bayesian inverse problem of inferring the Biot number, a spatio-temporal heat-flux
parameter in a PDE model. This is an ill-posed problem where standard optimisation yields unphysical
inferences. We introduce a training scheme that uses temperature data to adaptively train a neural-network
surrogate to simulate the parametric forward model. This approach approximates forward and inverse
solution together, by simultaneously identifying an approximate posterior distribution over
the Biot number, and weighting the forward training loss according to this approximation. Utilising
random Chebyshev series, we outline how to approximate an arbitrary Gaussian process prior, and
using the surrogate we apply Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) to efficiently sample from the corresponding
posterior distribution. We derive convergence of the surrogate posterior to the true posterior
distribution in the Hellinger metric as our adaptive loss function approaches zero. Furthermore,
we describe how this surrogate-accelerated HMC approach can be combined with a traditional PDE
solver in a delayed-acceptance scheme to a-priori control the posterior accuracy, thus overcoming
a major limitation of deep learning-based surrogate approaches, which do not achieve guaranteed
accuracy a-priori due to their non-convex training. Biot number calculations are involved turbo-machinery
design, which is safety critical and highly regulated, therefore it is important that our results
have such mathematical guarantees. Our approach achieves fast mixing in high-dimensional parameter
spaces, whilst retaining the convergence guarantees of a traditional PDE solver, and without the
burden of evaluating this solver for proposals that are likely to be rejected. Numerical results
compare the accuracy and efficiency of the adaptive and general training regimes, as well as various
Markov chain Monte Carlo proposals strategies.

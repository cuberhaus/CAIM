As the first review in this field, this paper presents an in-depth mathematical view of Intelligent
Flight Control Systems (IFCSs), particularly those based on artificial neural networks. The rapid
evolution of IFCSs in the last two decades in both the methodological and technical aspects necessitates
a comprehensive view of them to better demonstrate the current stage and the crucial remaining steps
towards developing a truly intelligent flight management unit. To this end, in this paper, we will
provide a detailed mathematical view of Neural Network (NN)-based flight control systems and the
challenging problems that still remain. The paper will cover both the model-based and model-free
IFCSs. The model-based methods consist of the basic feedback error learning scheme, the pseudocontrol
strategy, and the neural backstepping method. Besides, different approaches to analyze the closed-loop
stability in IFCSs, their requirements, and their limitations will be discussed in detail. Various
supplementary features, which can be integrated with a basic IFCS such as the fault-tolerance capability,
the consideration of system constraints, and the combination of NNs with other robust and adaptive
elements like disturbance observers, would be covered, as well. On the other hand, concerning model-free
flight controllers, both the indirect and direct adaptive control systems including indirect
adaptive control using NN-based system identification, the approximate dynamic programming
using NN, and the reinforcement learning-based adaptive optimal control will be carefully addressed.
Finally, by demonstrating a well-organized view of the current stage in the development of IFCSs,
the challenging issues, which are critical to be addressed in the future, are thoroughly identified.

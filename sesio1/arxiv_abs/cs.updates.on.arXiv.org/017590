A biased dataset is a dataset that generally has attributes with an uneven class distribution. These
biases have the tendency to propagate to the models that train on them, often leading to a poor performance
in the minority class. In this project, we will explore the extent to which various data augmentation
methods alleviate intrinsic biases within the dataset. We will apply several augmentation techniques
on a sample of the UTKFace dataset, such as undersampling, geometric transformations, variational
autoencoders (VAEs), and generative adversarial networks (GANs). We then trained a classifier
for each of the augmented datasets and evaluated their performance on the native test set and on external
facial recognition datasets. We have also compared their performance to the state-of-the-art
attribute classifier trained on the FairFace dataset. Through experimentation, we were able to
find that training the model on StarGAN-generated images led to the best overall performance. We
also found that training on geometrically transformed images lead to a similar performance with
a much quicker training time. Additionally, the best performing models also exhibit a uniform performance
across the classes within each attribute. This signifies that the model was also able to mitigate
the biases present in the baseline model that was trained on the original training set. Finally,
we were able to show that our model has a better overall performance and consistency on age and ethnicity
classification on multiple datasets when compared with the FairFace model. Our final model has
an accuracy on the UTKFace test set of 91.75%, 91.30%, and 87.20% for the gender, age, and ethnicity
attribute respectively, with a standard deviation of less than 0.1 between the accuracies of the
classes of each attribute.

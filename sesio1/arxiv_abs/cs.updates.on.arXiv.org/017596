We stand at the foot of a significant inflection in the trajectory of scientific discovery. As society
continues on its fast-paced digital transformation, so does humankind's collective scientific
knowledge and discourse. We now read and write papers in digitized form, and a great deal of the formal
and informal processes of science are captured digitally -- including papers, preprints and books,
code and datasets, conference presentations, and interactions in social networks and communication
platforms. The transition has led to the growth of a tremendous amount of information, opening exciting
opportunities for computational models and systems that analyze and harness it. In parallel, exponential
growth in data processing power has fueled remarkable advances in AI, including self-supervised
neural models capable of learning powerful representations from large-scale unstructured text
without costly human supervision. The confluence of societal and computational trends suggests
that computer science is poised to ignite a revolution in the scientific process itself. However,
the explosion of scientific data, results and publications stands in stark contrast to the constancy
of human cognitive capacity. While scientific knowledge is expanding with rapidity, our minds
have remained static, with severe limitations on the capacity for finding, assimilating and manipulating
information. We propose a research agenda of task-guided knowledge retrieval, in which systems
counter humans' bounded capacity by ingesting corpora of scientific knowledge and retrieving
inspirations, explanations, solutions and evidence synthesized to directly augment human performance
on salient tasks in scientific endeavors. We present initial progress on methods and prototypes,
and lay out important opportunities and challenges ahead with computational approaches that have
the potential to revolutionize science.

Kinetics of dilute heterogeneous traffic on a two lane road is formulated in the framework of the
Ben-Naim Krapivsky model and stationary state properties are analytically derived in the asymptotic
limit. The heterogeneity is introduced as a quenched disorder in desired speeds of vehicles. The
model assumes that each vehicle/platoon in a lane moves ballistically until it approaches a slow
moving vehicle/platoon and then joins it. Vehicles in a platoon are assumed to escape the platoon
at a constant rate by changing lanes. Each lane is assumed to have a different escape rate. As the stationary
state is approached, the platoon density in the two lanes become equal, whereas the vehicle densities
and fluxes are higher in the lane with lower escape rate. A majority of the vehicles enjoy a free-flow
if the harmonic mean of the escape rates of the lanes is comparable to average initial flux on the road.
The average platoon size is close to unity in the free-flow regime. If the harmonic mean is lower than
the average initial flux, then vehicles with desired speeds lower than a characteristic speed $v^*$
still enjoy free-flow while those vehicles with desired speeds that are greater than $v^*$ experience
congestion and form platoons behind the slower vehicles. The characteristic speed depends on the
mean of escape times $(R=(R_1+R_{-1})/2)$ of the two lanes (represented by 1 and -1) as $v^* \sim
R^{-\frac{1}{\mu+2}}$, where $\mu$ is the exponent of the quenched disorder distribution for
desired speed in the small speed limit. The average platoon size in a lane, when $v^* \ll 1$, is proportional
to $R^{\frac{\mu+1}{\mu+2}}$ plus a lane dependent correction. Equations for the kinetics of
platoon size distribution for two-lane traffic are also studied. It is shown that a stationary state
with platoons as large as road length can occur only if the mean escape rate is independent of platoon
size.

The rapid adoption of online social media platforms has transformed the way of communication and
interaction. On these platforms, discussions in the form of trending topics provide a glimpse of
events happening around the world in real-time. Also, these trends are used for political campaigns,
public awareness, and brand promotions. Consequently, these trends are sensitive to manipulation
by malicious users who aim to mislead the mass audience. In this article, we identify and study the
characteristics of users involved in the manipulation of Twitter trends in Pakistan. We propose
'Manipify', a framework for automatic detection and analysis of malicious users for Twitter trends.
Our framework consists of three distinct modules: i) user classifier, ii) hashtag classifier,
and ii) trend analyzer. The user classifier introduces a novel approach to automatically detect
manipulators using tweet content and user behaviour features. Also, the module classifies human
and bot users. Next, the hashtag classifier categorizes trending hashtags into six categories
assisting in examining manipulators behaviour across different categories. Finally, the trend
analyzer module examines users, hashtags, and tweets for hashtag reach, linguistic features and
user behaviour. Our user classifier module achieves 0.91 accuracy in classifying the manipulators.
We further test Manipify on the dataset comprising of 665 trending hashtags with 5.4 million tweets
and 1.9 million users. The analysis of trends reveals that the trending panel is mostly dominated
by political hashtags. In addition, our results show a higher contribution of human accounts in
trend manipulation as compared to bots. Furthermore, we present two case studies of hashtag-wars
and anti-state propaganda to implicate the real-world application of our research.

Governments must keep agricultural systems free of pests that threaten agricultural production
and international trade. Biosecurity surveillance already makes use of a wide range of technologies,
such as insect traps and lures, geographic information systems, and diagnostic biochemical tests.
The rise of cheap and usable surveillance technologies such as remotely piloted aircraft systems
(RPAS) presents value conflicts not addressed in international biosurveillance guidelines.
The costs of keeping agriculture pest-free include privacy violations and reduced autonomy for
farmers. We argue that physical and digital privacy in the age of ubiquitous aerial and ground surveillance
is a natural right to allow people to function freely on their land. Surveillance methods must be
co-created and justified through using ethically defensible processes such as discourse theory,
value-centred design and responsible innovation to forge a cooperative social contract between
diverse stakeholders. We propose an ethical framework for biosurveillance activities that balances
the collective benefits for food security with individual privacy: (1) establish the boundaries
of a biosurveillance social contract; (2) justify surveillance operations for the farmers, researchers,
industry, the public and regulators; (3) give decision makers a reasonable measure of control over
their personal and agricultural data; and (4) choose surveillance methodologies that give the
appropriate information. The benefits of incorporating an ethical framework for responsible
biosurveillance innovation include increased participation and accumulated trust over time.
Long term trust and cooperation will support food security, producing higher quality data overall
and mitigating against anticipated information gaps that may emerge due to disrespecting landholder
rights

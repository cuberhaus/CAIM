The project, under industrial funding, presented in this publication aims at the semantic analysis
of a normative document describing requirements applicable to electrical appliances. The objective
of the project is to build a semantic approach to extract and automatically process information
related to the requirements contained in the standard. To this end, the project has been divided
into three parts, covering the analysis of the requirements document, the extraction of relevant
information and creation of the ontology and the comparison with other approaches. The first part
of our work deals with the analysis of the requirements document under study. The study focuses on
the specificity of the sentence structure, the use of particular words and vocabulary related to
the representation of the requirements. The aim is to propose a representation facilitating the
extraction of information, used in the second part of the study. In the second part, the extraction
of relevant information is conducted in two ways: manual (the ontology being built by hand), semi-automatic
(using semantic annotation software and natural language processing techniques). Whatever the
method used, the aim of this extraction is to create the concept dictionary, then the ontology, enriched
as the document is scanned and understood by the system. Once the relevant terms have been identified,
the work focuses on identifying and representing the requirements, separating the textual writing
from the information given in the tables. The automatic processing of requirements involves the
extraction of sentences containing terms identified as relevant to a requirement. The identified
requirement is then indexed and stored in a representation that can be used for query processing.

Motivation: Medical image analysis involves tasks to assist physicians in qualitative and quantitative
analysis of lesions or anatomical structures, significantly improving the accuracy and reliability
of diagnosis and prognosis. Traditionally, these tasks are finished by physicians or medical physicists
and lead to two major problems: (i) low efficiency; (ii) biased by personal experience. In the past
decade, many machine learning methods have been applied to accelerate and automate the image analysis
process. Compared to the enormous deployments of supervised and unsupervised learning models,
attempts to use reinforcement learning in medical image analysis are scarce. This review article
could serve as the stepping-stone for related research. Significance: From our observation, though
reinforcement learning has gradually gained momentum in recent years, many researchers in the
medical analysis field find it hard to understand and deploy in clinics. One cause is lacking well-organized
review articles targeting readers lacking professional computer science backgrounds. Rather
than providing a comprehensive list of all reinforcement learning models in medical image analysis,
this paper may help the readers to learn how to formulate and solve their medical image analysis research
as reinforcement learning problems. Approach & Results: We selected published articles from Google
Scholar and PubMed. Considering the scarcity of related articles, we also included some outstanding
newest preprints. The papers are carefully reviewed and categorized according to the type of image
analysis task. We first review the basic concepts and popular models of reinforcement learning.
Then we explore the applications of reinforcement learning models in landmark detection. Finally,
we conclude the article by discussing the reviewed reinforcement learning approaches' limitations
and possible improvements.

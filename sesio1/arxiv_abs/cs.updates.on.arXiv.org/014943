Due to the diversity of attack materials, fingerprint recognition systems (AFRSs) are vulnerable
to malicious attacks. It is of great importance to propose effective Fingerprint Presentation
Attack Detection (PAD) methods for the safety and reliability of AFRSs. However, current PAD methods
often have poor robustness under new attack materials or sensor settings. This paper thus proposes
a novel Channel-wise Feature Denoising fingerprint PAD (CFD-PAD) method by considering handling
the redundant "noise" information which ignored in previous works. The proposed method learned
important features of fingerprint images by weighting the importance of each channel and finding
those discriminative channels and "noise" channels. Then, the propagation of "noise" channels
is suppressed in the feature map to reduce interference. Specifically, a PA-Adaption loss is designed
to constrain the feature distribution so as to make the feature distribution of live fingerprints
more aggregate and spoof fingerprints more disperse. Our experimental results evaluated on LivDet
2017 showed that our proposed CFD-PAD can achieve 2.53% ACE and 93.83% True Detection Rate when the
False Detection Rate equals to 1.0% (TDR@FDR=1%) and it outperforms the best single model based
methods in terms of ACE (2.53% vs. 4.56%) and TDR@FDR=1%(93.83% vs. 73.32\%) significantly, which
proves the effectiveness of the proposed method. Although we have achieved a comparable result
compared with the state-of-the-art multiple model based method, there still achieves an increase
of TDR@FDR=1% from 91.19% to 93.83% by our method. Besides, our model is simpler, lighter and, more
efficient and has achieved a 74.76% reduction in time-consuming compared with the state-of-the-art
multiple model based method. Code will be publicly available.

The design of a compact high-speed and wide field of view (FOV) receiver is challenging due to the
presence of two well-known trade-offs. The first one is the area-bandwidth trade-off of photodetectors
(PDs) and the second one is the gain-FOV trade-off due to the use of optics. The combined effects of
these two trade-offs imply that the achievable data rate of an imaging optical receiver is limited
by its FOV, i.e., a rate-FOV trade-off. To control the area-bandwidth trade-off, an array of small
PDs can be used instead of a single PD. Moreover, in practice, a large-area lens is required to ensure
sufficient power collection, which in turn limits the receiver FOV (i.e., gain-FOV trade-off).
We propose an imaging receiver design in the form of an array of arrays. To achieve a reasonable receiver
FOV, we use individual focusing lens for each PD array rather than a single collection lens for the
whole receiver. The proposed array of arrays structure provides an effective method to control
both gain-FOV trade-off (via an array of lenses) and area-bandwidth trade-off (via arrays of PDs).
We first derive a tractable analytical model for the SNR of an array of PDs where the maximum ratio
combining has been employed. Then, we extend the model for the proposed array of arrays structure
and the accuracy of the analytical model is verified based on several Optic Studio-based simulations.
Next, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the achievable data rate of the imaging receiver
subject to a minimum required FOV. The optimization problem is solved for two commonly used modulation
techniques, namely, OOK and direct current biased optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
with variable rate quadrature amplitude modulation. It is demonstrated that a data rate of ~ 24 Gbps
with a FOV of 15 is achievable using OOK with a total receiver size of 2 cm by 2 cm.

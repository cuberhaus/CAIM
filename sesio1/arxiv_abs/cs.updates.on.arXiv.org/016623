The Covid-19 pandemic has forced the workforce to switch to working from home, which has put significant
burdens on the management of broadband networks and called for intelligent service-by-service
resource optimization at the network edge. In this context, network traffic prediction is crucial
for operators to provide reliable connectivity across large geographic regions. Although recent
advances in neural network design have demonstrated potential to effectively tackle forecasting,
in this work we reveal based on real-world measurements that network traffic across different regions
differs widely. As a result, models trained on historical traffic data observed in one region can
hardly serve in making accurate predictions in other areas. Training bespoke models for different
regions is tempting, but that approach bears significant measurement overhead, is computationally
expensive, and does not scale. Therefore, in this paper we propose TransMUSE, a novel deep learning
framework that clusters similar services, groups edge-nodes into cohorts by traffic feature similarity,
and employs a Transformer-based Multi-service Traffic Prediction Network (TMTPN), which can
be directly transferred within a cohort without any customization. We demonstrate that TransMUSE
exhibits imperceptible performance degradation in terms of mean absolute error (MAE) when forecasting
traffic, compared with settings where a model is trained for each individual edge node. Moreover,
our proposed TMTPN architecture outperforms the state-of-the-art, achieving up to 43.21% lower
MAE in the multi-service traffic prediction task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
work that jointly employs model transfer and multi-service traffic prediction to reduce measurement
overhead, while providing fine-grained accurate demand forecasts for edge services provisioning.

Wavefront propagation and the appearance of spatially distant clusters of activity generically
arise in many contexts including neuron firing, social contagions, epidemics, and critical infrastructure
failures. These phenomena are in direct competition and represent a frustration between the network's
geometry and topology. Here, we extend their study to systems with higher-order interactions by
analyzing cascades over noisy geometric complexes, which contain short- and long-range `simplices'
that encode dyadic, triadic, and high-order dependencies. We present a simplicial threshold model
(STM) for cascades in which a vertex $v_i$ becomes active only when the activity across its simplicial
neighbors -- including adjacent 1-simplices, 2-simplices, etc. -- surpasses a threshold $T_i$.
We show that higher-order interactions and thresholding can coordinate to robustly guide cascades
along a geometric substrate comprised of lower-adjacent simplices despite the presence of long-range
simplices. We explore this phenomenon for a simplicial-complex-based model of a neuronal network,
i.e., a neuronal complex, revealing that higher-order interactions also promote the expressiveness
and efficiency of diverse spatio-temporal patterns. We support these findings with bifurcation
theory to predict wavefront and clustering dynamics as well as introduce simplicial cascade maps
that embed simplicial complexes with a latent geometry in which pairwise distances reflect the
time required for STM cascades to travel between vertices. Our findings and proposed mathematical
tools reveal the dynamical/structural interplay of higher-order nonlinearity and the multidimensional
geometry of simplicial complexes to be a fruitful direction for uncovering the multiscale mechanisms
that orchestrate higher-order processing within complex systems.

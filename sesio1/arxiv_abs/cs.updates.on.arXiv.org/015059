COVID-19 has become a global pandemic and is still posing a severe health risk to the public. Accurate
and efficient segmentation of pneumonia lesions in CT scans is vital for treatment decision-making.
We proposed a novel unsupervised approach using cycle consistent generative adversarial network
(cycle-GAN) which automates and accelerates the process of lesion delineation. The workflow includes
lung volume segmentation, "synthetic" healthy lung generation, infected and healthy image subtraction,
and binary lesion mask creation. The lung volume volume was firstly delineated using a pre-trained
U-net and worked as the input for the later network. The cycle-GAN was developed to generate synthetic
"healthy" lung CT images from infected lung images. After that, the pneumonia lesions are extracted
by subtracting the synthetic "healthy" lung CT images from the "infected" lung CT images. A median
filter and K-means clustering were then applied to contour the lesions. The auto segmentation approach
was validated on two public datasets (Coronacases and Radiopedia). The Dice coefficients reached
0.748 and 0.730, respectively, for the Coronacases and Radiopedia datasets. Meanwhile, the precision
and sensitivity for lesion segmentationdetection are 0.813 and 0.735 for the Coronacases dataset,
and 0.773 and 0.726 for the Radiopedia dataset. The performance is comparable to existing supervised
segmentation networks and outperforms previous unsupervised ones. The proposed unsupervised
segmentation method achieved high accuracy and efficiency in automatic COVID-19 lesion delineation.
The segmentation result can serve as a baseline for further manual modification and a quality assurance
tool for lesion diagnosis. Furthermore, due to its unsupervised nature, the result is not influenced
by physicians' experience which otherwise is crucial for supervised methods.

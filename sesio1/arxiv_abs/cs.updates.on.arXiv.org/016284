Production-level workflows for producing convincing 3D dynamic human faces have long relied on
a disarray of labor-intensive tools for geometry and texture generation, motion capture and rigging,
and expression synthesis. Recent neural approaches automate individual components but the corresponding
latent representations cannot provide artists explicit controls as in conventional tools. In
this paper, we present a new learning-based, video-driven approach for generating dynamic facial
geometries with high-quality physically-based assets. Two key components are well-structured
latent spaces due to dense temporal samplings from videos and explicit facial expression controls
to regulate the latent spaces. For data collection, we construct a hybrid multiview-photometric
capture stage, coupling with an ultra-fast video camera to obtain raw 3D facial assets. We then model
the facial expression, geometry and physically-based textures using separate VAEs with a global
MLP-based expression mapping across the latent spaces, to preserve characteristics across respective
attributes while maintaining explicit controls over geometry and texture. We also introduce to
model the delta information as wrinkle maps for physically-base textures, achieving high-quality
rendering of dynamic textures. We demonstrate our approach in high-fidelity performer-specific
facial capture and cross-identity facial motion retargeting. In addition, our neural asset along
with fast adaptation schemes can also be deployed to handle in-the-wild videos. Besides, we motivate
the utility of our explicit facial disentangle strategy by providing promising physically-based
editing results like geometry and material editing or winkle transfer with high realism. Comprehensive
experiments show that our technique provides higher accuracy and visual fidelity than previous
video-driven facial reconstruction and animation methods.

It is well known that translations of songs and poems not only breaks rhythm and rhyming patterns,
but also results in loss of semantic information. The Bhagavad Gita is an ancient Hindu philosophical
text originally written in Sanskrit that features a conversation between Lord Krishna and Arjuna
prior to the Mahabharata war. The Bhagavad Gita is also one of the key sacred texts in Hinduism and
known as the forefront of the Vedic corpus of Hinduism. In the last two centuries, there has been a
lot of interest in Hindu philosophy by western scholars and hence the Bhagavad Gita has been translated
in a number of languages. However, there is not much work that validates the quality of the English
translations. Recent progress of language models powered by deep learning has enabled not only
translations but better understanding of language and texts with semantic and sentiment analysis.
Our work is motivated by the recent progress of language models powered by deep learning methods.
In this paper, we compare selected translations (mostly from Sanskrit to English) of the Bhagavad
Gita using semantic and sentiment analyses. We use hand-labelled sentiment dataset for tuning
state-of-art deep learning-based language model known as \textit{bidirectional encoder representations
from transformers} (BERT). We use novel sentence embedding models to provide semantic analysis
for selected chapters and verses across translations. Finally, we use the aforementioned models
for sentiment and semantic analyses and provide visualisation of results. Our results show that
although the style and vocabulary in the respective Bhagavad Gita translations vary widely, the
sentiment analysis and semantic similarity shows that the message conveyed are mostly similar
across the translations.

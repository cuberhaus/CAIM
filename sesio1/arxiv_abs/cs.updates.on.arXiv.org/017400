Next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation has become an indispensable functionality in Location-based
Social Networks (LBSNs) due to its effectiveness in helping people decide the next POI to visit.
However, accurate recommendation requires a vast amount of historical check-in data, thus threatening
user privacy as the location-sensitive data needs to be handled by cloud servers. Although there
have been several on-device frameworks for privacy-preserving POI recommendations, they are
still resource-intensive when it comes to storage and computation, and show limited robustness
to the high sparsity of user-POI interactions. On this basis, we propose a novel decentralized collaborative
learning framework for POI recommendation (DCLR), which allows users to train their personalized
models locally in a collaborative manner. DCLR significantly reduces the local models' dependence
on the cloud for training, and can be used to expand arbitrary centralized recommendation models.
To counteract the sparsity of on-device user data when learning each local model, we design two self-supervision
signals to pretrain the POI representations on the server with geographical and categorical correlations
of POIs. To facilitate collaborative learning, we innovatively propose to incorporate knowledge
from either geographically or semantically similar users into each local model with attentive
aggregation and mutual information maximization. The collaborative learning process makes use
of communications between devices while requiring only minor engagement from the central server
for identifying user groups, and is compatible with common privacy preservation mechanisms like
differential privacy. We evaluate DCLR with two real-world datasets, where the results show that
DCLR outperforms state-of-the-art on-device frameworks and yields competitive results compared
with centralized counterparts.

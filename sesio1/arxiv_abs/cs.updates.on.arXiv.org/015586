The new coronavirus has caused more than one million deaths and continues to spread rapidly. This
virus targets the lungs, causing respiratory distress which can be mild or severe. The X-ray or computed
tomography (CT) images of lungs can reveal whether the patient is infected with COVID-19 or not.
Many researchers are trying to improve COVID-19 detection using artificial intelligence. Our
motivation is to develop an automatic method that can cope with scenarios in which preparing labeled
data is time consuming or expensive. In this article, we propose a Semi-supervised Classification
using Limited Labeled Data (SCLLD) relying on Sobel edge detection and Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) to automate the COVID-19 diagnosis. The GAN discriminator output is a probabilistic
value which is used for classification in this work. The proposed system is trained using 10,000
CT scans collected from Omid Hospital, whereas a public dataset is also used for validating our system.
The proposed method is compared with other state-of-the-art supervised methods such as Gaussian
processes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a semi-supervised method for COVID-19
detection is presented. Our system is capable of learning from a mixture of limited labeled and unlabeled
data where supervised learners fail due to a lack of sufficient amount of labeled data. Thus, our
semi-supervised training method significantly outperforms the supervised training of Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) when labeled training data is scarce. The 95% confidence intervals for our
method in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity are 99.56 +- 0.20%, 99.88 +- 0.24%, and
99.40 +- 0.18%, respectively, whereas intervals for the CNN (trained supervised) are 68.34 +- 4.11%,
91.2 +- 6.15%, and 46.40 +- 5.21%.

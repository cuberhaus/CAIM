Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification has been a hot topic for decides, as hyperspectral images
have rich spatial and spectral information and provide strong basis for distinguishing different
land-cover objects. Benefiting from the development of deep learning technologies, deep learning
based HSI classification methods have achieved promising performance. Recently, several neural
architecture search (NAS) algorithms have been proposed for HSI classification, which further
improve the accuracy of HSI classification to a new level. In this paper, NAS and Transformer are
combined for handling HSI classification task for the first time. Compared with previous work,
the proposed method has two main differences. First, we revisit the search spaces designed in previous
HSI classification NAS methods and propose a novel hybrid search space, consisting of the space
dominated cell and the spectrum dominated cell. Compared with search spaces proposed in previous
works, the proposed hybrid search space is more aligned with the characteristic of HSI data, that
is, HSIs have a relatively low spatial resolution and an extremely high spectral resolution. Second,
to further improve the classification accuracy, we attempt to graft the emerging transformer module
on the automatically designed convolutional neural network (CNN) to add global information to
local region focused features learned by CNN. Experimental results on three public HSI datasets
show that the proposed method achieves much better performance than comparison approaches, including
manually designed network and NAS based HSI classification methods. Especially on the most recently
captured dataset Houston University, overall accuracy is improved by nearly 6 percentage points.

Functional upper-limb prosthetic training can improve users performance in controlling prostheses
and has been incorporated into occupational therapy for individuals in need. In recent years, virtual
reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies have been shown to be promising avenues to
improve the convenience of rehabilitative prosthesis training systems. However, it is uncertain
if the comprehensive efficacy and effectiveness of VR or AR assistive tools are adequate compared
to conventional prosthetic tools and if not, whether enhancements can be made through incorporation
of other technical paradigms. This work first presents a mixed reality system we developed for prosthesis
control and training. Five able-bodied subjects are involved to perform three-dimensional object
manipulation tasks in analogous AR and VR environments. Multiple evaluation metrics are applied
to assess subjects performances within the two paradigms. Based on the comparative analysis, we
find that VR-based environment promotes more efficient motion along with higher task completion
rate and path efficiency while AR paradigm allows subjects to perform motor tasks with shorter time
consumed. Another study is conducted to evaluate the efficiency and feasibility of AR-facilitated
prosthesis control system compared to that in real-world and if any technical additions can be applied
to improve the AR-based system. Three able-bodied subjects were engaged in the experiment to perform
object manipulation tasks in a) physical environment, b) AR-without-bypass environment, and
c) AR-with-bypass environment. Based on the results obtained from the assessment, we conclude
that while our AR-based system modestly lags behind the effectiveness of physical systems, the
study conducted using a bypass prosthesis suggests that AR system has the potential to improve the
efficacy of prosthesis control.

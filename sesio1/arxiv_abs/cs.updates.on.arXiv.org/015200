In the institutional research mode, in order to explore which characteristics are the best indicators
for predicting academic risk from the student behavior data sets that have high-dimensional, unbalanced
classified small sample, it transforms the academic risk prediction of college students into a
binary classification task. It predicts academic risk based on the LightGBM model and the interpretable
machine learning method of Shapley value. The simulation results show that from the global perspective
of the prediction model, characteristics such as the quality of academic partners, the seating
position in classroom, the dormitory study atmosphere, the English scores of the college entrance
examination, the quantity of academic partners, the addiction level of video games, the mobility
of academic partners, and the degree of truancy are the best 8 predictors for academic risk. It is
contrary to intuition that characteristics such as living in campus or not, work-study, lipstick
addiction, student leader or not, lover amount, and smoking have little correlation with university
academic risk in this experiment. From the local perspective of the sample, the factors affecting
academic risk vary from person to person. It can perform personalized interpretable analysis through
Shapley values, which cannot be done by traditional mathematical statistical prediction models.
The academic contributions of this research are mainly in two aspects: First, the learning interaction
networks is proposed for the first time, so that social behavior can be used to compensate for the
one-sided individual behavior and improve the performance of academic risk prediction. Second,
the introduction of Shapley value calculation makes machine learning that lacks a clear reasoning
process visualized, and provides intuitive decision support for education managers.

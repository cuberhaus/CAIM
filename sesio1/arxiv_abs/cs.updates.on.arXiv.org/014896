Data is published on the web over time in great volumes, but majority of the data is unstructured,
making it hard to understand and difficult to interpret. Information Extraction (IE) methods obtain
structured information from unstructured data. One of the challenging IE tasks is Event Extraction
(EE) which seeks to derive information about specific incidents and their actors from the text.
EE is useful in many domains such as building a knowledge base, information retrieval and summarization.
In the past decades, some event ontologies like ACE, CAMEO and ICEWS were developed to define event
forms, actors and dimensions of events observed in the text. These event ontologies still have some
shortcomings such as covering only a few topics like political events, having inflexible structure
in defining argument roles and insufficient gold-standard data. To address these concerns, we
propose an event ontology, namely COfEE, that incorporates both expert domain knowledge and a data-driven
approach for identifying events from text. COfEE consists of two hierarchy levels (event types
and event sub-types) that include new categories relating to environmental issues, cyberspace
and criminal activity which need to be monitored instantly. Also, dynamic roles according to each
event sub-type are defined to capture various dimensions of events. In a follow-up experiment,
the proposed ontology is evaluated on Wikipedia events, and it is shown to be general and comprehensive.
Moreover, in order to facilitate the preparation of gold-standard data for event extraction, a
language-independent online tool is presented based on COfEE. A gold-standard dataset annotated
by 10 human experts is also prepared consisting 24K news articles in Persian language. Finally,
we present a supervised method based on deep learning techniques to automatically extract relevant
events and corresponding actors.

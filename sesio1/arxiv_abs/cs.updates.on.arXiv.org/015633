Graph summarization is beneficial in a wide range of applications, such as visualization, interactive
and exploratory analysis, approximate query processing, reducing the on-disk storage footprint,
and graph processing in modern hardware. However, the bulk of the literature on graph summarization
surprisingly overlooks the possibility of having edges of different types. In this paper, we study
the novel problem of producing summaries of multi-relation networks, i.e., graphs where multiple
edges of different types may exist between any pair of nodes. Multi-relation graphs are an expressive
model of real-world activities, in which a relation can be a topic in social networks, an interaction
type in genetic networks, or a snapshot in temporal graphs. The first approach that we consider for
multi-relation graph summarization is a two-step method based on summarizing each relation in
isolation, and then aggregating the resulting summaries in some clever way to produce a final unique
summary. In doing this, as a side contribution, we provide the first polynomial-time approximation
algorithm based on the k-Median clustering for the classic problem of lossless single-relation
graph summarization. Then, we demonstrate the shortcomings of these two-step methods, and propose
holistic approaches, both approximate and heuristic algorithms, to compute a summary directly
for multi-relation graphs. In particular, we prove that the approximation bound of k-Median clustering
for the single relation solution can be maintained in a multi-relation graph with proper aggregation
operation over adjacency matrices corresponding to its multiple relations. Experimental results
and case studies (on co-authorship networks and brain networks) validate the effectiveness and
efficiency of the proposed algorithms.

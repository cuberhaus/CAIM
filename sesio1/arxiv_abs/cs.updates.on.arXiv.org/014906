Identifying the targets of an antimicrobial peptide is a fundamental step in studying the innate
immune response and combating antibiotic resistance, and more broadly, precision medicine and
public health. There have been extensive studies on the statistical and computational approaches
to identify (i) whether a peptide is an antimicrobial peptide (AMP) or a non-AMP and (ii) which targets
are these sequences effective to (Gram-positive, Gram-negative, etc.). Despite the existing
deep learning methods on this problem, most of them are unable to handle the small AMP classes (anti-insect,
anti-parasite, etc.). And more importantly, some AMPs can have multiple targets, which the previous
methods fail to consider. In this study, we build a diverse and comprehensive multi-label protein
sequence database by collecting and cleaning amino acids from various AMP databases. To generate
efficient representations and features for the small classes dataset, we take advantage of a protein
language model trained on 250 million protein sequences. Based on that, we develop an end-to-end
hierarchical multi-label deep forest framework, HMD-AMP, to annotate AMP comprehensively. After
identifying an AMP, it further predicts what targets the AMP can effectively kill from eleven available
classes. Extensive experiments suggest that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art models
in both the binary classification task and the multi-label classification task, especially on
the minor classes.The model is robust against reduced features and small perturbations and produces
promising results. We believe HMD-AMP contributes to both the future wet-lab investigations of
the innate structural properties of different antimicrobial peptides and build promising empirical
underpinnings for precise medicine with antibiotics.

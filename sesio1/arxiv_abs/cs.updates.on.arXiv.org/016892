The commercialization of Cloud-RAN, and Open-RAN in particular, is a key factor to enable 5G cell
densification, by providing lower cost and more agile deployment of small cells. In addition, the
adoption of MEC is important to support ultra-low latency and high reliability required by mission-critical
applications, which constitute a milestone of the 5G and beyond vision of a fully connected society.
However, connecting antenna site, C-RAN processing and MEC at low cost is challenging, as it requires
high-capacity, low latency connectivity delivered through a highly inter-connected topology.
While PON is being considered as a solution for providing low-cost connectivity to C-RAN, they only
allow data transmission from the endpoints (for example hosting RU at the antenna site) towards
a central node (e.g., the central office, hosting computing equipment), thus cannot support traffic
from RU towards MEC end nodes that could host DU and possibly CU and network core. This led to research
into the evolution of PON architectures with the ability to provide direct communications between
endpoints, thus supporting mesh traffic patterns required by MEC installations. In this context,
virtualization plays a key role in enabling efficient resource allocation (i.e. optical transmission
capacity) to endpoints, according to their communication patterns. In this article, we address
the challenge of dynamic allocation of virtual PON slices over mesh-PON architectures to support
C-RAN and MEC nodes. We make use of a mixed analytical-iterative model to compute optimal virtual
PON slice allocation, with the objective of minimizing the use of MEC node resources, while meeting
a target latency threshold (100 $\mu s$ in our scenario). Our method is particularly effective in
reducing computation time, enabling virtual PON slice allocation in timescales compatible with
real-time or near real-time operations.

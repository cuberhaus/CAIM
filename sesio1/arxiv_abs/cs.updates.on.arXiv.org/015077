Although data-driven fault diagnosis methods have been widely applied, massive labeled data are
required for model training. However, a difficulty of implementing this in real industries hinders
the application of these methods. Hence, an effective diagnostic approach that can work well in
such situation is urgently needed.In this study, a multi-stage semi-supervised improved deep
embedded clustering (MS-SSIDEC) method, which combines semi-supervised learning with improved
deep embedded clustering (IDEC), is proposed to jointly explore scarce labeled data and massive
unlabeled data. In the first stage, a skip-connection-based convolutional auto-encoder (SCCAE)
that can automatically map the unlabeled data into a low-dimensional feature space is proposed
and pre-trained to be a fault feature extractor. In the second stage, a semi-supervised improved
deep embedded clustering (SSIDEC) network is proposed for clustering. It is first initialized
with available labeled data and then used to simultaneously optimize the clustering label assignment
and make the feature space to be more clustering-friendly. To tackle the phenomenon of overfitting,
virtual adversarial training (VAT) is introduced as a regularization term in this stage. In the
third stage, pseudo labels are obtained by the high-quality results of SSIDEC. The labeled dataset
can be augmented by these pseudo-labeled data and then leveraged to train a bearing fault diagnosis
model. Two public datasets of vibration data from rolling bearings are used to evaluate the performance
of the proposed method. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves a promising
performance in both semi-supervised and unsupervised fault diagnosis tasks. This method provides
a new approach for fault diagnosis under the situation of limited labeled samples by effectively
exploring unsupervised data.

This paper presents a new Metacognitive Decision Making (MDM) framework inspired by human-like
metacognitive principles. The MDM framework is incorporated in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
deployed for decentralized stochastic search without communication for detecting stationary
targets (fixed/sudden pop-up) and dynamic targets. The UAVs are equipped with multiple sensors
(varying sensing capability) and search for targets in a largely unknown area. The MDM framework
consists of a metacognitive component and a self-cognitive component. The metacognitive component
helps to self-regulate the search with multiple sensors addressing the issues of "which-sensor-to-use",
"when-to-switch-sensor", and "how-to-search". Each sensor possesses inverse characteristics
for the sensing attributes like sensing range and accuracy. Based on the information gathered by
multiple sensors carried by each UAV, the self-cognitive component regulates different levels
of stochastic search and switching levels for effective searching. The lower levels of search aim
to localize the search space for the possible presence of a target (detection) with different sensors.
The highest level of a search exploits the search space for target confirmation using the sensor
with the highest accuracy among all sensors. The performance of the MDM framework with two sensors
having low accuracy with wide range sensor for detection and increased accuracy with low range sensor
for confirmation is evaluated through Monte-Carlo simulations and compared with six multi-UAV
stochastic search algorithms (three self-cognitive searches and three self and social-cognitive
based search). The results indicate that the MDM framework is efficient in detecting and confirming
targets in an unknown environment.

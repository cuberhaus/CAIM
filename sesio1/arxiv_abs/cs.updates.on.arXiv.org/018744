Infectious diseases remain among the top contributors to human illness and death worldwide, among
which many diseases produce epidemic waves of infection. The unavailability of specific drugs
and ready-to-use vaccines to prevent most of these epidemics makes the situation worse. These force
public health officials and policymakers to rely on early warning systems generated by reliable
and accurate forecasts of epidemics. Accurate forecasts of epidemics can assist stakeholders
in tailoring countermeasures, such as vaccination campaigns, staff scheduling, and resource
allocation, to the situation at hand, which could translate to reductions in the impact of a disease.
Unfortunately, most of these past epidemics exhibit nonlinear and non-stationary characteristics
due to their spreading fluctuations based on seasonal-dependent variability and the nature of
these epidemics. We analyse a wide variety of epidemic time series datasets using a maximal overlap
discrete wavelet transform (MODWT) based autoregressive neural network and call it EWNet model.
MODWT techniques effectively characterize non-stationary behavior and seasonal dependencies
in the epidemic time series and improve the nonlinear forecasting scheme of the autoregressive
neural network in the proposed ensemble wavelet network framework. From a nonlinear time series
viewpoint, we explore the asymptotic stationarity of the proposed EWNet model to show the asymptotic
behavior of the associated Markov Chain. We also theoretically investigate the effect of learning
stability and the choice of hidden neurons in the proposal. From a practical perspective, we compare
our proposed EWNet framework with several statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models.
Experimental results show that the proposed EWNet is highly competitive compared to the state-of-the-art
epidemic forecasting methods.

Cryptocurrencies are poised to revolutionize the modern economy by democratizing commerce. These
currencies operate on top of blockchain-based distributed ledgers. Existing permissionless
blockchain-based protocols offer unparalleled benefits like decentralization, anonymity,
and transparency. However, these protocols suffer in performance which hinders their widespread
adoption. In particular, high time-to-finality and low transaction rates keep them from replacing
centralized payment systems such as the Visa network. Permissioned blockchain protocols offer
attractive performance guarantees, but they are not considered suitable for deploying decentralized
cryptocurrencies due to their centralized nature. Researchers have developed several multi-layered
blockchain protocols that combine both permissioned and permissionless blockchain protocols
to achieve high performance along with decentralization. The key idea with existing layered blockchain
protocols in literature is to divide blockchain operations into two layers and use different types
of blockchain protocols to manage each layer. However, many such works come with the assumptions
of honest majority which may not accurately reflect the real world where the participants may be
self-interested or rational. These assumptions may render the protocols susceptible to security
threats in the real world, as highlighted by the literature focused on exploring game-theoretic
attacks on these protocols. We generalize the "layered" approach taken by existing protocols in
the literature and present a framework to analyze the system in the BAR Model and provide a generalized
game-theoretic analysis of such protocols. Using our analysis, we identify the critical system
parameters required for a distributed ledger's secure operation in a more realistic setting.

Now-a-days, \emph{Online Social Networks} have been predominantly used by commercial houses
for viral marketing where the goal is to maximize profit. In this paper, we study the problem of Profit
Maximization in the two\mbox{-}phase setting. The input to the problem is a \emph{social network}
where the users are associated with a cost and benefit value, and a fixed amount of budget splitted
into two parts. Here, the cost and the benefit associated with a node signify its incentive demand
and the amount of benefit that can be earned by influencing that user, respectively. The goal of this
problem is to find out the optimal seed sets for both phases such that the aggregated profit at the
end of the diffusion process is maximized. First, we develop a mathematical model based on the \emph{Independent
Cascade Model} of diffusion that captures the aggregated profit in an \emph{expected} sense. Subsequently,
we show that selecting an optimal seed set for the first phase even considering the optimal seed set
for the second phase can be selected efficiently, is an $\textsf{NP}$-Hard Problem. Next, we propose
two solution methodologies, namely the \emph{single greedy} and the \emph{double greedy} approach
for our problem that works based on marginal gain computation. A detailed analysis of both methodologies
has been done to understand their time and space requirements. We perform an extensive set of experiments
to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approaches with real-world datasets.
From the experiments, we observe that the proposed solution approaches lead to more profit compared
to the baseline methods and in particular, the double greedy approach leads to up to $5 \%$ improvement
compared to its single\mbox{-}phase counterpart.

Traffic time series forecasting is challenging due to complex spatio-temporal dynamics time series
from different locations often have distinct patterns; and for the same time series, patterns may
vary across time, where, for example, there exist certain periods across a day showing stronger
temporal correlations. Although recent forecasting models, in particular deep learning based
models, show promising results, they suffer from being spatio-temporal agnostic. Such spatio-temporal
agnostic models employ a shared parameter space irrespective of the time series locations and the
time periods and they assume that the temporal patterns are similar across locations and do not evolve
across time, which may not always hold, thus leading to sub-optimal results. In this work, we propose
a framework that aims at turning spatio-temporal agnostic models to spatio-temporal aware models.
To do so, we encode time series from different locations into stochastic variables, from which we
generate location-specific and time-varying model parameters to better capture the spatio-temporal
dynamics. We show how to integrate the framework with canonical attentions to enable spatio-temporal
aware attentions. Next, to compensate for the additional overhead introduced by the spatio-temporal
aware model parameter generation process, we propose a novel window attention scheme, which helps
reduce the complexity from quadratic to linear, making spatio-temporal aware attentions also
have competitive efficiency. We show strong empirical evidence on four traffic time series datasets,
where the proposed spatio-temporal aware attentions outperform state-of-the-art methods in
term of accuracy and efficiency. This is an extended version of "Towards Spatio-Temporal Aware
Traffic Time Series Forecasting", to appear in ICDE 2022 [1], including additional experimental
results.

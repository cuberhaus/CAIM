Purpose: Hard-to-interpret Black-box Machine Learning (ML) were often used for early Alzheimer's
Disease (AD) detection. Methods: To interpret eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest
(RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) black-box models a workflow based on Shapley values was developed.
All models were trained on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset and
evaluated for an independent ADNI test set, as well as the external Australian Imaging and Lifestyle
flagship study of Ageing (AIBL), and Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) datasets. Shapley
values were compared to intuitively interpretable Decision Trees (DTs), and Logistic Regression
(LR), as well as natural and permutation feature importances. To avoid the reduction of the explanation
validity caused by correlated features, forward selection and aspect consolidation were implemented.
Results: Some black-box models outperformed DTs and LR. The forward-selected features correspond
to brain areas previously associated with AD. Shapley values identified biologically plausible
associations with moderate to strong correlations with feature importances. The most important
RF features to predict AD conversion were the volume of the amygdalae, and a cognitive test score.
Good cognitive test performances and large brain volumes decreased the AD risk. The models trained
using cognitive test scores significantly outperformed brain volumetric models ($p<0.05$).
Cognitive Normal (CN) vs. AD models were successfully transferred to external datasets. Conclusion:
In comparison to previous work, improved performances for ADNI and AIBL were achieved for CN vs.
Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) classification using brain volumes. The Shapley values and the
feature importances showed moderate to strong correlations.

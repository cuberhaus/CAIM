The text-based speech editor allows the editing of speech through intuitive cutting, copying,
and pasting operations to speed up the process of editing speech. However, the major drawback of
current systems is that edited speech often sounds unnatural due to cut-copy-paste operation.
In addition, it is not obvious how to synthesize records according to a new word not appearing in the
transcript. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end text-based speech editing method called context-aware
mask prediction network (CampNet). The model can simulate the text-based speech editing process
by randomly masking part of speech and then predicting the masked region by sensing the speech context.
It can solve unnatural prosody in the edited region and synthesize the speech corresponding to the
unseen words in the transcript. Secondly, for the possible operation of text-based speech editing,
we design three text-based operations based on CampNet: deletion, insertion, and replacement.
These operations can cover various situations of speech editing. Thirdly, to synthesize the speech
corresponding to long text in insertion and replacement operations, a word-level autoregressive
generation method is proposed. Fourthly, we propose a speaker adaptation method using only one
sentence for CampNet and explore the ability of few-shot learning based on CampNet, which provides
a new idea for speech forgery tasks. The subjective and objective experiments on VCTK and LibriTTS
datasets show that the speech editing results based on CampNet are better than TTS technology, manual
editing, and VoCo method. We also conduct detailed ablation experiments to explore the effect of
the CampNet structure on its performance. Finally, the experiment shows that speaker adaptation
with only one sentence can further improve the naturalness of speech. Examples of generated speech

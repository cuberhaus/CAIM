Network neutrality is related to the non-discriminatory treatment of packets on the Internet.
Any deliberate discrimination of traffic of one application while favoring others violates the
principle of neutrality. Many countries have enforced laws against such discrimination. To enforce
such laws, one requires tools to detect any net neutrality violations. However, detecting such
violations is challenging as it is hard to separate any degradation in quality due to natural network
effects and selective degradation. Also, legitimate traffic management and deliberate discrimination
methods can be technically the same, making it further challenging to distinguish them. We developed
an end-to-end measurement framework named FairNet to detect discrimination of traffic. It compares
the performance of similar services. Our focus is on HTTPS streaming services which constitute
a predominant portion of the Internet traffic. The effect of confounding factors (congestion,
traffic management policy, dynamic rate adaptation) is made `similar' on the test services to ensure
a fair comparison. FairNet framework uses a ``replay server'' and user-client that exchanges correctly
identifiable traffic streams over the Internet. The Server Name Indication (SNI) field in the TLS
handshake, which goes in plaintext, ensures that the traffic from the replay server appears to network
middle-boxes as that coming from its actual server. We validated that appropriate SNIs results
in the correct classification of services using a commercial traffic shaper. FairNet uses two novel
algorithms based on application-level throughput and connection status to detect traffic discrimination.
We also validated the methodology's effectiveness by collecting network logs through mobile apps
over the live Internet and analyzing them.

Unclonable encryption, introduced by Broadbent and Lord (TQC'20), is an encryption scheme with
the following attractive feature: given a ciphertext, an adversary cannot create two ciphertexts
both of which decrypt to the same message as the original ciphertext. We revisit this notion and show
the following: - Reusability: The constructions proposed by Broadbent and Lord have the disadvantage
that they either guarantee one-time security (that is, the encryption key can only be used once to
encrypt the message) in the plain model or they guaranteed security in the random oracle model. We
construct unclonable encryption schemes with semantic security. We present two constructions
(for public-key and private-key settings) from minimal cryptographic assumptions. - Lower Bound
and Generalized Construction: We revisit the information-theoretic one-time secure construction
of Broadbent and Lord. The success probability of the adversary in their construction was guaranteed
to be $0.85^n$, where $n$ is the length of the message. It was interesting to understand whether the
ideal success probability of (negligibly close to) $0.5^n$ was unattainable. We generalize their
construction to be based on a broader class of monogamy of entanglement games. We demonstrate a simple
cloning attack that succeeds with probability $0.71^n$ against a class of schemes including that
of Broadbent and Lord. We also present a $0.75^n$ cloning attack exclusively against their scheme.
- Implication to Copy-Protection: We show that unclonable encryption, satisfying a stronger property,
called unclonable-indistinguishability (defined by Broadbent and Lord), implies copy-protection
for a simple class of unlearnable functions. While we currently don't have encryption schemes satisfying
this stronger property, this implication demonstrates a new path to construct copy-protection.

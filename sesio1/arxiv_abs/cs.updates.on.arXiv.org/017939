The hazard and operability analysis (HAZOP) report contains precious industrial safety knowledge
(ISK) with expert experience and process nature, which is of great significance to the development
of industrial intelligence. Subject to the attributes of ISK, existing researches mine them through
sequence labeling in deep learning. Yet, there are two thorny issues: (1) Uneven distribution of
ISK and (2) Consistent importance of ISK: for safety review. In this study, we propose a novel generative
mining strategy called CRGM to explore ISK. Inspired Zipf law in linguistics, CRGM consists of common-rare
discriminator, induction-extension generator and ISK extractor. Firstly, the common-rare discriminator
divides HAZOP descriptions into common words and rare words, and obtains the common description
and the rare description, where the latter contains more industrial substances. Then, they are
operated by the induction-extension generator in the way of deep text generation, the common description
is induced and the rare description is extended, the material knowledge and the equipment knowledge
can be enriched. Finally, the ISK extractor processes the material knowledge and equipment knowledge
from the generated description through the rule template method, the additional ISK is regarded
as the supplement of the training set to train the proposed sequence labeling model. We conduct multiple
evaluation experiments on two industrial safety datasets. The results show that CRGM has promising
and gratifying aptitudes, greatly improves the performance of the model, and is efficient and generalized.
Our sequence labeling model also shows the expected performance, which is better than the existing
research. Our research provides a new perspective for exploring ISK, we hope it can contribute support
for the intelligent progress of industrial safety.

In next-generation wireless networks, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) systems are foreseeable to support a large number of antennas at the transceiver
as well as a large number of reflecting elements at the RIS. To fully unleash the potential of RIS,
the phase shifts of RIS elements should be carefully designed, resulting in a high-dimensional
non-convex optimization problem that is hard to solve with affordable computational complexity.
In this paper, we address this scalability issue by partitioning RIS into sub-surfaces, so as to
optimize the phase shifts in sub-surface levels to reduce complexity. Specifically, each sub-surface
employs a linear phase variation structure to anomalously reflect the incident signal to a desired
direction, and the sizes of sub-surfaces can be adaptively adjusted according to channel conditions.
We formulate the achievable rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the transmit covariance
matrix and the RIS phase shifts. Then, we characterize the asymptotic behavior of the system with
an infinitely large number of transceiver antennas and RIS elements. The asymptotic analysis provides
useful insights on the understanding of the fundamental performance-complexity tradeoff in RIS
partitioning design. We show that the achievable rate maximization problem has a rather simple
form in the asymptotic regime, and we develop an efficient algorithm to find the optimal solution
via one-dimensional (1D) search. Moreover, we discuss the insights and impacts of the asymptotically
optimal solution on finite-size system design. By applying the asymptotic result to a finite-size
system with necessary modifications, we show by numerical results that the proposed design achieves
a favorable tradeoff between system performance and computational complexity.

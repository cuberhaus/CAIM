Common AI music composition algorithms based on artificial neural networks are to train a machine
by feeding a large number of music pieces and create artificial neural networks that can produce
music similar to the input music data. This approach is a blackbox optimization, that is, the underlying
composition algorithm is, in general, not known to users. In this paper, we present a way of machine
composition that trains a machine the composition principle embedded in the given music data instead
of directly feeding music pieces. We propose this approach by using the concept of {\color{black}{Overlap}}
matrix proposed in \cite{TPJ}. In \cite{TPJ}, a type of Korean music, so-called the {\it Dodeuri}
music such as Suyeonjangjigok has been analyzed using topological data analysis (TDA), particularly
using persistent homology. As the raw music data is not suitable for TDA analysis, the music data
is first reconstructed as a graph. The node of the graph is defined as a two-dimensional vector composed
of the pitch and duration of each music note. The edge between two nodes is created when those nodes
appear consecutively in the music flow. Distance is defined based on the frequency of such appearances.
Through TDA on the constructed graph, a unique set of cycles is found for the given music. In \cite{TPJ},
the new concept of the {\it {\color{black}{Overlap}} matrix} has been proposed, which visualizes
how those cycles are interconnected over the music flow, in a matrix form. In this paper, we explain
how we use the {\color{black}{Overlap}} matrix for machine composition. The {\color{black}{Overlap}}
matrix makes it possible to compose a new music piece algorithmically and also provide a seed music
towards the desired artificial neural network. In this paper, we use the {\it Dodeuri} music and
explain detailed steps.

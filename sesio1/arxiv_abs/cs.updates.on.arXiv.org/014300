Undirected graphs are frequently used to model networks. The topology of an undirected graph G can
be captured by an adjacency matrix; this matrix in turn can be visualized directly to give insight
into the graph structure. Which visual patterns appear in such a matrix visualization depends on
the ordering of its rows and columns. Formally defining the quality of an ordering and then automatically
computing a high-quality ordering are both challenging problems; however, effective heuristics
exist and are used in practice. Often, graphs exist as part of a collection of graphs on the same set
of vertices. To visualize such graph collections, we need a single ordering that works well for all
matrices simultaneously. The current state-of-the-art solves this problem by taking a (weighted)
union over all graphs and applying existing heuristics. However, this union leads to a loss of information,
specifically in those parts of the graphs which are different. We propose a collection-aware approach
to avoid this loss of information and apply it to two popular heuristic methods: leaf order and barycenter.
The de-facto standard computational quality metrics for matrix ordering capture only block-diagonal
patterns (cliques). Instead, we propose to use Moran's I, a spatial auto-correlation metric, which
captures the full range of established patterns. The popular leaf order method heuristically optimizes
a similar measure which supports the use of Moran's I in this context. We evaluated our methods for
simultaneous orderings on real-world datasets using Moran's I as the quality metric. Our results
show that our collection-aware approach matches or improves performance compared to the union
approach, depending on the similarity of the graphs in the collection. Specifically, our Moran's
I-based collection-aware leaf order implementation consistently outperforms other implementations.

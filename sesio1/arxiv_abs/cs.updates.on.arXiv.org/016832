Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are complex, non-linear, and non-stationary in nature. However,
previous studies that applied decomposition to minimize the complexity mainly exploited the hand-engineering
features, limiting the information learned in EEG decoding. Therefore, extracting additional
primary features from different disassembled components to improve the EEG-based recognition
performance remains challenging. On the other hand, attempts have been made to use a single model
to learn the hand-engineering features. Less work has been done to improve the generalization ability
through ensemble learning. In this work, we propose a novel decomposition-based hybrid ensemble
convolutional neural network (CNN) framework to enhance the capability of decoding EEG signals.
CNNs, in particular, automatically learn the primary features from raw disassembled components
but not handcraft features. The first option is to fuse the obtained score before the Softmax layer
and execute back-propagation on the entire ensemble network, whereas the other is to fuse the probability
output of the Softmax layer. Moreover, a component-specific batch normalization (CSBN) layer
is employed to reduce subject variability. Against the challenging cross-subject driver fatigue-related
situation awareness (SA) recognition task, eight models are proposed under the framework, which
all showed superior performance than the strong baselines. The performance of different decomposition
methods and ensemble modes were further compared. Results indicated that discrete wavelet transform
(DWT)-based ensemble CNN achieves the best 82.11% among the proposed models. Our framework can
be simply extended to any CNN architecture and applied in any EEG-related sectors, opening the possibility
of extracting more preliminary information from complex EEG data.

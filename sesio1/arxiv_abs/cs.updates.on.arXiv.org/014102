Among the biggest challenges we face in utilizing neural networks trained on waveform data (i.e.,
seismic, electromagnetic, or ultrasound) is its application to real data. The requirement for
accurate labels forces us to develop solutions using synthetic data, where labels are readily available.
However, synthetic data often do not capture the reality of the field/real experiment, and we end
up with poor performance of the trained neural network (NN) at the inference stage. We describe a
novel approach to enhance supervised training on synthetic data with real data features (domain
adaptation). Specifically, for tasks in which the absolute values of the vertical axis (time or
depth) of the input data are not crucial, like classification, or can be corrected afterward, like
velocity model building using a well-log, we suggest a series of linear operations on the input so
the training and application data have similar distributions. This is accomplished by applying
two operations on the input data to the NN model: 1) The crosscorrelation of the input data (i.e.,
shot gather, seismic image, etc.) with a fixed reference trace from the same dataset. 2) The convolution
of the resulting data with the mean (or a random sample) of the autocorrelated data from another domain.
In the training stage, the input data are from the synthetic domain and the auto-correlated data
are from the real domain, and random samples from real data are drawn at every training epoch. In the
inference/application stage, the input data are from the real subset domain and the mean of the autocorrelated
sections are from the synthetic data subset domain. Example applications on passive seismic data
for microseismic event source location determination and active seismic data for predicting low
frequencies are used to demonstrate the power of this approach in improving the applicability of
trained models to real data.

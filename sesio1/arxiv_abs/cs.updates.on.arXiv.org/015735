Reminiscence therapy is an inexpensive non-pharmacological therapy commonly used due to its therapeutic
value for PwD, as it can be used to promote independence, positive moods and behavior, and improve
their quality of life. Caregivers are one of the main pillars in the adoption of digital technologies
for reminiscence therapy, as they are responsible for its administration. Despite their comprehensive
understanding of the needs and difficulties associated with the therapy, their perspective has
not been fully taken into account in the development of existing technological solutions. To inform
the design of technological solutions within dementia care, we followed a user-centered design
approach through worldwide surveys, follow-up semi-structured interviews, and focus groups.
Seven hundred and seven informal and 52 formal caregivers participated in our study. Our findings
show that technological solutions must provide mechanisms to carry out the therapy in a simple way,
reducing the amount of work for caregivers when preparing and conducting therapy sessions. They
should also diversify and personalize the current session (and following ones) based on both the
biographical information of the PwD and their emotional reactions. This is particularly important
since the PwD often become agitated, aggressive or angry, and caregivers might not know how to properly
deal with this situation (in particular, the informal ones). Additionally, formal caregivers
need an easy way to manage information of the different PwD they take care of, and consult the history
of sessions performed (in particular, to identify images that triggered negative emotional reactions,
and consult any notes taken about them). As a result, we present a list of validated functional requirements
gathered for the PwD and both formal and informal caregivers, as well as the corresponding expected
primary and secondary outcomes.

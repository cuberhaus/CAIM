Methods for upwinding the potential vorticity in a finite element discretisation of the rotating
shallow water equations are studied. These include the well-known anticipated potential vorticity
method (APVM), streamwise upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) method, and a recent approach where the
trial functions are evaluated downstream within the reference element. In all cases the upwinding
scheme conserves both potential vorticity and energy, since the antisymmetric structure of the
equations is preserved. The APVM leads to a symmetric definite correction to the potential enstrophy
that is dissipative and inconsistent, resulting in a turbulent state where the potential enstrophy
is more strongly damped than for the other schemes. While the SUPG scheme is widely known to be consistent,
since it modifies the test functions only, the downwinded trial function formulation results in
the advection of downwind corrections. Results of the SUPG and downwinded trial function schemes
are very similar in terms of both potential enstrophy conservation and turbulent spectra. The main
difference between these schemes is in the energy conservation and residual errors. If just two
nonlinear iterations are applied then the energy conservation errors are greatly improved for
the downwinded trial function formulation, reflecting a smaller residual error than for the SUPG
scheme. We also present a formulation by which potential enstrophy is exactly conserved in time.
The application of the APVM with exact temporal conservation of potential enstrophy yields conservation
errors that are significantly smaller than those of the SUPG or downwinded trial function formulations
using a potential enstrophy dissipating time discretisation. Exact conservation of the potential
enstrophy in time allows for stable simulation in the absence of dissipation, despite the uncontrolled
aliasing of grid scale turbulence.

The mortality of lung cancer has ranked high among cancers for many years. Early detection of lung
cancer is critical for disease prevention, cure, and mortality rate reduction. However, existing
detection methods on pulmonary nodules introduce an excessive number of false positive proposals
in order to achieve high sensitivity, which is not practical in clinical situations. In this paper,
we propose the multi-head detection and spatial squeeze-and-attention network, MHSnet, to detect
pulmonary nodules, in order to aid doctors in the early diagnosis of lung cancers. Specifically,
we first introduce multi-head detectors and skip connections to customize for the variety of nodules
in sizes, shapes and types and capture multi-scale features. Then, we implement a spatial attention
module to enable the network to focus on different regions differently inspired by how experienced
clinicians screen CT images, which results in fewer false positive proposals. Lastly, we present
a lightweight but effective false positive reduction module with the Linear Regression model to
cut down the number of false positive proposals, without any constraints on the front network. Extensive
experimental results compared with the state-of-the-art models have shown the superiority of
the MHSnet in terms of the average FROC, sensitivity and especially false discovery rate (2.98%
and 2.18% improvement in terms of average FROC and sensitivity, 5.62% and 28.33% decrease in terms
of false discovery rate and average candidates per scan). The false positive reduction module significantly
decreases the average number of candidates generated per scan by 68.11% and the false discovery
rate by 13.48%, which is promising to reduce distracted proposals for the downstream tasks based
on the detection results.

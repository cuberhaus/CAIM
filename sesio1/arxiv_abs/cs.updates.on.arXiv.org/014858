An architecture consisting of a serial coupling of the one-dimensional convolutional neural network
(1D-CNN) and the long short-term memory (LSTM) network, which is referred as CNNsLSTM, was proposed
for hourly-scale rainfall-runoff modeling in this study. In CNNsLTSM, the CNN component receives
the hourly meteorological time series data for a long duration, and then the LSTM component receives
the extracted features from 1D-CNN and the hourly meteorological time series data for a short-duration.
As a case study, CNNsLSTM was implemented for hourly rainfall-runoff modeling at the Ishikari River
watershed, Japan. The meteorological dataset, consists of precipitation, air temperature, evapotranspiration,
and long- and short-wave radiation, were utilized as input, and the river flow was used as the target
data. To evaluate the performance of proposed CNNsLSTM, results of CNNsLSTM were compared with
those of 1D-CNN, LSTM only with hourly inputs (LSTMwHour), parallel architecture of 1D-CNN and
LSTM (CNNpLSTM), and the LSTM architecture which uses both daily and hourly input data (LSTMwDpH).
CNNsLSTM showed clear improvements on the estimation accuracy compared to the three conventional
architectures (1D-CNN, LSTMwHour, and CNNpLSTM), and recently proposed LSTMwDpH. In comparison
to observed flows, the median of the NSE values for the test period are 0.455-0.469 for 1D-CNN (based
on NCHF=8, 16, and 32, the numbers of the channels of the feature map of the first layer of CNN), 0.639-0.656
for CNNpLSTM (based on NCHF=8, 16, and 32), 0.745 for LSTMwHour, 0.831 for LSTMwDpH, and 0.865-0.873
for CNNsLSTM (based on NCHF=8, 16, and 32). Furthermore, the proposed CNNsLSTM reduces the median
RMSE of 1D-CNN by 50.2%-51.4%, CNNpLSTM by 37.4%-40.8%, LSTMwHour by 27.3%-29.5%, and LSTMwDpH
by 10.6%-13.4%.

The first-order logical environment {\ttfamily FOLE} provides a rigorous and principled approach
to distributed interoperable first-order information systems. {\ttfamily FOLE} has been developed
in two forms: a classification form and an interpretation form. Two papers represent {\ttfamily
FOLE} in a classification form corresponding to ideas of the Information Flow Framework discussed
in (Kent~\cite{kent:sem:integ:iff:iswc2003}~\cite{kent:sem:integ:iff:dsp04391}) and
(IFF~\cite{iff}): the first paper (Kent~\cite{kent:fole:era:found}) provides a foundation
that connects elements of the {\ttfamily ERA} data model (Chen) with components of the first-order
logical environment {\ttfamily FOLE}; the second paper (Kent \cite{kent:fole:era:supstruc})
provides a superstructure that extends {\ttfamily FOLE} to the formalisms of first-order logic.
The formalisms in the classification form of {\ttfamily FOLE} provide an appropriate framework
for developing the \textbf{relational calculus}. Two other papers represent {\ttfamily FOLE}
in an interpretation form: the first paper (Kent \cite{kent:fole:era:tbl}) develops the notion
of the \texttt{FOLE} table following the relational model (Codd); the second paper (Kent \cite{kent:fole:era:db})
discusses the notion of a \texttt{FOLE} relational database. All the operations of the relational
algebra have been rigorously developed (Kent \cite{kent:fole:rel:ops}) using the interpretation
form of {\ttfamily FOLE}. The present study demonstrates that the classification form of {\ttfamily
FOLE} is informationally equivalent to the interpretation form of {\ttfamily FOLE}. In general,
the {\ttfamily FOLE} representation uses a conceptual structures approach, that is completely
compatible with formal concept analysis (Ganter and Wille) and information flow (Barwise and Seligman).

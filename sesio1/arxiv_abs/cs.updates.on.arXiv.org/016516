Supporting public health research and the public's situational awareness during a pandemic requires
continuous dissemination of infectious disease surveillance data. Legislation, such as the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and recent state-level regulations,
permits sharing de-identified person-level data; however, current de-identification approaches
are limited. namely, they are inefficient, relying on retrospective disclosure risk assessments,
and do not flex with changes in infection rates or population demographics over time. In this paper,
we introduce a framework to dynamically adapt de-identification for near-real time sharing of
person-level surveillance data. The framework leverages a simulation mechanism, capable of application
at any geographic level, to forecast the re-identification risk of sharing the data under a wide
range of generalization policies. The estimates inform weekly, prospective policy selection
to maintain the proportion of records corresponding to a group size less than 11 (PK11) at or below
0.1. Fixing the policy at the start of each week facilitates timely dataset updates and supports
sharing granular date information. We use August 2020 through October 2021 case data from Johns
Hopkins University and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in maintaining the PK!1 threshold of 0.01. When sharing COVID-19 county-level case
data across all US counties, the framework's approach meets the threshold for 96.2% of daily data
releases, while a policy based on current de-identification techniques meets the threshold for
32.3%. Periodically adapting the data publication policies preserves privacy while enhancing
public health utility through timely updates and sharing epidemiologically critical features.

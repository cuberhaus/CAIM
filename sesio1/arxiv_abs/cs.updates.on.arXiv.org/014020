High-throughput satellite communications systems are growing in strategic importance thanks
to their role in delivering broadband services to mobile platforms and residences and/or businesses
in rural and remote regions globally. Although precoding has emerged as a prominent technique to
meet ever-increasing user demands, there is a lack of studies dealing with congestion control.
This paper enhances the performance of multi-beam high throughput geostationary (GEO) satellite
systems under congestion, where the users' quality of service (QoS) demands cannot be fully satisfied
with limited resources. In particular, we propose congestion control strategies, relying on simple
power control schemes. We formulate a multi-objective optimization framework balancing the system
sum-rate and the number of users satisfying their QoS requirements. Next, we propose two novel approaches
that effectively handle the proposed multi-objective optimization problem. The former is a model-based
approach that relies on the weighted sum method to enrich the number of satisfied users by solving
a series of the sum-rate optimization problems in an iterative manner. Meanwhile, the latter is
a data-driven approach that offers a low-cost solution by utilizing supervised learning and exploiting
the optimization structures as continuous mappings. The proposed general framework is evaluated
for different linear precoding techniques, for which the low computational complexity algorithms
are designed. Numerical results manifest that our proposed framework effectively handles the
congestion issue and brings superior improvements of rate satisfaction to many users than previous
works. Furthermore, the proposed algorithms show low run-time, which make them realistic for practical
systems.

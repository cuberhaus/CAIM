While various covert botnets were proposed in the past, they still lack complete anonymization
for their servers/botmasters or suffer from slow communication between the botmaster and the bots.
In this paper, we first propose a new generation hybrid botnet that covertly and efficiently communicates
over Bitcoin Lightning Network (LN), called LNBot. Exploiting various anonymity features of LN,
we show the feasibility of a scalable two-layer botnet which completely anonymizes the identity
of the botmaster. In the first layer, the botmaster anonymously sends the commands to the command
and control (C&C) servers through regular LN payments. Specifically, LNBot allows botmaster's
commands to be sent in the form of surreptitious multi-hop LN payments, where the commands are either
encoded with the payments or attached to the payments to provide covert communications. In the second
layer, C&C servers further relay those commands to the bots in their mini-botnets to launch any type
of attacks to victim machines. We further improve on this design by introducing D-LNBot; a distributed
version of LNBot that generates its C&C servers by infecting users on the Internet and forms the C&C
connections by opening channels to the existing nodes on LN. In contrary to the LNBot, the whole botnet
formation phase is distributed and the botmaster is never involved in the process. By utilizing
Bitcoin's Testnet and the new message attachment feature of LN, we show that D-LNBot can be run for
free and commands are propagated faster to all the C&C servers compared to LNBot. We presented proof-of-concept
implementations for both LNBot and D-LNBot on the actual LN and extensively analyzed their delay
and cost performance. Finally, we also provide and discuss a list of potential countermeasures
to detect LNBot and D-LNBot activities and minimize their impacts.

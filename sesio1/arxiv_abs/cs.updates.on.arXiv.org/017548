There is an urgent need for streamlining radiology Quality Assurance (QA) programs to make them
better and faster. Here, we present a novel approach, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Based QUality
Assurance by Restricted Investigation of Unequal Scores (AQUARIUS), for re-defining radiology
QA, which reduces human effort by up to several orders of magnitude over existing approaches. AQUARIUS
typically includes automatic comparison of AI-based image analysis with natural language processing
(NLP) on radiology reports. Only the usually small subset of cases with discordant reads is subsequently
reviewed by human experts. To demonstrate the clinical applicability of AQUARIUS, we performed
a clinical QA study on Intracranial Hemorrhage (ICH) detection in 1936 head CT scans from a large
academic hospital. Immediately following image acquisition, scans were automatically analyzed
for ICH using a commercially available software (Aidoc, Tel Aviv, Israel). Cases rated positive
for ICH by AI (ICH-AI+) were automatically flagged in radiologists' reading worklists, where flagging
was randomly switched off with probability 50\%. Using AQUARIUS with NLP on final radiology reports
and targeted expert neuroradiology review of only 29 discordantly classified cases reduced the
human QA effort by 98.5\%, where we found a total of six non-reported true ICH+ cases, with radiologists'
missed ICH detection rates of 0.52\% and 2.5\% for flagged and non-flagged cases, respectively.
We conclude that AQUARIUS, by combining AI-based image analysis with NLP-based pre-selection
of cases for targeted human expert review, can efficiently identify missed findings in radiology
studies and significantly expedite radiology QA programs in a hybrid human-machine interoperability
approach.

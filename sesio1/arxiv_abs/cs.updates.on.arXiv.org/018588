Topologically interlocked structures are architectured by fitting together blocks that are constrained
geometrically through contact and friction by their neighboring blocks. As long as the frictional
strength is nowhere exceeded, the blocks stick against each other, allowing for large rotations.
Once the interfacial stresses exceed the frictional strength, relative sliding between the blocks
alters the structure's mechanical response. Improving the structural performance, precisely
the strength and the toughness, has been one of the main focal points in the literature. However,
many fundamental questions regarding the role and effect of the interface mechanisms (stick and
slip) and rotation of the blocks have not been addressed yet. Here, we carry out a parametric analysis
to understand the effect of Young's modulus, friction coefficient and geometry of the blocks on
the dominance of the stick or slip governed mechanism. We combine analytical and computational
tools to analyze the failure mechanisms and the response capacities of beam-like topologically
interlocked structures. This is achieved using a finite element method coupled with a penalty-based
approach for enforcing contact constraints along interfaces. We show that the combination of the
structure's height and the friction coefficient controls whether the failure mechanism is slip-governed
or stick-governed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the sticking mechanism across all interfaces
along with the rotation of the blocks dictates a saturation level to the mechanical performance
of a given structure irrespective of geometric and material properties. This provides a theoretical
upper bound for the structural response of topologically interlocked structures, and establishes
a benchmark of achievable performance under idealistic conditions.

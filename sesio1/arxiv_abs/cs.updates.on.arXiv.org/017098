The lifestyles of urban dwellers could reveal important insights regarding the dynamics and complexity
of cities. Despite growing research on analysis of lifestyle patterns in cities, little is known
about the characteristics of people's lifestyles patterns at urban scale. This limitation is primarily
due to challenges in characterizing lifestyle patterns when human movement data is aggregated
to protect the privacy of users. In this study, we model cities based on aggregated human visitation
data to construct a network of places. We then examine the subgraph signatures in the networks of
places to map and characterize lifestyle patterns at city scale. Location-based data from Harris
County, Dallas County, New York County, and Broward County in the United States were examined to
reveal lifestyle signatures in cities. For the motif analysis, two-node, three-node, and four-node
motifs without location attributes were extracted from human visitation networks. Second, homogenized
nodes in motifs were encoded with location categories from NAICS codes. Multiple statistical measures,
including network metrics and motif properties, were quantified to characterize lifestyle signatures.
The results show that: people's lifestyles in urban environments can be well depicted and quantified
based on distribution and attributes of motifs in networks of places; motifs in networks of places
show stability in quantity and distance as well as periodicity on weekends and weekdays indicating
the stability of lifestyle patterns in cities; human visitation networks and lifestyle patterns
show similarities across different metropolitan areas implying the universality of lifestyle
signatures across cities. The findings provide deeper insights into urban lifestyles signatures
in urban studies and provide important insights for data-informed urban planning and management.

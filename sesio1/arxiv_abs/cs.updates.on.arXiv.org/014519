Requirements engineering is a discipline of software engineering that is concerned with the identification
and handling of user and system requirements. Aspect-Oriented Requirements Engineering (AORE)
extends the existing requirements engineering approaches to cope with the issue of tangling and
scattering resulted from crosscutting concerns. Crosscutting concerns are considered as potential
aspects and can lead to the phenomena tyranny of the dominant decomposition. Requirements-level
aspects are responsible for producing scattered and tangled descriptions of requirements in the
requirements document. Validation of requirements artefacts is an essential task in software
development. This task ensures that requirements are correct and valid in terms of completeness
and consistency, hence, reducing the development cost, maintenance and establish an approximately
correct estimate of effort and completion time of the project. In this paper, we present a validation
framework to validate the aspectual requirements and the crosscutting relationship of concerns
that are resulted from the requirements engineering phase. The proposed framework comprises a
high-level and low-level validation to implement on software requirements specification (SRS).
The high-level validation validates the concerns with stakeholders, whereas the low-level validation
validates the aspectual requirement by requirements engineers and analysts using a checklist.
The approach has been evaluated using an experimental study on two AORE approaches. The approaches
are viewpoint-based called AORE with ArCaDe and lexical analysis based on Theme/Doc approach.
The results obtained from the study demonstrate that the proposed framework is an effective validation
model for AORE artefacts.

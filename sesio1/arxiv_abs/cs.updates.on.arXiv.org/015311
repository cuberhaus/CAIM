In this paper, we propose PATO-a producibility-aware topology optimization (TO) framework to
help efficiently explore the design space of components fabricated using metal additive manufacturing
(AM), while ensuring manufacturability with respect to cracking. Specifically, parts fabricated
through Laser Powder Bed Fusion are prone to defects such as warpage or cracking due to high residual
stress values generated from the steep thermal gradients produced during the build process. Maturing
the design for such parts and planning their fabrication can span months to years, often involving
multiple handoffs between design and manufacturing engineers. PATO is based on the a priori discovery
of crack-free designs, so that the optimized part can be built defect-free at the outset. To ensure
that the design is crack free during optimization, producibility is explicitly encoded within
the standard formulation of TO, using a crack index. Multiple crack indices are explored and using
experimental validation, maximum shear strain index (MSSI) is shown to be an accurate crack index.
Simulating the build process is a coupled, multi-physics computation and incorporating it in the
TO loop can be computationally prohibitive. We leverage the current advances in deep convolutional
neural networks and present a high-fidelity surrogate model based on an Attention-based U-Net
architecture to predict the MSSI values as a spatially varying field over the part's domain. Further,
we employ automatic differentiation to directly compute the gradient of maximum MSSI with respect
to the input design variables and augment it with the performance-based sensitivity field to optimize
the design while considering the trade-off between weight, manufacturability, and functionality.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through benchmark studies in 3D as well
as experimental validation.

Since many safety-critical systems, such as surgical robots and autonomous driving cars operate
in unstable environments with sensor noise and incomplete data, it is desirable for object detectors
to take the localization uncertainty into account. However, there are several limitations of the
existing uncertainty estimation methods for anchor-based object detection. 1) They model the
uncertainty of the heterogeneous object properties with different characteristics and scales,
such as location (center point) and scale (width, height), which could be difficult to estimate.
2) They model box offsets as Gaussian distributions, which is not compatible with the ground truth
bounding boxes that follow the Dirac delta distribution. 3) Since anchor-based methods are sensitive
to anchor hyperparameters, the localization uncertainty for them could be also highly sensitive
to the choice of hyperparameters as well. To tackle these limitations, we propose a new localization
uncertainty estimation method called UAD for anchor-free object detection. Our method captures
the uncertainty in four directions of box offsets~(left, right, top, bottom) that are homogeneous,
so that it can tell which direction is uncertain, and provides a quantitative value of uncertainty
in $[0, 1]$. To enable such uncertainty estimation, we design a new uncertainty loss, negative power
log-likelihood loss, to measure the localization uncertainty by weighting the likelihood loss
by its IoU, which alleviates the model misspecification problem. Furthermore, we propose an uncertainty-aware
focal loss for reflecting the estimated uncertainty to the classification score. Experimental
results on COCO datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves FCOS, by up to 1.8 points,
without sacrificing computational efficiency.

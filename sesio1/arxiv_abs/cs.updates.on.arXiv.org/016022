Public opinion surveys constitute a powerful tool to study peoples' attitudes and behaviors in
comparative perspectives. However, even worldwide surveys provide only partial geographic and
time coverage, which hinders comprehensive knowledge production. To broaden the scope of comparison,
social scientists turn to ex-post harmonization of variables from datasets that cover similar
topics but in different populations and/or years. The resulting new datasets can be analyzed as
a single source, which can be flexibly accessed through many data portals. However, such portals
offer little guidance to explore the data in-depth or query data with user-customized needs. As
a result, it is still challenging for social scientists to efficiently identify related data for
their studies and evaluate their theoretical models based on the sliced data. To overcome them,
in the Survey Data Recycling (SDR) international cooperation research project, we propose SDRQuerier
and apply it to the harmonized SDR database, which features over two million respondents interviewed
in a total of 1,721 national surveys that are part of 22 well-known international projects. We design
the SDRQuerier to solve three practical challenges that social scientists routinely face. First,
a BERT-based model provides customized data queries through research questions or keywords. Second,
we propose a new visual design to showcase the availability of the harmonized data at different levels,
thus helping users decide if empirical data exist to address a given research question. Lastly,
SDRQuerier discloses the underlying relational patterns among substantive and methodological
variables in the database, to help social scientists rigorously evaluate or even improve their
regression models. Through case studies with multiple social scientists in solving their daily
challenges, we demonstrated the novelty, effectiveness of SDRQuerier.

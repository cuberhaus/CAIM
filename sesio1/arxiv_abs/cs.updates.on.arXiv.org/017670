Given a ground set of items, the result diversification problem aims to select a subset with high
"quality" and "diversity" while satisfying some constraints. It arises in various real-world
artificial intelligence applications, such as web-based search, document summarization and
feature selection, and also has applications in other areas, e.g., computational geometry, databases,
finance and operations research. Previous algorithms are mainly based on greedy or local search.
In this paper, we propose to reformulate the result diversification problem as a bi-objective maximization
problem, and solve it by a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (EA), i.e., the GSEMO. We theoretically
prove that the GSEMO can achieve the (asymptotically) optimal theoretical guarantees under both
static and dynamic environments. For cardinality constraints, the GSEMO can achieve the optimal
polynomial-time approximation ratio, $1/2$. For more general matroid constraints, the GSEMO
can achieve an asymptotically optimal polynomial-time approximation ratio, $1/2-\epsilon/(4n)$,
where $\epsilon>0$ and $n$ is the size of the ground set of items. Furthermore, when the objective
function (i.e., a linear combination of quality and diversity) changes dynamically, the GSEMO
can maintain this approximation ratio in polynomial running time, addressing the open question
proposed by Borodin. This also theoretically shows the superiority of EAs over local search for
solving dynamic optimization problems for the first time, and discloses the robustness of the mutation
operator of EAs against dynamic changes. Experiments on the applications of web-based search,
multi-label feature selection and document summarization show the superior performance of the
GSEMO over the state-of-the-art algorithms (i.e., the greedy algorithm and local search) under
both static and dynamic environments.

Session-based recommendation is a practical recommendation task that predicts the next item based
on an anonymous behavior sequence, and its performance relies heavily on the transition information
between items in the sequence. The SOTA methods in SBR employ GNN to model neighboring item transitions
from global (i.e, other sessions) and local (i.e, current session) contexts. However, most existing
methods treat neighbors from different sessions equally without considering that the neighbor
items from different sessions may share similar features with the target item on different aspects
and may have different contributions. In other words, they have not explored finer-granularity
transition information between items in the global context, leading to sub-optimal performance.
In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing a novel Transition Information Enhanced Disentangled
Graph Neural Network (TIE-DGNN) model to capture finer-granular transition information between
items and try to interpret the reason of the transition by modeling the various factors of the item.
Specifically, we propose a position-aware global graph, which utilizes the relative position
information to model the neighboring item transition. Then, we slice item embeddings into blocks,
each of which represents a factor, and use disentangling module to separately learn the factor embeddings
over the global graph. For local context, we train item embeddings by using attention mechanisms
to capture transition information from the current session. To this end, our model considers two
levels of transition information. Especially in global text, we not only consider finer-granularity
transition information between items but also take user intents at factor-level into account to
interpret the key reason for the transition. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate
the superiority of our method over the SOTA methods.

The development of accurate methods for multi-label classification (MLC) of remote sensing (RS)
images is one of the most important research topics in RS. The MLC methods based on Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown strong performance gains in RS. However, they usually require
a high number of reliable training images annotated with multiple land-cover class labels. Collecting
such data is time-consuming and costly. To address this problem, the publicly available thematic
products, which can include noisy labels, can be used to annotate RS images with zero-labeling cost.
However, multi-label noise (which can be associated with wrong and missing label annotations)
can distort the learning process of the MLC methods. To address this problem, we propose a novel multi-label
noise robust collaborative learning (RCML) method to alleviate the negative effects of multi-label
noise during the training phase of a CNN model. RCML identifies, ranks and excludes noisy multi-labels
in RS images based on three main modules: 1) the discrepancy module; 2) the group lasso module; and
3) the swap module. The discrepancy module ensures that the two networks learn diverse features,
while producing the same predictions. The task of the group lasso module is to detect the potentially
noisy labels assigned to the multi-labeled training images, while the swap module is devoted to
exchange the ranking information between two networks. Unlike existing methods that make assumptions
about the noise distribution, our proposed RCML does not make any prior assumption about the type
of noise in the training set. The experiments conducted on two multi-label RS image archives confirm
the robustness of the proposed RCML under extreme multi-label noise rates. Our code is publicly

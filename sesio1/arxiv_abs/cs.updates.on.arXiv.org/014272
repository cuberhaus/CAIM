A streaming algorithm is considered to be adversarially robust if it provides correct outputs with
high probability even when the stream updates are chosen by an adversary who may observe and react
to the past outputs of the algorithm. We grow the burgeoning body of work on such algorithms in a new
direction by studying robust algorithms for the problem of maintaining a valid vertex coloring
of an $n$-vertex graph given as a stream of edges. Following standard practice, we focus on graphs
with maximum degree at most $\Delta$ and aim for colorings using a small number $f(\Delta)$ of colors.
A recent breakthrough (Assadi, Chen, and Khanna; SODA~2019) shows that in the standard, non-robust,
streaming setting, $(\Delta+1)$-colorings can be obtained while using only $\widetilde{O}(n)$
space. Here, we prove that an adversarially robust algorithm running under a similar space bound
must spend almost $\Omega(\Delta^2)$ colors and that robust $O(\Delta)$-coloring requires a
linear amount of space, namely $\Omega(n\Delta)$. We in fact obtain a more general lower bound,
trading off the space usage against the number of colors used. From a complexity-theoretic standpoint,
these lower bounds provide (i)~the first significant separation between adversarially robust
algorithms and ordinary randomized algorithms for a natural problem on insertion-only streams
and (ii)~the first significant separation between randomized and deterministic coloring algorithms
for graph streams, since deterministic streaming algorithms are automatically robust. We complement
our lower bounds with a suite of positive results, giving adversarially robust coloring algorithms
using sublinear space. In particular, we can maintain an $O(\Delta^2)$-coloring using $\widetilde{O}(n
\sqrt{\Delta})$ space and an $O(\Delta^3)$-coloring using $\widetilde{O}(n)$ space.

Introduction Existing literature about online handwriting analysis to support pathology diagnosis
has taken advantage of in-air trajectories. A similar situation occurred in biometric security
applications where the goal is to identify or verify an individual using his signature or handwriting.
These studies do not consider the distance of the pen tip to the writing surface. This is due to the
fact that current acquisition devices do not provide height formation. However, it is quite straightforward
to differentiate movements at two different heights: a) short distance: height lower or equal to
1 cm above a surface of digitizer, the digitizer provides x and y coordinates. b) long distance: height
exceeding 1 cm, the only information available is a time stamp that indicates the time that a specific
stroke has spent at long distance. Although short distance has been used in several papers, long
distances have been ignored and will be investigated in this paper. Methods In this paper, we will
analyze a large set of databases (BIOSECURID, EMOTHAW, PaHaW, Oxygen-Therapy and SALT), which
contain a total amount of 663 users and 17951 files. We have specifically studied: a) the percentage
of time spent on-surface, in-air at short distance, and in-air at long distance for different user
profiles (pathological and healthy users) and different tasks; b) The potential use of these signals
to improve classification rates. Results and conclusions Our experimental results reveal that
long-distance movements represent a very small portion of the total execution time (0.5 % in the
case of signatures and 10.4% for uppercase words of BIOSECUR-ID, which is the largest database).
In addition, significant differences have been found in the comparison of pathological versus
control group for letter l in PaHaW database (p=0.0157) and crossed pentagons in SALT database (p=0.0122)

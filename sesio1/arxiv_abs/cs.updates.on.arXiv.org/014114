The property of proportional representation in approval-based committee elections has appeared
in the social choice literature for over a century, and is typically understood as avoiding the underrepresentation
of minorities. However, we argue that the security of some distributed systems is directly linked
to the opposite goal of avoiding the overrepresentation of any minority, a goal not previously formalized
that leads us to an optimization objective known as maximin support. After providing a thorough
analysis of the computational complexity of this objective, we propose a new efficient election
rule that simultaneously achieves a) a constant-factor approximation guarantee for it, and b)
the property of proportional justified representation (PJR) - one of the strongest forms of proportional
representation. However, the most striking feature of the new rule is that one can verify in linear
time that the winning committee satisfies the two aforementioned guarantees, even when the algorithm
is executed by an untrusted party who only communicates the output. As a result, the rule can be adapted
into a verifiable computing scheme. Moreover, its verification procedure easily admits parallel
processing for further efficiency. Our work is motivated by an application on blockchain networks
that implement Nominated Proof-of-Stake, where the community elects a committee of validators
to participate in the consensus protocol, and where preventing overrepresentation protects the
network against attacks by an adversarial minority. Our election rule enables a validator selection
protocol with formal guarantees on security and proportionality, and its adaptation as a verifiable
computing scheme with a parallelized verification proves to be key for its successful implementation
given the computationally limited nature of the blockchain architecture.

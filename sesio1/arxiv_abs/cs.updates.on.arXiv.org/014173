Predicting the evolution of the brain network, also called connectome, by foreseeing changes in
the connectivity weights linking pairs of anatomical regions makes it possible to spot connectivity-related
neurological disorders in earlier stages and detect the development of potential connectomic
anomalies. Remarkably, such a challenging prediction problem remains least explored in the predictive
connectomics literature. It is a known fact that machine learning (ML) methods have proven their
predictive abilities in a wide variety of computer vision problems. However, ML techniques specifically
tailored for the prediction of brain connectivity evolution trajectory from a single timepoint
are almost absent. To fill this gap, we organized a Kaggle competition where 20 competing teams designed
advanced machine learning pipelines for predicting the brain connectivity evolution from a single
timepoint. The competing teams developed their ML pipelines with a combination of data pre-processing,
dimensionality reduction, and learning methods. Utilizing an inclusive evaluation approach,
we ranked the methods based on two complementary evaluation metrics (mean absolute error (MAE)
and Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC)) and their performances using different training and
testing data perturbation strategies (single random split and cross-validation). The final rank
was calculated using the rank product for each competing team across all evaluation measures and
validation strategies. In support of open science, the developed 20 ML pipelines along with the
connectomic dataset are made available on GitHub. The outcomes of this competition are anticipated
to lead to the further development of predictive models that can foresee the evolution of brain connectivity
over time, as well as other types of networks (e.g., genetic networks).

Industrial arms need to evolve beyond their standard shape to embrace new and emerging technologies.
In this paper, we shall first perform an analysis of four popular but different modern industrial
robot arms. By seeing the common trends we will try to extrapolate and expand these trends for the
future. Here, particular focus will be on interaction based on augmented reality (AR) through head-mounted
displays (HMD), but also through smartphones. Long-term human-robot interaction and personalization
of said interaction will also be considered. The use of AR in human-robot interaction has proven
to enhance communication and information exchange. A basic addition to industrial arm design would
be the integration of QR markers on the robot, both for accessing information and adding tracking
capabilities to more easily display AR overlays. In a recent example of information access, Mercedes
Benz added QR markers on their cars to help rescue workers estimate the best places to cut and evacuate
people after car crashes. One has also to deal with safety in an environment that will be more and more
about collaboration. The QR markers can therefore be combined with RF-based ranging modules, developed
in the EU-project SafeLog, that can be used both for safety as well as for tracking of human positions
while in close proximity interactions with the industrial arms. The industrial arms of the future
should also be intuitive to program and interact with. This would be achieved through AR and head
mounted displays as well as the already mentioned RF-based person tracking. Finally, a more personalized
interaction between the robots and humans can be achieved through life-long learning AI and disembodied,
personalized agents. We propose a design that not only exists in the physical world, but also partly
in the digital world of mixed reality.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are one of the most studied family of deep learning models
for signal classification, including modulation, technology, detection, and identification.
In this work, we focus on technology classification based on raw I/Q samples collected from multiple
synchronized receivers. As an example use case, we study protocol identification of Wi-Fi, LTE-LAA,
and 5G NR-U technologies that coexist over the 5 GHz Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure
(U-NII) bands. Designing and training accurate CNN classifiers involve significant time and effort
that goes into fine-tuning a model's architectural settings and determining the appropriate hyperparameter
configurations, such as learning rate and batch size. We tackle the former by defining architectural
settings themselves as hyperparameters. We attempt to automatically optimize these architectural
parameters, along with other preprocessing (e.g., number of I/Q samples within each classifier
input) and learning hyperparameters, by forming a Hyperparameter Optimization (HyperOpt) problem,
which we solve in a near-optimal fashion using the Hyperband algorithm. The resulting near-optimal
CNN (OCNN) classifier is then used to study classification accuracy for OTA as well as simulations
datasets, considering various SNR values. We show that the number of receivers to construct multi-channel
inputs for CNNs should be defined as a preprocessing hyperparameter to be optimized via Hyperband.
OTA results reveal that our OCNN classifiers improve classification accuracy by 24.58% compared
to manually tuned CNNs. We also study the effect of min-max normalization of I/Q samples within each
classifier's input on generalization accuracy over simulated datasets with SNRs other than training
set's SNR and show an average of 108.05% improvement when I/Q samples are normalized.

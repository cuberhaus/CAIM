Planning the defossilization of energy systems by facilitating high penetration of renewables
and maintaining access to abundant and affordable primary energy resources is a nontrivial multi-objective
problem encompassing economic, technical, environmental, and social aspects. However, so far,
most long-term policies to decrease the carbon footprint of our societies consider the cost of the
system as the leading indicator in the energy system models. To address this gap, we developed a new
approach by adding the energy return on investment (EROI) in a whole-energy system model. We built
the database with all EROI technologies and resources considered. This novel model is applied to
the Belgian energy system in 2035 for several greenhouse gas emissions targets. However, moving
away from fossil-based to carbon-neutral energy systems raises the issue of the uncertainty of
low-carbon technologies and resource data. Thus, we conduct a global sensitivity analysis to identify
the main parameters driving the variations in the EROI of the system. In this case study, the main
results are threefold: (i) the EROI of the system decreases from 8.9 to 3.9 when greenhouse gas emissions
are reduced by 5; (ii) the renewable fuels - mainly imported renewable gas - represent the largest
share of the system primary energy mix due to the lack of endogenous renewable resources such as wind
and solar; (iii) in the sensitivity analysis, the renewable fuels drive 67% of the variation of the
EROI of the system for low greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. The decrease in the EROI of the system
raises questions about meeting the climate targets without adverse socio-economic impact. Thus,
accounting for other criteria in energy planning models that nuance the cost-based results is essential
to guide policy-makers in addressing the challenges of the energy transition.

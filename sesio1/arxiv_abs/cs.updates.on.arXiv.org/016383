Power-to-Gas (P2G) has been one of the most frequently discussed technologies in the last few years.
This technology allows producing CO2 free fuels. Thanks to its high flexibility, it may offer services
to the power system, fostering Variable Renewable Energy Sources (VRES) and the electricity demand
match, mitigating the issues related to VRES overproduction. The role of P2G plants connected to
the transmission system as flexibility asset has been extensively analyzed in the literature.
Conversely, the analysis of these systems used at distribution level has only been dealt with in
a few studies: however, in this case critical operation conditions can easily arise, both on electrical
and gas infrastructure. This article presents a methodological analysis on the impact of different
simulation approaches when P2G is installed at distribution system level. The choice of the most
appropriate modeling approaches for electricity and distribution grids is required in order to
avoid overestimating or underestimating the potential flexibility that P2G plants connected
to distribution networks can offer. The aim of this paper is to understand the impact of different
modeling approaches in order to determine whether, and under which conditions, this is acceptable.
An illustrative case study has been developed to perform this kind of analysis. The results demonstrated
that it is important to take into account the electric distribution network topology, as the performance
of P2G plants could be affected by their placement in the network. Neglecting the dynamics of a gas
network or the interactions between P2G plant components under a low gas demand condition can lead
to an underestimation of the flexibility of the entire system. If the demand for gas is high enough,
the use of simplified assumptions that do not consider the dynamics of the gas network and P2G systems
may be acceptable.

The advent of blockchain technology has led to a massive wave of different decentralized ledger
technology (DLT) solutions. Such projects as Bitcoin and Ethereum have shifted the paradigm of
how to transact value in a decentralized manner, but their various core technologies have their
own advantages and disadvantages. This paper aims to describe an alternative to modern decentralized
financial networks by introducing the Humanode network. Humanode is a network safeguarded by cryptographically
secure bio-authorized nodes. Users will be able to deploy nodes by staking their encrypted biometric
data. This approach can potentially lead to the creation of a public, permissionless financial
network based on consensus between equal human nodes with algorithm-based emission mechanisms
targeting real value growth and proportional emission. Humanode combines different technological
stacks to achieve a decentralized, secure, scalable, efficient, consistent, immutable, and sustainable
financial network: 1) a bio-authorization module based on cryptographically secure neural networks
for the private classification of 3D templates of users' faces 2) a private Liveness detection mechanism
for identification of real human beings 3) a Substrate module as a blockchain layer 4) a cost-based
fee system 5) a Vortex decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governing system 6) a monetary
policy and algorithm, Fath, where monetary supply reacts to real value growth and emission is proportional.
All of these implemented technologies have nuances that are crucial for the integrity of the network.
In this paper we address these details, describing problems that might occur and their possible
solutions. The main goal of Humanode is to create a stable and just financial network that relies
on the existence of human life.

In the proposed demo, we will present a new software - Linguistic Field Data Management and Analysis
System - LiFE (https://github.com/kmi-linguistics/life) - an open-source, web-based linguistic
data management and analysis application that allows for systematic storage, management, sharing
and usage of linguistic data collected from the field. The application allows users to store lexical
items, sentences, paragraphs, audio-visual content with rich glossing / annotation; generate
interactive and print dictionaries; and also train and use natural language processing tools and
models for various purposes using this data. Since its a web-based application, it also allows for
seamless collaboration among multiple persons and sharing the data, models, etc with each other.
The system uses the Python-based Flask framework and MongoDB in the backend and HTML, CSS and Javascript
at the frontend. The interface allows creation of multiple projects that could be shared with the
other users. At the backend, the application stores the data in RDF format so as to allow its release
as Linked Data over the web using semantic web technologies - as of now it makes use of the OntoLex-Lemon
for storing the lexical data and Ligt for storing the interlinear glossed text and then internally
linking it to the other linked lexicons and databases such as DBpedia and WordNet. Furthermore it
provides support for training the NLP systems using scikit-learn and HuggingFace Transformers
libraries as well as make use of any model trained using these libraries - while the user interface
itself provides limited options for tuning the system, an externally-trained model could be easily
incorporated within the application; similarly the dataset itself could be easily exported into
a standard machine-readable format like JSON or CSV that could be consumed by other programs and
pipelines.

We study the performance of Markov chains for the $q$-state ferromagnetic Potts model on random
regular graphs. It is conjectured that their performance is dictated by metastability phenomena,
i.e., the presence of "phases" (clusters) in the sample space where Markov chains with local update
rules, such as the Glauber dynamics, are bound to take exponential time to escape, and therefore
cause slow mixing. The phases that are believed to drive these metastability phenomena in the case
of the Potts model emerge as local, rather than global, maxima of the so-called Bethe functional,
and previous approaches of analysing these phases based on optimisation arguments fall short of
the task. Our first contribution is to detail the emergence of the metastable phases for the $q$-state
Potts model on the $d$-regular random graph for all integers $q,d\geq 3$, and establish that for
an interval of temperatures, delineated by the uniqueness and the Kesten-Stigum thresholds on
the $d$-regular tree, the two phases coexist. The proofs are based on a conceptual connection between
spatial properties and the structure of the Potts distribution on the random regular graph, rather
than complicated moment calculations. Based on this new structural understanding of the model,
we obtain various algorithmic consequences. We first complement recent fast mixing results for
Glauber dynamics by Blanca and Gheissari below the uniqueness threshold, showing an exponential
lower bound on the mixing time above the uniqueness threshold. Then, we obtain tight results even
for the non-local Swendsen-Wang chain, where we establish slow mixing/metastability for the whole
interval of temperatures where the chain is conjectured to mix slowly on the random regular graph.
The key is to bound the conductance of the chains using a random graph "planting" argument combined
with delicate bounds on random-graph percolation.

This paper is designed to increase the knowledge and computational know-how for time-varying matrix
problems and Zeroing Neural Networks in the West. Zeroing Neural Networks (ZNN) were invented for
time-varying matrix problems 20 years ago in China and almost all of their advances have been made
in and still come from its birthplace. ZNN methods have become a backbone for solving discretized
sensor driven time-varying matrix problems in real-time, in theory and in on-chip applications
for robots, in control theory and in engineering. They have become the method of choice for many time-varying
matrix problems that benefit from or require efficient, accurate and predictive real-time computations.
The typical discretized ZNN algorithm needs seven distinct steps for its initial set-up. The construction
of discretized ZNN algorithms starts from a model with its associated error equation and the stipulation
that the error function decrease exponentially fast. The error function differential equation
is then mated with a convergent look-ahead finite difference formula to create a distinctly new
multistep-style solver that predicts the future state of the system reliably from current and earlier
state and solutions data. Matlab codes for discretized ZNN algorithms typically consist of one
linear equations solve and one recursion of already available data per time step. This makes discretized
ZNN based algorithms highly competitive with ordinary differential equation initial value path
following or homotopy methods that are designed to work adaptively and gives ZNN different characteristics
and applicabilities from multistep ODE initial value solvers. Discretized ZNN methods can solve
problems given by sensor data with constant sampling gaps or from functional equations.

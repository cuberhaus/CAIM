Data-driven approaches for medium-range weather forecasting are recently shown extraordinarily
promising for ensemble forecasting for their fast inference speed compared to traditional numerical
weather prediction (NWP) models, but their forecast accuracy can hardly match the state-of-the-art
operational ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) model. Previous data-driven attempts
achieve ensemble forecast using some simple perturbation methods, like initial condition perturbation
and Monte Carlo dropout. However, they mostly suffer unsatisfactory ensemble performance, which
is arguably attributed to the sub-optimal ways of applying perturbation. We propose a Swin Transformer-based
Variational Recurrent Neural Network (SwinVRNN), which is a stochastic weather forecasting model
combining a SwinRNN predictor with a perturbation module. SwinRNN is designed as a Swin Transformer-based
recurrent neural network, which predicts future states deterministically. Furthermore, to model
the stochasticity in prediction, we design a perturbation module following the Variational Auto-Encoder
paradigm to learn multivariate Gaussian distributions of a time-variant stochastic latent variable
from data. Ensemble forecasting can be easily achieved by perturbing the model features leveraging
noise sampled from the learned distribution. We also compare four categories of perturbation methods
for ensemble forecasting, i.e. fixed distribution perturbation, learned distribution perturbation,
MC dropout, and multi model ensemble. Comparisons on WeatherBench dataset show the learned distribution
perturbation method using our SwinVRNN model achieves superior forecast accuracy and reasonable
ensemble spread due to joint optimization of the two targets. More notably, SwinVRNN surpasses
operational IFS on surface variables of 2-m temperature and 6-hourly total precipitation at all
lead times up to five days.

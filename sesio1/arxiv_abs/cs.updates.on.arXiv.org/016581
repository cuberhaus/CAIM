We consider a cell-free wireless system operated in Time Division Duplex (TDD) mode with localized
user-centric clusters of remote radio units (RUs). Since the uplink pilot dimensions per channel
coherence slot is limited, co-pilot users might incur mutual pilot contamination. In the current
literature, it is assumed that the long-term statistical knowledge of all user channels is available.
This enables MMSE channel estimation or simplified dominant subspace projection, which achieves
significant pilot decontamination under certain assumptions on the channel covariance matrices.
However, estimating the channel covariance matrix or even just its dominant subspace at all RUs
forming a user cluster is not an easy task. In fact, if not properly designed, a piloting scheme for
such long-term statistics estimation will also be subject to the contamination problem. In this
paper, we propose a new channel subspace estimation scheme explicitly designed for cell-free wireless
networks. Our scheme is based on 1) a sounding reference signal (SRS) using latin squares wideband
frequency hopping, and 2) a subspace estimation method based on robust Principal Component Analysis
(R-PCA). The SRS hopping scheme ensures that for any user and any RU participating in its cluster,
only a few pilot measurements will contain strong co-pilot interference. These few heavily contaminated
measurements are (implicitly) eliminated by R-PCA, which is designed to regularize the estimation
and discount the "outlier" measurements. Our simulation results show that the proposed scheme
achieves almost perfect subspace knowledge, which in turns yields system performance very close
to that with ideal channel state information, thus essentially solving the problem of pilot contamination
in cell-free user-centric TDD wireless networks.

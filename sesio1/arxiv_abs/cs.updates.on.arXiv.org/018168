The statistical regularities in language corpora encode well-known social biases into word embeddings.
Here, we focus on gender to provide a comprehensive analysis of group-based biases in widely-used
static English word embeddings trained on internet corpora (GloVe 2014, fastText 2017). Using
the Single-Category Word Embedding Association Test, we demonstrate the widespread prevalence
of gender biases that also show differences in: (1) frequencies of words associated with men versus
women; (b) part-of-speech tags in gender-associated words; (c) semantic categories in gender-associated
words; and (d) valence, arousal, and dominance in gender-associated words. First, in terms of word
frequency: we find that, of the 1,000 most frequent words in the vocabulary, 77% are more associated
with men than women, providing direct evidence of a masculine default in the everyday language of
the English-speaking world. Second, turning to parts-of-speech: the top male-associated words
are typically verbs (e.g., fight, overpower) while the top female-associated words are typically
adjectives and adverbs (e.g., giving, emotionally). Gender biases in embeddings also permeate
parts-of-speech. Third, for semantic categories: bottom-up, cluster analyses of the top 1,000
words associated with each gender. The top male-associated concepts include roles and domains
of big tech, engineering, religion, sports, and violence; in contrast, the top female-associated
concepts are less focused on roles, including, instead, female-specific slurs and sexual content,
as well as appearance and kitchen terms. Fourth, using human ratings of word valence, arousal, and
dominance from a ~20,000 word lexicon, we find that male-associated words are higher on arousal
and dominance, while female-associated words are higher on valence.

Spatial speech communication, i.e., the reconstruction of spoken signal along with the relative
speaker position in the enclosure (reverberation information) is considered in this paper. Directional,
diffuse components and the source position information are estimated at the transmitter, and perceptually
effective reproduction is considered at the receiver. We consider spatially distributed microphone
arrays for signal acquisition, and node specific signal estimation, along with its direction of
arrival (DoA) estimation. Short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domain multi-channel linear prediction
(MCLP) approach is used to model the diffuse component and relative acoustic transfer function
is used to model the direct signal component. Distortion-less array response constraint and the
time-varying complex Gaussian source model are used in the joint estimation of source DoA and the
constituent signal components, separately at each node. The intersection between DoA directions
at each node is used to compute the source position. Signal components computed at the node nearest
to the estimated source position are taken as the signals for transmission. At the receiver, a four
channel loud speaker (LS) setup is used for spatial reproduction, in which the source spatial image
is reproduced relative to a chosen virtual listener position in the transmitter enclosure. Vector
base amplitude panning (VBAP) method is used for direct component reproduction using the LS setup
and the diffuse component is reproduced equally from all the loud speakers after decorrelation.
This scheme of spatial speech communication is shown to be effective and more natural for hands-free
telecommunication, through either loudspeaker listening or binaural headphone listening with
head related transfer function (HRTF) based presentation.

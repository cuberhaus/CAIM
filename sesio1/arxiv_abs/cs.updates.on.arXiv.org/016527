While major strides have been made towards gender equality in public life, serious inequality remains
in the domestic sphere, especially around parenting. The present study analyses discussions about
parenting on Reddit to explore audience effects and gender stereotypes. It suggests a novel method
to study topical variation in individuals' language when interacting with different audiences.
Comments posted in 2020 were collected from three parenting subreddits, described as being for
fathers (r/Daddit), mothers (r/Mommit), and all parents (r/Parenting). Users posting on r/Parenting
and r/Daddit or on r/Parenting and r/Mommit were assumed to identify as fathers or mothers, respectively,
allowing gender comparison. Users' comments on r/Parenting (to a mixed-gender audience) were
compared with their comments to single-gender audiences on r/Daddit or r/Mommit using LDA topic
modelling. Results showed that the most discussed topic among parents is about education and family
advice, a topic mainly discussed in the mixed-gender subreddit and more by fathers than mothers.
Regarding the basic needs of children (sleep, food, and medical care), mothers seemed to be more
concerned regardless of the audience. In contrast, topics such as birth and pregnancy announcements
and physical appearance were more discussed by fathers in the father-centric subreddit. Overall,
findings seem to show that mothers are generally more concerned about the practical sides of parenting
while fathers' expressed concerns are more contextual: with other fathers, there seems to be a desire
to show their fatherhood and be recognized for it while they discuss education with mothers. These
results demonstrate that concerns expressed by parents on Reddit are context-sensitive but also
consistent with gender stereotypes, potentially reflecting a persistent gendered and unequal
division of labour in parenting.

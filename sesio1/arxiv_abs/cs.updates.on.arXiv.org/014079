Deep learning models usually require a large amount of labeled data to achieve satisfactory performance.
In multimedia analysis, domain adaptation studies the problem of cross-domain knowledge transfer
from a label rich source domain to a label scarce target domain, thus potentially alleviates the
annotation requirement for deep learning models. However, we find that contemporary domain adaptation
methods for cross-domain image understanding perform poorly when source domain is noisy. Weakly
Supervised Domain Adaptation (WSDA) studies the domain adaptation problem under the scenario
where source data can be noisy. Prior methods on WSDA remove noisy source data and align the marginal
distribution across domains without considering the fine-grained semantic structure in the embedding
space, which have the problem of class misalignment, e.g., features of cats in the target domain
might be mapped near features of dogs in the source domain. In this paper, we propose a novel method,
termed Noise Tolerant Domain Adaptation, for WSDA. Specifically, we adopt the cluster assumption
and learn cluster discriminatively with class prototypes in the embedding space. We propose to
leverage the location information of the data points in the embedding space and model the location
information with a Gaussian mixture model to identify noisy source data. We then design a network
which incorporates the Gaussian mixture noise model as a sub-module for unsupervised noise removal
and propose a novel cluster-level adversarial adaptation method which aligns unlabeled target
data with the less noisy class prototypes for mapping the semantic structure across domains. We
conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our method on both general images
and medical images from COVID-19 and e-commerce datasets. The results show that our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art WSDA methods.

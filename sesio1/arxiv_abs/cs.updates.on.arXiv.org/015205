The importance of the working document is that it allows the analysis of information and cases associated
with (SARS-CoV-2) COVID-19, based on the daily information generated by the Government of Mexico
through the Secretariat of Health, responsible for the Epidemiological Surveillance System for
Viral Respiratory Diseases (SVEERV). The information in the SVEERV is disseminated as open data,
and the level of information is displayed at the municipal, state and national levels. On the other
hand, the monitoring of the genomic surveillance of (SARS-CoV-2) COVID-19, through the identification
of variants and mutations, is registered in the database of the Information System of the Global
Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) based in Germany. These two sources of information
SVEERV and GISAID provide the information for the analysis of the impact of (SARS-CoV-2) COVID-19
on the population in Mexico. The first data source identifies information, at the national level,
on patients according to age, sex, comorbidities and COVID-19 presence (SARS-CoV-2), among other
characteristics. The data analysis is carried out by means of the design of an algorithm applying
data mining techniques and methodology, to estimate the case fatality rate, positivity index and
identify a typology according to the severity of the infection identified in patients who present
a positive result. for (SARS-CoV-2) COVID-19. From the second data source, information is obtained
worldwide on the new variants and mutations of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2), providing valuable information
for timely genomic surveillance. This study analyzes the impact of (SARS-CoV-2) COVID-19 on the
indigenous language-speaking population, it allows us to provide information, quickly and in
a timely manner, to support the design of public policy on health.

Most real-world ecological dynamics, ranging from ecosystem dynamics to collective animal movement,
are inherently stochastic in nature. Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are a popular modelling
framework to model dynamics with intrinsic randomness. Here, we focus on the inverse question:
If one has empirically measured time-series data from some system of interest, is it possible to
discover the SDE model that best describes the data. Here, we present PyDaddy (PYthon library for
DAta Driven DYnamics), a toolbox to construct and analyze interpretable SDE models based on time-series
data. We combine traditional approaches for data-driven SDE reconstruction with an equation learning
approach, to derive symbolic equations governing the stochastic dynamics. The toolkit is presented
as an open-source Python library, and consists of tools to construct and analyze SDEs. Functionality
is included for visual examination of the stochastic structure of the data, guided extraction of
the functional form of the SDE, and diagnosis and debugging of the underlying assumptions and the
extracted model. Using simulated time-series datasets, exhibiting a wide range of dynamics, we
show that PyDaddy is able to correctly identify underlying SDE models. We demonstrate the applicability
of the toolkit to real-world data using a previously published movement data of a fish school. Starting
from the time-series of the observed polarization of the school, pyDaddy readily discovers the
SDE model governing the dynamics of group polarization. The model recovered by PyDaddy is consistent
with the previous study. In summary, stochastic and noise-induced effects are central to the dynamics
of many biological systems. In this context, we present an easy-to-use package to reconstruct SDEs
from timeseries data.

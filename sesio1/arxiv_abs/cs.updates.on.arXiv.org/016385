A homomorphism from a graph $G$ to a graph $H$ is an edge-preserving mapping from $V(G)$ to $V(H)$.
Let $H$ be a fixed graph with possible loops. In the list homomorphism problem, denoted by \textsc{LHom}($H$),
the instance is a graph $G$, whose every vertex is equipped with a subset of $V(H)$, called list. We
ask whether there exists a homomorphism from $G$ to $H$, such that every vertex from $G$ is mapped
to a vertex from its list. We study the complexity of the \textsc{LHom}($H$) problem in intersection
graphs of various geometric objects. In particular, we are interested in answering the question
for what graphs $H$ and for what types of geometric objects, the \textsc{LHom}($H$) problem can
be solved in time subexponential in the number of vertices of the instance. We fully resolve this
question for string graphs, i.e., intersection graphs of continuous curves in the plane. Quite
surprisingly, it turns out that the dichotomy exactly coincides with the analogous dichotomy for
graphs excluding a fixed path as an induced subgraph [Okrasa, Rz\k{a}\.zewski, STACS 2021]. Then
we turn our attention to subclasses of string graphs, defined as intersections of fat objects. We
observe that the (non)existence of subexponential-time algorithms in such classes is closely
related to the size $\mathrm{mrc}(H)$ of a maximum reflexive clique in $H$, i.e., maximum number
of pairwise adjacent vertices, each of which has a loop. We study the maximum value of $\mathrm{mrc}(H)$
that guarantees the existence of a subexponential-time algorithm for \textsc{LHom}($H$) in intersection
graphs of (i) convex fat objects, (ii) fat similarly-sized objects, and (iii) disks. In the first
two cases we obtain optimal results, by giving matching algorithms and lower bounds. Finally, we
discuss possible extensions of our results to weighted generalizations of \textsc{LHom}($H$).

Camera traps have transformed how ecologists study wildlife species distributions, activity
patterns, and interspecific interactions. Although camera traps provide a cost-effective method
for monitoring species, the time required for data processing can limit survey efficiency. Thus,
the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically Deep Learning (DL), to process camera-trap
data has gained considerable attention. Using DL for these applications involves training algorithms,
such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to automatically detect objects and classify species.
To overcome technical challenges associated with training CNNs, several research communities
have recently developed platforms that incorporate DL in easy-to-use interfaces. We review key
characteristics of four AI-powered platforms -- Wildlife Insights (WI), MegaDetector (MD), Machine
Learning for Wildlife Image Classification (MLWIC2), and Conservation AI -- including data management
tools and AI features. We also provide R code in an open-source GitBook, to demonstrate how users
can evaluate model performance, and incorporate AI output in semi-automated workflows. We found
that species classifications from WI and MLWIC2 generally had low recall values (animals that were
present in the images often were not classified to the correct species). Yet, the precision of WI
and MLWIC2 classifications for some species was high (i.e., when classifications were made, they
were generally accurate). MD, which classifies images using broader categories (e.g., "blank"
or "animal"), also performed well. Thus, we conclude that, although species classifiers were not
accurate enough to automate image processing, DL could be used to improve efficiencies by accepting
classifications with high confidence values for certain species or by filtering images containing
blanks.

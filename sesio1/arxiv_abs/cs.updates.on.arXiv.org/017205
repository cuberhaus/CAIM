Many problems that can be solved in quadratic time have bit-parallel speed-ups with factor $w$,
where $w$ is the computer word size. For example, edit distance of two strings of length $n$ can be
solved in $O(n^2/w)$ time. In a reasonable classical model of computation, one can assume $w=\Theta(\log
n)$. There are conditional lower bounds for such problems stating that speed-ups with factor $n^\epsilon$
for any $\epsilon>0$ would lead to breakthroughs in complexity theory. However, these conditional
lower bounds do not cover quantum models of computing. Indeed, Boroujeni et al. (J. ACM, 2021) showed
that edit distance can be approximated within a factor $3$ in sub-quadratic time $O(n^{1.81})$
using quantum computing. They also showed that, in their chosen model of quantum computing, the
approximation factor cannot be improved using sub-quadractic time. To break through the aforementioned
classical conditional lower bounds and this latest quantum lower bound, we enrich the model of computation
with a quantum random access memory (QRAM), obtaining what we call the word QRAM model. Under this
model, we show how to convert the bit-parallelism of quadratic time solvable problems into quantum
algorithms that attain speed-ups with factor $n$. The technique we use is simple and general enough
to apply to many bit-parallel algorithms that use Boolean logics and bit-shifts. To apply it to edit
distance, we first show that the famous $O(n^2/w)$ time bit-parallel algorithm of Myers (J. ACM,
1999) can be adjusted to work without arithmetic + operations. As a direct consequence of applying
our technique to this variant, we obtain linear time edit distance algorithm under the word QRAM
model for constant alphabet. We give further results on a restricted variant of the word QRAM model
to give more insights to the limits of the model.

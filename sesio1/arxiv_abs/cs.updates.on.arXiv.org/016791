In this paper, we focus on the inverse problem of reconstructing distributional brain activity
with cortical and weakly detectable deep components in non-invasive Electroencephalography.
In particular, we aim to generalize the previously extensively used conditionally Gaussian prior
(CGP) formalism to achieve distributional reconstructions with higher focality. For this purpose,
we introduce as a hierarchical prior, a general exponential distribution, refered to as conditionally
exponential prior (CEP). The first-degree CEP corresponds to focality enforcing Laplace prior
that suffers from strong depth bias making the deep activity unrecoverable. We sample over multiple
resolution levels via RAMUS to reduce this bias as it is known to depend on the resolution of the source
space. Moreover, we introduce a procedure based on the physiological a priori knowledge of the brain
activity to obtain the shape and scale parameters of the gamma hyperprior that steer the CEP. The
posterior estimates are calculated using iterative statistical methods, expectation maximization
and iterative alternating sequential algorithm, which we show to be algorithmically similar and
to have a close resemblance to the iterative reweighting methods. The performance of CEP is compared
with the recent sampling-based dipole localization method Sequential semi-analytic Monte Carlo
estimation (SESAME) in numerical experiments of simulated somatosensory evoked potentials related
to the human median nerve stimulation. Our results suggest that a hybrid of the first-degree CEP
and RAMUS can achieve an accuracy comparable to the second-degree case (CGP) while being more focal.
Further, the proposed hybrid is shown to be robust to noise effects and compare well to the dipole
reconstructions obtained with SESAME.

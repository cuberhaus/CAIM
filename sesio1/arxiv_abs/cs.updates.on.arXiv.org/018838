The classification of airborne laser scanning (ALS) point clouds is a critical task of remote sensing
and photogrammetry fields. Although recent deep learning-based methods have achieved satisfactory
performance, they have ignored the unicity of the receptive field, which makes the ALS point cloud
classification remain challenging for the distinguishment of the areas with complex structures
and extreme scale variations. In this article, for the objective of configuring multi-receptive
field features, we propose a novel receptive field fusion-and-stratification network (RFFS-Net).
With a novel dilated graph convolution (DGConv) and its extension annular dilated convolution
(ADConv) as basic building blocks, the receptive field fusion process is implemented with the dilated
and annular graph fusion (DAGFusion) module, which obtains multi-receptive field feature representation
through capturing dilated and annular graphs with various receptive regions. The stratification
of the receptive fields with point sets of different resolutions as the calculation bases is performed
with Multi-level Decoders nested in RFFS-Net and driven by the multi-level receptive field aggregation
loss (MRFALoss) to drive the network to learn in the direction of the supervision labels with different
resolutions. With receptive field fusion-and-stratification, RFFS-Net is more adaptable to
the classification of regions with complex structures and extreme scale variations in large-scale
ALS point clouds. Evaluated on the ISPRS Vaihingen 3D dataset, our RFFS-Net significantly outperforms
the baseline approach by 5.3% on mF1 and 5.4% on mIoU, accomplishing an overall accuracy of 82.1%,
an mF1 of 71.6%, and an mIoU of 58.2%. Furthermore, experiments on the LASDU dataset and the 2019 IEEE-GRSS
Data Fusion Contest dataset show that RFFS-Net achieves a new state-of-the-art classification
performance.

Small-size robots offer access to spaces that are inaccessible to larger ones. This type of access
is crucial in applications such as drug delivery, environmental detection, and collection of small
samples. However, there are some tasks that are not possible to perform using only one robot including
assembly and manufacturing at small scales, manipulation of micro- and nano- objects, and robot-based
structuring of small-scale materials. The solution to this problem is to use a group of robots as
a system. Thus, we focus on tasks that can be achieved using a group of small-scale robots. These robots
are typically externally actuated due to their size limitation. Yet, one faces the challenge of
controlling a group of robots using a single global input. We propose a control algorithm to position
individual members of a swarm in predefined positions. A single control input applies to the system
and moves all robots in the same direction. We also add another control modality by using different
length robots. An electromagnetic coil system applied external force and steered the millirobots.
This millirobot can move in various modes of motion such as pivot walking and tumbling. We propose
two new designs of these millirobots. In the first design, the magnets are placed at the center of
body to reduce the magnetic attraction force. In the second design, the millirobots are of identical
length with two extra legs acting as the pivot points. This way we vary pivot separation in design
to take advantage of variable speed in pivot walking mode while keeping the speed constant in tumbling
mode. This paper presents a general algorithm for positional control of n millirobots with different
lengths to move them from given initial positions to final desired ones. This method is based on choosing
a leader that is fully controllable. Simulations and hardware experiments validate these results.

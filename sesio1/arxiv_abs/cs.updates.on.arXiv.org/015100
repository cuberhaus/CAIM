Understanding the abundance of a species is the first step towards understanding both its long-term
sustainability and the impact that we may be having upon it. Ecologists use camera traps to remotely
survey for the presence of specific animal species. Previous studies have shown that deep learning
models can be trained to automatically detect and classify animals within camera trap imagery with
high levels of confidence. However, the ability to train these models is reliant upon having enough
high-quality training data. What happens when the animal is rare or the data sets are non-existent?
This research proposes an approach of using images of rare animals in captivity (focusing on the
Scottish wildcat) to generate the training dataset. We explore the challenges associated with
generalising a model trained on captivity data when applied to data collected in the wild. The research
is contextualised by the needs of ecologists in planning/engineering. Following precedents from
other research, this project establishes an ensemble for object detection, image segmentation
and image classification models which are then tested using different image manipulation and class
structuring techniques to encourage model generalisation. The research concludes, in the context
of Scottish wildcat, that models trained on captivity imagery cannot be generalised to wild camera
trap imagery using existing techniques. However, final model performances based on a two-class
model Wildcat vs Not Wildcat achieved an overall accuracy score of 81.6% and Wildcat accuracy score
of 54.8% on a test set in which only 1% of images contained a wildcat. This suggests using captivity
images is feasible with further research. This is the first research which attempts to generate
a training set based on captivity data and the first to explore the development of such models in the
context of ecologists in planning/engineering.

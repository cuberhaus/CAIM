In 2020, amidst the COVID pandemic and a polarized political climate, the Sleeping Giants online
activist movement gained traction in Brazil. Its rationale was simple: to curb the spread of misinformation
by harming the advertising revenue of sources that produce this type of content. Like its international
counterparts, Sleeping Giants Brasil (SGB) campaigned against media outlets using Twitter to
ask companies to remove ads from the targeted outlets. This work presents a thorough quantitative
characterization of this activism model, analyzing the three campaigns carried out by SGB between
May and September 2020. To do so, we use digital traces from both Twitter and Google Trends, toxicity
and sentiment classifiers trained for the Portuguese language, and an annotated corpus of SGB's
tweets. Our key findings were threefold. First, we found that SGB's requests to companies were largely
successful (with 83.85\% of all 192 targeted companies responding positively) and that user pressure
was correlated to the speed of companies' responses. Second, there were no significant changes
in the online attention and the user engagement going towards the targeted media outlets in the six
months that followed SGB's campaign (as measured by Google Trends and Twitter engagement). Third,
we observed that user interactions with companies changed only transiently, even if the companies
did not respond to SGB's request. Overall, our results paint a nuanced portrait of internet activism.
On the one hand, they suggest that SGB was successful in getting companies to boycott specific media
outlets, which may have harmed their advertisement revenue stream. On the other hand, they also
suggest that the activist movement did not impact the online attention these media outlets received
nor the online image of companies that did not respond positively to their requests.

Objective: To propose novel SSVEP classification methodologies using deep neural networks (DNNs)
and improve performances in single-channel and user-independent brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs) with small data lengths. Approach: We propose the utilization of filter banks (creating
sub-band components of the EEG signal) in conjunction with DNNs. In this context, we created three
different models: a recurrent neural network (FBRNN) analyzing the time domain, a 2D convolutional
neural network (FBCNN-2D) processing complex spectrum features and a 3D convolutional neural
network (FBCNN-3D) analyzing complex spectrograms, which we introduce in this study as possible
input for SSVEP classification. We trained our neural networks with an open dataset and conceived
them so as not to require calibration from the final user: therefore, the test subject data was separated
from training and validation. Results: The DNNs with the filter banks surpassed the accuracy of
similar networks without this preprocessing step by considerable margins (up to 4.6%), and they
outperformed common SSVEP classification methods (SVM and FBCCA) by even higher margins (up to
7.1%). Out of the three DNNs using filter banks, the best results were obtained by the FBRNN, followed
by the FBCNN-3D, and finally by the FBCNN-2D. Conclusion and significance: Filter banks allow different
types of deep neural networks to more efficiently analyze the harmonic components of SSVEP. Complex
spectrograms carry more information than complex spectrum features and magnitude spectrum, allowing
the FBCNN-3D to surpass the other CNNs. The mean test accuracy (87.3%) and F1-Score (0.877) obtained
in the challenging classification problem indicates a strong potential for the construction of
portable, economical, fast and low-latency BCIs.

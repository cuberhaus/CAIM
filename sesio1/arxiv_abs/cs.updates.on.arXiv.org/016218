Targeting simulations on parallel hardware architectures, this paper presents computational
kernels for efficient computations in mortar finite element methods. Mortar methods enable a variationally
consistent imposition of coupling conditions at high accuracy, but come with considerable numerical
effort and cost for the evaluation of the mortar integrals to compute the coupling operators. In
this paper, we identify bottlenecks in parallel data layout and domain decomposition that hinder
an efficient evaluation of the mortar integrals. We then propose a set of computational strategies
to restore optimal parallel communication and scalability for the core kernels devoted to the evaluation
of mortar terms. We exemplarily study the proposed algorithmic components in the context of three-dimensional
large-deformation contact mechanics, both for cases with fixed and dynamically varying interface
topology, yet these concepts can naturally and easily be transferred to other mortar applications,
e.g. classical meshtying problems. To restore parallel scalability, we employ overlapping domain
decompositions of the interface discretization independent from the underlying volumes and then
tackle parallel communication for the mortar evaluation by a geometrically motivated reduction
of ghosting data. Using three-dimensional contact examples, we demonstrate strong and weak scalability
of the proposed algorithms up to 480 parallel processes as well as study and discuss improvements
in parallel communication related to mortar finite element methods. For the first time, dynamic
load balancing is applied to mortar contact problems with evolving contact zones, such that the
computational work is well balanced among all parallel processors independent of the current state
of the simulation.

In 2020, we initiated a systematic study of graph classes in which the treewidth can only be large
due the presence of a large clique, which we call $(\textrm{tw},\omega)$-bounded. While $(\textrm{tw},\omega)$-bounded
graph classes are known to enjoy some good algorithmic properties related to clique and coloring
problems, an interesting open problem is whether $(\textrm{tw},\omega)$-boundedness has useful
algorithmic implications for problems related to independent sets. We provide a partial answer
to this question by identifying a sufficient condition for $(\textrm{tw},\omega)$-bounded graph
classes to admit a polynomial-time algorithm for the Max Weight Independent Set problem and more
generally for the Max Weight Independent Packing problem. Our approach is based on a new min-max
graph parameter related to tree decompositions, which we call tree-independence number. We consider
six graph containment relations - the subgraph, topological minor, and minor relations, as well
as their induced variants - and for each of them characterize the graphs $H$ such that the class of
graphs excluding $H$ has bounded tree-independence number. These results build on and refine the
analogous characterizations for $(\textrm{tw},\omega)$-boundedness. We use a variety of tools
including SPQR trees and potential maximal cliques, to show that in the bounded cases, one can also
obtain tree decompositions with bounded independence number efficiently. This leads to polynomial-time
algorithms for the Max Weight Independent Set problem in an infinite family of graph classes, each
of which properly contains the class of chordal graphs. These results also apply to the class of 1-perfectly
orientable graphs, answering a question of Beisegel, Chudnovsky, Gurvich, Milani\v{c}, and Servatius
from 2019.

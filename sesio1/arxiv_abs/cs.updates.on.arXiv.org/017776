There is a great demand for vision-based robotics solutions that can operate using Global Positioning
Systems (GPS), but are also robust against GPS signal loss and gyroscope failure. This paper investigates
the estimation and tracking control in application to a Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) Unmanned
Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in six degrees of freedom (6 DoF). A full state observer for the estimation of
VTOL-UAV motion parameters (attitude, angular velocity, position, and linear velocity) is proposed
on the Lie Group of $\mathbb{SE}_{2}\left(3\right)\times\mathbb{R}^{3}$ $=\mathbb{SO}\left(3\right)\times\mathbb{R}^{9}$
with almost globally exponentially stable closed loop error signals. Thereafter, a full state
observer-based controller for the VTOL-UAV motion parameters is proposed on the Lie Group with
a guaranteed almost global exponential stability. The proposed approach produces good results
without the need for angular and linear velocity measurements (without a gyroscope and GPS signals)
utilizing only a set of known landmarks obtained by a vision-aided unit (monocular or stereo camera).
The equivalent quaternion representation on $\mathbb{S}^{3}\times\mathbb{R}^{9}$ is provided
in the Appendix. The observer-based controller is presented in a continuous form while its discrete
version is tested using a VTOL-UAV simulation that incorporates large initial error and uncertain
measurements. The proposed observer is additionally tested experimentally on a real-world UAV
flight dataset. Keywords: Unmanned aerial vehicle, nonlinear filter algorithm, autonomous navigation,

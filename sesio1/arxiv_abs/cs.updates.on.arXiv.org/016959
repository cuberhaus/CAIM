International mobility in academia can enhance the human and social capital of researchers and
consequently their scientific outcome. However, there is still a very limited understanding of
the different mobility patterns among scholars with various socio-demographic characteristics.
The aim of this study is twofold. First, we investigate to what extent individual factors associate
with the mobility of researchers. Second, we explore the relationship between mobility and scientific
activity and impact. For this purpose, we used a bibliometric approach to track the mobility of authors.
To compare the scientific outcomes of researchers, we considered the number of publications and
received citations as indicators, as well as the number of unique co-authors in all their publications.
We also analysed the co-authorship network of researchers and compared centrality measures of
mobile and non-mobile researchers. Results show that researchers from North America and Sub-Saharan
Africa, particularly female ones, have the lowest, respectively, highest tendency towards international
mobility. Having international co-authors increases the probability of international movement.
Our findings uncover gender inequality in international mobility across scientific fields and
countries. Across genders, researchers in the Physical sciences have the most and in the Social
sciences the least rate of mobility. We observed more mobility for Social scientists at the advanced
career stage, while researchers in other fields prefer to move at earlier career stages. Also, we
found a positive correlation between mobility and scientific outcomes, but no apparent difference
between females and males. Comparing the centrality of mobile and non-mobile researchers in the
co-authorship networks reveals a higher social capital advantage for mobile researchers.

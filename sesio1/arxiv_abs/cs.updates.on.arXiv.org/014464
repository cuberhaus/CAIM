Malware distribution to the victim network is commonly performed through file attachments in phishing
email or from the internet, when the victim interacts with the source of infection. To detect and
prevent the malware distribution in the victim machine, the existing end device security applications
may leverage techniques such as signature or anomaly-based, machine learning techniques. The
well-known file formats Portable Executable (PE) for Windows and Executable and Linkable Format
(ELF) for Linux based operating system are used for malware analysis, and the malware detection
capabilities of these files has been well advanced for real-time detection. But the malware payload
hiding in multimedia using steganography detection has been a challenge for enterprises, as these
are rarely seen and usually act as a stager in sophisticated attacks. In this article, to our knowledge,
we are the first to try to address the knowledge gap between the current progress in image steganography
and steganalysis academic research focusing on data hiding and the review of the stegomalware (malware
payload hiding in images) targeting enterprises with cyberattacks current status. We present
the stegomalware history, generation tools, file format specification description. Based on
our findings, we perform the detail review of the image steganography techniques including the
recent Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) based models and the image steganalysis methods
including the Deep Learning(DL) models for hiding data detection. Additionally, the stegomalware
detection framework for enterprise is proposed for anomaly based stegomalware detection emphasizing
the architecture details for different network environments. Finally, the research opportunities
and challenges in stegomalware generation and detection are also presented.

In this article, we show that the algorithm of maintaining expander decompositions in graphs undergoing
edge deletions directly by removing sparse cuts repeatedly can be made efficient. Formally, for
an $m$-edge undirected graph $G$, we say a cut $(S, \bar{S})$ is $\phi$-sparse if $|E_G(S, \bar{S})|
< \phi \cdot \min\{vol_G(S), vol_G(\bar{S})\}$. A $\phi$-expander decomposition of $G$ is a partition
of $V$ into sets $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_k$ such that each cluster $G[X_i]$ contains no $\phi$-sparse
cut (meaning it is a $\phi$-expander) with $\tilde{O}(\phi m)$ edges crossing between clusters.
A natural way to compute a $\phi$-expander decomposition is to decompose clusters by $\phi$-sparse
cuts until no such cut is contained in any cluster. We show that even in graphs undergoing edge deletions,
a slight relaxation of this meta-algorithm can be implemented efficiently with amortized update
time $m^{o(1)}/\phi^2$. Our approach naturally extends to maintaining directed $\phi$-expander
decompositions and $\phi$-expander hierarchies and thus gives a unifying framework while having
simpler proofs than previous state-of-the-art work. In all settings, our algorithm matches the
run-times of previous algorithms up to subpolynomial factors. Moreover, our algorithm provides
stronger guarantees for $\phi$-expander decompositions, for example, for graphs undergoing
edge deletions, our approach achieves the first sublinear $\phi m^{o(1)}$ recourse bounds on the
number of edges to become crossing between clusters. Our techniques also give by far the simplest,
deterministic algorithms for maintaining Strongly-Connected Components (SCCs) in directed
graphs undergoing edge deletions, and for maintaining connectivity in undirected fully-dynamic
graphs, both matching the current state-of-the-art run-times up to subpolynomial factors.

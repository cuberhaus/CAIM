Structural resonance involves the absorption of inertial loads by a tuned structural elasticity:
a process playing a key role in a wide range of biological and technological systems, including many
biological and bio-inspired locomotion systems. Conventional linear and nonlinear resonant
states typically exist at specific discrete frequencies, and specific symmetric waveforms. This
discreteness can be an obstacle to resonant control modulation: deviating from these states, by
breaking waveform symmetry or modulating drive frequency, generally leads to losses in system
efficiency. Here, we demonstrate a new strategy for achieving these modulations at no loss of energetic
efficiency. Leveraging fundamental advances in nonlinear dynamics, we characterise a new form
of structural resonance: band-type resonance, describing a continuous band of energetically-optimal
resonant states existing around conventional discrete resonant states. These states are a counterexample
to the common supposition that deviation from a linear (or nonlinear) resonant frequency necessarily
involves a loss of efficiency. We demonstrate how band-type resonant states can be generated via
a spectral shaping approach: with small modifications to the system kinematic and load waveforms,
we construct sets of frequency-modulated and symmetry-broken resonant states that show equal
energetic optimality to their conventional discrete analogues. The existence of these non-discrete
resonant states in a huge range of oscillators - linear and nonlinear, in many different physical
contexts - is a new dynamical-systems phenomenon. It has implications not only for biological and
bio-inspired locomotion systems but for a constellation of forced oscillator systems across physics,
engineering, and biology.

In non-invasive brain-computer interface systems, pre-movement decoding plays an important
role in the detection of movement before limbs actually move. Movement-related cortical potential
is a kind of brain activity associated with pre-movement decoding. In current studies, patterns
decoded from movement are mainly applied to the binary classification between movement state and
resting state, such as elbow flexion and rest. The classifications between two movement states
and among multiple movement states are still challenging. This study proposes a new method, the
star-arrangement spectral filtering (SASF), to solve the multi-class pre-movement classification
problem. We first design a referenced task-related component analysis (RTRCA) framework that
consists of two modules. This first module is the classification between movement state and resting
state; the second module is the classification of multiple movement states. SASF is developed by
optimizing the features in RTRCA. In SASF, feature selection on filter banks is used on the first
module of RTRCA, and feature selection on time windows is used on the second module of RTRCA. A linear
discriminant analysis classifier is used to classify the optimized features. In the binary classification
between two motions, the classification accuracy of SASF achieves 0.9670$\pm$0.0522, which is
significantly higher than the result provided by the deep convolutional neural network (0.6247$\pm$0.0680)
and the discriminative spatial pattern method (0.4400$\pm$0.0700). In the multi-class classification
of 7 states, the classification accuracy of SASF is 0.9491$\pm$0.0372. The proposed SASF greatly
improves the classification between two motions and enables the classification among multiple
motions. The result shows that the movement can be decoded from EEG signals before the actual limb
movement.

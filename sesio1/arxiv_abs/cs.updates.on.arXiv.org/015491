Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by an unpredictable
course of flares and remission with diverse manifestations. Lupus nephritis, one of the major disease
manifestations of SLE for organ damage and mortality, is a key component of lupus classification
criteria. Accurately identifying lupus nephritis in electronic health records (EHRs) would therefore
benefit large cohort observational studies and clinical trials where characterization of the
patient population is critical for recruitment, study design, and analysis. Lupus nephritis can
be recognized through procedure codes and structured data, such as laboratory tests. However,
other critical information documenting lupus nephritis, such as histologic reports from kidney
biopsies and prior medical history narratives, require sophisticated text processing to mine
information from pathology reports and clinical notes. In this study, we developed algorithms
to identify lupus nephritis with and without natural language processing (NLP) using EHR data.
We developed four algorithms: a rule-based algorithm using only structured data (baseline algorithm)
and three algorithms using different NLP models. The three NLP models are based on regularized logistic
regression and use different sets of features including positive mention of concept unique identifiers
(CUIs), number of appearances of CUIs, and a mixture of three components respectively. The baseline
algorithm and the best performed NLP algorithm were external validated on a dataset from Vanderbilt
University Medical Center (VUMC). Our best performing NLP model incorporating features from both
structured data, regular expression concepts, and mapped CUIs improved F measure in both the NMEDW
(0.41 vs 0.79) and VUMC (0.62 vs 0.96) datasets compared to the baseline lupus nephritis algorithm.

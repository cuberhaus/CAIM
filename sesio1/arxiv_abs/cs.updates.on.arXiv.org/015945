Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is an emerging research area advocating the use of quantum computing
for advancement in machine learning. Since the discovery of the capability of Parametrized Variational
Quantum Circuits (VQC) to replace Artificial Neural Networks, they have been widely adopted to
different tasks in Quantum Machine Learning. However, despite their potential to outperform neural
networks, VQCs are limited to small scale applications given the challenges in scalability of quantum
circuits. To address this shortcoming, we propose an algorithm that compresses the quantum state
within the circuit using a tensor ring representation. Using the input qubit state in the tensor
ring representation, single qubit gates maintain the tensor ring representation. However, the
same is not true for two qubit gates in general, where an approximation is used to have the output as
a tensor ring representation. Using this approximation, the storage and computational time increases
linearly in the number of qubits and number of layers, as compared to the exponential increase with
exact simulation algorithms. This approximation is used to implement the tensor ring VQC. The training
of the parameters of tensor ring VQC is performed using a gradient descent based algorithm, where
efficient approaches for backpropagation are used. The proposed approach is evaluated on two datasets:
Iris and MNIST for the classification task to show the improved accuracy using more number of qubits.
We achieve a test accuracy of 83.33\% on Iris dataset and a maximum of 99.30\% and 76.31\% on binary
and ternary classification of MNIST dataset using various circuit architectures. The results
from the IRIS dataset outperform the results on VQC implemented on Qiskit, and being scalable, demonstrates
the potential for VQCs to be used for large scale Quantum Machine Learning applications.

An important theoretical problem in the study of quantum computation, that is also practically
relevant in the context of near-term quantum devices, is to understand the computational power
of hybrid models, that combine poly-time classical computation with short-depth quantum computation.
Here, we consider two such models: CQ_d which captures the scenario of a polynomial-time classical
algorithm that queries a d-depth quantum computer many times; and QC_d which is more analogous to
measurement-based quantum computation and captures the scenario of a d-depth quantum computer
with the ability to change the sequence of gates being applied depending on measurement outcomes
processed by a classical computation. Chia, Chung & Lai (STOC 2020) and Coudron & Menda (STOC 2020)
showed that these models (with d=log^O(1) (n)) are strictly weaker than BQP (the class of problems
solvable by poly-time quantum computation), relative to an oracle, disproving a conjecture of
Jozsa in the relativised world. We show that, despite the similarities between CQ_d and QC_d, the
two models are incomparable, i.e. CQ_d $\nsubseteq$ QC_d and QC_d $\nsubseteq$ CQ_d relative to
an oracle. In other words, there exist problems that one model can solve but not the other and vice
versa. We do this by considering new oracle problems that capture the distinctions between the two
models and by introducing the notion of an intrinsically stochastic oracle, an oracle whose responses
are inherently randomised, which is used for our second result. While we leave showing the second
separation relative to a standard oracle as an open problem, we believe the notion of stochastic
oracles could be of independent interest for studying complexity classes which have resisted separation
in the standard oracle model. Our constructions also yield simpler oracle separations between
the hybrid models and BQP, compared to earlier works.

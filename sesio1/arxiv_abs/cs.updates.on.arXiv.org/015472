This paper introduces Presto, a symbolic partial evaluator for Maude's rewriting logic theories
that can improve system analysis and verification. In Presto, the automated optimization of a conditional
rewrite theory R (whose rules define the concurrent transitions of a system) is achieved by partially
evaluating, with respect to the rules of R, an underlying, companion equational logic theory E that
specifies the algebraic structure of the system states of R. This can be particularly useful for
specializing an overly general equational theory E whose operators may obey complex combinations
of associativity, commutativity, and/or identity axioms, when being plugged into a host rewrite
theory R as happens, for instance, in protocol analysis, where sophisticated equational theories
for cryptography are used. Presto implements different unfolding operators that are based on folding
variant narrowing (the symbolic engine of Maude's equational theories). When combined with an
appropriate abstraction algorithm, they allow the specialization to be adapted to the theory termination
behavior and bring significant improvement while ensuring strong correctness and termination
of the specialization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Presto in several examples of protocol
analysis where it achieves a significant speed-up. Actually, the transformation provided by Presto
may cut down an infinite folding variant narrowing space to a finite one, and moreover, some of the
costly algebraic axioms and rule conditions may be eliminated as well. As far as we know, this is the
first partial evaluator for Maude that respects the semantics of functional, logic, concurrent,
and object-oriented computations. Under consideration in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming
(TPLP).

Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) are promising security primitives for resource-constrained
network nodes. The XOR Arbiter PUF (XOR PUF or XPUF) is an intensively studied PUF invented to improve
the security of the Arbiter PUF, probably the most lightweight delay-based PUF. Recently, highly
powerful machine learning attack methods were discovered and were able to easily break large-sized
XPUFs, which were highly secure against earlier machine learning attack methods. Component-differentially-challenged
XPUFs (CDC-XPUFs) are XPUFs with different component PUFs receiving different challenges. Studies
showed they were much more secure against machine learning attacks than the conventional XPUFs,
whose component PUFs receive the same challenge. But these studies were all based on earlier machine
learning attack methods, and hence it is not clear if CDC-XPUFs can remain secure under the recently
discovered powerful attack methods. In this paper, the two current most powerful two machine learning
methods for attacking XPUFs are adapted by fine-tuning the parameters of the two methods for CDC-XPUFs.
Attack experiments using both simulated PUF data and silicon data generated from PUFs implemented
on field-programmable gate array (FPGA) were carried out, and the experimental results showed
that some previously secure CDC-XPUFs of certain circuit parameter values are no longer secure
under the adapted new attack methods, while many more CDC-XPUFs of other circuit parameter values
remain secure. Thus, our experimental attack study has re-defined the boundary between the secure
region and the insecure region of the PUF circuit parameter space, providing PUF manufacturers
and IoT security application developers with valuable information in choosing PUFs with secure
parameter values.

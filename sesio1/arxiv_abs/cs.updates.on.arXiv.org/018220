Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a new distributed method for identity management, commonly used
to address the problem that users are lack of control over their identities. However, the excessive
pursuit of self-sovereignty in the most existing SSI schemes hinders sanctions against attackers.
To deal with the malicious behavior, a few SSI schemes introduce accountability mechanisms, but
they sacrifice users' privacy. What's more, the digital identities (static strings or updatable
chains) in the existing SSI schemes are as inputs to a third-party executable program (mobile app,
smart contract, etc.) to achieve identity reading, storing and proving, users' self-sovereignty
are weakened. To solve the above problems, we present a new self-sovereign identity scheme to strike
a balance between privacy and accountability and get rid of the dependence on the third-party program.
In our scheme, one and only individual-specific executable code is generated as a digital avatar-i
for each human to interact with others in cyberspace without a third-party program, in which the
embedding of biometrics enhances uniqueness and user control over their identity. In addition,
a joint accountability mechanism, which is based on the shamir (t, n) threshold algorithm and a consortium
blockchain, is designed to restrict the power of each regulatory authority and protect users' privacy.
Finally, we analyze the security, SSI properties and conduct detailed experiments in term of the
cost of computation, storage and blockchain gas. The analysis results indicate that our scheme
resists the known attacks and fulfills all the six SSI properties. Compared with the state-of-the-art
schemes, the extensive experiment results show that the cost is larger in server storage, blockchain
storage and blockchain gas, but is still low enough for practical situations.

The discovery of neutrino oscillation, proving that neutrinos do have masses, reveals the misfits
of particles in the current Standard Model (SM) theory. In theory, neutrinos having masses could
result in lepton flavour not being a symmetry called Lepton Flavour Violation (LFV). While SM theory
extensions allowed LFV processes, their branching fractions are too small, making them unobservable
even with the strongest equipment up-to-date. With that, scientists in recent years have generated
LFV-like processes from the combined LHCb and Monte-Carlo-Simulated data in an attempt to identify
LFV using Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning
(DL). In this paper, the performance of several algorithms in AI has been presented, such as XGBoost,
LightGBM, custom 1-D Dense Block Neural Networks (DBNNs), and custom 1-D Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) in identifying LFV signals, specifically $\tau^{-} \rightarrow \mu^{-}\mu^{-}\mu^{+}$
decay from the combined LHCb and Monte-Carlo-Simulated data that imitates the signatures of the
said decay. Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) and Cramer-von Mises (CvM) tests were also conducted to verify
the validity of predictions for each of the trained algorithms. The result shows decent performances
among algorithms, except for the LightGBM, for failing the CvM test, and a 20-layered CNN for having
recorded a considerably low AUC. Meanwhile, XGBoost and a 10-layered DBNN recorded the highest
AUC of 0.88. The main contribution of this paper is the extensive experiment involving custom DBNN
and CNN algorithms in different layers, all of which have been rarely used in the past years in identifying
LFV-like signatures, unlike GBMs and tree-based algorithms, which have been more popular in the
said task.

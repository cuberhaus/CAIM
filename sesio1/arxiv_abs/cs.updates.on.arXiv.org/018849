With the exponential increase of the number of devices in wireless networks, more enabling technologies
are expected to fulfill the network requirements of high throughput, massive connectivity, and
diversify quality of service. To this end, rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) is proposed as
a promising solution to improve spectral efficiency and provide better fairness for the next-generation
mobile networks. In this paper, the outage performance of uplink RSMA transmission with randomly
deployed users is investigated, taking both user scheduling schemes and power allocation strategies
into consideration. Specifically, the greedy user scheduling (GUS) and cumulative distribution
function (CDF) based user scheduling (CUS) schemes are considered, which could maximize the rate
performance and guarantee scheduling fairness, respectively. Meanwhile, we re-investigate
cognitive power allocation (CPA) strategy, and propose a new rate fairness-oriented power allocation
(FPA) strategy to enhance the scheduled users' rate fairness. By employing order statistics and
stochastic geometry, an analytical expression of the outage probability for each scheduling scheme
combining power allocation is derived to characterize the performance. To get more insights, the
achieved diversity order of each scheme is also derived. Theoretical results demonstrate that
both GUS and CUS schemes applying CPA or FPA strategy can achieve full diversity orders, and the application
of CPA strategy in RSMA can effectively eliminate the secondary user's diversity order constraint
from the primary user. Simulation results corroborate the accuracy of the analytical expressions,
and show that the proposed FPA strategy can achieve excellent rate fairness performance in high
signal-to-noise ratio region.

Although machine learning approaches have been widely used in the field of finance, to very successful
degrees, these approaches remain bespoke to specific investigations and opaque in terms of explainability,
comparability, and reproducibility. The primary objective of this research was to shed light upon
this field by providing a generic methodology that was investigation-agnostic and interpretable
to a financial markets practitioner, thus enhancing their efficiency, reducing barriers to entry,
and increasing the reproducibility of experiments. The proposed methodology is showcased on two
automated trading platform components. Namely, price levels, a well-known trading pattern, and
a novel 2-step feature extraction method. The methodology relies on hypothesis testing, which
is widely applied in other social and scientific disciplines to effectively evaluate the concrete
results beyond simple classification accuracy. The main hypothesis was formulated to evaluate
whether the selected trading pattern is suitable for use in the machine learning setting. Across
the experiments we found that the use of the considered trading pattern in the machine learning setting
is only partially supported by statistics, resulting in insignificant effect sizes (Rebound 7
- $0.64 \pm 1.02$, Rebound 11 $0.38 \pm 0.98$, and rebound 15 - $1.05 \pm 1.16$), but allowed the rejection
of the null hypothesis. We showcased the generic methodology on a US futures market instrument and
provided evidence that with this methodology we could easily obtain informative metrics beyond
the more traditional performance and profitability metrics. This work is one of the first in applying
this rigorous statistically-backed approach to the field of financial markets and we hope this
may be a springboard for more research.

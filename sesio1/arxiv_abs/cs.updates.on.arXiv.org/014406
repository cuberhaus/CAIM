Cryptographic techniques have the potential to enable distrusting parties to collaborate in fundamentally
new ways, but their practical implementation poses numerous challenges. An important class of
such cryptographic techniques is known as Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC). Developing Secure
MPC applications in realistic scenarios requires extensive knowledge spanning multiple areas
of cryptography and systems. And while the steps to arrive at a solution for a particular application
are often straightforward, it remains difficult to make the implementation efficient, and tedious
to apply those same steps to a slightly different application from scratch. Hence, it is an important
problem to design platforms for implementing Secure MPC applications with minimum effort and using
techniques accessible to non-experts in cryptography. In this paper, we present the HACCLE (High
Assurance Compositional Cryptography: Languages and Environments) toolchain, specifically
targeted to MPC applications. HACCLE contains an embedded domain-specific language Harpoon,
for software developers without cryptographic expertise to write MPC-based programs, and uses
Lightweight Modular Staging (LMS) for code generation. Harpoon programs are compiled into acyclic
circuits represented in HACCLE's Intermediate Representation (HIR) that serves as an abstraction
over different cryptographic protocols such as secret sharing, homomorphic encryption, or garbled
circuits. Implementations of different cryptographic protocols serve as different backends
of our toolchain. The extensible design of HIR allows cryptographic experts to plug in new primitives
and protocols to realize computation. And the use of standard metaprogramming techniques lowers
the development effort significantly.

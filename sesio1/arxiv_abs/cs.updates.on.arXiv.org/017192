Electrocardiograms (ECGs) have shown unique patterns to distinguish between different subjects
and present important advantages compared to other biometric traits, such as difficulty to counterfeit,
liveness detection, and ubiquity. Also, with the success of Deep Learning technologies, ECG biometric
recognition has received increasing interest in recent years. However, it is not easy to evaluate
the improvements of novel ECG proposed methods, mainly due to the lack of public data and standard
experimental protocols. In this study, we perform extensive analysis and comparison of different
scenarios in ECG biometric recognition. Both verification and identification tasks are investigated,
as well as single- and multi-session scenarios. Finally, we also perform single- and multi-lead
ECG experiments, considering traditional scenarios using electrodes in the chest and limbs and
current user-friendly wearable devices. In addition, we present ECGXtractor, a robust Deep Learning
technology trained with an in-house large-scale database and able to operate successfully across
various scenarios and multiple databases. We introduce our proposed feature extractor, trained
with multiple sinus-rhythm heartbeats belonging to 55,967 subjects, and provide a general public
benchmark evaluation with detailed experimental protocol. We evaluate the system performance
over four different databases: i) our in-house database, ii) PTB, iii) ECG-ID, and iv) CYBHi. With
the widely used PTB database, we achieve Equal Error Rates of 0.14% and 2.06% in verification, and
accuracies of 100% and 96.46% in identification, respectively in single- and multi-session analysis.
We release the source code, experimental protocol details, and pre-trained models in GitHub to
advance in the field.

Extracting main content from web pages provides primary informative blocks that remove a web page's
minor areas like navigation menu, ads, and site templates. The main content extraction has various
applications: information retrieval, search engine optimization, and browser reader mode. We
assessed the existing four main content extraction methods (Readability.js, Chrome DOM Distiller,
Web2Text, and Boilernet) with the web pages of two English datasets from global websites of 2017
and 2020 and seven non-English datasets by languages of 2020. Its result showed that performance
was lower by up to 40% in non-English datasets than in English datasets. Thus, this paper proposes
a multilingual main content extraction method using visual features: the elements' positions,
size, and distances from three centers. These centers were derived from the browser window, web
document, and the first browsing area. We propose this first browsing area, which is the top side
of a web document for simulating situations where a user first encountered a web page. Because web
page authors placed their main contents in the central area for the web page's usability, we can assume
the center of this area is close to the main content. Our grid-centering-expanding (GCE) method
suggests the three centroids as hypothetical user foci. Traversing the DOM tree from each of the
leaf nodes closest to these centroids, our method inspects which the ancestor node can be the main
content candidate. Finally, it extracts the main content by selecting the best among the three main
content candidates. Our method performed 14% better than the existing method on average in Longest
Common Subsequence F1 score. In particular, it improved performance by up to 25% in the English dataset
and 16% in the non-English dataset. Therefore, our method showed the visual and basic HTML features
are effective in extracting the main content.

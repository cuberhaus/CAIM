Overcoming the link blockage challenges is essential for enhancing the reliability and latency
of millimeter wave (mmWave) and sub-terahertz (sub-THz) communication networks. Previous approaches
relied mainly on either (i) multiple-connectivity, which under-utilizes the network resources,
or on (ii) the use of out-of-band and non-RF sensors to predict link blockages, which is associated
with increased cost and system complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel solution that relies
only on in-band mmWave wireless measurements to proactively predict future dynamic line-of-sight
(LOS) link blockages. The proposed solution utilizes deep neural networks and special patterns
of received signal power, that we call pre-blockage wireless signatures to infer future blockages.
Specifically, the developed machine learning models attempt to predict: (i) If a future blockage
will occur? (ii) When will this blockage happen? (iii) What is the type of the blockage? And (iv) what
is the direction of the moving blockage? To evaluate our proposed approach, we build a large-scale
real-world dataset comprising nearly $0.5$ million data points (mmWave measurements) for both
indoor and outdoor blockage scenarios. The results, using this dataset, show that the proposed
approach can successfully predict the occurrence of future dynamic blockages with more than 85\%
accuracy. Further, for the outdoor scenario with highly-mobile vehicular blockages, the proposed
model can predict the exact time of the future blockage with less than $80$ms error for blockages
happening within the future $500$ms. These results, among others, highlight the promising gains
of the proposed proactive blockage prediction solution which could potentially enhance the reliability
and latency of future wireless networks.

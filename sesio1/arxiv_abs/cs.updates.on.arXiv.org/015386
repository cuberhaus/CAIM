In the process industry, condition monitoring systems with automated fault diagnosis methods
assisthuman experts and thereby improve maintenance efficiency, process sustainability, and
workplace safety.Improving the automated fault diagnosis methods using data and machine learning-based
models is a centralaspect of intelligent fault diagnosis (IFD). A major challenge in IFD is to develop
realistic datasets withaccurate labels needed to train and validate models, and to transfer models
trained with labeled lab datato heterogeneous process industry environments. However, fault
descriptions and work-orders written bydomain experts are increasingly digitized in modern condition
monitoring systems, for example in the contextof rotating equipment monitoring. Thus, domain-specific
knowledge about fault characteristics and severitiesexists as technical language annotations
in industrial datasets. Furthermore, recent advances in naturallanguage processing enable weakly
supervised model optimization using natural language annotations, mostnotably in the form ofnatural
language supervision(NLS). This creates a timely opportunity to developtechnical language supervision(TLS)
solutions for IFD systems grounded in industrial data, for exampleas a complement to pre-training
with lab data to address problems like overfitting and inaccurate out-of-sample generalisation.
We surveyed the literature and identify a considerable improvement in the maturityof NLS over the
last two years, facilitating applications beyond natural language; a rapid development ofweak
supervision methods; and transfer learning as a current trend in IFD which can benefit from thesedevelopments.
Finally, we describe a framework for integration of TLS in IFD which is inspired by recentNLS innovations.

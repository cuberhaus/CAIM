Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) surfaces are commonly used within Computer-Aided Design
(CAD) tools to represent geometric objects. When using isogeometric analysis (IGA), it is possible
to use such NURBS geometries for numerical analysis directly. Analyzing fluid flows, however,
requires complex three-dimensional geometries to represent flow domains. Defining a parametrization
of such volumetric domains using NURBS can be challenging and is still an ongoing topic in the IGA
community. With the recently developed NURBS-enhanced finite element method (NEFEM), the favorable
geometric characteristics of NURBS are used within a standard finite element method. This is achieved
by enhancing the elements touching the boundary by using the NURBS geometry itself. In the current
work, a new variation of NEFEM is introduced, which is suitable for three-dimensional space-time
finite element formulations. The proposed method makes use of a new mapping which results in a non-Cartesian
formulation suitable for fluid-structure interaction (FSI). This is demonstrated by combining
the method with an IGA formulation in a strongly-coupled partitioned framework for solving FSI
problems. The framework yields a fully spline-based representation of the fluid-structure interface
through a single NURBS. The coupling conditions at the fluid-structure interface are enforced
through a Robin-Neumann type coupling scheme. This scheme is particularly useful when considering
incompressible fluids in fully Dirichlet-bounded and curved problems, as it satisfies the incompressibility
constraint on the fluid for each step within the coupling procedure. The accuracy and performance
of the introduced spline-based space-time finite element approach and its use within the proposed
coupled FSI framework are demonstrated using a series of two- and three-dimensional benchmark
problems.

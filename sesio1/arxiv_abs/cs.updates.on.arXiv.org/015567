Session-based recommendation aims to predict a user's next action based on previous actions in
the current session. The major challenge is to capture authentic and complete user preferences
in the entire session. Recent work utilizes graph structure to represent the entire session and
adopts Graph Neural Network to encode session information. This modeling choice has been proved
to be effective and achieved remarkable results. However, most of the existing studies only consider
each item within the session independently and do not capture session semantics from a high-level
perspective. Such limitation often leads to severe information loss and increases the difficulty
of capturing long-range dependencies within a session. Intuitively, compared with individual
items, a session snippet, i.e., a group of locally consecutive items, is able to provide supplemental
user intents which are hardly captured by existing methods. In this work, we propose to learn multi-granularity
consecutive user intent unit to improve the recommendation performance. Specifically, we creatively
propose Multi-granularity Intent Heterogeneous Session Graph which captures the interactions
between different granularity intent units and relieves the burden of long-dependency. Moreover,
we propose the Intent Fusion Ranking module to compose the recommendation results from various
granularity user intents. Compared with current methods that only leverage intents from individual
items, IFR benefits from different granularity user intents to generate more accurate and comprehensive
session representation, thus eventually boosting recommendation performance. We conduct extensive
experiments on five session-based recommendation datasets and the results demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method.

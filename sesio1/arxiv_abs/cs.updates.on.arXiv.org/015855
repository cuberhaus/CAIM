Drones are begin used for various purposes such as border security, surveillance, cargo delivery,
visual shows and it is not possible to overcome such intensive tasks with a single drone. In order
to expedite performing such tasks, drone swarms are employed. The number of drones in a swarm can
be high depending on the assigned duty. The current solution to authenticate a single drone using
a 5G new radio (NR) network requires the execution of two steps. The first step covers the authentication
between a drone and the 5G core network, and the second step is the authentication between the drone
and the drone control station. It is not feasible to authenticate each drone in a swarm with the current
solution without causing a significant latency. Authentication keys between a base station (BS)
and a user equipment (UE) must be shared with the new BS while performing handover. The drone swarms
are heavily mobile and require several handovers from BS to a new BS. Sharing authentication keys
for each drone as explained in 5G NR is not scalable for the drone swarms. Also, the drones can be used
as a UE or a radio access node on board unmanned aerial vehicle (UxNB). A UxNB may provide service to
a drone swarm in a rural area or emergency. The number of handovers may increase and the process of
sharing authentication keys between UxNB to new UxNB may be vulnerable to eavesdropping due to the
wireless connectivity. In this work, we present a method where the time and the number of the communication
for the authentication of a new drone joining the swarm are less than 5G NR. In addition, group-based
handover solutions for the scenarios in which the base stations are terrestrial or mobile are proposed
to overcome the scalability and latency issues in the 5G NR.

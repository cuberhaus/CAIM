We introduce a new metric ($W_\nu$ $\nu$-based Wasserstein metric) on the set of probability measures
on $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^m$, based on a slight refinement of the notion of generalized geodesics
with respect to a base measure $\nu$, relevant in particular for the case when $\nu$ is singular with
respect to $m$-dimensional Lebesgue measure. $W_\nu$ is defined in terms of an iterated variational
problem involving optimal transport to $\nu$; we also characterize it in terms of integrations
of classical Wasserstein distance between the conditional probabilities with respect to $\nu$,
and through limits of certain multi-marginal optimal transport problems. We also introduce a class
of metrics which are dual in a certain sense to $W_\nu$ on the set of measures which are absolutely
continuous with respect to a second fixed based measure $\sigma$.As we vary the base measure $\nu$,
$W_\nu$ interpolates between the usual quadratic Wasserstein distance and a metric associated
with the uniquely defined generalized geodesics obtained when $\nu$ is sufficiently regular.
When $\nu$ concentrates on a lower dimensional submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^m$, we prove that the
variational problem in the definition of the $\nu$-based Wasserstein distance has a unique solution.
We establish geodesic convexity of the usual class of functionals and of the set of source measures
$\mu$ such that optimal transport between $\mu$ and $\nu$ satisfies a strengthening of the generalized
nestedness condition introduced in \cite{McCannPass20}. We also present two applications of
the ideas introduced here. First, our dual metric is used to prove convergence of an iterative scheme
to solve a variational problem arising in game theory. We also use the multi-marginal formulation
to characterize solutions to the multi-marginal problem by an ordinary differential equation,
yielding a new numerical method for it.

Spectral super-resolution (SSR) refers to the hyperspectral image (HSI) recovery from an RGB counterpart.
Due to the one-to-many nature of the SSR problem, a single RGB image can be reprojected to many HSIs.
The key to tackle this ill-posed problem is to plug into multi-source prior information such as the
natural spatial context-prior of RGB images, deep feature-prior or inherent statistical-prior
of HSIs, etc., so as to effectively alleviate the degree of ill-posedness. However, most current
approaches only consider the general and limited priors in their customized convolutional neural
networks (CNNs), which leads to the inability to guarantee the confidence and fidelity of reconstructed
spectra. In this paper, we propose a novel holistic prior-embedded relation network (HPRN) to integrate
comprehensive priors to regularize and optimize the solution space of SSR. Basically, the core
framework is delicately assembled by several multi-residual relation blocks (MRBs) that fully
facilitate the transmission and utilization of the low-frequency content prior of RGBs. Innovatively,
the semantic prior of RGB inputs is introduced to mark category attributes, and a semantic-driven
spatial relation module (SSRM) is invented to perform the feature aggregation of clustered similar
range for refining recovered characteristics. Additionally, we develop a transformer-based
channel relation module (TCRM), which breaks the habit of employing scalars as the descriptors
of channel-wise relations in the previous deep feature-prior, and replaces them with certain vectors
to make the mapping function more robust and smoother. In order to maintain the mathematical correlation
and spectral consistency between hyperspectral bands, the second-order prior constraints (SOPC)
are incorporated into the loss function to guide the HSI reconstruction.

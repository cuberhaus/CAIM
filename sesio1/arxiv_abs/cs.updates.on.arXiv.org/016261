Fake news is an age-old phenomenon, widely assumed to be associated with political propaganda published
to sway public opinion. Yet, with the growth of social media it has become a lucrative business for
web publishers. Despite many studies performed and countermeasures deployed from researchers
and stakeholders, unreliable news sites have increased their share of engagement among the top
performing news sources in last years. Indeed, stifling fake news impact depends on the efforts
from the society, and the market, in limiting the (economic) incentives of fake news producers.
In this paper, we aim at enhancing the transparency around these exact incentives and explore the
following main questions: Who supports the existence of fake news websites via paid ads, either
as an advertiser or an ad seller? Who owns these websites and what other Web business are they into?
What tracking activity do they perform in these websites? Aiming to answer these questions, we are
the first to systematize the auditing process of fake news revenue flows. We develop a novel ad detection
methodology to identify the companies that advertise in fake news websites and the intermediary
companies responsible for facilitating those ad revenues. We study more than 2400 popular fake
and real news websites and show that well-known legitimate ad networks, such as of Google, IndexExchange,
and AppNexus, have a direct advertising relation with more than 40% of these fake news websites,
and a re-seller advertising relation with more than 60% of them. Using a graph clustering approach
on an extended set of 114.5K sites connected with 443K edges, we show that entities who own fake news
websites, also own (or operate) other types of websites for entertainment, business, and politics,
pointing to the fact that owning a fake news website is part of a broader business operation.

The worldwide adoption of cloud data centers (CDCs) has given rise to the ubiquitous demand for hosting
application services on the cloud. Further, contemporary data-intensive industries have seen
a sharp upsurge in the resource requirements of modern applications. This has led to the provisioning
of an increased number of cloud servers, giving rise to higher energy consumption and, consequently,
sustainability concerns. Traditional heuristics and reinforcement learning based algorithms
for energy-efficient cloud resource management address the scalability and adaptability related
challenges to a limited extent. Existing work often fails to capture dependencies across thermal
characteristics of hosts, resource consumption of tasks and the corresponding scheduling decisions.
This leads to poor scalability and an increase in the compute resource requirements, particularly
in environments with non-stationary resource demands. To address these limitations, we propose
an artificial intelligence (AI) based holistic resource management technique for sustainable
cloud computing called HUNTER. The proposed model formulates the goal of optimizing energy efficiency
in data centers as a multi-objective scheduling problem, considering three important models:
energy, thermal and cooling. HUNTER utilizes a Gated Graph Convolution Network as a surrogate model
for approximating the Quality of Service (QoS) for a system state and generating optimal scheduling
decisions. Experiments on simulated and physical cloud environments using the CloudSim toolkit
and the COSCO framework show that HUNTER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of energy
consumption, SLA violation, scheduling time, cost and temperature by up to 12, 35, 43, 54 and 3 percent
respectively.

Purpose: To develop a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) model for visualizing deep neural
network (DNN) behavior during multi-parametric MRI (mp-MRI) based glioma segmentation as a method
to enhance deep learning explainability. Methods: By hypothesizing that deep feature extraction
can be modeled as a spatiotemporally continuous process, we designed a novel deep learning model,
neural ODE, in which deep feature extraction was governed by an ODE without explicit expression.
The dynamics of 1) MR images after interactions with DNN and 2) segmentation formation can be visualized
after solving ODE. An accumulative contribution curve (ACC) was designed to quantitatively evaluate
the utilization of each MRI by DNN towards the final segmentation results. The proposed neural ODE
model was demonstrated using 369 glioma patients with a 4-modality mp-MRI protocol: T1, contrast-enhanced
T1 (T1-Ce), T2, and FLAIR. Three neural ODE models were trained to segment enhancing tumor (ET),
tumor core (TC), and whole tumor (WT). The key MR modalities with significant utilization by DNN
were identified based on ACC analysis. Segmentation results by DNN using only the key MR modalities
were compared to the ones using all 4 MR modalities. Results: All neural ODE models successfully
illustrated image dynamics as expected. ACC analysis identified T1-Ce as the only key modality
in ET and TC segmentations, while both FLAIR and T2 were key modalities in WT segmentation. Compared
to the U-Net results using all 4 MR modalities, Dice coefficient of ET (0.784->0.775), TC (0.760->0.758),
and WT (0.841->0.837) using the key modalities only had minimal differences without significance.
Conclusion: The neural ODE model offers a new tool for optimizing the deep learning model inputs
with enhanced explainability. The presented methodology can be generalized to other medical image-related
deep learning applications.

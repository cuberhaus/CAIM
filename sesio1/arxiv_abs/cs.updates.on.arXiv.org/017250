Recent advancement in the field of pervasive healthcare monitoring systems causes the generation
of a huge amount of lifelog data in real-time. Chronic diseases are one of the most serious health
challenges in developing and developed countries. According to WHO, this accounts for 73% of all
deaths and 60% of the global burden of diseases. Chronic disease classification models are now harnessing
the potential of lifelog data to explore better healthcare practices. This paper is to construct
an optimal feature selection-based unsupervised logistic regression model (OFS-ULR) to classify
chronic diseases. Since lifelog data analysis is crucial due to its sensitive nature; thus the conventional
classification models show limited performance. Therefore, designing new classifiers for the
classification of chronic diseases using lifelog data is the need of the age. The vital part of building
a good model depends on pre-processing of the dataset, identifying important features, and then
training a learning algorithm with suitable hyper parameters for better performance. The proposed
approach improves the performance of existing methods using a series of steps such as (i) removing
redundant or invalid instances, (ii) making the data labelled using clustering and partitioning
the data into classes, (iii) identifying the suitable subset of features by applying either some
domain knowledge or selection algorithm, (iv) hyper parameter tuning for models to get best results,
and (v) performance evaluation using Spark streaming environment. For this purpose, two-time
series datasets are used in the experiment to compute the accuracy, recall, precision, and f1-score.
The experimental analysis proves the suitability of the proposed approach as compared to the conventional
classifiers and our newly constructed model achieved highest accuracy and reduced training complexity
among all among all.

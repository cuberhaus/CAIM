High dimensional parameter space optimization is crucial in many applications. The parameters
affecting this performance can be both numerical and categorical in their type. The existing techniques
of black-box optimization and visual analytics are good in dealing with numerical parameters but
analyzing categorical variables in context of the numerical variables are not well studied. Hence,
we propose a novel approach, to create an auto-tuning framework for storage systems optimization
combining both direct optimization techniques and visual analytics research. While the optimization
algorithm will be the core of the system, visual analytics will provide a guideline with the help
of an external agent (expert) to provide crucial hints to narrow down the large search space for the
optimization engine. As part of the initial step towards creating an auto-tuning engine for storage
systems optimization, we created an Interactive Configuration Explorer \textit{ICE}, which
directly addresses the need of analysts to learn how the dependent numerical variable is affected
by the parameter settings given multiple optimization objectives. No information is lost as ICE
shows the complete distribution and statistics of the dependent variable in context with each categorical
variable. Analysts can interactively filter the variables to optimize for certain goals such as
achieving a system with maximum performance, low variance, etc. Our system was developed in tight
collaboration with a group of systems performance researchers and its final effectiveness was
evaluated with expert interviews, a comparative user study, and two case studies. We also discuss
our research plan for creating an efficient auto-tuning framework combining black-box optimization
and visual analytics for storage systems performance optimization.

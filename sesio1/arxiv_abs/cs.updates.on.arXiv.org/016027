Registration of unmanned aerial vehicle laser scanning (ULS) and ground light detection and ranging
(LiDAR) point clouds in forests is critical to create a detailed representation of a forest structure
and an accurate inversion of forest parameters. However, forest occlusion poses challenges for
marker-based registration methods, and some marker-free automated registration methods have
low efficiency due to the process of object (e.g., tree, crown) segmentation. Therefore, we use
a divide-and-conquer strategy and propose an automated and efficient method to register ULS and
ground LiDAR point clouds in forests. Registration involves coarse alignment and fine registration,
where the coarse alignment of point clouds is divided into vertical and horizontal alignment. The
vertical alignment is achieved by ground alignment, which is achieved by the transformation relationship
between normal vectors of the ground point cloud and the horizontal plane, and the horizontal alignment
is achieved by canopy projection image matching. During image matching, vegetation points are
first distinguished by the ground filtering algorithm, and then, vegetation points are projected
onto the horizontal plane to obtain two binary images. To match the two images, a matching strategy
is used based on canopy shape context features, which are described by a two-point congruent set
and canopy overlap. Finally, we implement coarse alignment of ULS and ground LiDAR datasets by combining
the results of ground alignment and image matching and finish fine registration. Also, the effectiveness,
accuracy, and efficiency of the proposed method are demonstrated by field measurements of forest
plots. Experimental results show that the ULS and ground LiDAR data in different plots are registered,
of which the horizontal alignment errors are less than 0.02 m, and the average runtime of the proposed
method is less than 1 second.

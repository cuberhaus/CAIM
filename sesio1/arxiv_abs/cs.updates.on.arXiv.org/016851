We consider ideals involving the maximal minors of a polynomial matrix. For example, those arising
in the computation of the critical values of a polynomial restricted to a variety for polynomial
optimisation. Gr\"obner bases are a classical tool for solving polynomial systems. For practical
computations, this consists of two stages. First, a Gr\"obner basis is computed with respect to
a DRL (degree reverse lexicographic) ordering. Then, a change of ordering algorithm, such as \textsf{Sparse-FGLM},
designed by Faug\`ere and Mou, is used to find a Gr\"obner basis of the same ideal but with respect
to a lexicographic ordering. The complexity of this latter step, in terms of arithmetic operations,
is $O(mD^2)$, where $D$ is the degree of the ideal and $m$ is the number of non-trivial columns of a
certain $D \times D$ matrix. While asymptotic estimates are known for $m$ for generic polynomial
systems, thus far, the complexity of \textsf{Sparse-FGLM} was unknown for determinantal systems.
By assuming Fr\"oberg's conjecture we expand the work of Moreno-Soc\'ias by detailing the structure
of the DRL staircase in the determinantal setting. Then we study the asymptotics of the quantity
$m$ by relating it to the coefficients of these Hilbert series. Consequently, we arrive at a new bound
on the complexity of the \textsf{Sparse-FGLM} algorithm for generic determinantal systems and
for generic critical point systems. We consider the ideal in the polynomial ring $\mathbb{K}[x_1,
\dots, x_n]$, where $\mathbb{K}$ is some infinite field, generated by $p$ generic polynomials
of degree $d$ and the maximal minors of a $p \times (n-1)$ polynomial matrix with generic entries
of degree $d-1$. Then for the case $d=2$ and for $n \gg p$ we give an exact formula for $m$ in terms of
$n$ and $p$. Moreover, for $d \geq 3$, we give an asymptotic formula, as $n \to \infty$, for $m$ in terms
of $n,p$ and $d$.

Introduction: Active commuting has been recommended as a method to increase population physical
activity, but evidence is mixed. Social norms related to travel behaviour may influence the uptake
of active commuting interventions but are rarely considered in the design and evaluation of interventions.
Methods: We developed an agent-based model that incorporates social norms related to travel behaviour
and demonstrate the utility of this through implementing car-free Wednesdays. A synthetic population
of Waltham Forest, London, UK was generated using a microsimulation approach with data from the
UK Census 2011 and UK HLS datasets. An agent-based model was created using this synthetic population
which modelled how the actions of peers and neighbours, subculture, habit, weather, bicycle ownership,
car ownership, environmental supportiveness, and congestion affect the decision to travel between
four modes: walking, cycling, driving, and taking public transport. Results: In the control scenario,
the odds of active travel were plausible at 0.091 (89% HPDI: [0.091, 0.091]). Compared to the control
scenario, the odds of active travel were increased by 70.3% (89% HPDI: [70.3%, 70.3%]), in the intervention
scenario, on non-car-free days; the effect of the intervention is sustained to non-car-free days.
Discussion: While these results demonstrate the utility of our agent-based model, rather than
aim to make accurate predictions, they do suggest that by there being a 'nudge' of car-free days,
there may be a sustained change in active commuting behaviour. The model is a useful tool for investigating
the effect of how social networks and social norms influence the effectiveness of various interventions.
If configured using real-world built environment data, it may be useful for investigating how social
norms interact with the built environment to cause the emergence of commuting conventions.

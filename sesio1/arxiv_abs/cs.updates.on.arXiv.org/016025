Given a sequence of random (directed and weighted) graphs, we address the problem of online monitoring
and detection of changes in the underlying data distribution. Our idea is to endow sequential change-point
detection (CPD) techniques with a graph representation learning substrate based on the versatile
Random Dot Product Graph (RDPG) model. We consider efficient, online updates of a judicious monitoring
function, which quantifies the discrepancy between the streaming graph observations and the nominal
RDPG. This reference distribution is inferred via spectral embeddings of the first few graphs in
the sequence. We characterize the distribution of this running statistic to select thresholds
that guarantee error-rate control, and under simplifying approximations we offer insights on
the algorithm's detection resolution and delay. The end result is a lightweight online CPD algorithm,
that is also explainable by virtue of the well-appreciated interpretability of RDPG embeddings.
This is in stark contrast with most existing graph CPD approaches, which either rely on extensive
computation, or they store and process the entire observed time series. An apparent limitation
of the RDPG model is its suitability for undirected and unweighted graphs only, a gap we aim to close
here to broaden the scope of the CPD framework. Unlike previous proposals, our non-parametric RDPG
model for weighted graphs does not require a priori specification of the weights' distribution
to perform inference and estimation. This network modeling contribution is of independent interest
beyond CPD. We offer an open-source implementation of the novel online CPD algorithm for weighted
and direct graphs, whose effectiveness and efficiency are demonstrated via (reproducible) synthetic
and real network data experiments.

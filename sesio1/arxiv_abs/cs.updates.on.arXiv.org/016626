This paper addresses poor cluster formation and frequent Cluster Head (CH) failure issues of underwater
sensor networks by proposing an energy-efficient hierarchical topology-aware clustering routing
(EEHTAC) protocol. In this paper, fault-tolerant backup clustering (FTBC) algorithms and multi-parameter
cluster formation (MPCF) model were developed for the EEHTAC operation. The MPCF model tackles
the issue of poor cluster formation performance by integrating multiple parameters to achieve
effective clustering process. The FTBC algorithms tackle the issue of frequent CH failures to avoid
interruption in data transmission. Performance of the MPCF model was evaluated using normal, high-fault,
and high routing overhead network scenarios. Performance metrics employed for this analysis are
temporal topology variation ratio (TTVR), CH load distribution (CLD), and cluster stability (STB).
Obtained results show that operating with a CH retention period of 90s achieves better CH duty cycling
per round and improves the MPCF process with values of 25.69%, 55.56%, and 60% for TTVR, CLD, and STB
respectively. Performance of the FTBC-based EEHTAC was evaluated relative to Energy-balanced
Unequal Layering Clustering (EULC) protocol. Performance indicators adopted for this evaluation
are routing overhead ({\Omega}), end to end delay ({\Delta}), CH failures recovered (CFR), CH failures
detected (CFD), received packets ({\theta}), and energy consumption ({\Sigma}). With reference
to the best obtained values, EEHTAC demonstrated performance improvement of 58.40%, 29.94%, 81.33%,
28.02%, 86.65%, and 54.35% over EULC variants in terms of {\Omega}, {\Delta}, CFR, CFD, {\theta},
and {\Sigma} respectively. Obtained results displayed that the MPCF model is efficient for cluster
formation performance and the FTBC-based EEHTAC protocol can perform effectively well against
an existing CBR protocol.

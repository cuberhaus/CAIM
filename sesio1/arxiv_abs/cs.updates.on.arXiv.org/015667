Infrared small target super-resolution (SR) aims to recover reliable and detailed high-resolution
image with highcontrast targets from its low-resolution counterparts. Since the infrared small
target lacks color and fine structure information, it is significant to exploit the supplementary
information among sequence images to enhance the target. In this paper, we propose the first infrared
small target SR method named local motion and contrast prior driven deep network (MoCoPnet) to integrate
the domain knowledge of infrared small target into deep network, which can mitigate the intrinsic
feature scarcity of infrared small targets. Specifically, motivated by the local motion prior
in the spatio-temporal dimension, we propose a local spatiotemporal attention module to perform
implicit frame alignment and incorporate the local spatio-temporal information to enhance the
local features (especially for small targets). Motivated by the local contrast prior in the spatial
dimension, we propose a central difference residual group to incorporate the central difference
convolution into the feature extraction backbone, which can achieve center-oriented gradient-aware
feature extraction to further improve the target contrast. Extensive experiments have demonstrated
that our method can recover accurate spatial dependency and improve the target contrast. Comparative
results show that MoCoPnet can outperform the state-of-the-art video SR and single image SR methods
in terms of both SR performance and target enhancement. Based on the SR results, we further investigate
the influence of SR on infrared small target detection and the experimental results demonstrate
that MoCoPnet promotes the detection performance. The code is available at https://github.com/XinyiYing/MoCoPnet.

Accurate segmentation of electron microscopy (EM) volumes of the brain is essential to characterize
neuronal structures at a cell or organelle level. While supervised deep learning methods have led
to major breakthroughs in that direction during the past years, they usually require large amounts
of annotated data to be trained, and perform poorly on other data acquired under similar experimental
and imaging conditions. This is a problem known as domain adaptation, since models that learned
from a sample distribution (or source domain) struggle to maintain their performance on samples
extracted from a different distribution or target domain. In this work, we address the complex case
of deep learning based domain adaptation for mitochondria segmentation across EM datasets from
different tissues and species. We present three unsupervised domain adaptation strategies to
improve mitochondria segmentation in the target domain based on (1) state-of-the-art style transfer
between images of both domains; (2) self-supervised learning to pre-train a model using unlabeled
source and target images, and then fine-tune it only with the source labels; and (3) multi-task neural
network architectures trained end-to-end with both labeled and unlabeled images. Additionally,
we propose a new training stopping criterion based on morphological priors obtained exclusively
in the source domain. We carried out all possible cross-dataset experiments using three publicly
available EM datasets. We evaluated our proposed strategies on the mitochondria semantic labels
predicted on the target datasets. The methods introduced here outperform the baseline methods
and compare favorably to the state of the art. In the absence of validation labels, monitoring our
proposed morphology-based metric is an intuitive and effective way to stop the training process
and select in average optimal models.

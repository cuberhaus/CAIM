We propose a new technique for creating a space-efficient index for large repetitive text collections,
such as pangenomic databases containing sequences of many individuals from the same species. We
combine two recent techniques from this area: Wheeler graphs (Gagie et al., 2017) and prefix-free
parsing (PFP, Boucher et al., 2019). Wheeler graphs (WGs) are a general framework encompassing
several indexes based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT), such as the FM-index. Wheeler graphs
admit a succinct representation which can be further compacted by employing the idea of tunnelling,
which exploits redundancies in the form of parallel, equally-labelled paths called blocks that
can be merged into a single path. The problem of finding the optimal set of blocks for tunnelling,
i.e. the one that minimizes the size of the resulting WG, is known to be NP-complete and remains the
most computationally challenging part of the tunnelling process. To find an adequate set of blocks
in less time, we propose a new method based on the prefix-free parsing (PFP). The idea of PFP is to divide
the input text into phrases of roughly equal sizes that overlap by a fixed number of characters. The
original text is represented by a sequence of phrase ranks (the parse) and a list of all used phrases
(the dictionary). In repetitive texts, the PFP of the text is generally much shorter than the original.
To speed up the block selection for tunnelling, we apply the PFP to obtain the parse and the dictionary
of the text, tunnel the WG of the parse using existing heuristics and subsequently use this tunnelled
parse to construct a compact WG of the original text. Compared with constructing a WG from the original
text without PFP, our method is much faster and uses less memory on collections of pangenomic sequences.
Therefore, our method enables the use of WGs as a pangenomic reference for real-world datasets.

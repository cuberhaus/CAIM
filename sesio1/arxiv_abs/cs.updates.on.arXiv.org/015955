Cross-view geo-localization is a task of matching the same geographic image from different views,
e.g., unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and satellite. The most difficult challenges are the position
shift and the uncertainty of distance and scale. Existing methods are mainly aimed at digging for
more comprehensive fine-grained information. However, it underestimates the importance of extracting
robust feature representation and the impact of feature alignment. The CNN-based methods have
achieved great success in cross-view geo-localization. However it still has some limitations,
e.g., it can only extract part of the information in the neighborhood and some scale reduction operations
will make some fine-grained information lost. In particular, we introduce a simple and efficient
transformer-based structure called Feature Segmentation and Region Alignment (FSRA) to enhance
the model's ability to understand contextual information as well as to understand the distribution
of instances. Without using additional supervisory information, FSRA divides regions based on
the heat distribution of the transformer's feature map, and then aligns multiple specific regions
in different views one on one. Finally, FSRA integrates each region into a set of feature representations.
The difference is that FSRA does not divide regions manually, but automatically based on the heat
distribution of the feature map. So that specific instances can still be divided and aligned when
there are significant shifts and scale changes in the image. In addition, a multiple sampling strategy
is proposed to overcome the disparity in the number of satellite images and that of images from other
sources. Experiments show that the proposed method has superior performance and achieves the state-of-the-art
in both tasks of drone view target localization and drone navigation. Code will be released at https://github.com/Dmmm1997/FSRA

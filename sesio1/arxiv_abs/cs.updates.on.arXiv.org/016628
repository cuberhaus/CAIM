Purpose: We model group advertising decisions, which are the collective decisions of every single
advertiser within the set of advertisers who are competing in the same auction or vertical industry,
and examine resulting market outcomes, via a proposed simulation framework named EXP-SEA (Experimental
Platform for Search Engine Advertising) supporting experimental studies of collective behaviors
in the context of search engine advertising. Design: We implement the EXP-SEA to validate the proposed
simulation framework, also conduct three experimental studies on the aggregate impact of electronic
word-of-mouth, the competition level, and strategic bidding behaviors. EXP-SEA supports heterogeneous
participants, various auction mechanisms, and also ranking and pricing algorithms. Findings:
Findings from our three experiments show that (a) both the market profit and advertising indexes
such as number of impressions and number of clicks are larger when the eWOM effect presents, meaning
social media certainly has some effect on search engine advertising outcomes, (b) the competition
level has a monotonic increasing effect on the market performance, thus search engines have an incentive
to encourage both the eWOM among search users and competition among advertisers, and (c) given the
market-level effect of the percentage of advertisers employing a dynamic greedy bidding strategy,
there is a cut-off point for strategic bidding behaviors. Originality: This is one of the first research
works to explore collective group decisions and resulting phenomena in the complex context of search
engine advertising via developing and validating a simulation framework that supports assessments
of various advertising strategies and estimations of the impact of mechanisms on the search market.

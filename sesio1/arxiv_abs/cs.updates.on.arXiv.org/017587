Although remarkable progress has been made by the existing federated learning (FL) platforms to
provide fundamental functionalities for development, these platforms cannot well tackle the
challenges brought by the heterogeneity of FL scenarios from both academia and industry. To fill
this gap, in this paper, we propose a flexible federated learning platform, named FederatedScope,
for handling various types of heterogeneity in FL. Considering both flexibility and extendability,
FederatedScope adopts an event-driven architecture to conveniently support asynchronous training
protocol in practical FL applications, and abstracts the exchanged information as messages and
the behaviors of participants as handling functions. For a new FL application, developers only
need to specify the adopted FL algorithm by defining new types of exchanged messages and the corresponding
handling functions based on participants' behaviors, which would be automatically executed in
an asynchronous way for balancing effectiveness and efficiency in FederatedScope. Meanwhile,
towards an easy-to-use platform, FederatedScope provides rich built-in algorithms, including
personalization, federated aggregation, privacy protection, and privacy attack, for users to
conveniently customize participant-specific training, fusing, aggregating, and protecting.
Besides, a federated hyperparameter optimization module is integrated into FederatedScope for
users to automatically tune their FL systems for resolving the unstable issues brought by heterogeneity.
We conduct a series of experiments on the provided easy-to-use and comprehensive FL benchmarks
to validate the correctness and efficiency of FederatedScope. We have released FederatedScope
for users on https://github.com/alibaba/FederatedScope to promote research and industrial
deployment of federated learning in a variety of real-world applications.

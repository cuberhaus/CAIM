Enterprises have paid attention to consortium blockchains like Hyperledger Fabric, which is one
of the most promising platforms, for efficient decentralized transactions without depending
on any particular organization. A consortium blockchain-based system will be typically built
across multiple organizations. In such blockchain-based systems, system operations across multiple
organizations in a decentralized manner are essential to maintain the value of introducing consortium
blockchains. Decentralized system operations have recently been becoming realistic with the
evolution of consortium blockchains. For instance, the release of Hyperledger Fabric v2.x, in
which individual operational tasks for a blockchain network, such as command execution of configuration
change of channels (Fabric's sub-networks) and upgrade of chaincodes (Fabric's smart contracts),
can be partially executed in a decentralized manner. However, the operations workflows also include
the preceding procedure of pre-sharing, coordinating, and pre-agreeing the operational information
(e.g., configuration parameters) among organizations, after which operation executions can
be conducted, and this preceding procedure relies on costly manual tasks. To realize efficient
decentralized operations workflows for consortium blockchain-based systems in general, we propose
a decentralized inter-organizational operations method that we call Operations Smart Contract
(OpsSC), which defines an operations workflow as a smart contract. Furthermore, we design and implement
OpsSC for blockchain network operations with Hyperledger Fabric v2.x. This paper presents OpsSC
for operating channels and chaincodes, which are essential for managing the blockchain networks,
through clarifying detailed workflows of those operations. The implementation of OpsSC has been
open-sourced and registered as one of Hyperledger Labs projects.

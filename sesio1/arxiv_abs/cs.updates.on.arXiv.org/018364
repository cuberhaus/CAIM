The Quantum CONGEST model is a variant of the CONGEST model, where messages consist of $O(\log(n))$
qubits. We give a general framework for implementing quantum query algorithms in Quantum CONGEST,
using the concept of parallel-queries. We apply our framework for distributed quantum queries
in two settings: when data is distributed over the network, and graph theoretical problems where
the network defines the input. The first is slightly unusual in CONGEST but our results follow almost
directly. The second is more traditional for the CONGEST model but here we require some classical
CONGEST steps to get our results. In the setting with distributed data, we show how a network can schedule
a meeting in one of $k$ dates using $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{kD}+D)$ rounds, with $D$ the network diameter.
We also give an algorithm for element distinctness: if all nodes together hold a list of $k$ numbers,
they can find a duplicate in $\tilde O(k^{2/3}D^{1/3}+D)$ rounds. We also generalize the protocol
for the distributed Deutsch-Jozsa problem from the two-party setting considered in [arXiv:quant-ph/9802040]
to general networks, giving a novel separation between exact classical and exact quantum protocols
in CONGEST. When the input is the network structure itself, we almost directly recover the $O(\sqrt{nD})$
round diameter computation algorithm of Le Gall and Magniez [arXiv:1804.02917]. We also compute
the radius in the same number of rounds, and give an $\epsilon$-additive approximation of the average
eccentricity in $\tilde{O}(D+D^{3/2}/\epsilon)$ rounds. Finally, we give quantum speedups
for the problems of cycle detection and girth computation. We detect whether a graph has a cycle of
length at most $k$ in $O(k+(kn)^{1/2-1/\Theta(k)})$ rounds. For girth computation we give an $\tilde{O}(g+(gn)^{1/2-1/\Theta(g)})$
round algorithm for graphs with girth $g$, beating the known classical lower bound.

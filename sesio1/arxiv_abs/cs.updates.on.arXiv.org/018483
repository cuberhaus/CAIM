Differential GNSS (DGNSS) has been demonstrated to provide reliable, high-quality range correction
information enabling real-time navigation with centimeter to sub-meter accuracy, which is required
for applications such as connected and autonomous vehicles. However, DGNSS requires a local reference
station near each user. For a continental or global scale implementation, this information dissemination
approach would require a dense network of reference stations whose construction and maintenance
would be prohibitively expensive. Precise Point Positioning affords more flexibility as a public
service for GNSS receivers, but its State Space Representation format is not supported by most receivers
in the field or on the market. This article proposes a novel Virtual Network DGNSS (VN-DGNSS) approach
and an optimization algorithm that is key to its implementation. The approach capitalizes on the
existing PPP infrastructure without the need for new physical reference stations. By connecting
to public GNSS SSR data services, a VN-DGNSS server maintains current information about common-mode
errors. Construction of the RTCM Observation Space Representation messages from this SSR information
requires both the signal time-of-transmission and the satellite position at that time which are
consistent with the time-of-reception for each client. This article presents an algorithm to determine
these quantities. The results of real-time stationary and moving platform evaluations are included,
using u-blox M8P and ZED-F9P receivers. The performance surpasses the SAE specification (68% of
horizontal error <= 1.5 m and vertical error <= 3 m) and shows significantly better horizontal performance
than GNSS Open Service. The moving tests also show better horizontal performance than the ZED-F9P
receiver with SBAS enabled and achieve the lane-level accuracy (95% of horizontal errors less than
1 meter).

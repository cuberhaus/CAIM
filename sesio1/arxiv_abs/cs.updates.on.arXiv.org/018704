The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to cybersecurity challenges
has gained traction in industry and academia, partially as a result of widespread malware attacks
on critical systems such as cloud infrastructures and government institutions. Intrusion Detection
Systems (IDS), using some forms of AI, have received widespread adoption due to their ability to
handle vast amounts of data with a high prediction accuracy. These systems are hosted in the organizational
Cyber Security Operation Center (CSoC) as a defense tool to monitor and detect malicious network
flow that would otherwise impact the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA). CSoC
analysts rely on these systems to make decisions about the detected threats. However, IDSs designed
using Deep Learning (DL) techniques are often treated as black box models and do not provide a justification
for their predictions. This creates a barrier for CSoC analysts, as they are unable to improve their
decisions based on the model's predictions. One solution to this problem is to design explainable
IDS (X-IDS). This survey reviews the state-of-the-art in explainable AI (XAI) for IDS, its current
challenges, and discusses how these challenges span to the design of an X-IDS. In particular, we
discuss black box and white box approaches comprehensively. We also present the tradeoff between
these approaches in terms of their performance and ability to produce explanations. Furthermore,
we propose a generic architecture that considers human-in-the-loop which can be used as a guideline
when designing an X-IDS. Research recommendations are given from three critical viewpoints: the
need to define explainability for IDS, the need to create explanations tailored to various stakeholders,
and the need to design metrics to evaluate explanations.

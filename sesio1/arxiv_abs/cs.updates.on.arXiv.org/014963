Functional connectivity (FC) for quantifying interactions between regions of the brain is commonly
estimated from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). There has been increasing interest
in the potential of multimodal imaging to obtain more robust estimates of FC in high-dimensional
settings. Recent work has found uses for graphical algorithms in combining fMRI signals with structural
connectivity estimated from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for FC estimation. At the same time
new algorithms focused on de novo identification of graphical subnetworks with significant levels
of connectivity are finding other biological applications with great success. Such algorithms
develop notions of graphical influence that aid in revealing subnetworks of interest while maintaining
rigorous statistical control on discoveries. We develop a novel algorithm adapting some of these
methods to FC estimation with computational efficiency and scalability. Our proposed algorithm
leverages a graphical random walk on DTI data to define a new measure of structural influence that
highlights connected components of maximal interest. The subnetwork topology is then compared
to a suitable null hypothesis using permutation testing. Finally, individual discovered components
are tested for significance. Extensive simulations show our method is comparable in power to those
currently in use while being fast, robust, and simple to implement. We also analyze task-fMRI data
from the Human Connectome Project database and find novel insights into brain interactions during
the performance of a motor task. It is anticipated that the transparency and flexibility of our approach
will prove valuable as further understanding of the structure-function relationship informs
the future of network estimation. Scalability will also only become more important as neurological
data become more granular and grow in dimension.

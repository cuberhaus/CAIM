This study compares participant acceptance of the property graph and edge-labelled graph paradigms,
as represented by Cypher and the proposed extensions to the W3C standards, RDF* and SPARQL*. In general,
modelling preferences are consistent across the two paradigms. When presented with location information,
participants preferred to create nodes to represent cities, rather than use metadata; although
the preference was less marked for Cypher. In Cypher, participants showed little difference in
preference between representing dates or population size as nodes. In RDF*, this choice was not
necessary since both could be represented as literals. However, there was a significant preference
for using the date as metadata to describe a triple containing population size, rather than vice
versa. There was no significant difference overall in accuracy of interpretation of queries in
the two paradigms; although in one specific case, the use of a reverse arrow in Cypher was interpreted
significantly more accurately than the ^ symbol in SPARQL. Based on our results and on the comments
of participants, we make some recommendations for modellers. Techniques for reifing RDF have attracted
a great deal of research. Recently, a hybrid approach, employing some of the features of property
graphs, has claimed to offer an improved technique for RDF reification. Query-time reasoning is
also a requirement which has prompted a number of proposed extensions to SPARQL and which is only
possible to a limited extent in the property graph paradigm. Another recent development, the hypergraph
paradigm enables more powerful query-time reasoning. There is a need for more research into the
user acceptance of these various more powerful approaches to modelling and querying. Such research
should take account of complex modelling situations.

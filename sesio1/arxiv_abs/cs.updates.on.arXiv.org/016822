Overcoming the digital divide in rural and remote areas has always been a big challenge for Canada
with its huge geographical area. In 2016, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications
Commission announced broadband Internet as a basic service available for all Canadians. However,
approximately one million Canadians still do not have access to broadband services as of 2020. The
COVID-19 pandemic has made the situation more challenging, as social, economic, and educational
activities have increasingly been transferred online. The condition is more unfavorable for Indigenous
communities. A key challenge in deploying rural and remote broadband Internet is to plan and implement
high-capacity backbones, which are now available only in denser urban areas. For any Internet provider,
it is almost impossible to make a viable business proposal in these areas. For example, the vast land
of the Northwest Territories, Yukon, and Nunavuts diverse geographical features present obstacles
for broadband infrastructure. In this paper, we investigate the digital divide in Canada with a
focus on rural and remote areas. In so doing, we highlight two potential solutions using low Earth
orbit (LEO) constellations to deliver broadband Internet in rural and remote areas to address the
access inequality and the digital divide. The first solution involves integrating LEO constellations
as a backbone for the existing 4G/5G telecommunications network. This solution uses satellites
in a LEO constellation to provide a backhaul network connecting the 4G/5G access network to its core
network. The 3rd Generation Partnership Project already specifies how to integrate LEO satellite
networks into the 4G/5G network, and the Canadian satellite operator Telesat has already showcased
this solution with one terrestrial operator, TIM Brasil, in their 4G network.

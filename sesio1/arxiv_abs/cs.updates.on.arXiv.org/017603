Brain metastases occur frequently in patients with metastatic cancer. Early and accurate detection
of brain metastases is very essential for treatment planning and prognosis in radiation therapy.
To improve brain metastasis detection performance with deep learning, a custom detection loss
called volume-level sensitivity-specificity (VSS) is proposed, which rates individual metastasis
detection sensitivity and specificity in (sub-)volume levels. As sensitivity and precision are
always a trade-off in a metastasis level, either a high sensitivity or a high precision can be achieved
by adjusting the weights in the VSS loss without decline in dice score coefficient for segmented
metastases. To reduce metastasis-like structures being detected as false positive metastases,
a temporal prior volume is proposed as an additional input of DeepMedic. The modified network is
called DeepMedic+ for distinction. Our proposed VSS loss improves the sensitivity of brain metastasis
detection for DeepMedic, increasing the sensitivity from 85.3% to 97.5%. Alternatively, it improves
the precision from 69.1% to 98.7%. Comparing DeepMedic+ with DeepMedic with the same VSS loss, 44.4%
of the false positive metastases are reduced in the high sensitivity model and the precision reaches
99.6% for the high specificity model. The mean dice coefficient for all metastases is about 0.81.
With the ensemble of the high sensitivity and high specificity models, on average only 1.5 false
positive metastases per patient needs further check, while the majority of true positive metastases
are confirmed. The ensemble learning is able to distinguish high confidence true positive metastases
from metastases candidates that require special expert review or further follow-up, being particularly
well-fit to the requirements of expert support in real clinical practice.

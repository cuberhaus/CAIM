Long Range (LoRa) is the most widely used technology for enabling Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs)
on unlicensed frequency bands. Despite its modest Data Rates (DRs), it provides extensive coverage
for low-power devices, making it an ideal communication system for many Internet of Things (IoT)
applications. In general, LoRa radio is considered as the physical layer, whereas Long Range Wide
Area Networks (LoRaWAN) is the MAC layer of the LoRa stack that adopts star topology to enable communication
between multiple End Devices (EDs) and the network Gateway (GW). The Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS)
modulation deals with LoRa signals interference and ensures long-range communication. At the
same time, the Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) mechanism allows EDs to dynamically alter some LoRa features
such as the Spreading Factor (SF), Code Rate (CR), and carrier frequency to address the time variance
of communication conditions in dense networks. Despite the high LoRa connectivity demand, LoRa
signals interference and concurrent transmission collisions are major limitations. Therefore,
to enhance LoRaWAN capacity, the LoRa alliance released many LoRaWAN versions, and the research
community provided numerous solutions to develop scalable LoRaWAN technology. Hence, we thoroughly
examined LoRaWAN scalability challenges and the state-of-the-art solutions in both the PHY and
MAC layers. Most of these solutions rely on SF, logical, and frequency channel assignment, while
others propose new network topologies or implement signal processing schemes to cancel the interference
and allow LoRaWAN to connect more EDs efficiently. A summary of the existing solutions in the literature
is provided at the end of the paper by describing the advantages and drawbacks of each solution and
suggesting possible enhancements as future research directions.

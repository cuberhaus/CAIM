Traditional botnet attacks leverage large and distributed numbers of compromised internet-connected
devices to target and overwhelm other devices with internet packets. With increasing consumer
adoption of high-wattage internet-facing "smart devices", a new "power botnet" attack emerges,
where such devices are used to target and overwhelm power grid devices with unusual load demand.
We introduce a variant of this attack, the power-botnet weardown-attack, which does not intend
to cause blackouts or short-term acute instability, but instead forces expensive mechanical components
to activate more frequently, necessitating costly replacements / repairs. Specifically, we target
the on-load tap-changer (OLTC) transformer, which uses a mechanical switch that responds to change
in load demand. In our analysis and simulations, these attacks can halve the lifespan of an OLTC,
or in the most extreme cases, reduce it to $2.5\%$ of its original lifespan. Notably, these power
botnets are composed of devices not connected to the internal SCADA systems used to control power
grids. This represents a new internet-based cyberattack that targets the power grid from the outside.
To help the power system to mitigate these types of botnet attacks, we develop attack-localization
strategies. We formulate the problem as a supervised machine learning task to locate the source
of power botnet attacks. Within a simulated environment, we generate the training and testing dataset
to evaluate several machine learning algorithm based localization methods, including SVM, neural
network and decision tree. We show that decision-tree based classification successfully identifies
power botnet attacks and locates compromised devices with at least $94\%$ improvement of accuracy
over a baseline "most-frequent" classifier.

As an essential prerequisite for developing a medical intelligent assistant system, medical image
segmentation has received extensive research and concentration from the neural network community.
A series of UNet-like networks with encoder-decoder architecture has achieved extraordinary
success, in which UNet2+ and UNet3+ redesign skip connections, respectively proposing dense skip
connection and full-scale skip connection and dramatically improving compared with UNet in medical
image segmentation. However, UNet2+ lacks sufficient information explored from the full scale,
which will affect the learning of organs' location and boundary. Although UNet3+ can obtain the
full-scale aggregation feature map, owing to the small number of neurons in the structure, it does
not satisfy the segmentation of tiny objects when the number of samples is small. This paper proposes
a novel network structure combining dense skip connections and full-scale skip connections, named
UNet-sharp (UNet\#) for its shape similar to symbol \#. The proposed UNet\# can aggregate feature
maps of different scales in the decoder sub-network and capture fine-grained details and coarse-grained
semantics from the full scale, which benefits learning the exact location and accurately segmenting
the boundary of organs or lesions. We perform deep supervision for model pruning to speed up testing
and make it possible for the model to run on mobile devices; furthermore, designing two classification-guided
modules to reduce false positives achieves more accurate segmentation results. Various experiments
of semantic segmentation and instance segmentation on different modalities (EM, CT, MRI) and dimensions
(2D, 3D) datasets, including the nuclei, brain tumor, liver, and lung, demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms state-of-the-art models.

Closed-loop reservoir management (CLRM), in which history matching and production optimization
are performed multiple times over the life of an asset, can provide significant improvement in the
specified objective. These procedures are computationally expensive due to the large number of
flow simulations required for data assimilation and optimization. Existing CLRM procedures are
applied asset by asset, without utilizing information that could be useful over a range assets.
Here, we develop a CLRM framework for multiple assets with varying numbers of wells. We use deep reinforcement
learning to train a single global control policy that is applicable for all assets considered. The
new framework is an extension of a recently introduced control policy methodology for individual
assets. Embedding layers are incorporated into the representation to handle the different numbers
of decision variables that arise for the different assets. Because the global control policy learns
a unified representation of useful features from multiple assets, it is less expensive to construct
than asset-by-asset training (we observe about 3x speedup in our examples). The production optimization
problem includes a relative-change constraint on the well settings, which renders the results
suitable for practical use. We apply the multi-asset CLRM framework to 2D and 3D water-flooding
examples. In both cases, four assets with different well counts, well configurations, and geostatistical
descriptions are considered. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the global control policy
provides objective function values, for both the 2D and 3D cases, that are nearly identical to those
from control policies trained individually for each asset. This promising finding suggests that
multi-asset CLRM may indeed represent a viable practical strategy.

In recent years, computer vision algorithms have become more powerful. However, current algorithms
mainly share one limitation: They rely on directly visible objects. This is a significant drawback
compared to human behavior, where visual cues caused by objects (e.g., shadows) are already used
intuitively to retrieve information or anticipate occurring objects. While driving at night,
this performance deficit becomes even more obvious: Humans already process the light artifacts
caused by the headlamps of oncoming vehicles to estimate where they appear, whereas current object
detection systems require that the oncoming vehicle is directly visible before it can be detected.
Based on previous work on this subject, in this paper, we present a complete system that can detect
light artifacts caused by the headlights of oncoming vehicles so that it detects that a vehicle is
approaching providently. For that, an entire algorithm architecture is investigated, including
the detection in the image space, the three-dimensional localization, and the tracking of light
artifacts. To demonstrate the usefulness of such an algorithm, the proposed algorithm is deployed
in a test vehicle to use the detected light artifacts to control the glare-free high beam system proactively.
Using this experimental setting, the provident vehicle detection system's time benefit compared
to an in-production computer vision system is quantified. Additionally, the glare-free high beam
use case provides a real-time and real-world visualization interface of the detection results
by considering the adaptive headlamps as projectors. With this investigation of provident vehicle
detection, we want to put awareness on the unconventional sensing task of detecting objects providently
and further close the performance gap between human behavior and computer vision algorithms to
bring autonomous and automated driving a step forward.

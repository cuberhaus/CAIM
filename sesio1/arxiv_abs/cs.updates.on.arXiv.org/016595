Teachers often conduct surveys in order to collect data from a predefined group of students to gain
insights into topics of interest. When analyzing surveys with open-ended textual responses, it
is extremely time-consuming, labor-intensive, and difficult to manually process all the responses
into an insightful and comprehensive report. In the analysis step, traditionally, the teacher
has to read each of the responses and decide on how to group them in order to extract insightful information.
Even though it is possible to group the responses only using certain keywords, such an approach would
be limited since it not only fails to account for embedded contexts but also cannot detect polysemous
words or phrases and semantics that are not expressible in single words. In this work, we present
a novel end-to-end context-aware framework that extracts, aggregates, and abbreviates embedded
semantic patterns in open-response survey data. Our framework relies on a pre-trained natural
language model in order to encode the textual data into semantic vectors. The encoded vectors then
get clustered either into an optimally tuned number of groups or into a set of groups with pre-specified
titles. In the former case, the clusters are then further analyzed to extract a representative set
of keywords or summary sentences that serve as the labels of the clusters. In our framework, for the
designated clusters, we finally provide context-aware wordclouds that demonstrate the semantically
prominent keywords within each group. Honoring user privacy, we have successfully built the on-device
implementation of our framework suitable for real-time analysis on mobile devices and have tested
it on a synthetic dataset. Our framework reduces the costs at-scale by automating the process of
extracting the most insightful information pieces from survey data.

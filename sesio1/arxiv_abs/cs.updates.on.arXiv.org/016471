Inpainting shadowed regions cast by superficial blood vessels in retinal optical coherence tomography
(OCT) images is critical for accurate and robust machine analysis and clinical diagnosis. Traditional
sequence-based approaches such as propagating neighboring information to gradually fill in the
missing regions are cost-effective. But they generate less satisfactory outcomes when dealing
with larger missing regions and texture-rich structures. Emerging deep learning-based methods
such as encoder-decoder networks have shown promising results in natural image inpainting tasks.
However, they typically need a long computational time for network training in addition to the high
demand on the size of datasets, which makes it difficult to be applied on often small medical datasets.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-scale shadow inpainting framework for OCT
images by synergically applying sparse representation and deep learning: sparse representation
is used to extract features from a small amount of training images for further inpainting and to regularize
the image after the multi-scale image fusion, while convolutional neural network (CNN) is employed
to enhance the image quality. During the image inpainting, we divide preprocessed input images
into different branches based on the shadow width to harvest complementary information from different
scales. Finally, a sparse representation-based regularizing module is designed to refine the
generated contents after multi-scale feature aggregation. Experiments are conducted to compare
our proposal versus both traditional and deep learning-based techniques on synthetic and real-world
shadows. Results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves favorable image inpainting in
terms of visual quality and quantitative metrics, especially when wide shadows are presented.

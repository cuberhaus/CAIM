Adaptive representations are increasingly indispensable for reducing the in-memory and on-disk
footprints of large-scale data. Usual solutions are designed broadly along two themes: reducing
data precision, e.g., through compression, or adapting data resolution, e.g., using spatial hierarchies.
Recent research suggests that combining the two approaches, i.e., adapting both resolution and
precision simultaneously, can offer significant gains over using them individually. However,
there currently exist no practical solutions to creating and evaluating such representations
at scale. In this work, we present a new resolution-precision-adaptive representation to support
hybrid data reduction schemes and offer an interface to existing tools and algorithms. Through
novelties in spatial hierarchy, our representation, Adaptive Multilinear Meshes (AMM), provides
considerable reduction in the mesh size. AMM creates a piecewise multilinear representation of
uniformly sampled scalar data and can selectively relax or enforce constraints on conformity,
continuity, and coverage, delivering a flexible adaptive representation. AMM also supports representing
the function using mixed-precision values to further the achievable gains in data reduction. We
describe a practical approach to creating AMM incrementally using arbitrary orderings of data
and demonstrate AMM on six types of resolution and precision datastreams. By interfacing with state-of-the-art
rendering tools through VTK, we demonstrate the practical and computational advantages of our
representation for visualization techniques. With an open-source release of our tool to create
AMM, we make such evaluation of data reduction accessible to the community, which we hope will foster
new opportunities and future data reduction schemes

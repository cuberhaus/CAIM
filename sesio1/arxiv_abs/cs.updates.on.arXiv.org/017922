To better understand discriminations and the effect of affirmative actions in selection problems
(e.g., college admission or hiring), a recent line of research proposed a model based on differential
variance. This model assumes that the decision-maker has a noisy estimate of each candidate's quality
and puts forward the difference in the noise variances between different demographic groups as
a key factor to explain discrimination. The literature on differential variance, however, does
not consider the strategic behavior of candidates who can react to the selection procedure to improve
their outcome, which is well-known to happen in many domains. In this paper, we study how the strategic
aspect affects fairness in selection problems. We propose to model selection problems with strategic
candidates as a contest game: A population of rational candidates compete by choosing an effort
level to increase their quality. They incur a cost-of-effort but get a (random) quality whose expectation
equals the chosen effort. A Bayesian decision-maker observes a noisy estimate of the quality of
each candidate (with differential variance) and selects the fraction $\alpha$ of best candidates
based on their posterior expected quality; each selected candidate receives a reward $S$. We characterize
the (unique) equilibrium of this game in the different parameters' regimes, both when the decision-maker
is unconstrained and when they are constrained to respect the fairness notion of demographic parity.
Our results reveal important impacts of the strategic behavior on the discrimination observed
at equilibrium and allow us to understand the effect of imposing demographic parity in this context.
In particular, we find that, in many cases, the results contrast with the non-strategic setting.

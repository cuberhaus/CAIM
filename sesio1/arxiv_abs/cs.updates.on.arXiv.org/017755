Sensors embedded in mobile smart devices can monitor users' activity with high accuracy to provide
a variety of services to end-users ranging from precise geolocation, health monitoring, and handwritten
word recognition. However, this involves the risk of accessing and potentially disclosing sensitive
information of individuals to the apps that may lead to privacy breaches. In this paper, we aim to
minimize privacy leakages that may lead to user identification on mobile devices through user tracking
and distinguishability while preserving the functionality of apps and services. We propose a privacy-preserving
mechanism that effectively handles the sensor data fluctuations (e.g., inconsistent sensor readings
while walking, sitting, and running at different times) by formulating the data as time-series
modeling and forecasting. The proposed mechanism also uses the notion of correlated noise-series
against noise filtering attacks from an adversary, which aims to filter out the noise from the perturbed
data to re-identify the original data. Unlike existing solutions, our mechanism keeps running
in isolation without the interaction of a user or a service provider. We perform rigorous experiments
on benchmark datasets and show that our proposed mechanism limits user tracking and distinguishability
threats to a significant extent compared to the original data while maintaining a reasonable level
of utility of functionalities. In general, we show that our obfuscation mechanism reduces the user
trackability threat by 60\% across all the datasets while maintaining the utility loss below 0.5
Mean Absolute Error (MAE). We also observe that our mechanism is more effective in large datasets.
For example, with the Swipes dataset, the distinguishability risk is reduced by 60\% on average
while the utility loss is below 0.5 MAE.

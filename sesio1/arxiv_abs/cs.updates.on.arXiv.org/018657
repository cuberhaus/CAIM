We propose and analyze a product segmentation newsvendor problem, which generalizes the phenomenon
of segmentation sales of a class of perishable items. The product segmentation newsvendor problem
is a new variant of the newsvendor problem, reflecting that sellers maximize profits by determining
the inventory of the whole item in the context of uncertain demand for sub-items. We derive the closed-form
robust ordering decision by assuming that the means and covariance matrix of stochastic demand
are available but not the distributions. However, robust approaches that always trade-off in the
worst-case demand scenario face a concern in solution conservatism; thus, the traditional robust
schemes offer unsatisfactory. In this paper, we integrate robust and deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) techniques and propose a new paradigm termed robust learning to increase the attractiveness
of robust policies. Notably, we take the robust decision as human domain knowledge and implement
it into the training process of DRL by designing a full-process human-machine collaborative mechanism
of teaching experience, normative decision, and regularization return. Simulation results confirm
that our approach effectively improves robust performance and can generalize to various problems
that require robust but less conservative solutions. Simultaneously, fewer training episodes,
increased training stability, and interpretability of behavior may have the opportunity to facilitate
the deployment of DRL algorithms in operational practice. Furthermore, the successful attempt
of RLDQN to solve the 1000-dimensional demand scenarios reveals that the algorithm provides a path
to solve complex operational problems through human-machine collaboration and may have potential
significance for solving other complex operational management problems.

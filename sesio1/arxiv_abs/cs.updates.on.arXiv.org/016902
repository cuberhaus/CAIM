Reducing the intensity of wind excitation via aerodynamic shape modification is a major strategy
to mitigate the reaction forces on supertall buildings, reduce construction and maintenance costs,
and improve the comfort of future occupants. To this end, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) combined
with state-of-the-art stochastic optimization algorithms is more promising than the trial and
error approach adopted by the industry. The present study proposes and investigates a novel approach
to risk-averse shape optimization of tall building structures that incorporates site-specific
uncertainties in the wind velocity, terrain conditions, and wind flow direction. A body-fitted
finite element approximation is used for the CFD with different wind directions incorporated by
re-meshing the fluid domain. The bending moment at the base of the building is minimized, resulting
in a building with reduced cost, material, and hence, a reduced carbon footprint. Both risk-neutral
and risk-averse optimization of the twist and tapering of a representative building are presented
under uncertain inflow wind conditions that have been calibrated to fit freely-available site-specific
data from Basel, Switzerland. The risk-averse strategy uses the conditional value-at-risk to
optimize for the low-probability high-consequence events appearing in the worst 10% of loading
conditions. Adaptive sampling is used to accelerate the gradient-based stochastic optimization
pipeline. The adaptive method is easy to implement and particularly helpful for compute-intensive
simulations because the number of gradient samples grows only as the optimal design algorithm converges.
The performance of the final risk-averse building geometry is exceptionally favorable when compared
to the risk-neutral optimized geometry, thus, demonstrating the effectiveness of the risk-averse
design approach in computational wind engineering.

In the storied Colonel Blotto game, two colonels allocate $a$ and $b$ troops, respectively, to $k$
distinct battlefields. A colonel wins a battle if they assign more troops to that particular battle,
and each colonel seeks to maximize their total number of victories. Despite the problem's formulation
in 1921, the first polynomial-time algorithm to compute Nash equilibrium (NE) strategies for this
game was discovered only quite recently. In 2016, \citep{ahmadinejad_dehghani_hajiaghayi_lucier_mahini_seddighin_2019}
formulated a breakthrough algorithm to compute NE strategies for the Colonel Blotto game, receiving
substantial media coverage (e.g. \citep{Insider}, \citep{NSF}, \citep{ScienceDaily}). In
this work, we present the first known $\epsilon$-approximation algorithm to compute NE strategies
in the two-player Colonel Blotto game in runtime $\widetilde{O}(\epsilon^{-4} k^8 \max\{a,b\})$
for arbitrary settings of these parameters. Moreover, this algorithm computes approximate coarse
correlated equilibrium strategies in the multiplayer Colonel Blotto game (when there are $\ell
> 2$ colonels) with runtime $\widetilde{O}(\ell \epsilon^{-4} k^8 n + \ell^2 \epsilon^{-2} k^4
n)$, where $n$ is the maximum troop count. Before this work, no polynomial-time algorithm was known
to compute exact or approximate equilibrium (in any sense) strategies for multiplayer Colonel
Blotto with arbitrary parameters. Further, this is the first algorithm to compute optimal strategies
(exact or approximate) in the continuous Colonel Blotto game with arbitrary parameters. Our algorithm
computes these approximate equilibria by a novel (to the author's knowledge) sampling technique
with which we implicitly perform multiplicative weights update over the exponentially many strategies
available to each player.

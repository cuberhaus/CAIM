Although domain adaptation has been extensively studied in natural image-based segmentation
task, the research on cross-domain segmentation for very high resolution (VHR) remote sensing
images (RSIs) still remains underexplored. The VHR RSIs-based cross-domain segmentation mainly
faces two critical challenges: 1) Large area land covers with many diverse object categories bring
severe local patch-level data distribution deviations, thus yielding different adaptation difficulties
for different local patches; 2) Different VHR sensor types or dynamically changing modes cause
the VHR images to go through intensive data distribution differences even for the same geographical
location, resulting in different global feature-level domain gap. To address these challenges,
we propose a curriculum-style local-to-global cross-domain adaptation framework for the segmentation
of VHR RSIs. The proposed curriculum-style adaptation performs the adaptation process in an easy-to-hard
way according to the adaptation difficulties that can be obtained using an entropy-based score
for each patch of the target domain, and thus well aligns the local patches in a domain image. The proposed
local-to-global adaptation performs the feature alignment process from the locally semantic
to globally structural feature discrepancies, and consists of a semantic-level domain classifier
and an entropy-level domain classifier that can reduce the above cross-domain feature discrepancies.
Extensive experiments have been conducted in various cross-domain scenarios, including geographic
location variations and imaging mode variations, and the experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed method can significantly boost the domain adaptability of segmentation networks
for VHR RSIs. Our code is available at: https://github.com/BOBrown/CCDA_LGFA.

Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) caused by prenatal alcohol exposure can result in a series of cranio-facial
anomalies, and behavioral and neurocognitive problems. Current diagnosis of FAS is typically
done by identifying a set of facial characteristics, which are often obtained by manual examination.
Anatomical landmark detection, which provides rich geometric information, is important to detect
the presence of FAS associated facial anomalies. This imaging application is characterized by
large variations in data appearance and limited availability of labeled data. Current deep learning-based
heatmap regression methods designed for facial landmark detection in natural images assume availability
of large datasets and are therefore not wellsuited for this application. To address this restriction,
we develop a new regularized transfer learning approach that exploits the knowledge of a network
learned on large facial recognition datasets. In contrast to standard transfer learning which
focuses on adjusting the pre-trained weights, the proposed learning approach regularizes the
model behavior. It explicitly reuses the rich visual semantics of a domain-similar source model
on the target task data as an additional supervisory signal for regularizing landmark detection
optimization. Specifically, we develop four regularization constraints for the proposed transfer
learning, including constraining the feature outputs from classification and intermediate layers,
as well as matching activation attention maps in both spatial and channel levels. Experimental
evaluation on a collected clinical imaging dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach can
effectively improve model generalizability under limited training samples, and is advantageous
to other approaches in the literature.

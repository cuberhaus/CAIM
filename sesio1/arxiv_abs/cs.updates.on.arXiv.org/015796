This study aims to identify chicken eggs fertility using the support vector machine (SVM) classifier
method. The classification basis used the first-order statistical (FOS) parameters as feature
extraction in the identification process. This research was developed based on the process's identification
process, which is still manual (conventional). Although currently there are many technologies
in the identification process, they still need development. Thus, this research is one of the developments
in the field of image processing technology. The sample data uses datasets from previous studies
with a total of 100 egg images. The egg object in the image is a single object. From these data, the classification
of each fertile and infertile egg is 50 image data. Chicken egg image data became input in image processing,
with the initial process is segmentation. This initial segmentation aims to get the cropped image
according to the object. The cropped image is repaired using image preprocessing with grayscaling
and image enhancement methods. This method (image enhancement) used two combination methods:
contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) and histogram equalization (HE). The
improved image becomes the input for feature extraction using the FOS method. The FOS uses five parameters,
namely mean, entropy, variance, skewness, and kurtosis. The five parameters entered into the SVM
classifier method to identify the fertility of chicken eggs. The results of these experiments,
the method proposed in the identification process has a success percentage of 84.57%. Thus, the
implementation of this method can be used as a reference for future research improvements. In addition,
it may be possible to use a second-order feature extraction method to improve its accuracy and improve
supervised learning for classification.

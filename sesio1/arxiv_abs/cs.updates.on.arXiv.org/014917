Transit timing variations (TTVs) can provide useful information for systems observed by transit,
as they allow us to put constraints on the masses and eccentricities of the observed planets, or even
to constrain the existence of non-transiting companions. However, TTVs can also act as a detection
bias that can prevent the detection of small planets in transit surveys that would otherwise be detected
by standard algorithms such as the Boxed Least Square algorithm (BLS) if their orbit was not perturbed.
This bias is especially present for surveys with a long baseline, such as Kepler, some of the TESS
sectors, and the upcoming PLATO mission. Here we introduce a detection method that is robust to large
TTVs, and illustrate its use by recovering and confirming a pair of resonant super-Earths with ten-hour
TTVs around Kepler-1705. The method is based on a neural network trained to recover the tracks of
low-signal-to-noise-ratio(S/N) perturbed planets in river diagrams. We recover the transit
parameters of these candidates by fitting the light curve. The individual transit S/N of Kepler-1705b
and c are about three times lower than all the previously known planets with TTVs of 3 hours or more,
pushing the boundaries in the recovery of these small, dynamically active planets. Recovering
this type of object is essential for obtaining a complete picture of the observed planetary systems,
and solving for a bias not often taken into account in statistical studies of exoplanet populations.
In addition, TTVs are a means of obtaining mass estimates which can be essential for studying the
internal structure of planets discovered by transit surveys. Finally, we show that due to the strong
orbital perturbations, it is possible that the spin of the outer resonant planet of Kepler-1705
is trapped in a sub- or super-synchronous spin-orbit resonance.

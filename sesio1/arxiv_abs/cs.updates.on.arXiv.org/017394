Compared with other imaging modalities, intravascular optical coherence tomography (IVOCT)
has significant advantages for guiding percutaneous coronary interventions. To aid IVOCT research
studies, we developed the Optical Coherence TOmography PlaqUe and Stent (OCTOPUS) analysis software.
To automate image analysis results, the software includes several important algorithmic steps:
pre-processing, deep learning plaque segmentation, machine learning identification of stent
struts, and registration of pullbacks. Interactive visualization and manual editing of segmentations
were included in the software. Quantifications include stent deployment characteristics (e.g.,
stent strut malapposition), strut level analysis, calcium angle, and calcium thickness measurements.
Interactive visualizations include (x,y) anatomical, en face, and longitudinal views with optional
overlays. Underlying plaque segmentation algorithm yielded excellent pixel-wise results (86.2%
sensitivity and 0.781 F1 score). Using OCTOPUS on 34 new pullbacks, we determined that following
automated segmentation, only 13% and 23% of frames needed any manual touch up for detailed lumen
and calcification labeling, respectively. Only up to 3.8% of plaque pixels were modified, leading
to an average editing time of only 7.5 seconds/frame, an approximately 80% reduction compared to
manual analysis. Regarding stent analysis, sensitivity and precision were both greater than 90%,
and each strut was successfully classified as either covered or uncovered with high sensitivity
(94%) and specificity (90%). We introduced and evaluated the clinical application of a highly automated
software package, OCTOPUS, for quantitative plaque and stent analysis in IVOCT images. The software
is currently used as an offline tool for research purposes; however, the software's embedded algorithms
may also be useful for real-time treatment planning.

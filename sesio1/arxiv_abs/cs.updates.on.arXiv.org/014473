Mission critical Machine-type Communication, also referred to as Ultra-reliable Low Latency
Communication is primarily characterized by communication that provides ultra-high reliability
and very low latency to concurrently transmit short commands to a massive number of connected devices.
While the reduction in PHY layer overhead and improvement in channel coding techniques are pivotal
in reducing latency and improving reliability, the current wireless standards dedicated to support
mcMTC rely heavily on adopting the bottom layers of general-purpose wireless standards and customizing
only the upper layers. The mcMTC has a significant technical impact on the design of all layers of
the communication protocol stack. In this paper, an innovative bottom-up approach has been proposed
for mcMTC applications through PHY layer targeted at improving the transmission reliability by
implementing ultra-reliable channel coding scheme in the PHY layer of IEEE 802.11a bearing in mind
short packet transmission system. To achieve this aim, we analyzed and compared the channel coding
performance of convolutional codes, LDPC codes, and polar codes in wireless network on the condition
of short data packet transmission. The Viterbi decoding algorithm, logarithmic belief propagation
algorithm, and cyclic redundancy check - successive cancellation list decoding algorithm were
adopted to CC, LDPC codes, and polar codes, respectively. Consequently, a new PHY layer for mcMTC
has been proposed. The reliability of the proposed approach has been validated by simulation in
terms of Bit error rate vs. SNR. The simulation results demonstrate that the reliability of IEEE
802.11a standard has been significantly improved to be at PER less 10e-5 with the implementation
of polar codes. The results also show that the general-purpose wireless networks are prominent
in providing short packet mcMTC with the modification needed.

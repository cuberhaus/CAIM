Recent research in Internet of things has been widely applied for industrial practices, fostering
the exponential growth of data and connected devices. Henceforth, data-driven AI models would
be accessed by different parties through certain data-sharing policies. However, most of the current
training procedures rely on the centralized data-collection strategy and a single computational
server. However, such a centralized scheme may lead to many issues. Customer data stored in a centralized
database may be tampered with so the provenance and authenticity of data cannot be justified. Once
the aforementioned security concerns occur, the credibility of the trained AI models would be questionable
and even unfavorable outcomes might be produced at the test stage. Lately, blockchain and AI, the
two core technologies in Industry 4.0 and Web 3.0, have been explored to facilitate the decentralized
AI training strategy. To serve on this very purpose, we propose a new system architecture called
APPFLChain, namely an integrated architecture of a Hyperledger Fabric-based blockchain and a
federated-learning paradigm. Our proposed new system allows different parties to jointly train
AI models and their customers or stakeholders are connected by a consortium blockchain-based network.
Our new system can maintain a high degree of security and privacy as users do not need to share sensitive
personal information to the server. For numerical evaluation, we simulate a real-world scenario
to illustrate the whole operational process of APPFLChain. Simulation results show that taking
advantage of the characteristics of consortium blockchain and federated learning, APPFLChain
can demonstrate favorable properties including untamperability, traceability, privacy protection,
and reliable decision-making.

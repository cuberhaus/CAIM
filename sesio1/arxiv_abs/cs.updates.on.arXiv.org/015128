When members of ad-hoc virtual teams need to collectively ideate or deliberate, they often fail
to engage with each others' perspectives in a constructive manner. At best, this leads to sub-optimal
outcomes and, at worst, it can cause conflicts that lead to teams not wanting to continue working
together. Prior work has attempted to facilitate constructive communication by highlighting
problematic communication patterns and nudging teams to alter interaction norms. However, these
approaches achieve limited success because they fail to acknowledge two social barriers: (1) it
is hard to reset team norms mid-interaction, and (2) corrective nudges have limited utility unless
team members believe it is safe to voice their opinion and that their opinion will be heard. This paper
introduces Empathosphere, a chat-embedded intervention to mitigate these barriers and foster
constructive communication in teams. To mitigate the first barrier, Empathosphere leverages
the benefits of "experimental spaces" in dampening existing norms and creating a climate conducive
to change. To mitigate the second barrier, Empathosphere harnesses the benefits of perspective-taking
to cultivate a group climate that promotes a norm of members speaking up and engaging with each other.
Empathosphere achieves this by orchestrating authentic socio-emotional exchanges designed
to induce perspective-taking. A controlled study (N=110) compared Empathosphere to an alternate
intervention strategy of prompting teams to reflect on their team experience. We found that Empathosphere
led to higher work satisfaction, encouraged more open communication and feedback within teams,
and boosted teams' desire to continue working together. This work demonstrates that ``experimental
spaces,'' particularly those that integrate methods of encouraging perspective-taking, can
be a powerful means of improving communication in virtual teams.

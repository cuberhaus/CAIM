Development of new algorithms in the area of machine learning, especially clustering, comparative
studies of such algorithms as well as testing according to software engineering principles requires
availability of labeled data sets. While standard benchmarks are made available, a broader range
of such data sets is necessary in order to avoid the problem of overfitting. In this context, theoretical
works on axiomatization of clustering algorithms, especially axioms on clustering preserving
transformations are quite a cheap way to produce labeled data sets from existing ones. However,
the frequently cited axiomatic system of Kleinberg:2002, as we show in this paper, is not applicable
for finite dimensional Euclidean spaces, in which many algorithms like $k$-means, operate. In
particular, the so-called outer-consistency axiom fails upon making small changes in datapoint
positions and inner-consistency axiom is valid only for identity transformation in general settings.
Hence we propose an alternative axiomatic system, in which Kleinberg's inner consistency axiom
is replaced by a centric consistency axiom and outer consistency axiom is replaced by motion consistency
axiom. We demonstrate that the new system is satisfiable for a hierarchical version of $k$-means
with auto-adjusted $k$, hence it is not contradictory. Additionally, as $k$-means creates convex
clusters only, we demonstrate that it is possible to create a version detecting concave clusters
and still the axiomatic system can be satisfied. The practical application area of such an axiomatic
system may be the generation of new labeled test data from existent ones for clustering algorithm
testing. %We propose the gravitational consistency as a replacement which does not have this deficiency.

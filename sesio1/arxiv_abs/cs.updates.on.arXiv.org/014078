Like many scientific fields, new chemistry literature has grown at a staggering pace, with thousands
of papers released every month. A large portion of chemistry literature focuses on new molecules
and reactions between molecules. Most vital information is conveyed through 2-D images of molecules,
representing the underlying molecules or reactions described. In order to ensure reproducible
and machine-readable molecule representations, text-based molecule descriptors like SMILES
and SELFIES were created. These text-based molecule representations provide molecule generation
but are unfortunately rarely present in published literature. In the absence of molecule descriptors,
the generation of molecule descriptors from the 2-D images present in the literature is necessary
to understand chemistry literature at scale. Successful methods such as Optical Structure Recognition
Application (OSRA), and ChemSchematicResolver are able to extract the locations of molecules
structures in chemistry papers and infer molecular descriptions and reactions. While effective,
existing systems expect chemists to correct outputs, making them unsuitable for unsupervised
large-scale data mining. Leveraging the task formulation of image captioning introduced by DECIMER,
we introduce IMG2SMI, a model which leverages Deep Residual Networks for image feature extraction
and an encoder-decoder Transformer layers for molecule description generation. Unlike previous
Neural Network-based systems, IMG2SMI builds around the task of molecule description generation,
which enables IMG2SMI to outperform OSRA-based systems by 163% in molecule similarity prediction
as measured by the molecular MACCS Fingerprint Tanimoto Similarity. Additionally, to facilitate
further research on this task, we release a new molecule prediction dataset. including 81 million

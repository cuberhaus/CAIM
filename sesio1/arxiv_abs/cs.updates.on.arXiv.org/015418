The Android Open Source Project (AOSP) is probably the most used and customized operating system
for smartphones and IoT devices worldwide. Its market share and high adaptability makes Android
an interesting operating system for many developers. Nowadays, we use Android firmware in smartphones,
TVs, smartwatches, cars, and other devices by various vendors and manufacturers. The sheer amount
of customized Android firmware and devices makes it hard for security analysts to detect potentially
harmful applications. Another fact is that many vendors include apps from 3rd party developers.
Such bloatware usually has more privileges than standard apps and cannot be removed by the user without
rooting the device. In recent years several cases were reported where 3rd party developers could
include malicious apps into the Android built chain. Media reports claim that pre-installed malware
like Chamois and Triade we able to infect several million devices. Such cases demonstrate the need
for better strategies for analyzing Android firmware. In our study, we analyze the Android firmware
eco-system in various ways. We collected a dataset with several thousand Android firmware archives
and show that several terabytes of firmware data are waiting on the web to be analyzed. We develop
a web service called FirmwareDroid for analyzing Android firmware archives and pre-installed
apps and create a dataset of firmware samples. Focusing on Android apps, we automated the process
of extracting and scanning pre-installed apps with state of the art open-source tools. We demonstrate
on real data that pre-installed apps are, in fact, a a threat to Android's users, and we can detect
several hundred malware samples using scanners like VirusTotal, AndroGuard, and APKiD. With state
of the art tools, we could scan more than 900000 apps during our research and give unique insights
into Android custom ROMs.

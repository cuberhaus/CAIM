Modern large-scale computing systems distribute jobs into multiple smaller tasks which execute
in parallel to accelerate job completion rates and reduce energy consumption. However, a common
performance problem in such systems is dealing with straggler tasks that are slow running instances
that increase the overall response time. Such tasks can significantly impact the system's Quality
of Service (QoS) and the Service Level Agreements (SLA). To combat this issue, there is a need for
automatic straggler detection and mitigation mechanisms that execute jobs without violating
the SLA. Prior work typically builds reactive models that focus first on detection and then mitigation
of straggler tasks, which leads to delays. Other works use prediction based proactive mechanisms,
but ignore heterogeneous host or volatile task characteristics. In this paper, we propose a Straggler
Prediction and Mitigation Technique (START) that is able to predict which tasks might be stragglers
and dynamically adapt scheduling to achieve lower response times. Our technique analyzes all tasks
and hosts based on compute and network resource consumption using an Encoder Long-Short-Term-Memory
(LSTM) network. The output of this network is then used to predict and mitigate expected straggler
tasks. This reduces the SLA violation rate and execution time without compromising QoS. Specifically,
we use the CloudSim toolkit to simulate START in a cloud environment and compare it with state-of-the-art
techniques (IGRU-SD, SGC, Dolly, GRASS, NearestFit and Wrangler) in terms of QoS parameters such
as energy consumption, execution time, resource contention, CPU utilization and SLA violation
rate. Experiments show that START reduces execution time, resource contention, energy and SLA
violations by 13%, 11%, 16% and 19%, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.

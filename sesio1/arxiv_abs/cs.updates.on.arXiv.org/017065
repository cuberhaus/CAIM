We present a data-driven workflow to biological tissue modeling, which aims to predict the displacement
field based on digital image correlation (DIC) measurements under unseen loading scenarios, without
postulating a specific constitutive model form nor possessing knowledges on the material microstructure.
To this end, a material database is constructed from the DIC displacement tracking measurements
of multiple biaxial stretching protocols on a porcine tricuspid valve anterior leaflet, with which
we build a neural operator learning model. The material response is modeled as a solution operator
from the loading to the resultant displacement field, with the material microstructure properties
learned implicitly from the data and naturally embedded in the network parameters. Using various
combinations of loading protocols, we compare the predictivity of this framework with finite element
analysis based on the phenomenological Fung-type model. From in-distribution tests, the predictivity
of our approach presents good generalizability to different loading conditions and outperforms
the conventional constitutive modeling at approximately one order of magnitude. When tested on
out-of-distribution loading ratios, the neural operator learning approach becomes less effective.
To improve the generalizability of our framework, we propose a physics-guided neural operator
learning model via imposing partial physics knowledge. This method is shown to improve the model's
extrapolative performance in the small-deformation regime. Our results demonstrate that with
sufficient data coverage and/or guidance from partial physics constraints, the data-driven approach
can be a more effective method for modeling biological materials than the traditional constitutive
modeling.

Unlearning the data observed during the training of a machine learning (ML) model is an important
task that can play a pivotal role in fortifying the privacy and security of ML-based applications.
This paper raises the following questions: (i) can we unlearn a single or multiple classes of data
from an ML model without looking at the full training data even once? (ii) can we make the process of
unlearning fast and scalable to large datasets, and generalize it to different deep networks? We
introduce a novel machine unlearning framework with error-maximizing noise generation and impair-repair
based weight manipulation that offers an efficient solution to the above questions. An error-maximizing
noise matrix is learned for the class to be unlearned using the original model. The noise matrix is
used to manipulate the model weights to unlearn the targeted class of data. We introduce impair and
repair steps for a controlled manipulation of the network weights. In the impair step, the noise
matrix along with a very high learning rate is used to induce sharp unlearning in the model. Thereafter,
the repair step is used to regain the overall performance. With very few update steps, we show excellent
unlearning while substantially retaining the overall model accuracy. Unlearning multiple classes
requires a similar number of update steps as for the single class, making our approach scalable to
large problems. Our method is quite efficient in comparison to the existing methods, works for multi-class
unlearning, doesn't put any constraints on the original optimization mechanism or network design,
and works well in both small and large-scale vision tasks. This work is an important step towards
fast and easy implementation of unlearning in deep networks. We will make the source code publicly
available.

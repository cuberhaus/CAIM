Metasurfaces have received a lot of attentions recently due to their versatile capability in manipulating
electromagnetic wave. Advanced designs to satisfy multiple objectives with non-linear constraints
have motivated researchers in using machine learning (ML) techniques like deep learning (DL) for
accelerated design of metasurfaces. For metasurfaces, it is difficult to make quantitative comparisons
between different ML models without having a common and yet complex dataset used in many disciplines
like image classification. Many studies were directed to a relatively constrained datasets that
are limited to specified patterns or shapes in metasurfaces. In this paper, we present our SUTD polarized
reflection of complex metasurfaces (SUTD-PRCM) dataset, which contains approximately 260,000
samples of complex metasurfaces created from electromagnetic simulation, and it has been used
to benchmark our DL models. The metasurface patterns are divided into different classes to facilitate
different degree of complexity, which involves identifying and exploiting the relationship between
the patterns and the electromagnetic responses that can be compared in using different DL models.
With the release of this SUTD-PRCM dataset, we hope that it will be useful for benchmarking existing
or future DL models developed in the ML community. We also propose a classification problem that
is less encountered and apply neural architecture search to have a preliminary understanding of
potential modification to the neural architecture that will improve the prediction by DL models.
Our finding shows that convolution stacking is not the dominant element of the neural architecture
anymore, which implies that low-level features are preferred over the traditional deep hierarchical
high-level features thus explains why deep convolutional neural network based models are not performing
well in our dataset.

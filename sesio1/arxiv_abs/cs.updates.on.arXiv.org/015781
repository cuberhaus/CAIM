MRI scan time reduction is commonly achieved by Parallel Imaging methods, typically based on uniform
undersampling of the inverse image space (a.k.a. k-space) and simultaneous signal reception with
multiple receiver coils. The GRAPPA method interpolates missing k-space signals by linear combination
of adjacent, acquired signals across all coils, and can be described by a convolution in k-space.
Recently, a more generalized method called RAKI was introduced. RAKI is a deep-learning method
that generalizes GRAPPA with additional convolution layers, on which a non-linear activation
function is applied. This enables non-linear estimation of missing signals by convolutional neural
networks. In analogy to GRAPPA, the convolution kernels in RAKI are trained using scan-specific
training samples obtained from auto-calibration-signals (ACS). RAKI provides superior reconstruction
quality compared to GRAPPA, however, often requires much more ACS due to its increased number of
unknown parameters. In order to overcome this limitation, this study investigates the influence
of training data on the reconstruction quality for standard 2D imaging, with particular focus on
its amount and contrast information. Furthermore, an iterative k-space interpolation approach
(iRAKI) is evaluated, which includes training data augmentation via an initial GRAPPA reconstruction,
and refinement of convolution filters by iterative training. Using only 18, 20 and 25 ACS lines (8%),
iRAKI outperforms RAKI by suppressing residual artefacts occurring at accelerations factors
R=4 and R=5, and yields strong noise suppression in comparison to GRAPPA, underlined by quantitative
quality metrics. Combination with a phase-constraint yields further improvement. Additionally,
iRAKI shows better performance than GRAPPA and RAKI in case of pre-scan calibration and strongly
varying contrast between training- and undersampled data.

Hackathons and similar time-bounded events have become a popular form of collaboration. They are
commonly organized as in-person events during which teams engage in intense collaboration over
a short period of time to complete a project that is of interest to them. Most research to date has focused
on studying how teams collaborate in a co-located setting, pointing towards the advantages of radical
co-location. The global pandemic of 2020, however, has led to many hackathons moving online, which
challenges our current understanding of how they function. In this paper, we address this gap by
presenting findings from a multiple-case study of 10 hackathon teams that participated in 4 hackathons
across two continents. By analyzing the collected data, we found that teams merged synchronous
and asynchronous means of communication to maintain a common understanding of work progress as
well as to maintain awareness of each other's tasks. Task division was self-assigned based on individual
skills or interests, while leaders emerged from different strategies (e.g., participant experience,
the responsibility of registering the team in an event). Some of the affordances of in-person hackathons,
such as the radical co-location of team members, could be partially reproduced in teams that kept
synchronous communication channels while working (i.e., shared audio territories), in a sort
of "radical virtual co-location". However, others, such as interactions with other teams, easy
access to mentors, and networking with other participants, decreased. In addition, the technical
constraints of the different communication tools and platforms brought technical problems and
were overwhelming to participants. Our work contributes to understanding the virtual collaboration
of small teams in the context of online hackathons and how technologies and event structures proposed
by organizers imply this collaboration.

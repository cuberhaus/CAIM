Treatment effect estimation from observational data is a fundamental problem in causal inference.
There are two very different schools of thought that have tackled this problem. On one hand, Pearlian
framework commonly assumes structural knowledge (provided by an expert) in form of directed acyclic
graphs and provides graphical criteria such as back-door criterion to identify valid adjustment
sets. On other hand, potential outcomes (PO) framework commonly assumes that all observed features
satisfy ignorability (i.e., no hidden confounding), which in general is untestable. In prior works
that attempted to bridge these frameworks, there is an observational criteria to identify an anchor
variable and if a subset of covariates (not involving the anchor variable) passes a suitable conditional
independence criteria, then that subset is a valid back-door. Our main result strengthens these
prior results by showing that under a different expert-driven structural knowledge -- that one
variable is a direct causal parent of treatment variable -- remarkably, testing for subsets (not
involving the known parent variable) that are valid back-doors is equivalent to an invariance test.
Importantly, we also cover the non-trivial case where entire set of observed features is not ignorable
(generalizing the PO framework) without requiring knowledge of all parents of treatment variable.
Our key technical idea involves generation of a synthetic sub-sampling (or environment) variable
that is a function of the known parent variable. In addition to designing an invariance test, this
sub-sampling variable allows us to leverage Invariant Risk Minimization, and thus, connects finding
valid adjustments (in non-ignorable observational setting) to representation learning. We demonstrate
effectiveness and tradeoffs of our approaches on a variety of synthetic data as well as real causal
effect estimation benchmarks.

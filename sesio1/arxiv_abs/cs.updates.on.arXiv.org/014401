Composed of spatially distributed sensors and actuators that communicate through wireless networks,
networked control systems are emerging as a fundamental infrastructure technology in 5G and IoT
technologies, including diverse applications, such as autonomous vehicles, UAVs, and various
sensing devices. In order to increase flexibility and reduce deployment and maintenance costs,
many such applications consider battery-powered or energy-harvesting networks, which bring
additional limitations on the energy consumption of the wireless network. Specifically, the operation
of battery-powered or energy-harvesting wireless communication networks needs to guarantee
(i) efficient communication between nodes and (ii) preservation of available energy. Motivated
by these novel requirements, in this paper, we present and analyze a novel distributed average consensus
algorithm, which (i) operates exclusively on quantized values (in order to guarantee efficient
communication and data storage), and (ii) relies on event-driven updates (in order to reduce energy
consumption, communication bandwidth, network congestion, and/or processor usage). We characterize
the properties of the proposed algorithm and show that its execution, on any time-invariant and
strongly connected digraph, will allow all nodes to reach, in finite time, a common consensus value
that is equal to the exact average (represented as the ratio of two quantized values). Furthermore,
we show that our algorithm allows each node to cease transmissions once the exact average of the initial
quantized values has been reached (in order to preserve its battery energy). Then, we present upper
bounds on (i) the number of transmissions and computations each node has to perform during the execution
of the algorithm, and (ii) the memory and energy requirements of each node in order for the algorithm
to be executed.

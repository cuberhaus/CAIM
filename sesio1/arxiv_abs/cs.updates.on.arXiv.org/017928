Deep subspace clustering has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Almost all the existing
works are required to load the whole training data into one batch for learning the self-expressive
coefficients in the framework of deep learning. Although these methods achieve promising results,
such a learning fashion severely prevents from the usage of deeper neural network architectures
(e.g., ResNet), leading to the limited representation abilities of the models. In this paper, we
propose a new deep subspace clustering framework, motivated by the energy-based models. In contrast
to previous approaches taking the weights of a fully connected layer as the self-expressive coefficients,
we propose to learn an energy-based network to obtain the self-expressive coefficients by mini-batch
training. By this means, it is no longer necessary to load all data into one batch for learning, and
it thus becomes a reality that we can utilize deeper neural network models for subspace clustering.
Considering the powerful representation ability of the recently popular self-supervised learning,
we attempt to leverage self-supervised representation learning to learn the dictionary. Finally,
we propose a joint framework to learn both the self-expressive coefficients and dictionary simultaneously,
and train the model in an end-to-end manner. The experiments are performed on three publicly available
datasets, and extensive experimental results demonstrate our method can significantly outperform
the other related approaches. For instance, on the three datasets, our method can averagely achieve
$13.8\%$, $15.4\%$, $20.8\%$ improvements in terms of Accuracy, NMI, and ARI over SENet which is
proposed very recently and obtains the second best results in the experiments.

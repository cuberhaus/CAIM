Matching markets involve heterogeneous agents (typically from two parties) who are paired for
mutual benefit. During the last decade, matching markets have emerged and grown rapidly through
the medium of the Internet. They have evolved into a new format, called Online Matching Markets (OMMs),
with examples ranging from crowdsourcing to online recommendations to ridesharing. There are
two features distinguishing OMMs from traditional matching markets. One is the dynamic arrival
of one side of the market: we refer to these as online agents while the rest are offline agents. Examples
of online and offline agents include keywords (online) and sponsors (offline) in Google Advertising;
workers (online) and tasks (offline) in Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT); riders (online) and drivers
(offline when restricted to a short time window) in ridesharing. The second distinguishing feature
of OMMs is the real-time decision-making element. However, studies have shown that the algorithms
making decisions in these OMMs leave disparities in the match rates of offline agents. For example,
tasks in neighborhoods of low socioeconomic status rarely get matched to gig workers, and drivers
of certain races/genders get discriminated against in matchmaking. In this paper, we propose online
matching algorithms which optimize for either individual or group-level fairness among offline
agents in OMMs. We present two linear-programming (LP) based sampling algorithms, which achieve
online competitive ratios at least 0.725 for individual fairness maximization (IFM) and 0.719
for group fairness maximization (GFM), respectively. We conduct extensive numerical experiments
and results show that our boosted version of sampling algorithms are not only conceptually easy
to implement but also highly effective in practical instances of fairness-maximization-related
models.

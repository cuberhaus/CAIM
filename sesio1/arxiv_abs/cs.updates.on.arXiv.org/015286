To alleviate green house effect, high network energy efficiency (EE) has increasingly become an
important research target in wireless green communications. Therefore, the investigation for
resource management to mitigate the co-tier interference in the small cell network (SCN) is provided.
Moreover, with the merits of cloud radio access network (C-RAN), small cell base stations (SBSs)
can be decomposed of a central small cell (CSC) and remote small cells (RSCs). To achieve the coordination,
the split medium access control (MAC) based functional splitting is adopted with scheduler deployed
at CSCs and retransmission functions left at RSCs. However, limited fronthaul has a compelling
impact at RSCs due to requirements of user quality-of-service (QoS). Accordingly, a traffic control-based
user association and resource allocation (TURA) scheme is proposed for a centralized resource
management. To deal with the infeasibility to control all RSCs by CSC, we propose a hybrid controlled
user and resource management (HARM) scheme. A CSC performs TURA for RSCs to mitigate intra-group
interference within localized C-RANs, whereas the CSCs among separate C-RANs conduct cooperative
resource competition (CRC) game for alleviating inter-group interference. Based on regret-based
learning algorithm, the proposed schemes are analytically proved to reach the correlated equilibrium
(CE). Simulation results have validated the effect of traffic control in TURA scheme and the convergence
of CRC. Moreover, the comparison of the proposed TURA, HARM, and CRC schemes with the benchmark is
revealed. It is observed that the TURA scheme outperforms the other schemes under ideal fronthaul
control, whilst the proposed HARM scheme can sustain EE performance considering feasible implementation.

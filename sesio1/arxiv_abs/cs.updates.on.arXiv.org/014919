The ubiquitous growth of mobility-on-demand services for passenger and goods delivery has brought
various challenges and opportunities within the realm of transportation systems. As a result,
intelligent transportation systems are being developed to maximize operational profitability,
user convenience, and environmental sustainability. The growth of last mile deliveries alongside
ridesharing calls for an efficient and cohesive system that transports both passengers and goods.
Existing methods address this using static routing methods considering neither the demands of
requests nor the transfer of goods between vehicles during route planning. In this paper, we present
a dynamic and demand aware fleet management framework for combined goods and passenger transportation
that is capable of (1) Involving both passengers and drivers in the decision-making process by allowing
drivers to negotiate to a mutually suitable price, and passengers to accept/reject, (2) Matching
of goods to vehicles, and the multi-hop transfer of goods, (3) Dynamically generating optimal routes
for each vehicle considering demand along their paths, based on the insertion cost which then determines
the matching, (4) Dispatching idle vehicles to areas of anticipated high passenger and goods demand
using Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), (5) Allowing for distributed inference at each vehicle
while collectively optimizing fleet objectives. Our proposed model is deployable independently
within each vehicle as this minimizes computational costs associated with the growth of distributed
systems and democratizes decision-making to each individual. Simulations on a variety of vehicle
types, goods, and passenger utility functions show the effectiveness of our approach as compared
to other methods that do not consider combined load transportation or dynamic multi-hop route planning.

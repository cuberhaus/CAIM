In applications of group testing in networks, e.g. identifying individuals who are infected by
a disease spread over a network, exploiting correlation among network nodes provides fundamental
opportunities in reducing the number of tests needed. We model and analyze group testing on $n$ correlated
nodes whose interactions are specified by a graph $G$. We model correlation through an edge-faulty
random graph formed from $G$ in which each edge is dropped with probability $1-r$, and all nodes in
the same component have the same state. We consider three classes of graphs: cycles and trees, $d$-regular
graphs and stochastic block models or SBM, and obtain lower and upper bounds on the number of tests
needed to identify the defective nodes. Our results are expressed in terms of the number of tests
needed when the nodes are independent and they are in terms of $n$, $r$, and the target error. In particular,
we quantify the fundamental improvements that exploiting correlation offers by the ratio between
the total number of nodes $n$ and the equivalent number of independent nodes in a classic group testing
algorithm. The lower bounds are derived by illustrating a strong dependence of the number of tests
needed on the expected number of components. In this regard, we establish a new approximation for
the distribution of component sizes in "$d$-regular trees" which may be of independent interest
and leads to a lower bound on the expected number of components in $d$-regular graphs. The upper bounds
are found by forming dense subgraphs in which nodes are more likely to be in the same state. When $G$
is a cycle or tree, we show an improvement by a factor of $log(1/r)$. For grid, a graph with almost $2n$
edges, the improvement is by a factor of ${(1-r) \log(1/r)}$, indicating drastic improvement compared
to trees. When $G$ has a larger number of edges, as in SBM, the improvement can scale in $n$.

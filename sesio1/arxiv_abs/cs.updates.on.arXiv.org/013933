Systems whose movement is highly dissipative provide an opportunity to both identify models easily
and quickly optimize motions. Geometric mechanics provides means for reduction of the dynamics
by environmental homogeneity, while the dissipative nature minimizes the role of second order
(inertial) features in the dynamics. Here we extend the tools of geometric system identification
to ``Shape-Underactuated Dissipative Systems (SUDS)'' -- systems whose motions are more dissipative
than inertial, but whose actuation is restricted to a subset of the body shape coordinates. Many
animal motions are SUDS, including micro-swimmers such as nematodes and flagellated bacteria,
and granular locomotors such as snakes and lizards. Many soft robots are also SUDS, particularly
those robots using highly damped series elastic actuators. Whether involved in locomotion or manipulation,
these robots are often used to interface less rigidly with the environment. We motivate the use of
SUDS models, and validate their ability to predict motion of a variety of simulated viscous swimming
platforms. For a large class of SUDS, we show how the shape velocity actuation inputs can be directly
converted into torque inputs suggesting that systems with soft pneumatic actuators or dielectric
elastomers can be modeled with the tools presented. Based on fundamental assumptions in the physics,
we show how our model complexity scales linearly with the number of passive shape coordinates. This
offers a large reduction on the number of trials needed to identify the system model from experimental
data, and may reduce overfitting. The sample efficiency of our method suggests its use in modeling,
control, and optimization in robotics, and as a tool for the study of organismal motion in friction
dominated regimes.

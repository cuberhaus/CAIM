Item-based collaborative filtering (ICF) enjoys the advantages of high recommendation accuracy
and ease in online penalization and thus is favored by the industrial recommender systems. ICF recommends
items to a target user based on their similarities to the previously interacted items of the user.
Great progresses have been achieved for ICF in recent years by applying advanced machine learning
techniques (e.g., deep neural networks) to learn the item similarity from data. The early methods
simply treat all the historical items equally and recently proposed methods attempt to distinguish
the different importance of historical items when recommending a target item. Despite the progress,
we argue that those ICF models neglect the diverse intents of users on adopting items (e.g., watching
a movie because of the director, leading actors, or the visual effects). As a result, they fail to
estimate the item similarity on a finer-grained level to predict the user's preference to an item,
resulting in sub-optimal recommendation. In this work, we propose a general feature-level attention
method for ICF models. The key of our method is to distinguish the importance of different factors
when computing the item similarity for a prediction. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method,
we design a light attention neural network to integrate both item-level and feature-level attention
for neural ICF models. It is model-agnostic and easy-to-implement. We apply it to two baseline ICF
models and evaluate its effectiveness on six public datasets. Extensive experiments show the feature-level
attention enhanced models consistently outperform their counterparts, demonstrating the potential
of differentiating user intents on the feature-level for ICF recommendation models.

The importance of quality measures in process mining has increased. One of the key quality aspects,
generalization, is concerned with measuring the degree of overfitting of a process model w.r.t.
an event log, since the recorded behavior is just an example of the true behavior of the underlying
business process. Existing generalization measures exhibit several shortcomings that severely
hinder their applicability in practice. For example, they assume the event log fully fits the discovered
process model, and cannot deal with large real-life event logs and complex process models. More
significantly, current measures neglect generalizations for clear patterns that demand a certain
construct in the model. For example, a repeating sequence in an event log should be generalized with
a loop structure in the model. We address these shortcomings by proposing a framework of measures
that generalize a set of patterns discovered from an event log with representative traces and check
the corresponding control-flow structures in the process model via their trace alignment. We instantiate
the framework with a generalization measure that uses tandem repeats to identify repetitive patterns
that are compared to the loop structures and a concurrency oracle to identify concurrent patterns
that are compared to the parallel structures of the process model. In an extensive qualitative and
quantitative evaluation using 74 log-model pairs using against two baseline generalization measures,
we show that the proposed generalization measure consistently ranks process models that fulfil
the observed patterns with generalizing control-flow structures higher than those which do not,
while the baseline measures disregard those patterns. Further, we show that our measure can be efficiently
computed for datasets two orders of magnitude larger than the largest dataset the baseline generalization
measures can handle.

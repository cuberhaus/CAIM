Curiosity is a vital metacognitive skill in educational contexts, leading to creativity, and a
love of learning. And while many school systems increasingly undercut curiosity by teaching to
the test, teachers are increasingly interested in how to evoke curiosity in their students to prepare
them for a world in which lifelong learning and reskilling will be more and more important. One aspect
of curiosity that has received little attention, however, is the role of peers in eliciting curiosity.
We present what we believe to be the first theoretical framework that articulates an integrated
socio-cognitive account of curiosity that ties observable behaviors in peers to underlying curiosity
states. We make a bipartite distinction between individual and interpersonal functions that contribute
to curiosity, and multimodal behaviors that fulfill these functions. We validate the proposed
framework by leveraging a longitudinal latent variable modeling approach. Findings confirm a
positive predictive relationship between the latent variables of individual and interpersonal
functions and curiosity, with the interpersonal functions exercising a comparatively stronger
influence. Prominent behavioral realizations of these functions are also discovered in a data-driven
manner. We instantiate the proposed theoretical framework in a set of strategies and tactics that
can be incorporated into learning technologies to indicate, evoke, and scaffold curiosity. This
work is a step towards designing learning technologies that can recognize and evoke moment-by-moment
curiosity during learning in social contexts and towards a more complete multimodal learning analytics.
The underlying rationale is applicable more generally for developing computer support for other
metacognitive and socio-emotional skills.

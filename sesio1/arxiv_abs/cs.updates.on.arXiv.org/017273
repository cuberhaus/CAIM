Forest land plays a vital role in global climate, ecosystems, farming and human living environments.
Therefore, forest biomass estimation methods are necessary to monitor changes in the forest structure
and function, which are key data in natural resources research. Although accurate forest biomass
measurements are important in forest inventory and assessments, high-density measurements that
involve airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) at a low flight height in large mountainous
areas are highly expensive. The objective of this study was to quantify the aboveground biomass
(AGB) of a plateau mountainous forest reserve using a system that synergistically combines an unmanned
aircraft system (UAS)-based digital aerial camera and LiDAR to leverage their complementary advantages.
In this study, we utilized digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP), which has the unique advantages
of speed, high spatial resolution, and low cost, to compensate for the deficiency of forestry inventory
using UAS-based LiDAR that requires terrain-following flight for high-resolution data acquisition.
Combined with the sparse LiDAR points acquired by using a high-altitude and high-speed UAS for terrain
extraction, dense normalized DAP point clouds can be obtained to produce an accurate and high-resolution
canopy height model (CHM). Based on the CHM and spectral attributes obtained from multispectral
images, we estimated and mapped the AGB of the region of interest with considerable cost efficiency.
Our study supports the development of predictive models for large-scale wall-to-wall AGB mapping
by leveraging the complementarity between DAP and LiDAR measurements. This work also reveals the
potential of utilizing a UAS-based digital camera and LiDAR synergistically in a plateau mountainous
forest area.

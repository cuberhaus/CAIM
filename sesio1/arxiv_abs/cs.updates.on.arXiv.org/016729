In the past decade, we have witnessed the rise of deep learning to dominate the field of artificial
intelligence. Advances in artificial neural networks alongside corresponding advances in hardware
accelerators with large memory capacity, together with the availability of large datasets enabled
practitioners to train and deploy sophisticated neural network models that achieve state-of-the-art
performance on tasks across several fields spanning computer vision, natural language processing,
and reinforcement learning. However, as these neural networks become bigger, more complex, and
more widely used, fundamental problems with current deep learning models become more apparent.
State-of-the-art deep learning models are known to suffer from issues that range from poor robustness,
inability to adapt to novel task settings, to requiring rigid and inflexible configuration assumptions.
Collective behavior, commonly observed in nature, tends to produce systems that are robust, adaptable,
and have less rigid assumptions about the environment configuration. Collective intelligence,
as a field, studies the group intelligence that emerges from the interactions of many individuals.
Within this field, ideas such as self-organization, emergent behavior, swarm optimization, and
cellular automata were developed to model and explain complex systems. It is therefore natural
to see these ideas incorporated into newer deep learning methods. In this review, we will provide
a historical context of neural network research's involvement with complex systems, and highlight
several active areas in modern deep learning research that incorporate the principles of collective
intelligence to advance its current capabilities. We hope this review can serve as a bridge between
the complex systems and deep learning communities.

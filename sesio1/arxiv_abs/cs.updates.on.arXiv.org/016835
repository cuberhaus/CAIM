Given a closed simple polygon $P$, we say two points $p,q$ see each other if the segment $pq$ is fully
contained in $P$. The art gallery problem seeks a minimum size set $G\subset P$ of guards that sees
$P$ completely. The only currently correct algorithm to solve the art gallery problem exactly uses
algebraic methods and is attributed to Sharir. As the art gallery problem is ER-complete, it seems
unlikely to avoid algebraic methods, without additional assumptions. In this paper, we introduce
the notion of vision stability. In order to describe vision stability consider an enhanced guard
that can see "around the corner" by an angle of $\delta$ or a diminished guard whose vision is by an
angle of $\delta$ "blocked" by reflex vertices. A polygon $P$ has vision stability $\delta$ if the
optimal number of enhanced guards to guard $P$ is the same as the optimal number of diminished guards
to guard $P$. We will argue that most relevant polygons are vision stable. We describe a one-shot
vision stable algorithm that computes an optimal guard set for visionstable polygons using polynomial
time and solving one integer program. It guarantees to find the optimal solution for every vision
stable polygon. We implemented an iterative visionstable algorithm and show its practical performance
is slower, but comparable with other state of the art algorithms. Our iterative algorithm is inspired
and follows closely the one-shot algorithm. It delays several steps and only computes them when
deemed necessary. Given a chord $c$ of a polygon, we denote by $n(c)$ the number of vertices visible
from $c$. The chord-width of a polygon is the maximum $n(c)$ over all possible chords $c$. The set
of vision stable polygons admits an FPT algorithm when parametrized by the chord-width. Furthermore,
the one-shot algorithm runs in FPT time, when parameterized by the number of reflex vertices.

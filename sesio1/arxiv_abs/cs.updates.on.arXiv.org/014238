\emph{Resistive memories}, such as \emph{phase change memories} and \emph{resistive random
access memories} have attracted significant attention in recent years due to their better scalability,
speed, rewritability, and yet non-volatility. However, their \emph{limited endurance} is still
a major drawback that has to be improved before they can be widely adapted in large-scale systems.
In this work, in order to reduce the wear out of the cells, we propose a new coding scheme, called \emph{endurance-limited
memories} (\emph{ELM}) codes, that increases the endurance of these memories by limiting the number
of cell programming operations. Namely, an \emph{$\ell$-change $t$-write ELM code} is a coding
scheme that allows to write $t$ messages into some $n$ binary cells while guaranteeing that each
cell is programmed at most $\ell$ times. In case $\ell=1$, these codes coincide with the well-studied
\emph{write-once memory} (\emph{WOM}) codes. We study some models of these codes which depend
upon whether the encoder knows on each write the number of times each cell was programmed, knows only
the memory state, or even does not know anything. For the decoder, we consider these similar three
cases. We fully characterize the capacity regions and the maximum sum-rates of three models where
the encoder knows on each write the number of times each cell was programmed. In particular, it is
shown that in these models the maximum sum-rate is $\log \sum_{i=0}^{\ell} {t \choose i}$. We also
study and expose the capacity regions of the models where the decoder is informed with the number
of times each cell was programmed. Finally we present the most practical model where the encoder
read the memory before encoding new data and the decoder has no information about the previous states
of the memory.

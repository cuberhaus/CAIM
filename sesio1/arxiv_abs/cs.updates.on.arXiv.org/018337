An optical microscopic examination of thinly cut stained tissue on glass slides prepared from a
FFPE tissue blocks is the gold standard for tissue diagnostics. In addition, the diagnostic abilities
and expertise of any pathologist is dependent on their direct experience with common as well as rarer
variant morphologies. Recently, deep learning approaches have been used to successfully show
a high level of accuracy for such tasks. However, obtaining expert-level annotated images is an
expensive and time-consuming task and artificially synthesized histological images can prove
greatly beneficial. Here, we present an approach to not only generate histological images that
reproduce the diagnostic morphologic features of common disease but also provide a user ability
to generate new and rare morphologies. Our approach involves developing a generative adversarial
network model that synthesizes pathology images constrained by class labels. We investigated
the ability of this framework in synthesizing realistic prostate and colon tissue images and assessed
the utility of these images in augmenting diagnostic ability of machine learning methods as well
as their usability by a panel of experienced anatomic pathologists. Synthetic data generated by
our framework performed similar to real data in training a deep learning model for diagnosis. Pathologists
were not able to distinguish between real and synthetic images and showed a similar level of inter-observer
agreement for prostate cancer grading. We extended the approach to significantly more complex
images from colon biopsies and showed that the complex microenvironment in such tissues can also
be reproduced. Finally, we present the ability for a user to generate deepfake histological images
via a simple markup of sematic labels.

A multitude of studies have been conducted on graph drawing, but many existing methods only focus
on optimizing particular aesthetic aspects of graph layout. Given a graph, generating a good layout
that satisfies certain human aesthetic preference remains a challenging task, especially if such
preference can not be expressed as a differentiable objective function. In this paper, we propose
a student-teacher GAN-based graph drawing framework, SmartGD, which learns to draw graphs just
like how humans learn to perform tasks. The student network in the SmartGD learns graph drawing by
imitating good layout examples, while the teacher network in SmartGD is responsible for providing
ratings regarding the goodness of the generated layouts. When there is a lack of concrete aesthetic
criteria to specify what constitutes a good layout, the student network can learn from the good layout
examples. On the other hand, when the goodness of a layout can be assessed by quantitative criteria
(even if not differentiable), the student network can use it as a concrete goal to optimize the target
aesthetics. To accomplish the goal, we propose a novel variant of GAN, self-challenging GAN, to
learn the optimal layout distribution with respect to any aesthetic criterion, whether the criterion
is differentiable or not. The proposed graph drawing framework can not only draw graphs in a similar
style as the good layout examples but also optimize the graph layouts according to any given aesthetic
criteria when available. Once the model is trained, it can be used to visualize arbitrary graphs
according to the style of the example layouts or the chosen aesthetic criteria. The comprehensive
experimental studies show that SmartGD outperforms 12 benchmark methods according to the commonly
agreed metrics.

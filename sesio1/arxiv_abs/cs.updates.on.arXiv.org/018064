We investigate the privacy practices of labor organizers in the computing technology industry
and explore the changes in these practices as a response to remote work. Our study is situated at the
intersection of two pivotal shifts in workplace dynamics: (a) the increase in online workplace
communications due to remote work, and (b) the resurgence of the labor movement and an increase in
collective action in workplaces -- especially in the tech industry, where this phenomenon has been
dubbed the tech worker movement. Through a series of qualitative interviews with 29 tech workers
involved in collective action, we investigate how labor organizers assess and mitigate risks to
privacy while engaging in these actions. Among the most common risks that organizers experienced
are retaliation from their employer, lateral worker conflict, emotional burnout, and the possibility
of information about the collective effort leaking to management. Depending on the nature and source
of the risk, organizers use a blend of digital security practices and community-based mechanisms.
We find that digital security practices are more relevant when the threat comes from management,
while community management and moderation are central to protecting organizers from lateral worker
conflict. Since labor organizing is a collective rather than individual project, individual privacy
and collective privacy are intertwined, sometimes in conflict and often mutually constitutive.
Notions of privacy that solely center individuals are often incompatible with the needs of organizers,
who noted that safety in numbers could only be achieved when workers presented a united front to management.
We conclude with design recommendations that can help create safer, more secure and more private
tools to better address the risks that organizers face.

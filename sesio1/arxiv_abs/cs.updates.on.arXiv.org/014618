In the inter-domain network, a route leak occurs when a routing announcement is propagated outside
of its intended scope, which is a violation of the agreed routing policy. The route leaks can disrupt
the internet traffic and cause large outages. The accurately detection of route leaks requires
the share of AS business relationship information of ASes. However, the business relationship
information between ASes is confidential due to economic issues. Thus, ASes are usually unwilling
to revealing this information to the other ASes, especially their competitors. Recent advancements
in federated learning make it possible to share data while maintaining privacy. Motivated by this,
in this paper we study the route leak problem by considering the privacy of business relationships
between ASes, and propose a method for route leak detection with privacy guarantee by using blockchain-based
federated learning framework, in which ASes can train a global detection model without revealing
their business relationships directly. Moreover, the proposed method provides a self-validation
scheme by labeling AS triples with local routing policies, which mitigates route leaks' lack of
ground truth. We evaluate the proposed method under a variety of datasets including unbalanced
and balanced datasets. The different deployment strategies of the proposed method under different
topologies are also examined. The results show that the proposed method has a better performance
in detecting route leaks than a single AS detection regardless of whether using balanced or unbalanced
datasets. In the analysis of the deployment, the results show that ASes with more peers have more
possible route leaks and can contribute more on the detection of route leaks with the proposed method.

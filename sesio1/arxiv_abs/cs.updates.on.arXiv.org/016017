Sender-receiver interactions, and specifically persuasion games, are widely researched in economic
modeling and artificial intelligence. However, in the classic persuasion games setting, the messages
sent from the expert to the decision-maker (DM) are abstract or well-structured signals rather
than natural language messages. This paper addresses the use of natural language in persuasion
games. For this purpose, we conduct an online repeated interaction experiment. At each trial of
the interaction, an informed expert aims to sell an uninformed decision-maker a vacation in a hotel,
by sending her a review that describes the hotel. While the expert is exposed to several scored reviews,
the decision-maker observes only the single review sent by the expert, and her payoff in case she
chooses to take the hotel is a random draw from the review score distribution available to the expert
only. We also compare the behavioral patterns in this experiment to the equivalent patterns in similar
experiments where the communication is based on the numerical values of the reviews rather than
the reviews' text, and observe substantial differences which can be explained through an equilibrium
analysis of the game. We consider a number of modeling approaches for our verbal communication setup,
differing from each other in the model type (deep neural network vs. linear classifier), the type
of features used by the model (textual, behavioral or both) and the source of the textual features
(DNN-based vs. hand-crafted). Our results demonstrate that given a prefix of the interaction sequence,
our models can predict the future decisions of the decision-maker, particularly when a sequential
modeling approach and hand-crafted textual features are applied. Further analysis of the hand-crafted
textual features allows us to make initial observations about the aspects of text that drive decision
making in our setup

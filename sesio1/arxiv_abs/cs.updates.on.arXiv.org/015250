User modeling plays a fundamental role in industrial recommender systems, either in the matching
stage and the ranking stage, in terms of both the customer experience and business revenue. How to
extract users' multiple interests effectively from their historical behavior sequences to improve
the relevance and personalization of the recommend results remains an open problem for user modeling.Most
existing deep-learning based approaches exploit item-ids and category-ids but neglect fine-grained
features like color and mate-rial, which hinders modeling the fine granularity of users' interests.In
the paper, we present Multiple interest and Fine granularity Net-work (MFN), which tackle users'
multiple and fine-grained interests and construct the model from both the similarity relationship
and the combination relationship among the users' multiple interests.Specifically, for modeling
the similarity relationship, we leverage two sets of embeddings, where one is the fixed embedding
from pre-trained models (e.g. Glove) to give the attention weights and the other is trainable embedding
to be trained with MFN together.For modeling the combination relationship, self-attentive layers
are exploited to build the higher order combinations of different interest representations. In
the construction of network, we design an interest-extract module using attention mechanism to
capture multiple interest representations from user historical behavior sequences and leverage
an auxiliary loss to boost the distinction of the interest representations. Then a hierarchical
network is applied to model the attention relation between the multiple interest vectors of different
granularities and the target item. We evaluate MFNon both public and industrial datasets. The experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed MFN achieves superior performance than other existed representing
methods.

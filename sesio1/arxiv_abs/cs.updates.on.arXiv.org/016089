In the storied Colonel Blotto game, two colonels allocate $a$ and $b$ troops, respectively, to $k$
distinct battlefields. A colonel wins a battle if they assign more troops to that particular battle,
and each colonel seeks to maximize their total number of victories. Despite the problem's formulation
in 1921, the first polynomial-time algorithm to compute Nash equilibrium (NE) strategies for this
game was discovered only quite recently. In 2016, \citep{ahmadinejad_dehghani_hajiaghayi_lucier_mahini_seddighin_2019}
formulated a breakthrough algorithm to compute NE strategies for the Colonel Blotto game in computational
complexity $O(k^{14}\max\{a,b\}^{13})$, receiving substantial media coverage (e.g. \citep{Insider},
\citep{NSF}, \citep{ScienceDaily}). This is the only known provably efficient algorithm for
the Colonel Blotto game with general parameters. In this work, we present the first known algorithm
to compute $\epsilon$-approximate NE strategies in the two-player Colonel Blotto game in runtime
$\widetilde{O}(\epsilon^{-4} k^8 \max\{a,b\})$ for arbitrary settings of these parameters.
Moreover, this algorithm computes approximate coarse correlated equilibrium strategies in the
multiplayer Colonel Blotto game (when there are $\ell > 2$ colonels) with runtime $\widetilde{O}(\ell
\epsilon^{-4} k^8 n + \ell^2 \epsilon^{-2} k^3 n)$, where $n$ is the maximum troop count. Before
this work, no polynomial-time algorithm was known to compute exact or approximate equilibrium
(in any sense) strategies for multiplayer Colonel Blotto with arbitrary parameters. Our algorithm
computes these approximate equilibria through a novel (to the author's knowledge) sampling technique
with which it implicitly performs multiplicative weights update over the exponentially many strategies
available to each player.

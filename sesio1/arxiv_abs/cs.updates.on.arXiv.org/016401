The mercury constitutive model predicting the strain and stress in the target vessel plays a central
role in improving the lifetime prediction and future target designs of the mercury targets at the
Spallation Neutron Source (SNS). We leverage the experiment strain data collected over multiple
years to improve the mercury constitutive model through a combination of large-scale simulations
of the target behavior and the use of machine learning tools for parameter estimation. We present
two interdisciplinary approaches for surrogate-based model calibration of expensive simulations
using evolutionary neural networks and sparse polynomial expansions. The experiments and results
of the two methods show a very good agreement for the solid mechanics simulation of the mercury spallation
target. The proposed methods are used to calibrate the tensile cutoff threshold, mercury density,
and mercury speed of sound during intense proton pulse experiments. Using strain experimental
data from the mercury target sensors, the newly calibrated simulations achieve 7\% average improvement
on the signal prediction accuracy and 8\% reduction in mean absolute error compared to previously
reported reference parameters, with some sensors experiencing up to 30\% improvement. The proposed
calibrated simulations can significantly aid in fatigue analysis to estimate the mercury target
lifetime and integrity, which reduces abrupt target failure and saves a tremendous amount of costs.
However, an important conclusion from this work points out to a deficiency in the current constitutive
model based on the equation of state in capturing the full physics of the spallation reaction. Given
that some of the calibrated parameters that show a good agreement with the experimental data can
be nonphysical mercury properties, we need a more advanced two-phase flow model to capture bubble
dynamics and mercury cavitation.

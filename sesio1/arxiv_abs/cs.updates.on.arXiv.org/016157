The current medical standard for setting an oral cancer (OC) diagnosis is histological examination
of a tissue sample from the oral cavity. This process is time consuming and more invasive than an alternative
approach of acquiring a brush sample followed by cytological analysis. Skilled cytotechnologists
are able to detect changes due to malignancy, however, to introduce this approach into clinical
routine is associated with challenges such as a lack of experts and labour-intensive work. To design
a trustworthy OC detection system that would assist cytotechnologists, we are interested in AI-based
methods that reliably can detect cancer given only per-patient labels (minimizing annotation
bias), and also provide information on which cells are most relevant for the diagnosis (enabling
supervision and understanding). We, therefore, perform a comparison of a conventional single
instance learning (SIL) approach and a modern multiple instance learning (MIL) method suitable
for OC detection and interpretation, utilizing three different neural network architectures.
To facilitate systematic evaluation of the considered approaches, we introduce a synthetic PAP-QMNIST
dataset, that serves as a model of OC data, while offering access to per-instance ground truth. Our
study indicates that on PAP-QMNIST, the SIL performs better, on average, than the MIL approach.
Performance at the bag level on real-world cytological data is similar for both methods, yet the
single instance approach performs better on average. Visual examination by cytotechnologist
indicates that the methods manage to identify cells which deviate from normality, including malignant
cells as well as those suspicious for dysplasia. We share the code as open source at https://github.com/MIDA-group/OralCancerMILvsSIL

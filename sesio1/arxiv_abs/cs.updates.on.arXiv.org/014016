Radiomics is an active area of research focusing on high throughput feature extraction from medical
images with a wide array of applications in clinical practice, such as clinical decision support
in oncology. However, noise in low dose computed tomography (CT) scans can impair the accurate extraction
of radiomic features. In this article, we investigate the possibility of using deep learning generative
models to improve the performance of radiomics from low dose CTs. We used two datasets of low dose
CT scans -NSCLC Radiogenomics and LIDC-IDRI - as test datasets for two tasks - pre-treatment survival
prediction and lung cancer diagnosis. We used encoder-decoder networks and conditional generative
adversarial networks (CGANs) trained in a previous study as generative models to transform low
dose CT images into full dose CT images. Radiomic features extracted from the original and improved
CT scans were used to build two classifiers - a support vector machine (SVM) and a deep attention based
multiple instance learning model - for survival prediction and lung cancer diagnosis respectively.
Finally, we compared the performance of the models derived from the original and improved CT scans.
Encoder-decoder networks and CGANs improved the area under the curve (AUC) of survival prediction
from 0.52 to 0.57 (p-value<0.01). On the other hand, Encoder-decoder network and CGAN can improve
the AUC of lung cancer diagnosis from 0.84 to 0.88 and 0.89 respectively (p-value<0.01). Moreover,
there are no statistically significant differences in improving AUC by using encoder-decoder
network and CGAN (p-value=0.34) when networks trained at 75 and 100 epochs. Generative models can
improve the performance of low dose CT-based radiomics in different tasks. Hence, denoising using
generative models seems to be a necessary pre-processing step for calculating radiomic features
from low dose CTs.

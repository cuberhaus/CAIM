Signal maps are essential for the planning and operation of cellular networks. However, the measurements
needed to create such maps are expensive, often biased, not always reflecting the metrics of interest,
and posing privacy risks. In this paper, we develop a unified framework for predicting cellular
signal maps from limited measurements. Our framework builds on a state-of-the-art random-forest
predictor, or any other base predictor. We propose and combine three mechanisms that deal with the
fact that not all measurements are equally important for a particular prediction task. First, we
design quality-of-service functions ($Q$), including signal strength (RSRP) but also other metrics
of interest to operators, i.e., coverage and call drop probability. By implicitly altering the
loss function employed in learning, quality functions can also improve prediction for RSRP itself
where it matters (e.g., MSE reduction up to 27% in the low signal strength regime, where errors are
critical). Second, we introduce weight functions ($W$) to specify the relative importance of prediction
at different locations and other parts of the feature space. We propose re-weighting based on importance
sampling to obtain unbiased estimators when the sampling and target distributions are different.
This yields improvements up to 20% for targets based on spatially uniform loss or losses based on
user population density. Third, we apply the Data Shapley framework for the first time in this context:
to assign values ($\phi$) to individual measurement points, which capture the importance of their
contribution to the prediction task. This improves prediction (e.g., from 64% to 94% in recall for
coverage loss) by removing points with negative values, and can also enable data minimization.
We evaluate our methods and demonstrate significant improvement in prediction performance, using
several real-world datasets.

Crowd localization is to predict each instance head position in crowd scenarios. Since the distance
of instances being to the camera are variant, there exists tremendous gaps among scales of instances
within an image, which is called the intrinsic scale shift. The core reason of intrinsic scale shift
being one of the most essential issues in crowd localization is that it is ubiquitous in crowd scenes
and makes scale distribution chaotic. To this end, the paper concentrates on access to tackle the
chaos of the scale distribution incurred by intrinsic scale shift. We propose Gaussian Mixture
Scope (GMS) to regularize the chaotic scale distribution. Concretely, the GMS utilizes a Gaussian
mixture distribution to adapt to scale distribution and decouples the mixture model into sub-normal
distributions to regularize the chaos within the sub-distributions. Then, an alignment is introduced
to regularize the chaos among sub-distributions. However, despite that GMS is effective in regularizing
the data distribution, it amounts to dislodging the hard samples in training set, which incurs overfitting.
We assert that it is blamed on the block of transferring the latent knowledge exploited by GMS from
data to model. Therefore, a Scoped Teacher playing a role of bridge in knowledge transform is proposed.
What' s more, the consistency regularization is also introduced to implement knowledge transform.
To that effect, the further constraints are deployed on Scoped Teacher to derive feature consistence
between teacher and student end. With proposed GMS and Scoped Teacher implemented on five mainstream
datasets of crowd localization, the extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our
work. Moreover, comparing with existing crowd locators, our work achieves state-of-the-art via
F1-meansure comprehensively on five datasets.

Since gyri and sulci, two basic anatomical building blocks of cortical folding patterns, were suggested
to bear different functional roles, a precise mapping from brain function to gyro-sulcal patterns
can provide profound insights into both biological and artificial neural networks. However, there
lacks a generic theory and effective computational model so far, due to the highly nonlinear relation
between them, huge inter-individual variabilities and a sophisticated description of brain function
regions/networks distribution as mosaics, such that spatial patterning of them has not been considered.
we adopted brain functional gradients derived from resting-state fMRI to embed the "gradual" change
of functional connectivity patterns, and developed a novel attention mesh convolution model to
predict cortical gyro-sulcal segmentation maps on individual brains. The convolution on mesh
considers the spatial organization of functional gradients and folding patterns on a cortical
sheet and the newly designed channel attention block enhances the interpretability of the contribution
of different functional gradients to cortical folding prediction. Experiments show that the prediction
performance via our model outperforms other state-of-the-art models. In addition, we found that
the dominant functional gradients contribute less to folding prediction. On the activation maps
of the last layer, some well-studied cortical landmarks are found on the borders of, rather than
within, the highly activated regions. These results and findings suggest that a specifically designed
artificial neural network can improve the precision of the mapping between brain functions and
cortical folding patterns, and can provide valuable insight of brain anatomy-function relation
for neuroscience.

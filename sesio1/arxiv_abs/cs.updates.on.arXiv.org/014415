In the field of Natural Language Processing, information extraction from texts has been the objective
of many researchers for years. Many different techniques have been applied in order to reveal the
opinion that a tweet might have, thus understanding the sentiment of the small writing up to 280 characters.
Other than figuring out the sentiment of a tweet, a study can also focus on finding the correlation
of the tweets with a certain area of interest, which constitutes the purpose of this study. In order
to reveal if an area of interest has a trend in ongoing tweets, we have proposed an easily applicable
automated methodology in which the Daily Mean Similarity Scores that show the similarity between
the daily tweet corpus and the target words representing our area of interest is calculated by using
a na\"ive correlation-based technique without training any Machine Learning Model. The Daily
Mean Similarity Scores have mainly based on cosine similarity and word/sentence embeddings computed
by Multilanguage Universal Sentence Encoder and showed main opinion stream of the tweets with respect
to a certain area of interest, which proves that an ongoing trend of a specific subject on Twitter
can easily be captured in almost real time by using the proposed methodology in this study. We have
also compared the effectiveness of using word versus sentence embeddings while applying our methodology
and realized that both give almost the same results, whereas using word embeddings requires less
computational time than sentence embeddings, thus being more effective. This paper will start
with an introduction followed by the background information about the basics, then continue with
the explanation of the proposed methodology and later on finish by interpreting the results and
concluding the findings.

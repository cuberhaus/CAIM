Performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in image analysis tasks is often marred in
the presence of acquisition-related distribution shifts between training and test images. Recently,
it has been proposed to tackle this problem by fine-tuning trained CNNs for each test image. Such
test-time-adaptation (TTA) is a promising and practical strategy for improving robustness to
distribution shifts as it requires neither data sharing between institutions nor annotating additional
data. Previous TTA methods use a helper model to increase similarity between outputs and/or features
extracted from a test image with those of the training images. Such helpers, which are typically
modeled using CNNs, can be task-specific and themselves vulnerable to distribution shifts in their
inputs. To overcome these problems, we propose to carry out TTA by matching the feature distributions
of test and training images, as modelled by a field-of-experts (FoE) prior. FoEs model complicated
probability distributions as products of many simpler expert distributions. We use 1D marginal
distributions of a trained task CNN's features as experts in the FoE model. Further, we compute principal
components of patches of the task CNN's features, and consider the distributions of PCA loadings
as additional experts. We validate the method on 5 MRI segmentation tasks (healthy tissues in 4 anatomical
regions and lesions in 1 one anatomy), using data from 17 clinics, and on a MRI registration task,
using data from 3 clinics. We find that the proposed FoE-based TTA is generically applicable in multiple
tasks, and outperforms all previous TTA methods for lesion segmentation. For healthy tissue segmentation,
the proposed method outperforms other task-agnostic methods, but a previous TTA method which is
specifically designed for segmentation performs the best for most of the tested datasets. Our code
is publicly available.

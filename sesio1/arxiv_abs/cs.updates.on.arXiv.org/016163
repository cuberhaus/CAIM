Click-stream data, which comes with a massive volume generated by the human activities on the websites,
has become a prominent feature to identify readers' characteristics by the newsrooms after the
digitization of the news outlets. It is essential to have elastic architectures to process the streaming
data, particularly for unprecedented traffic, enabling conducting more comprehensive analyses
such as recommending mostly related articles to the readers. Although the nature of click-stream
data has a similar logic within the websites, it has inherent limitations to recognize human behaviors
when looking from a broad perspective, which brings the need of limiting the problem in niche areas.
This study investigates the anonymized readers' click activities in the organizations' websites
to identify news consumption patterns following referrals from Twitter, who incidentally reach
but propensity is mainly the routed news content. The investigation is widened to a broad perspective
by linking the log data with news content to enrich the insights rather than sticking into the web
journey. The methodologies on ensemble cluster analysis with mixed-type embedding strategies
are applied and compared to find similar reader groups and interests independent from time. Our
results demonstrate that the quality of clustering mixed-type data set approaches to optimal internal
validation scores when embedded by Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) and using
consensus function as a key to access the most applicable hyper parameter configurations in the
given ensemble rather than using consensus function results directly. Evaluation of the resulting
clusters highlights specific clusters repeatedly present in the samples, which provide insights
to the news organizations and overcome the degradation of the modeling behaviors due to the change
in the interest over time.

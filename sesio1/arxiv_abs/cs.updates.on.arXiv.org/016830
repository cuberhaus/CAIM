Blockchain technology has the characteristics of decentralization, traceability and tamper-proof,
which creates a reliable decentralized trust mechanism, further accelerating the development
of blockchain finance. However, the anonymization of blockchain hinders market regulation, resulting
in increasing illegal activities such as money laundering, gambling and phishing fraud on blockchain
financial platforms. Thus financial security has become a top priority in the blockchain ecosystem,
calling for effective market regulation. In this paper, we consider identifying Ethereum accounts
from a graph classification perspective, and propose an end-to-end graph neural network framework
named Ethident, to characterize the behavior patterns of accounts and further achieve account
de-anonymization. Specifically, we first construct an Account Interaction Graph (AIG) using
raw Ethereum data. Then we design a hierarchical graph attention encoder named HGATE as the backbone
of our framework, which can effectively characterize the node-level account features and subgraph-level
behavior patterns. For alleviating account label sparsity, we further introduce contrastive
self-supervision mechanism as regularization to jointly train our framework. Comprehensive
experiments on Ethereum datasets demonstrate that our framework achieves superior performance
in account identification, yielding 1.13% - 4.93% relative improvement over previous state-of-the-art.
Furthermore, detailed analyses illustrate the effectiveness of Ethident in identifying and understanding
the behavior of known participants in Ethereum (e.g. exchanges, miners, etc.), as well as that of
the lawbreakers (e.g. phishing scammers, hackers, etc.), which may aid in risk assessment and market
regulation.

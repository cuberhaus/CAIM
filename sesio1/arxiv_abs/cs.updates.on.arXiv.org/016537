Performance and reliability are two prominent factors in the design of data storage systems. To
achieve higher performance, recently storage system designers use DRAM-based buffers. The volatility
of DRAM brings up the possibility of data loss, so a part of the main storage is conventionally used
as the journal area to be able of recovering unflushed data pages in the case of power failure. Moreover,
periodically flushing buffered data pages to the main storage is a common mechanism to preserve
a high level of reliability, which leads to an increase in storage write traffic. To address this
shortcoming, recent studies offer a small NVM as the Persistent Journal Area (PJA) along with DRAM
as an efficient approach, named NVM-Backed Buffer (NVB-Buffer). This approach aims to address
DRAM vulnerability against power failure while reducing storage write traffic. In this paper,
we use the most promising technologies for PJA among the emerging technologies, which is STT-MRAM
to meet the requirements of PJA (high endurance, non-volatility, and DRAM-like latency). However,
STT-MRAM faces major reliability challenges, i.e. Retention Failure, Read Disturbance, and Write
Failure. In this paper, we first show that retention failure is the dominant source of errors in NVB-Buffers
as it suffers from long and unpredictable page idle intervals. Then, we propose a novel NVB-Buffer
management scheme, named, Cold Page Awakening (CoPA), which predictably reduces the idle time
of PJA pages. To this aim, CoPA employs Distant Refreshing to periodically overwrite the vulnerable
PJA page contents by using their replica in DRAM-based buffer. We compare CoPA with the state-of-the-art
schemes over several workloads based on physical journaling. Our evaluations show that employing
CoPA leads to three orders of magnitude lower failure rate with negligible performance degradation
(1.1%) and memory overhead (1.2%).

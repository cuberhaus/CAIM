Reliably and physically accurately transferring information between images through deformable
image registration with large anatomical differences is an open challenge in medical image analysis.
Most existing methods have two key shortcomings: first, they require extensive up-front parameter
tuning to each specific registration problem, and second, they have difficulty capturing large
deformations and content mismatches between images. There have however been developments that
have laid the foundation for potential solutions to both shortcomings. Towards the first shortcoming,
a multi-objective optimization approach using the Real-Valued Gene-pool Optimal Mixing Evolutionary
Algorithm (RV-GOMEA) has been shown to be capable of producing a diverse set of registrations for
2D images in one run of the algorithm, representing different trade-offs between conflicting objectives
in the registration problem. This allows the user to select a registration afterwards and removes
the need for up-front tuning. Towards the second shortcoming, a dual-dynamic grid transformation
model has proven effective at capturing large differences in 2D images. These two developments
have recently been accelerated through GPU parallelization, delivering large speed-ups. Based
on this accelerated version, it is now possible to extend the approach to 3D images. Concordantly,
this work introduces the first method for multi-objective 3D deformable image registration, using
a 3D dual-dynamic grid transformation model based on simplex meshes while still supporting the
incorporation of annotated guidance information and multi-resolution schemes. Our proof-of-concept
prototype shows promising results on synthetic and clinical 3D registration problems, forming
the foundation for a new, insightful method that can include bio-mechanical properties in the registration.

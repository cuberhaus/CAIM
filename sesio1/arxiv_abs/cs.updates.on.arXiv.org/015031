Online voting for independent elections is generally supported by trusted election providers.
Typically these providers do not offer any way in which a voter can verify their vote, so the providers
are trusted with ballot privacy and ensuring correctness. Despite the desire to offer online voting
for political elections, this lack of transparency and verifiability is often seen as a significant
barrier to the large-scale adoption of online elections. Adding verifiability to an online election
increases transparency and integrity, allowing voters to verify that their vote has been recorded
correctly and included in the tally. However, replacing existing online systems with those that
provide verifiable voting requires new algorithms and code to be deployed, and this presents a significant
business risk to commercial election providers. In this paper we present the first step in an incremental
approach which minimises the business risk but demonstrates the advantages of verifiability,
by developing an implementation of key elements of a Selene-based verifiability layer and adding
it to an operational online voting system. Selene is a verifiable voting protocol that uses trackers
to enable voters to confirm that their votes have been captured correctly while protecting voter
anonymity. This results in a system where even the election authority running the system cannot
change the result in an undetectable way, and gives stronger guarantees on the integrity of the election
than were previously present. We explore the challenges presented by adding a verifiability layer
to an operational system. We describe the results of two initial trials, which obtained that survey
respondents found this form of verifiability easy to use and that they broadly appreciated it. We
conclude by outlining the further steps in the road-map towards the deployment of a fully trustworthy
online voting system.

In future 6G millimeter wave (mmWave)/sub-THz vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication systems,
vehicles are expected to be equipped with massive antenna arrays to realize beam-based links capable
of compensating for the severe path loss. However, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) direct links are prone
to be blocked by surrounding vehicles. Emerging metasurface technologies enable the control of
the electromagnetic wave reflection towards the desired direction, enriching the channel scattering
to boost communication performance. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), and mostly the
pre-configured counterpart intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS), are a promising low-cost
relaying system for 6G. This paper proposes using conformal metasurfaces (either C-RIS or C-IRS)
deployed on vehicles' body to mitigate the blockage impact in a highway multi-lane scenario. In
particular, conformal metasurfaces create artificial reflections to mitigate blockage by compensating
for the non-flat shape of the vehicle's body, such as the lateral doors, with proper phase patterns.
We analytically derive the phase pattern to apply to a cylindrical C-RIS/C-IRS approximating the
shape of the car body, as a function of both incidence and reflection angles, considering cylindrical
RIS/IRS as a generalization of conventional planar ones. We propose a novel design for optimally
pre-configured C-IRS to mimic the behavior of an EM flat surface on car doors, proving the benefits
of C-RIS and C-IRS in a multi-lane V2V highway scenario. The results show a consistent reduction
of blockage probability when exploiting C-RIS/C-IRS, 20% for pre-configured C-IRS, and 70% for
C-RIS, as well as a remarkable improvement in terms of average signal-to-noise ratio, respectively
10-20 dB for C-IRS and 30-40 dB for C-RIS.

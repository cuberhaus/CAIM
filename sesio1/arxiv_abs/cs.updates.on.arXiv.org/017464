Despite impressive state-of-the-art performance on a wide variety of machine learning tasks,
deep learning methods can produce over-confident predictions, particularly with limited training
data. Therefore, quantifying uncertainty is particularly important in critical applications
such as lesion detection and clinical diagnosis, where a realistic assessment of uncertainty is
essential in determining surgical margins, disease status and appropriate treatment. In this
work, we propose a novel approach that uses quantile regression for quantifying aleatoric uncertainty
in both supervised and unsupervised lesion detection problems. The resulting confidence intervals
can be used for lesion detection and segmentation. In the unsupervised setting, we combine quantile
regression with the Variational AutoEncoder (VAE). Here we address the problem of quantifying
uncertainty in the images that are reconstructed by the VAE as the basis for principled outlier or
lesion detection. The VAE models the output as a conditionally independent Gaussian characterized
by its mean and variance. Unfortunately, joint optimization of both mean and variance in the VAE
leads to the well-known problem of shrinkage or underestimation of variance. Here we describe an
alternative Quantile-Regression VAE (QR-VAE) that avoids this variance shrinkage problem by
directly estimating conditional quantiles for the input image. Using the estimated quantiles,
we compute the conditional mean and variance for the input image from which we then detect outliers
by thresholding at a false-discovery-rate corrected p-value. In the supervised setting, we develop
binary quantile regression (BQR) for the supervised lesion segmentation task. We show how BQR can
be used to capture uncertainty in lesion boundaries in a manner that characterizes expert disagreement.

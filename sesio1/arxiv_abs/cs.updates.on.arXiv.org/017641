We propose a new variable selection algorithm, subsample-ordered least-angle regression (solar),
and its coordinate descent generalization, solar-cd. Solar re-constructs lasso paths using the
$L_0$ norm and averages the resulting solution paths across subsamples. Path averaging retains
the ranking information of the informative variables while averaging out sensitivity to high dimensionality,
improving variable selection stability, efficiency, and accuracy. We prove that: (i) with a high
probability, path averaging perfectly separates informative variables from redundant variables
on the average $L_0$ path; (ii) solar variable selection is consistent and accurate; and (iii) the
probability that solar omits weak signals is controllable for finite sample size. We also demonstrate
that: (i) solar yields, with less than $1/3$ of the lasso computation load, substantial improvements
over lasso in terms of the sparsity (64-84\% reduction in redundant variable selection) and accuracy
of variable selection; (ii) compared with the lasso safe/strong rule and variable screening, solar
largely avoids selection of redundant variables and rejection of informative variables in the
presence of complicated dependence structures; (iii) the sparsity and stability of solar conserves
residual degrees of freedom for data-splitting hypothesis testing, improving the accuracy of
post-selection inference on weak signals with limited $n$; (iv) replacing lasso with solar in bootstrap
selection (e.g., bolasso or stability selection) produces a multi-layer variable ranking scheme
that improves selection sparsity and ranking accuracy with the computation load of only one lasso
realization; and (v) given the computation resources, solar bootstrap selection is substantially
faster (98\% lower computation time) than the theoretical maximum speedup for parallelized bootstrap
lasso (confirmed by Amdahl's law).

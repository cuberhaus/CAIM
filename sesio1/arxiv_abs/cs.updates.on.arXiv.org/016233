Interaction between devices, people, and the Internet has given birth to a new digital communication
model, the Internet of Things (IoT). The seamless network of these smart devices is the core of this
IoT model. However, on the other hand, integrating smart devices to constitute a network introduces
many security challenges. These connected devices have created a security blind spot, where cybercriminals
can easily launch an attack to compromise the devices using malware proliferation techniques.
Therefore, malware detection is considered a lifeline for the survival of IoT devices against cyberattacks.
This study proposes a novel IoT Malware Detection Architecture (iMDA) using squeezing and boosting
dilated convolutional neural network (CNN). The proposed architecture exploits the concepts
of edge and smoothing, multi-path dilated convolutional operations, channel squeezing, and boosting
in CNN. Edge and smoothing operations are employed with split-transform-merge (STM) blocks to
extract local structure and minor contrast variation in the malware images. STM blocks performed
multi-path dilated convolutional operations, which helped recognize the global structure of
malware patterns. Additionally, channel squeezing and merging helped to get the prominent reduced
and diverse feature maps, respectively. Channel squeezing and boosting are applied with the help
of STM block at the initial, middle and final levels to capture the texture variation along with the
depth for the sake of malware pattern hunting. The proposed architecture has shown substantial
performance compared with the customized CNN models. The proposed iMDA has achieved Accuracy:
97.93%, F1-Score: 0.9394, Precision: 0.9864, MCC: 0. 8796, Recall: 0.8873, AUC-PR: 0.9689 and
AUC-ROC: 0.9938.

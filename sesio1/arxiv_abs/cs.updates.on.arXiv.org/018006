Traditional content-based tag recommender systems directly learn the association between user-generated
content (UGC) and tags based on collected UGC-tag pairs. However, since a UGC uploader simultaneously
creates the UGC and selects the corresponding tags, her personal preference inevitably biases
the tag selections, which prevents these recommenders from learning the causal influence of UGCs'
content features on tags. In this paper, we propose a deep deconfounded content-based tag recommender
system, namely, DecTag, to address the above issues. We first establish a causal graph to represent
the relations among uploader, UGC, and tag, where the uploaders are identified as confounders that
spuriously correlate UGC and tag selections. Specifically, to eliminate the confounding bias,
causal intervention is conducted on the UGC node in the graph via backdoor adjustment, where uploaders'
influence on tags leaked through backdoor paths can be eliminated for causal effect estimation.
Observing that adjusting the causal graph with do-calculus requires integrating the entire uploader
space, which is infeasible, we design a novel Monte Carlo (MC)-based estimator with bootstrap,
which can achieve asymptotic unbiasedness provided that uploaders for the collected UGCs are i.i.d.
samples from the population. In addition, the MC estimator has the intuition of substituting the
biased uploaders with a hypothetical random uploader from the population in the training phase,
where deconfounding can be achieved in an interpretable manner. Finally, we establish a YT-8M-Causal
dataset based on the widely used YouTube-8M dataset with causal intervention and propose an evaluation
strategy accordingly to unbiasedly evaluate causal tag recommenders. Extensive experiments
show that DecTag is more robust to confounding bias than state-of-the-art causal recommenders.

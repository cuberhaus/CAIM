Since the outbreak of COVID-19, an astronomical number of publications on the pandemic dynamics
appeared in the literature, of which many use the susceptible infected removed (SIR) and susceptible
exposed infected removed (SEIR) models, or their variants, to simulate and study the spread of the
coronavirus. SIR and SEIR are continuous-time models which are a class of initial value problems
(IVPs) of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Discrete-time models such as regression and
machine learning have also been applied to analyze COVID-19 pandemic data (e.g. predicting infection
cases), but most of these methods use simplified models involving a small number of input variables
pre-selected based on a priori knowledge, or use very complicated models (e.g. deep learning),
purely focusing on certain prediction purposes and paying little attention to the model interpretability.
There have been relatively fewer studies focusing on the investigations of the inherent time-lagged
or time-delayed relationships e.g. between the reproduction number (R number), infection cases,
and deaths, analyzing the pandemic spread from a systems thinking and dynamic perspective. The
present study, for the first time, proposes using systems engineering and system identification
approach to build transparent, interpretable, parsimonious and simulatable (TIPS) dynamic machine
learning models, establishing links between the R number, the infection cases and deaths caused
by COVID-19. The TIPS models are developed based on the well-known NARMAX (Nonlinear AutoRegressive
Moving Average with eXogenous inputs) model, which can help better understand the COVID-19 pandemic
dynamics. A case study on the UK COVID-19 data is carried out, and new findings are detailed. The proposed
method and the associated new findings are useful for better understanding the spread dynamics
of the COVID-19 pandemic.

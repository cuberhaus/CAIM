The integration of artificial intelligence into clinical workflows requires reliable and robust
models. Repeatability is a key attribute of model robustness. Repeatable models output predictions
with low variation during independent tests carried out under similar conditions. During model
development and evaluation, much attention is given to classification performance while model
repeatability is rarely assessed, leading to the development of models that are unusable in clinical
practice. In this work, we evaluate the repeatability of four model types (binary classification,
multi-class classification, ordinal classification, and regression) on images that were acquired
from the same patient during the same visit. We study the performance of binary, multi-class, ordinal,
and regression models on four medical image classification tasks from public and private datasets:
knee osteoarthritis, cervical cancer screening, breast density estimation, and retinopathy
of prematurity. Repeatability is measured and compared on ResNet and DenseNet architectures.
Moreover, we assess the impact of sampling Monte Carlo dropout predictions at test time on classification
performance and repeatability. Leveraging Monte Carlo predictions significantly increased
repeatability for all tasks on the binary, multi-class, and ordinal models leading to an average
reduction of the 95\% limits of agreement by 16% points and of the disagreement rate by 7% points.
The classification accuracy improved in most settings along with the repeatability. Our results
suggest that beyond about 20 Monte Carlo iterations, there is no further gain in repeatability.
In addition to the higher test-retest agreement, Monte Carlo predictions were better calibrated
which leads to output probabilities reflecting more accurately the true likelihood of being correctly
classified.

Predicting the future states of surrounding traffic participants and planning a safe, smooth,
and socially compliant trajectory accordingly is crucial for autonomous vehicles. There are two
major issues with the current autonomous driving system: the prediction module is often decoupled
from the planning module and the cost function for planning is hard to specify and tune. To tackle
these issues, we propose an end-to-end differentiable framework that integrates prediction and
planning modules and is able to learn the cost function from data. Specifically, we employ a differentiable
nonlinear optimizer as the motion planner, which takes the predicted trajectories of surrounding
agents given by the neural network as input and optimizes the trajectory for the autonomous vehicle,
thus enabling all operations in the framework to be differentiable including the cost function
weights. The proposed framework is trained on a large-scale real-world driving dataset to imitate
human driving trajectories in the entire driving scene and validated in both open-loop and closed-loop
manners. The open-loop testing results reveal that the proposed method outperforms the baseline
methods across a variety of metrics and delivers planning-centric prediction results, allowing
the planning module to output close-to-human trajectories. In closed-loop testing, the proposed
method shows the ability to handle complex urban driving scenarios and robustness against the distributional
shift that imitation learning methods suffer from. Importantly, we find that joint training of
planning and prediction modules achieves better performance than planning with a separate trained
prediction module in both open-loop and closed-loop tests. Moreover, the ablation study indicates
that the learnable components in the framework are essential to ensure planning stability and performance.

Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a family of graphs, and let $p,r$ be nonnegative integers. The \textsc{$(p,r,\mathcal{F})$-Covering}
problem asks whether for a graph $G$ and an integer $k$, there exists a set $D$ of at most $k$ vertices
in $G$ such that $G^p\setminus N_G^r[D]$ has no induced subgraph isomorphic to a graph in $\mathcal{F}$,
where $G^p$ is the $p$-th power of $G$. The \textsc{$(p,r,\mathcal{F})$-Packing} problem asks
whether for a graph $G$ and an integer $k$, $G^p$ has $k$ induced subgraphs $H_1,\ldots,H_k$ such
that each $H_i$ is isomorphic to a graph in $\mathcal{F}$, and for distinct $i,j\in \{1, \ldots,
k\}$, the distance between $V(H_i)$ and $V(H_j)$ in $G$ is larger than $r$. We show that for every
fixed nonnegative integers $p,r$ and every fixed nonempty finite family $\mathcal{F}$ of connected
graphs, the \textsc{$(p,r,\mathcal{F})$-Covering} problem with $p\leq2r+1$ and the \textsc{$(p,r,\mathcal{F})$-Packing}
problem with $p\leq2\lfloor r/2\rfloor+1$ admit almost linear kernels on every nowhere dense
class of graphs, and admit linear kernels on every class of graphs with bounded expansion, parameterized
by the solution size $k$. We obtain the same kernels for their annotated variants. As corollaries,
we prove that \textsc{Distance-$r$ Vertex Cover}, \textsc{Distance-$r$ Matching}, \textsc{$\mathcal{F}$-Free
Vertex Deletion}, and \textsc{Induced-$\mathcal{F}$-Packing} for any fixed finite family $\mathcal{F}$
of connected graphs admit almost linear kernels on every nowhere dense class of graphs and linear
kernels on every class of graphs with bounded expansion. Our results extend the results for \textsc{Distance-$r$
Dominating Set} by Drange et al. (STACS 2016) and Eickmeyer et al. (ICALP 2017), and the result for
\textsc{Distance-$r$ Independent Set} by Pilipczuk and Siebertz (EJC 2021).

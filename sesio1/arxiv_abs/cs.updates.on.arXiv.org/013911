When patients develop acute respiratory failure, accurately identifying the underlying etiology
is essential for determining the best treatment, but it can be challenging to differentiate between
common diagnoses in clinical practice. Machine learning models could improve medical diagnosis
by augmenting clinical decision making and play a role in the diagnostic evaluation of patients
with acute respiratory failure. While machine learning models have been developed to identify
common findings on chest radiographs (e.g. pneumonia), augmenting these approaches by also analyzing
clinically relevant data from the electronic health record (EHR) could aid in the diagnosis of acute
respiratory failure. Machine learning models were trained to predict the cause of acute respiratory
failure (pneumonia, heart failure, and/or COPD) using chest radiographs and EHR data from patients
within an internal cohort using diagnoses based on physician chart review. Models were also tested
on patients in an external cohort using discharge diagnosis codes. A model combining chest radiographs
and EHR data outperformed models based on each modality alone for pneumonia and COPD. For pneumonia,
the combined model AUROC was 0.79 (0.78-0.79), image model AUROC was 0.73 (0.72-0.75), and EHR model
AUROC was 0.73 (0.70-0.76); for COPD, combined: 0.89 (0.83-0.91), image: 0.85 (0.77-0.89), and
EHR: 0.80 (0.76-0.84); for heart failure, combined: 0.80 (0.77-0.84), image: 0.77 (0.71-0.81),
and EHR: 0.80 (0.75-0.82). In the external cohort, performance was consistent for heart failure
and COPD, but declined slightly for pneumonia. Overall, machine learning models combing chest
radiographs and EHR data can accurately differentiate between common causes of acute respiratory
failure. Further work is needed to determine whether these models could aid clinicians in the diagnosis
of acute respiratory failure in clinical settings.

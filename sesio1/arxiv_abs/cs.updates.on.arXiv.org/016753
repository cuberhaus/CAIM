The jigsaw puzzle problem (JPP) is a well-known research problem, which has been studied for many
years. Solving this problem typically involves a two-stage scheme, consisting of the computation
of a pairwise piece compatibility measure (CM), coupled with a subsequent puzzle reconstruction
algorithm. Many effective CMs, which apply a simple distance measure, based merely on the information
along the piece edges, have been proposed. However, the practicality of these classical methods
is rather doubtful for problem instances harder than pure synthetic images. Specifically, these
methods tend to break down in more realistic scenarios involving, e.g., monochromatic puzzles,
eroded boundaries due to piece degradation over long time periods, missing pieces, etc. To overcome
this significant deficiency, a few deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based CMs have been
recently introduced. Despite their promising accuracy, these models are very computationally
intensive. Twin Embedding Networks (TEN), to represent a piece with respect to its boundary in a
latent embedding space. Combining this latent representation with a simple distance measure,
we then demonstrate a superior performance, in terms of accuracy, of our newly proposed pairwise
CM, compared to that of various classical methods, for the problem domain of eroded tile boundaries,
a testbed for a number of real-world JPP variants. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that TEN is faster
by a few orders of magnitude, on average, than the recent NN models, i.e., it is as fast as the classical
methods. In this regard, the paper makes a significant first attempt at bridging the gap between
the relatively low accuracy (of classical methods) and the intensive computational complexity
(of NN models), for practical, real-world puzzle-like problems.

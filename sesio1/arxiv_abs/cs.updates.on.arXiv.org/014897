Intersection is one of the most complex and accident-prone urban scenarios for autonomous driving
wherein making safe and computationally efficient decisions is non-trivial. Current research
mainly focuses on the simplified traffic conditions while ignoring the existence of mixed traffic
flows, i.e., vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians. For urban roads, different participants leads
to a quite dynamic and complex interaction, posing great difficulty to learn an intelligent policy.
This paper develops the dynamic permutation state representation in the framework of integrated
decision and control (IDC) to handle signalized intersections with mixed traffic flows. Specially,
this representation introduces an encoding function and summation operator to construct driving
states from environmental observation, capable of dealing with different types and variant number
of traffic participants. A constrained optimal control problem is built wherein the objective
involves tracking performance and the constraints for different participants and signal lights
are designed respectively to assure safety. We solve this problem by offline optimizing encoding
function, value function and policy function, wherein the reasonable state representation will
be given by the encoding function and then served as the input of policy and value function. An off-policy
training is designed to reuse observations from driving environment and backpropagation through
time is utilized to update the policy function and encoding function jointly. Verification result
shows that the dynamic permutation state representation can enhance the driving performance of
IDC, including comfort, decision compliance and safety with a large margin. The trained driving
policy can realize efficient and smooth passing in the complex intersection, guaranteeing driving
intelligence and safety simultaneously.

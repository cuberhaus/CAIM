In several papers published in Biological Cybernetics in the 1980s and 1990s, Kawato and colleagues
proposed computational models explaining how internal models are acquired in the cerebellum.
These models were later supported by neurophysiological experiments using monkeys and neuroimaging
experiments involving humans. These early studies influenced neuroscience from basic, sensory-motor
control to higher cognitive functions. One of the most perplexing enigmas related to internal models
is to understand the neural mechanisms that enable animals to learn large-dimensional problems
with so few trials. Consciousness and metacognition -- the ability to monitor one's own thoughts,
may be part of the solution to this enigma. Based on literature reviews of the past 20 years, here we
propose a computational neuroscience model of metacognition. The model comprises a modular hierarchical
reinforcement-learning architecture of parallel and layered, generative-inverse model pairs.
In the prefrontal cortex, a distributed executive network called the "cognitive reality monitoring
network" (CRMN) orchestrates conscious involvement of generative-inverse model pairs in perception
and action. Based on mismatches between computations by generative and inverse models, as well
as reward prediction errors, CRMN computes a "responsibility signal" that gates selection and
learning of pairs in perception, action, and reinforcement learning. A high responsibility signal
is given to the pairs that best capture the external world, that are competent in movements (small
mismatch), and that are capable of reinforcement learning (small reward prediction error). CRMN
selects pairs with higher responsibility signals as objects of metacognition, and consciousness
is determined by the entropy of responsibility signals across all pairs.

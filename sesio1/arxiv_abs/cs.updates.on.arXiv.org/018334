This paper presents a novel approach for autonomous cooperating UAVs in search and rescue operations
in subterranean domains with complex topology. The proposed system was ranked second in the Virtual
Track of the DARPA SubT Finals as part of the team CTU-CRAS-NORLAB. In contrast to the winning solution
that was developed specifically for the Virtual Track, the proposed solution also proved to be a
robust system for deployment onboard physical UAVs flying in the extremely harsh and confined environment
of the real-world competition. The proposed approach enables fully autonomous and decentralized
deployment of a UAV team with seamless simulation-to-world transfer, and proves its advantage
over less mobile UGV teams in the flyable space of diverse environments. The main contributions
of the paper are present in the mapping and navigation pipelines. The mapping approach employs novel
map representations -- SphereMap for efficient risk-aware long-distance planning, FacetMap
for surface coverage, and the compressed topological-volumetric LTVMap for allowing multi-robot
cooperation under low-bandwidth communication. These representations are used in navigation
together with novel methods for visibility-constrained informed search in a general 3D environment
with no assumptions about the environment structure, while balancing deep exploration with sensor-coverage
exploitation. The proposed solution also includes a visual-perception pipeline for on-board
detection and localization of objects of interest in four RGB stream at 5 Hz each without a dedicated
GPU. Apart from participation in the DARPA SubT, the performance of the UAV system is supported by
extensive experimental verification in diverse environments with both qualitative and quantitative
evaluation.

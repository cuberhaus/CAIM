In AI research, so far, the attention paid to the characterization and representation of function
and affordance has been sporadic and sparse, even though this aspect features prominently in an
intelligent system's functioning. In the sporadic and sparse, though commendable efforts so far
devoted to the characterization and understanding of function and affordance, there has also been
no general framework that could unify all the different use domains and situations related to the
representation and application of functional concepts. This paper develops just such a general
framework, with an approach that emphasizes the fact that the representations involved must be
explicitly cognitive and conceptual, and they must also contain causal characterizations of the
events and processes involved, as well as employ conceptual constructs that are grounded in the
referents to which they refer, in order to achieve maximal generality. The basic general framework
is described, along with a set of basic guiding principles with regards to the representation of
functionality. To properly and adequately characterize and represent functionality, a descriptive
representation language is needed. This language is defined and developed, and many examples of
its use are described. The general framework is developed based on an extension of the general language
meaning representational framework called conceptual dependency. To support the general characterization
and representation of functionality, the basic conceptual dependency framework is enhanced with
representational devices called structure anchor and conceptual dependency elaboration, together
with the definition of a set of ground level concepts. These novel representational constructs
are defined, developed, and described. A general framework dealing with functionality would represent
a major step toward achieving Artificial General Intelligence.

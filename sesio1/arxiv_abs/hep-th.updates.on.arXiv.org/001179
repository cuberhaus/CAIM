We consider the introduction of anisotropy in a class of bouncing models of cosmology. The presence
of anisotropy often spell doom on bouncing models, since the energy density due to the anisotropic
stress outweighs that of other matter components, as the universe contracts. Different suggestions
have also been made in the literature to resolve this pathology, classically. In order to gain more
insights about the effect of anisotropy, we introduce an analytically tractable family of bouncing
models, in which the shear density can be tuned to either allow or forbid classical bouncing scenarios.
Following that, we show that quantum cosmological considerations can drastically change the above
scenario. Firstly, we find that quantum effects enable a bounce, even when anisotropic stress is
large enough to forbid the same classically. On the flip side, however, quantum tunnelling of the
universe to singularity leads to instabilities, even when the anisotropic stress is small enough
for bounce to occur classically. We employ the solutions of appropriate minisuperspace Wheeler-deWitt
equation for homogeneous, but anisotropic cosmologies, with the boundary condition that the universe
is initially contracting. Intriguingly, the solution to the Wheeler-deWitt equation exhibit
an interesting phase transition-like behaviour, wherein, the probability to have a bouncing universe
is precisely unity before the shear density reaches a critical value and then starts to decrease
abruptly as the shear density increases further. We verified our findings using the tools of the
so-called Lorentzian quantum cosmology, along with the application of Picard-Lefschetz theory.
In particular, the semi-classical probability for bounce has been re-derived from the imaginary
component of the on-shell effective action, evaluated at the complex saddle points. Implications
and future directions have also been discussed.

In this PhD thesis we deal with several theoretical and phenomenological apsects of metric-affine
theories of gravity. Concretely, we first give a broad introduction to the necessary tools to understand
the framework and elaborate on some subtleties of the minimal coupling prescription between geometry
and matter in presence of torsion and nonmetricity. Then we dedicate the central part of the thesis
to study the structure of Ricci Based gravity (RBG) theories, which will be of later use to understand
generic properties of metric-affine theories. We begin by analysing the structure of the RBG field
equations and nontrivial aspects of their solution space. We then analyse the abrosption spectra
of some spherically symmetric solutions. Then, we show that, if the projective symmetry in these
theories is explicitly broken, then there arise ghost degrees of freedom, and we argue that this
will be a generic feature of metric-affine gravity theories. Having done this, we analyse metricafine
theories through the EFT lens, showing how the nonmetricity tkes a particular form in generic theories
where the symmetrised Ricci tensor appears in the action beyond the Einstein-Hilbert term. This
sources effective interactions that we use to place tight constraints to these theories. In the
third part of the thesis we present a miscelanea of works which are not so related to the structure
of RBG theories. We begin by studying a model for spontaneous breaking of Lorentz symmetry, namely
the bumblebee model, in the metric-affine approach. In the following chapter we generalise a conformal
invariant definition of proper time given by Perlick to the case with general nonmetricity. Finally,
we present arguments that show that the recently proposed D4EGB theory is not well defined in its
original form. We finish with a brief outlook.

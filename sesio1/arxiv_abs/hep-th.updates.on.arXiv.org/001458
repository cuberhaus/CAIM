We study the analytic structure of in-in correlation functions in a deSitter background. The aim
of this study is to probe the initial conditions for inflation through the features of correlation
functions of the field fluctuations, and understand precisely how an in-in correlator responds
to particles in the initial state. We emphasize that the choice of vacuua and the corresponding particle
interpretation for these fluctuations is flexible, and we clarify the role of this choice at the
level of calculations and their diagrammatic interpretation. We consider several possibilities
aside from the standard Bunch Davies vacuum prescription for the initial state, and trace the change
in pole structure as one begins adding excitations; starting from just a single particle, to highly
excited states and special cases such as a coherent state. We illustrate - with the example of coherent
states - the subtleties in concluding a Bunch Davies initial state from the absence of physical poles
in the bispectrum, which is interesting in light of some recent literature. Initial states with
a finite number of excitations are plagued with disconnected diagrams isolated in phase space,
and we highlight their implications on the observation of these signals, and how the situation changes
as one begins to excite more and more particles. We also comment about the implications of various
initial conditions on the squeezed limit of the bispectrum. These new pole structures are a direct
consequence of mixing of positive and negative frequency modes which is a characteristic of curved
spacetimes; in particular, we see in detail how particles in an initial state replicate mode mixing
structures. This study aims to clarify the missing details that link quantum and classical initial
conditions, and sharpen our understanding of in-in correlators in inflation.

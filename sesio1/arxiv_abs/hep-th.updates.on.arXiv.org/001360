Non-Commutative space-time introduces a fundamental length scale suggested by approaches to
quantum gravity. Here we report the analysis of the Casimir effect for parallel plates separated
by a distance of $L$ using a Lorentz invariant scalar theory in a non-commutative space-time (DFR
space-time), both at zero and finite temperatures. This is done in two ways; one when the additional
space-dimensions introduced in DFR space-time are treated as extra dimensions but on par with usual
space-dimension and in the second way, the additional dimensions are treated as compact dimensions.
Casimir force obtained in the first approach coincides with the result in the extra-dimensional
commutative space-time and this is varying as $\frac{1}{L^5}$. In the second approach, we derive
the corrections to the Casimir force, which is dependent on the separation between the plate, $L$
and on the size of the extra compactified dimension, $R$. Since correction terms are very small,
keeping only the most significant terms of these corrections, we show that for certain values of
the R, the corrections due to non-commutativity makes the force between the parallel plates more
attractive, and using this, we find lower bound on the value of $R$. We show here that the requirement
of the Casimir force and the energy to be real, impose the condition that the weight function used
in defining the DFR action has to be a constant. At zero temperature, we find correction terms due
to non-commutativity, depend on $L$ and $R$ dependent modified Bessel functions $K_{1}$ and $K_{2}$,
with coefficients that vary as $\frac{1}{LR^3}$ and $\frac{1}{L^2R^2}$, respectively . For finite
temperature, the Casimir force has correction terms that scale as $\frac{1}{L}$ and $\frac{1}{L^3}$
in high-temperature limit and as $\frac{1}{L^2}$ and $\frac{1}{L^4}$ in the low-temperature
limit.

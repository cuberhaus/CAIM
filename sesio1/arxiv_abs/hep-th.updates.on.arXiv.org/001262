We construct a class of 4D `yoga' (naturally relaxed) models for which the gravitational response
of heavy-particle vacuum energies is strongly suppressed. The models contain three ingredients:
(i) a relaxation mechanism, (ii) a very supersymmetric gravity sector coupled to matter for which
supersymmetry is non-linearly realised, and (iii) an accidental approximate scale invariance
expressed through the presence of a low-energy dilaton supermultiplet. All three are common in
higher-dimensional and string constructions and although none suffices on its own, taken together
they can dramatically suppress the net vacuum-energy density. The dilaton's {\it vev}~$\tau$
determines the weak scale $M_W \sim M_p/\sqrt\tau$. We compute the potential for $\tau$ and find
it can be stabilized in a local de Sitter minimum at sufficiently large field values to explain the
electroweak hierarchy, doing so using input parameters no larger than $O(60)$ because the relevant
potential arises as a rational function of $\ln\tau$. The de Sitter vacuum energy at the minimum
is order $c\, M_W^8 \propto 1/\tau^4$, with $c \ll O(M_W^{-4})$. We discuss how to achieve $c \sim
1/M_p^4$ as required by observations. Scale invariance implies the dilaton couples to matter like
a Brans-Dicke scalar with dangerously large coupling yet because it comes paired with an axion it
can evade bounds through the novel screening mechanism described in {\tt ArXiV:2110.10352}. Cosmological
axio-dilaton evolution predicts a natural quintessence model for Dark Energy, whose evolution
can realize recent proposals to resolve the Hubble tension, and whose axion contributes to Dark
Matter. We summarize inflationary implications and some remaining challenges, including the
unusual supersymmetry breaking regime used and the potential for UV completions of our approach.

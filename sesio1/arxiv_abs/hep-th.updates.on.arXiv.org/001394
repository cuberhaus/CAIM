By viewing a (generalized) finite symmetry as a topological order ${M}$ in one higher dimension
( i.e. as a categorical symmetry), we find that the patterns of spontaneous categorical symmetry
breaking are classified by condensable (higher) algebras $\mathcal{A}$ formed by excitations
in ${M}$. The local low energy properties of a state with spontaneous categorical symmetry breaking
pattern $\mathcal{A}$ are exactly reproduced by a 1-condensed boundary state} of ${M}_{/\mathcal{A}}$,
where ${M}_{/\mathcal{A}}$ (called unbroken categorical symmetry) is the topological order
obtained from ${M}$ by condensing $\mathcal{A}$. The properties (such as scaling dimensions)
of gapless state can be calculated from the unbroken categorical symmetry ${M}_{/\mathcal{A}}$
via an algebraic number theoretical method. For example, a state with symmetry breaking pattern
$\mathcal{A}$ can be gapped if ${M}_{/\mathcal{A}}$ is trivial, and must be gapless if ${M}_{/\mathcal{A}}$
is non-trivial. This is a general way to understand the emergence and the symmetry protection of
gaplessness, that applies to generalized symmetries, such as algebraic higher symmetries. The
relations between the condensable algebras also help us to determine the structure of the global
phase diagram. Using such a theory, we show that for 1+1D $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2'$ symmetry
with the mixed anomaly, there is a stable continuous transition between the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-breaking-$\mathbb{Z}_2'$-symmetric
phase and the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric-$\mathbb{Z}_2'$-breaking phase. The critical point
is the same as the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry breaking critical point. The gapped and gapless states
for 1+1D bosonic systems with anomalous $S_3$ symmetries are also obtained. For example, anomalous
$S_3^{(2)}$ symmetry can have a stable chiral gapless phase described $E(8)_1 \times \overline{SO}(9)_2$
CFT.

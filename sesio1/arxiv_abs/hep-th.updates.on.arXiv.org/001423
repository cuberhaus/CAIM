We perform the shadow calculation of the loop quantum gravity motivated regular black hole recently
proposed by Ashtekar, Olmedo and Singh (will be termed AOS black hole hereafter). In the process,
we also construct the rotating loop quantum gravity inspired solution of the originally proposed
static spherically symmetric AOS black hole by applying the modified Newman-Janis algorithm.
We study the quantum effects on the shadows of both the non-rotating and rotating loop quantum black
hole solutions. It is observed that the general shape of the shadow for non-rotating AOS black hole
is circular in shape as is expected for its classical counter part too, but the presence of loop quantum
gravity inspired modification contracts the shadow radius and the effect reduces with the increase
in the mass of the black hole. On a similar note, in the rotating situation, we find contraction in
shadow radius due to quantum effects and the tapered nature of the shadow as expected from the classical
Kerr case. However, instead of the symmetrical contraction, like non-rotating one, we found more
contraction on one side relative to the other when we compare our result with the shadow of the Kerr
black hole. We finally studied super-radiance in rotating AOS background and observed that the
super-radiance condition for massless scalar field is identical to that of the Kerr case with the
rotation of the BH being more compared to Kerr in the low mass regime. With an increase in mass of the
rotating AOS black hole, the difference from Kerr starts to become insignificant. We also perform
the calculation of the super-radiance amplification factor using Teukolsky formalism in the AOS
background and present a comparative study of the amplification factors of the AOS and Kerr black
holes with respect to changing mass and spin of the holes.

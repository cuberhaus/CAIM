By treating the order parameter as a stochastic thermal fluctuating variable for small-large black
hole phase transition, we investigate the kinetic process of phase transition for the Kerr-AdS
(anti-de Sitter) black holes on free energy landscape. We find that the extremal points of the off
shell Gibbs free energy correspond to physical black holes. For small-large black hole phase transition,
the off shell Gibbs free energy exhibits a double well behavior with the same depth. Contrary to previous
research for the kinetics of phase transition for the Kerr-Newman-AdS family black holes on a free
energy landscape, we find that there is a lower bound for the order parameter and the lower bound corresponds
to extremal black holes. In particular, the off shell Gibbs free energy is zero instead of divergent
as previous work suggested for vanishing black hole horizon radius, which corresponds to the Gibbs
free energy of a thermal AdS space. The investigation for the evolution of the probability distribution
for the phase transition indicates that the initial stable small (large) black hole tends to switch
to stable large (small) black hole. Increasing the temperature along the coexistence curve, the
switching process becomes faster and the probability distribution reaches the final stationary
Boltzmann distribution at a shorter time. The distribution of the first passage time indicates
the time scale of the small-large black hole phase transition, and the peak of the distribution becomes
sharper and shifts to the left with the increase of temperature along the coexistence curve. This
suggests that a considerable first passage process occurs at a shorter time for higher temperature.
The investigation of the kinetics of phase transition might provide us new insight into the underlying
microscopic interactions.

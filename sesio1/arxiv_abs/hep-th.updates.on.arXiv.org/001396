The $T \overline{T}$ operator provides a universal irrelevant deformation of two-dimensional
quantum field theories with remarkable properties, including connections to both string theory
and holography beyond $\mathrm{AdS}$ spacetimes. In particular, it appears that a $T \overline{T}$-deformed
theory is a kind of new structure, which is neither a local quantum field theory nor a full-fledged
string theory, but which is nonetheless under some analytic control. On the other hand, supersymmetry
is a beautiful extension of Poincar\'e symmetry which relates bosonic and fermionic degrees of
freedom. It is natural to ask what one can learn about irrelevant deformations in supersymmetric
quantum field theories. In this thesis, we describe a presentation of the $T \overline{T}$ deformation
in manifestly supersymmetric settings. We define a "supercurrent-squared" operator, which is
closely related to $T \overline{T}$, in any two-dimensional theory with $(0, 1)$, $(1, 1)$, or $(2,
2)$ supersymmetry. This deformation generates a flow equation for the superspace Lagrangian of
the theory, which therefore makes the supersymmetry manifest. In certain examples, the deformed
theories produced by supercurrent-squared are related to superstring and brane actions, and some
of these theories possess extra non-linearly realized supersymmetries. We then show that $T \overline{T}$
defines a new theory of both abelian and non-abelian gauge fields coupled to charged matter, which
includes models compatible with maximal supersymmetry. Most of this thesis is adapted from previous
publications. However, the final chapter presents new results on $T \overline{T}$-like deformations
of general gauge theories in an arbitrary number of spacetime dimensions; this analysis has not
appeared in past work.

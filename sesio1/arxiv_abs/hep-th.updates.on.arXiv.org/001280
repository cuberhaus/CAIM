We propose a model of Majorana fermions with quartic self-couplings. These Majorana fermions acquire
masses via type II seesaw mechanism in which the physical eigenstates are identified as a light Majorana
particle and another heavy Majorana particle. On a physical basis, the quartic self-couplings
involve axial currents of these Majorana particles, and also the interaction of the axial current
for the light particle with the heavy particle one. We introduce two auxiliaries gauge fields in
this model, and we study the stability conditions of the correspondent effective potential of the
model. The ground state of the effective potential introduces two 4-vectors as scales of vacuum
expected values, and consequently, the Lorentz symmetry is broken dynamically in the model. We
use the expansion of the effective action to calculate the effective Lagrangian up to second order
in the auxiliary fields as fluctuations around the ground state. This mechanism generates dynamics
for the auxiliary gauge fields, mixed mass terms, longitudinal propagation, and Chern-Simons
term through radiative corrections. After the diagonalization, the two gauge fields gain masses
through an analogous type II seesaw mechanism in which a gauge boson has a light mass, and the other
one acquires a heavy mass. In this scenario of Lorentz symmetry breaking, we obtain the correspondent
dispersion relations for the Majorana fermions and the gauge boson fields. Posteriorly, we analyze
the neutrino's oscillations in the presence of a DLSB parameter. We calculate the transition probability
of $\nu_{e} \rightarrow \nu_{\mu}$ and the oscillation length in the strong coupling regime and
discuss the parameter space of this transition and show that the DLSB can conciliate the LSND and
super-Kamiokande results.

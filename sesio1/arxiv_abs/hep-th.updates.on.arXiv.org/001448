Fractonic phases are new phases of matter that host excitations with restricted mobility. We show
that a certain class of gapless fractonic phases are realized as a result of spontaneous breaking
of continuous higher-form symmetries whose conserved charges do not commute with spatial translations.
We refer to such symmetries as nonuniform higher-form symmetries. These symmetries fall within
the standard definition of higher-form symmetries in quantum field theory, and the corresponding
symmetry generators are topological. Worldlines of particles are regarded as the charged objects
of 1-form symmetries, and mobility restrictions can be implemented by introducing additional
1-form symmetries whose generators do not commute with spatial translations. These features are
realized by effective field theories associated with spontaneously broken nonuniform 1-form
symmetries. At low energies, the theories reduce to known higher-rank gauge theories such as scalar/vector
charge gauge theories, and the gapless excitations in these theories are interpreted as Nambu--Goldstone
modes for higher-form symmetries. Due to the nonuniformity of the symmetry, some of the modes acquire
a gap, which is the higher-form analogue of the inverse Higgs mechanism of spacetime symmetries.
The gauge theories have emergent nonuniform magnetic symmetries, and some of the magnetic monopoles
become fractonic. We identify the 't~Hooft anomalies of the nonuniform higher-form symmetries
and the corresponding bulk symmetry-protected topological phases. By this method, the mobility
restrictions are fully determined by the choice of the commutation relations of charges with translations.
This approach allows us to view existing (gapless) fracton models such as the scalar/vector charge
gauge theories and their variants from a unified perspective and enables us to engineer theories
with desired mobility restrictions.

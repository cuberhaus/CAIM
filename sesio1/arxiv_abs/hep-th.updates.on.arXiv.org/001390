Detecting gravitational waves from coalescing compact binaries allows us to explore the dynamical,
nonlinear regime of general relativity and constrain modifications to it. Some of the gravitational-wave
events observed by the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration have sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio
in the merger, allowing us to probe the relaxation of the remnant black hole to its final, stationary
state - the so-called black-hole ringdown, which is characterized by a set of quasinormal modes.
Can we use the ringdown to constrain deviations from general relativity, as predicted by several
of its contenders? Here, we address this question by using an inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform
model in the effective-one-body formalism, augmented with a parametrization of the ringdown based
on an expansion in the final black hole's spin. We give a prescription on how to include in this waveform
model, the quasinormal mode frequencies calculated on a theory-by-theory basis. In particular,
we focus on theories that modify general relativity by higher-order curvature corrections, namely,
Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet (EdGB), dynamical Chern-Simons (dCS) theories, and cubic- and
quartic-order effective-field-theories (EFT) of general relativity. We use this parametrized
waveform model to measure the ringdown properties of the two loudests ringdown signals observed
so far, GW150914 and GW200129. We find that while EdGB theory cannot be constrained with these events,
we can place upper bounds on the fundamental length-scale of cubic- ($\ell_{\rm cEFT} \leqslant
38.2$ km) and quartic-order ($\ell_{\rm qEFT} \leqslant 51.3$ km) EFTs of general relativity,
and of dCS gravity ($\ell_{\rm dCS} \leqslant 38.7$ km). The latter result is a concrete example
of a theory presently unconstrained by inspiral-only analyses which, however, can be constrained
by merger-ringdown studies with current gravitational-wave data.

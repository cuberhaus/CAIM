It is well-known that quantum field theory (QFT) induces a huge value of the cosmological constant,
$\Lambda$, which is outrageously inconsistent with cosmological observations. We review here
some aspects of this fundamental theoretical conundrum (`the cosmological constant problem')
and strongly argue in favor of the possibility that the cosmic vacuum density $\rho_{\rm vac}$ may
be mildly evolving with the expansion rate $H$. Such a `running vacuum model' (RVM) proposal predicts
an effective dynamical dark energy without postulating new ad hoc fields (quintessence and the
like). Using the method of adiabatic renormalization within QFT in curved spacetime we find that
$\rho_{\rm vac}(H)$ acquires a dynamical component ${\cal O}(H^2)$ caused by the quantum matter
effects. There are also ${\cal O}(H^n)$ ($n=4,6,..$) contributions, some of which may trigger
inflation in the early universe. Remarkably, the evolution of the adiabatically renormalized
$\rho_{\rm vac}(H)$ is not affected by dangerous terms proportional to the quartic power of the
masses ($\sim m^4$) of the fields. Traditionally, these terms have been the main source of trouble
as they are responsible for the extreme fine tuning feature of the cosmological constant problem.
In the context under study, however, the late time $\rho_{\rm vac}(H)$ around $H_0$ is given by a
dominant term ($\rho_{\rm vac}^0$) plus the aforementioned mild dynamical component $\propto
\nu (H^2-H_0^2)$ (with $|\nu|\ll1$), which makes the RVM to mimic quintessence. Finally, on the
phenomenological side we show that the RVM may be instrumental in alleviating some of the most challenging
problems (so-called `tensions') afflicting nowadays the observational consistency of the `concordance'
$\Lambda$CDM model, such as the $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ tensions.

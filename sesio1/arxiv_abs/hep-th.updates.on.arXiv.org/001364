Symmetry fractionalization (SF) on topological excitations is one of the most remarkable quantum
phenomena in topological orders with symmetry, i.e., symmetry-enriched topological phases.
While much progress has been theoretically and experimentally made in 2D, the understanding on
SF in 3D is far from complete. A long-standing challenge is to understand SF on looplike topological
excitations which are spatially extended objects. In this work, we construct a powerful topological-field-theoretical
framework approach for 3D topological orders, which leads to a systematic characterization and
classification of SF. For systems with Abelian gauge groups ($G_g$) and Abelian symmetry groups
($G_s$), we successfully establish equivalence classes that lead to a finite number of patterns
of SF, although there are notoriously infinite number of Lagrangian-descriptions of the system.
We compute topologically distinct types of fractional symmetry charges carried by particles.
Then, for each type, we compute topologically distinct statistical phases of braiding processes
among loop excitations and external symmetry fluxes. As a result, we are able to unambiguously list
all physical observables for each pattern of SF. We present detailed calculations on many concrete
examples. As an example, we find that the SF in an untwisted $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2$
topological order with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry is classified by $ (\mathbb{Z}_2)^6\oplus (\mathbb{Z}_2)^2\oplus
(\mathbb{Z}_2)^2\oplus (\mathbb{Z}_2)^2$. If the topological order is twisted, the classification
reduces to $(\mathbb{Z}_2)^6$ in which particle excitations always carry integer charge. Pure
algebraic formalism of the classification is given by: $ \bigoplus_{\nu_i} \mathcal H^4 ( G_g\leftthreetimes_{\nu_i}G_s,
U (1)) /\Gamma_\omega ({\nu_i}) \,$. Several future directions are proposed.

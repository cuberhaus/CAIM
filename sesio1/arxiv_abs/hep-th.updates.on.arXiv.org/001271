In this paper we identify a new family of black holes and solitons that lead to the exact integration
of scalar probes, even in the presence of a non-minimal coupling with the Ricci scalar which has a
non-trivial profile. The backgrounds are planar and spherical black holes as well as solitons of
$SU\left( 2\right) \times SU\left( 2\right) $ $\mathcal{N}=4$ gauged supergravity in four dimensions.
On these geometries, we compute the spectrum of (quasi-)normal modes for the non-minimally coupled
scalar field. We find that the equation for the radial dependence can be integrated in terms of hypergeometric
functions leading to an exact expression for the frequencies. The solutions do not asymptote to
a constant curvature spacetime, nevertheless the asymptotic region acquires an extra conformal
Killing vector. For the black hole, the scalar probe is purely ingoing at the horizon, and requiring
that the solutions lead to an extremum of the action principle we impose a Dirichlet boundary condition
at infinity. Surprisingly, the quasinormal modes do not depend on the radius of the black hole, therefore
this family of geometries can be interpreted as isospectral in what regards to the wave operator
non-minimally coupled to the Ricci scalar. We find both purely damped modes, as well as exponentially
growing unstable modes depending on the values of the non-minimal coupling parameter. For the solitons
we show that the same integrability property is achieved separately in a non-supersymmetric solutions
as well as for the supersymmetric one. Imposing regularity at the origin and a well defined extremum
for the action principle we obtain the spectra that can also lead to purely oscillatory modes as well
as to unstable scalar probes, depending on the values of the non-minimal coupling.

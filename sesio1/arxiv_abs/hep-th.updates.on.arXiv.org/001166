We study a class of 4-dimensional $SU(N)$ chiral gauge theories with fermions in the 2-index symmetric
and antisymmetric representations and classify their infrared phases. The choice $N=4\mathbb{Z}$
corresponds to gauging the fermion number and makes the theory purely bosonic. We examine the most
general background fields of the centers of the gauge, non-abelian flavor, and $U(1)$-axial groups
that can be consistently activated, thereby determine the faithful global continuous and discrete
symmetries of the theory. This allows us to identify new mixed 0-form/1-form `t Hooft anomalies
on both spin and nonspin manifolds. If the theory confines, the absence of composite fermions implies
that continuous symmetries must be broken down to anomaly-free subgroups. Anomalies associated
with discrete symmetries can be saturated either by breaking the symmetry or by a symmetry-preserving
topological quantum field theory. The latter, however, is obstructed on spin manifold. The interplay
between these features greatly restricts the possible infrared scenarios. Generally, we find
that the vacuum condensates that match the full set of anomalies have large scaling dimensions.
It is unlikely that such condensates form, suggesting that the corresponding theories flow to a
conformal fixed point. We present two explicit examples that demonstrate our approach. In the first
example, we argue that if the theory confines, we can uniquely determine the vacuum condensate and
the chiral symmetry breaking pattern. In the second example, which exhibits the general behavior
of most theories, we show that the lowest dimensional vacuum operator consistent with anomaly matching
has a very large scaling dimension and the theory flows to a conformal phase. The existence of a perturbative
fixed point further supports our results.

We delineate the quark-hadron continuity by constructing QCD equations of state for neutron star
dynamics, covering the wide range of charge chemical potential ($\mu_Q$) and temperatures ($T$).
Based on the nuclear-2SC continuity scenario, we match equations of state for nuclear and two-flavor
color-superconducting (2SC) quark matter, where the matching baryon density is $n_B\simeq 1.5n_0$
($n_0\simeq 0.16\, {\rm fm^{-3}}$: nuclear saturation density). The effective vector and diquark
couplings in a quark matter model evolve as functions of $n_B, \mu_Q, T$, whose low density values
are constrained by the nuclear matter properties and neutron star radii, with the high density behavior
by the two-solar mass ($2M_\odot$) constraint. With couplings dependent on $n_B$, we examined
how smooth the nuclear-2SC continuity can be, and found problems in matching nuclear and 2SC entropies
at low temperatures. To proceed with the continuity scenario, we enforce smooth matching by making
the couplings ($n_B, \mu_Q, T$)-dependent. In effect, this adds phenomenological contributions
which we call "X". After the phenomenological matching, we take the rest as our predictions. The
2SC and color-flavor-locked (CFL) phases computed with these evolving couplings are called 2SCX
and CFLX. The CFLX appears around $n_B\simeq 2$-$4n_0$ and, in contrast to the conventional CFL,
has non-negligible dependence on $(\mu_Q,T)$. To examine the astrophysical consequences of our
modeling, we add charged leptons and neutrinos, and study the composition of matter for lepton fractions
relevant for protoneutron stars and neutron star mergers. The abundance of neutrinos and thermal
effects reduce the strangeness fraction and stiffen equations of state. For a neutrino trapped
neutron star at $T\simeq 30 $ MeV with a lepton fraction $Y_L\simeq 0.05$, the mass is larger than
its cold static counterpart by $\sim 0.1M_\odot$.

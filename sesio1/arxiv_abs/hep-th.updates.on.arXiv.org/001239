Among the many disparate approaches towards quantum gravity, the reduction of spacetime dimension
in the ultraviolet regime is expected to be a common thread. The dimensionality of spacetime can
be defined in various contexts. The spectral dimension of spacetime is defined in the context of
diffusion processes on a manifold. We show that a spacetime with zero-point length has spectral
dimension $3.5$ when the characteristic diffusion time has the size of the zero-point length. The
spectral dimension (negatively) diverges for an even shorter diffusion time, thus preventing
any reliable physical interpretation in the deep ultraviolet regime. The thermodynamic dimension
is defined by realizing that the free energy $F(\beta)$ of a free field or ideal gas at finite temperature
($\beta^{-1}$) in $D$ dimensions scales as $F\sim \beta^{-D}$. Using Schwinger's proper time
formalism at finite temperature, we show that for spacetime incorporating a zero-point length,
the thermodynamic dimension reduces to $1.5$ near the Planck scale and then to $1$ in the deep ultraviolet
regime. This signifies a "phase-transition" in which a (massless) bosonic ideal gas in four dimensions
essentially behaves like radiation ($w=1/3$) at low energies, whereas near the Planck scale, it
behaves equivalently to having an equation of state parameter $w=2$. Furthermore, dimension can
be deduced from the potential $V_D(r)$ of interaction between two point-like sources separated
at a distance $r$ as its scaling depends on $D$. Comparing with the scaling behavior of conventional
Yukawa-like potentials at short distances, we show that the zero-point length spacetime's ultraviolet
dimension appears to be either $2$ or $3$ depending on the use of massive or massless force carriers
as probes.

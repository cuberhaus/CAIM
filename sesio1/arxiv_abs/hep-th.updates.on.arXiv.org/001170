The theme of this thesis is the study of field theories generically without Lorentz symmetry, but
possessing an inhomogeneous scaling symmetry. A number of aspects of such models are explored,
including the addition of supersymmetry, and their application in the construction of more conventional
conformal field theories. In Part I, we describe a scaling technique by which non-Lorentzian theories
with an inhomogeneous scaling symmetry are obtained from Lorentzian supersymmetric models, while
retaining all supersymmetry of the parent theory. The dynamics of the resulting theories are generically
constrained to the moduli space of some BPS soliton. We explore this scaling technique and the resulting
reduction to superconformal quantum mechanics for some examples, including several relevant
to the branes of M-theory. In Part II, we build from the ground up the theory of models in five dimensions
with an exotic $SU(1,3)$ spacetime symmetry, including an inhomogeneous scaling. We derive and
solve the corresponding Ward-Takahashi identities for correlators, and demonstrate how such
models naturally describe any six-dimensional conformal field theory on a conformal compactification
of Minkowski space. We derive necessary conditions for a generic $SU(1,3)$ theory to admit such
a six-dimensional interpretation, and also explore a degenerate limit of the construction that
recovers the standard DLCQ picture. Finally, we study in detail an explicit $SU(1,3)$ model, conjectured
to provide a Lagrangian description of the non-Abelian $(2,0)$ theory. The theory is shown to realise
six-dimensional physics through the inclusion of singular points carrying non-zero instanton
charge, which are encoded by instanton operators in the path integral. We explore the constrained
dynamics of the theory, which are shown to describe the propagation of Yang-Mills instanton-particles
between such points.

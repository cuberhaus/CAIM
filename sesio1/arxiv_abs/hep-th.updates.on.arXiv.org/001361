We investigate how the resolution of the singularity problem for the Schwarzschild BH could be related
to the presence of quantum gravity effects at horizon scales. Motivated by the analogy with the cosmological
Schwarzschild-dS solution, we construct a class of non-singular, static, asymptotically-flat
BH solutions with a dS core, sourced by an anisotropic fluid, which encodes the quantum corrections.
The latter are parametrized by a single length-scale $\ell$, which has a dual interpretation as
an effective "quantum hair" and as the length-scale resolving the classical singularity. Depending
on the value of $\ell$, these solutions can have two horizons, be extremal (when the two horizons
merge) or be horizonless exotic stars. We also investigate the thermodynamic behavior of our BH
solutions and propose a generalization of the area law in order to account for their entropy. We find
a second-order phase transition near extremality, when $\ell$ is of order of the classical Schwarzschild
radius $R_{\rm S}$. BHs with $\ell\sim R_{\rm S}$ are thermodynamically preferred with respect
to those with $\ell\ll R_{\rm S}$, supporting the relevance of quantum corrections at horizon scales.
We also find that the extremal configuration is a zero-temperature, zero-entropy state with its
near-horizon geometry factorizing as AdS$_2\times$ S$^2$, signalizing the possible relevance
of these models for the information paradox. We show that the presence of quantum corrections with
$\ell\sim R_{\rm S}$ have observable phenomenological signatures in the photon orbits and in the
QNMs spectrum. In particular, in the near-extremal regime, the imaginary part of the spectrum scales
with the temperature as $c_1/\ell+c_2\ell T_\text{H}^2$, while it goes to zero linearly in the
near-horizon limit. Our general findings are confirmed by revisiting two already-known models,
namely the Hayward and gaussian-core BHs.

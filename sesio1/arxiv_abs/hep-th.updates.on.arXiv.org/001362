The role of symmetries in what concerns entanglement entropy has been extensively explored in the
last years and revealed a profound connection with the quantum field theory's algebraic structure.
Recently, it was found that some universal contributions to the entanglement entropy and mutual
information may be non uniquely defined in theories with generalized symmetries. Here, we study
this issue in detail in the particular case of the entanglement entropy of the Maxwell theory in $(2+1)$
dimensions for rotationally symmetric regions. In this setup, the problem can be dimensionally
reduced to a half-line. We find that the only difference between the reduced problem for the Maxwell
field and the reduced scalar free field stems from the Fourier angular $n=0$ mode. This simplification
allows us to check explicitly the many issues that characterize models with broken global symmetries.
Namely, we manifestly show that the additive algebras break Haag duality, and single out the non-local
operators which are responsible for the failure of this property. More interestingly, we present
concrete lattice realizations that confirm that the logarithmic "universal" term of the Maxwell
entanglement entropy for disks depends on the details of the algebra assignation. This ambiguity
hinders the identification of possible topological contributions characteristic of models with
generalized symmetries and tarnishes its universal character. We further calculate the Maxwell
mutual information for two nearly complementary concentric disks. We obtain the expected universal
contribution with a log-log dependence and check that, unlike entropy, this is stable. Accordingly,
this supports mutual information as the appropriate probe to sense additivity-duality breaking
and the consequent universal topological contributions.

We consider two established supergravities which are known to provide the low-energy effective
description of either superstring theory or M-theory: the six-dimensional theory of Romans, and
the maximal supergravity in seven dimensions. We compactify on an $S^{1}$ and $T^{2}$, respectively,
to obtain 5D sigma-models coupled to gravity, and spectra of bosonic excitations are computed numerically
by fluctuating fields on backgrounds which holographically realise confinement. We propose a
method to detect mixing effects between scalar resonances and the pseudo-Nambu--Goldstone boson
associated with spontaneous breaking of conformal invariance: the dilaton. This test consists
of neglecting a key component of the spin-0 fluctuation variables, effectively disregarding their
back-reaction on the underlying geometry; where discrepancies arise compared to the proper calculation
we infer dilaton mixing. In both cases this analysis evinces a parametrically light dilaton. For
each theory we also uncover a tachyonic instability within their parameter space. We hence proceed
to investigate their respective phase structures, reasoning that some mechanism must render the
instabilities physically inaccessible. We compile a catalogue of geometrically distinct backgrounds
within each theory, and derive general expressions for their holographically renormalised free
energy $F$. Another numerical routine is used to systematically extract data for some special deformation
parameters, and $F$ is plotted in units of an appropriate universal scale. Our analysis proves fruitful:
each theory shows evidence of a first-order phase transition which induces the spontaneous decompactification
of the shrinking dimension before the instability manifests, favouring instead a branch of singular
solutions. The light dilaton resonance appears only along a metastable portion of the branch of
confining backgrounds.

Horava gravity has been proposed as a renormalizable quantum gravity without the ghost problem
through anisotropic scaling dimensions which break Lorentz symmetry in UV. In the Hamiltonian
formalism, due to the Lorentz-violating terms, the constraint structure looks quite different
from that of general relativity (GR) but we have recently found that "there exists the case where
we can recover the same number of degrees of freedom as in GR", in a rather general set-up. In this paper,
we study its Lagrangian perspectives and examine the full diffeomorphism (Diff) symmetry and its
associated conservation laws in Horava gravity. Surprisingly, we find that the full Diff symmetry
in the action can also be recovered when a certain condition, called "super-condition", which super-selects
the Lorentz-symmetric sector in Horava gravity, is satisfied. This indicates that the broken Lorentz
symmetry, known as "foliation-preserving" Diff, is just an "apparent" symmetry of the Horava gravity
action and rather its "full action symmetry can be as large as the Diff in GR ". The super-condition
exactly corresponds to the tertiary constraint in Hamiltonian formalism which is the second-class
constraint and provides a non-trivial realization of the Lorentz symmetry otherwise being absent
apparently. From the recovered Lorentz symmetry in the action, we obtain the conservation laws
with the Noether currents as in covariant theories. The general formula for the conserved Noether
charges reproduces the mass of four-dimensional static black holes with an "arbitrary" cosmological
constant in Horava gravity, and is independent of ambiguities associated with the choice of asymptotic
boundaries. We also discuss several challenging problems, including its implications to Hamiltonian
formalism, black hole thermodynamics, radiations from colliding black holes.

We study neutrino oscillations in a rotating spacetime under the weak gravity limit for the neutrino
trajectories constrained in the equatorial plane. Using the asymptotic form of the Kerr metric,
we show that the gravitational source's rotation non-trivially modifies the neutrino phase. Further,
we find that the flavor transition probability deviates more prominently from the Schwarzschild
spacetime results when neutrinos are produced and detected on the same side of the gravitational
source, i.e., neutrino propagates only towards or away from the gravitational source. For the neutrino
weak gravity lensing in the equatorial plane, we find that the effects of gravitational object spin
on the neutrino phase are subdominant compared with the Schwarzschild spacetime neutrino phase.
However, the rotational effect can be comparable with the gravitational mass effect in the neutrino
lensing if the naked singularity condition that bounds the Kerr rotation is violated. Furthermore,
we find that the neutrino phase for the non-radial neutrino emission depends on the relative angular
momentum direction of the neutrino and the gravitational source. For an asymptotic observer, we
find that the neutrino phase, in the leading orders of gravitational spin corrections, differs
from the Schwarzschild spacetime due to the difference in the proper spatial distance of the neutrino
trajectory that connects the neutrino source and the detector. In contrast, the higher-order terms,
other than those arriving from the proper spatial distance, which lead to the deviation from the
Schwarzschild spacetime neutrino phase, are significantly suppressed. Further, we discuss neutrino
gravitational decoherence. We find that decoherence length is also sensitive to the relative direction
of the neutrino angular momentum and the gravitational source rotation. Finally, we demonstrate
results using numerical examples.

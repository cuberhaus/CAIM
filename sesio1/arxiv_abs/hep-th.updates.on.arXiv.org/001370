Not only are Casimir interaction entropies not guaranteed to be positive, but also, more strikingly,
Casimir self-entropies of bodies can be negative. Here, we attempt to interpret the physical origin
and meaning of these negative self-entropies by investigating the Casimir self-entropy of a neutral
spherical nanoparticle. After extracting the polarizabilities of such a particle by examining
the asymptotic behavior of the scattering Green's function, we compute the corresponding free
energy and entropy. Two models for the nanoparticle, namely a spherical plasma $\delta$-function
shell and a homogeneous dielectric/diamagnetic ball, are considered at low temperature, because
that is all that can be revealed from a nanoparticle perspective. The second model includes a contribution
to the entropy from the bulk free energy, referring to the situation where the medium inside or outside
the ball fills all space, which must be subtracted on physical grounds in order to maintain consistency
with van der Waals interactions, corresponding to the self-entropy of each bulk. (The van der Waals
calculation is described in Appendix A.) The entropies so calculated agree with known results in
the low-temperature limit, appropriate for a small particle, and are negative. But we suggest that
the negative self-entropy is simply an interaction entropy, the difference between the total entropy
and the blackbody entropy of the two bulks, outside or inside of the nanosphere. The vacuum entropy
is always positive and overwhelms the interaction entropy. Thus the interaction entropy can be
negative, without contradicting the principles of statistical thermodynamics. Because the entropy
of blackbody radiation by itself plays an important role, it is also discussed, including dispersive
effects, in detail.

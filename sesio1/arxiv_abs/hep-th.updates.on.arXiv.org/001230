After a brief outline of general aspects of conformal field theories in coordinate space, in a first
part we review the solution of the conformal constraints of three- and four-point functions in momentum
space in dimensions $d\geq 2$, in the form of conformal Ward identities (CWI's). We center our discussion
on the analysis of correlators containing stress-energy tensors $(T)$, conserved currents $(J)$,
and scalar operators $(O)$. For scalar four-point functions, we briefly discuss our method for
determining the dual conformal solutions of such equations, identified only by the CWI's, and related
to the conformal Yangian symmetry, introduced by us in previous work. In correlation functions
with $T$ tensors, evaluated around a flat spacetime, the conformal anomaly is characterized by
the (non-local) exchange of massless poles in specific form factors, a signature that has been investigated
both in free field theory and non-perturbatively, by solving the conformal constraints. We discuss
the anomaly effective action, and illustrate the derivation of the CWI's directly from its path
integral definition and its Weyl symmetry, which is alternative to the standard operatorial approach
used in conformal field theories in flat space. For two- and three-point functions, we elaborate
on the matching of these types of correlators to free-field theories. Perturbative realizations
of CFTs at one-loop provide the simplest expressions of the general solutions identified by the
CWI's, for generic operators $T$, $J$, and scalars of specific scaling dimensions, by an appropriate
choice of their field content. In a technical appendix we offer details on the reconstruction of
the $TTO$ and $TTT$ correlators in the approach of Bzowski, McFadden and Skenderis, and specifically
on the secondary Ward identities of the method, in order to establish a complete match with the perturbative
description.

Null Wilson loops in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills are dual to planar scattering amplitudes.
This duality implies hidden symmetries for both objects. We consider closely related infrared
finite observables, defined as the Wilson loop with a Lagrangian insertion, normalized by the Wilson
loop itself. Unlike ratio and remainder functions studied in the literature, this observable is
non-trivial already for four scattered particles and bears close resemblance to (finite parts
of) scattering processes in non-supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. We study the general structure
of the Wilson loop with a Lagrangian insertion, focusing in particular on its leading singularities
and their (hidden) symmetry properties. We find evidence that the leading singularities can be
written as certain Grassmannian integrals. The latter are manifestly dual conformal. They also
have a conformal symmetry, up to total derivatives. We find that, surprisingly, the conformal symmetry
becomes an invariance in the frame where the Lagrangian insertion point is sent to infinity. Furthermore,
we use integrability methods to study how higher Yangian charges act on the Grassmannian integral.
We evaluate the $n$-particle observable both at tree- and at one-loop level, finding compact analytic
formulas. These results are explicitly written in the form of conformal leading singularities,
multiplied by transcendental functions. We then compare these formulas to known expressions for
all-plus amplitudes in pure Yang-Mills theory. We find a remarkable new connection: the Wilson
loop with Lagrangian insertion in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills appears to predict the maximal
weight terms of the planar pure Yang-Mills all-plus amplitude. We test this relationship for the
two-loop $n$-point Yang-Mills amplitude, as well as for the three-loop four-point amplitude.

The ever-increasing number of detections of gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binaries by
the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors allows us to perform ever-more sensitive tests of
general relativity (GR) in the dynamical and strong-field regime of gravity. We perform a suite
of tests of GR using the compact binary signals observed during the second half of the third observing
run of those detectors. We restrict our analysis to the 15 confident signals that have false alarm
rates $\leq 10^{-3}\, {\rm yr}^{-1}$. In addition to signals consistent with binary black hole
(BH) mergers, the new events include GW200115_042309, a signal consistent with a neutron star--BH
merger. We find the residual power, after subtracting the best fit waveform from the data for each
event, to be consistent with the detector noise. Additionally, we find all the post-Newtonian deformation
coefficients to be consistent with the predictions from GR, with an improvement by a factor of ~2
in the -1PN parameter. We also find that the spin-induced quadrupole moments of the binary BH constituents
are consistent with those of Kerr BHs in GR. We find no evidence for dispersion of GWs, non-GR modes
of polarization, or post-merger echoes in the events that were analyzed. We update the bound on the
mass of the graviton, at 90% credibility, to $m_g \leq 1.27 \times 10^{-23} \mathrm{eV}/c^2$. The
final mass and final spin as inferred from the pre-merger and post-merger parts of the waveform are
consistent with each other. The studies of the properties of the remnant BHs, including deviations
of the quasi-normal mode frequencies and damping times, show consistency with the predictions
of GR. In addition to considering signals individually, we also combine results from the catalog
of GW signals to calculate more precise population constraints. We find no evidence in support of
physics beyond GR.

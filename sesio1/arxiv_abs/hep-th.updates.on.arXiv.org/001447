However, for the regime $B >1$, this behavior gradually becomes fuzzing and chaotic as it approaches
$B = 3.3$. The case $B = 3.3$ is obtained again as the minimum of the critical speed curve as a function
of $B$. For the regime $3.3< B \leq 10$, the chaotic behavior gradually decreases. However, a fractal
structure is never observed. Nevertheless, it is shown that despite the fuzzing and shuffling of
the scattering windows, they follow the rules of the resonant energy exchange theory. In this study,
based on the $\varphi^4$ model, a new model (called the $B\varphi^4$ model) is introduced. The only
difference in this model is that the potential form for the values of the field whose magnitudes are
greater than $1$ is multiplied by the positive number $B$. All features related to a single kink (antikink)
solution remain unchanged and are independent of parameter $B$. However, when a kink interacts
with an antikink in a collision, the results will significantly depend on parameter $B$. Hence,
for kink-antikink collisions, many features such as the critical speed, output speeds for a fixed
initial speed, two-bounce scattering windows, extreme values, and fractal structure in terms
of parameter $B$ are considered in detail numerically. The role of parameter $B$ in the emergence
of a nearly soliton behavior in kink-antikink collisions at some initial speed intervals is clearly
confirmed. The fractal structure in the diagrams of scattering windows is seen for the regime $B\leq
1$. However, for the regime $B >1$, this behavior gradually becomes fuzzing and chaotic as it approaches
$B = 3.3$. The case $B = 3.3$ is obtained again as the minimum of the critical speed curve as a function
of $B$. For the regime $3.3< B \leq 10$, the chaotic behavior gradually decreases.

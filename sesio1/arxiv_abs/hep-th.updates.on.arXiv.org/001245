In this paper, we employ the {\bf mimetic-like} field equations coupled with the Lagrange multiplier
and %mimetic {\bf potential} to derive non-trivial spherically symmetric black hole (BH) solutions.
We divided this study into three cases: The first one in which we take the Lagrange multiplier and
%mimetic {\bf the potential} to have vanishing value and derive a BH solution that completely coincides
with the BH of the Einstein general relativity despite the non-vanishing value of the {\bf mimetic-like
scalar field}. The first case is completely consistent with the previous studies in the literature
that mimetic theory coincides with GR \cite{Nashed:2018qag}. In the second case, we derive a solution
with a constant value of the {\bf potential} and a dynamical value of the Lagrange multiplier. This
solution has no horizon and therefore the obtained spacetime does not correspond to the BH. In this
solution, there appears the region of the Euclidian signature where the signature of the diagonal
components of the metric is $(+,+,+,+)$ or the region with two times where the signature is $(+,+,-,-)$.
Finally, we derive a BH solution with non-vanishing values of the Lagrange multiplier, {\bf potential},
and {\bf mimetic-like scalar field}. This BH shows a soft singularity compared with the Einstein
BH solution. The relevant physics of the third case is discussed by showing their behavior of the
metric potential at infinity, calculating their energy conditions, and study their thermodynamical
quantities. We give a brief discussion on how our third case can generate a BH with three horizons
as in the de Sitter-Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole spacetime, where the largest horizon is the
cosmological one and two correspond to the outer and inner horizons of the BH.

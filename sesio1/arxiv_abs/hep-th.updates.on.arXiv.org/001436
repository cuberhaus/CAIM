We study the observational implications of a class of inflationary models wherein the inflaton
is coupled to the Einstein tensor through a generalized non-minimal derivative coupling (GNMDC).
Such a coupling can be realized in the framework of Horndeski theories or generalized Galileon theories
and leads to novel and distinguishable inflationary predictions. In particular, we explore whether
such models can provide a possible explanation to the large scale anomalies such as the power suppression
and other localized features associated with the CMB temperature and polarisation anisotropies
at low multipoles or large angular scales. For a specific choice of the GNMDC coupling function,
we find that these models can lead to suitable localized features in the power spectrum on large scales.
To our knowledge, such models have not been used earlier to explain the origin of these modulations
in the CMB power spectrum. We work in the regime of parameter space such that we avoid the gradient
instability and the superluminal propagation of scalar perturbations. A very interesting aspect
of our analysis is that a class of inflationary models such as the hilltop-quartic model results
in a better agreement with the Planck data in the presence of an additional GNMDC term. Further, we
compare the GNMDC model with the data using CosmoMC and find that these models provide a considerable
improvement over the best fit reference $\Lambda$CDM model with a featureless, power law, primordial
spectrum. Future CMB experiments such as CMB-S4 will certainly impose better constraints on various
parameters of the GNMDC scenario. Finally, we discuss the wider implications of our results and
argue that these models may also be useful in providing an explanation to other anomalies associated
with the CMB observations.

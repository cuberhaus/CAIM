Violation of the $U(1)$ axial symmetry in QCD is stiffer than the chiral $SU(2)$ breaking, simply
because of the presence of the quantum axial anomaly. Hence it might be expected that if and only if
the QCD gauge coupling is turned off, or sent to zero (the asymptotic-free limit), where the $U(1)$
axial anomaly goes away, the strength of the $U(1)$ axial breaking trivially coincides with that
of the chiral $SU(2)$ breaking. In this write-up, we find that a axial-chiral coincidence occurs
even with nonzero QCD gauge coupling, that is a nontrivial coincidence: it is the case with the massive
light quarks $(m_l\neq 0)$ and the massless strange quark ($m_s=0$), due to the flavor-singlet
nature of the topological susceptibility. This coincidence is robust and tied with the anomalous
chiral Ward-Takahashi identity. The nontrivial coincidence implies that the $U(1)$ axial anomaly
becomes invisible in the meson susceptibility functions. The invisibility of the $U(1)$ axial
anomaly keeps even at hot QCD, so that the chiral $SU(2)$ symmetry restores simultaneously with
the $U(1)$ axial symmetry at high temperatures. This simultaneous restoration is independent
of the light quark mass, hence is irrespective to the order of the chiral phase transition. We explicitize
what the nontrivial coincidence can tell us, by working on a chiral effective model. It turns out
that once the strange quark mass gets massive, the topological susceptibility handles the deviation
from the nontrivial coincidence. It is then clarified that the large discrepancy between the chiral
and axial restorations in the $2+1$ flavors with the physical quark masses is brought by the significant
interference of the topological susceptibility. Thus the deviation from the nontrivial coincidence
monitored by the topological susceptibility provides a new way of understanding of the chiral and
axial breaking in QCD.

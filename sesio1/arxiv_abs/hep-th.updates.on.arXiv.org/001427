We reconsider the role of wormholes in the AdS/CFT correspondence. We focus on Euclidean wormholes
that connect two asymptotically AdS or hyperbolic regions with $\mathbb{S}^1\times \mathbb{S}^{d-1}$
boundary. There is no solution to Einstein's equations of this sort, as the wormholes possess a modulus
that runs to infinity. To find on-shell wormholes we must stabilize this modulus, which we can do
by fixing the total energy on the two boundaries. Such a wormhole gives the saddle point approximation
to a non-standard problem in quantum gravity, where we fix two asymptotic boundaries and constrain
the common energy. Crucially the dual quantity does not factorize even when the bulk is dual to a single
CFT, on account of the fixed energy constraint. From this quantity we extract a smeared version of
the microcanonical spectral form factor. For a chaotic theory this quantity is self-averaging,
i.e. well-approximated by averaging over energy windows, or over coupling constants. We go on to
give a precision test involving the microcanonical spectral form factor where the two replicas
have slightly different coupling constants. In chaotic theories this form factor is known to smoothly
decay at a rate universally predicted in terms of one replica physics, provided that there is an average
either over a window or over couplings. We compute the expected decay rate for holographic theories,
and the form factor from a wormhole, and the two exactly agree for a wide range of two-derivative effective
field theories in AdS. This gives a precision test of averaging in AdS/CFT. Our results interpret
a number of confusing facts about wormholes and factorization in AdS and suggest that we should regard
gravitational effective field theory as a mesoscopic description, analogous to semiclassical
mesoscopic descriptions of quantum chaotic systems.

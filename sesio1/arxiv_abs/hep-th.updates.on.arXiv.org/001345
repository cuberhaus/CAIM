The electroweak symmetry-breaking sector is one of the most promising and uncharted parts of the
Standard Model; but it seems likely that new electroweak physics may be out of reach of the present
accelerator effort and the hope is to observe small deviations from the SM. Given that, Effective
Field Theory becomes the logic method to use, and SMEFT has become the standard. However, the most
general theory with the known particle content is HEFT, and whether SMEFT suffices should be investigated
in future experimental efforts. Building on investigations by other groups that established geometric
criteria to distinguish SMEFT from HEFT (useful for theorists examining specific beyond-SM completions),
we seek more phenomenological understanding and present an analogous discussion aimed at a broader
audience. We discuss various aspects of (multi-) Higgs boson production from longitudinal electroweak
gauge bosons $W_LW_L\to n\times h$ in the TeV region as the necessary information to characterise
the Flare function, $\mathcal{F}(h)$, that determines whether SMEFT or HEFT is needed. We also
present tree-level amplitudes including contact and exchange channels, as well as a short discussion
on accessing $\mathcal{F}(h)$ from the statistical limit of many bosons. We also discuss the status
of the coefficients of its series expansion, its validity, whether its complex-$h$ extension can
be used to predict or not a tell-tale zero, and how they relate to the dimension-6 and -8 SMEFT operators
in the electroweak sector. We derive a set of new correlations among BSM corrections to the HEFT coefficients
that help decide, from experimental data, whether we have a viable SMEFT. This analysis can be useful
for machines beyond the LHC that could address the challenging final state with several Higgs bosons.

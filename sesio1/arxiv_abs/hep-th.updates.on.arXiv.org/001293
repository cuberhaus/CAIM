This article, based on the author's PhD thesis, reviews recent advancements in the field of quantum
integrability, in particular the separation of variables (SoV) program for high-rank integrable
spin chains and the boost mechanism for solving the Yang-Baxter equation. We begin with a general
overview of quantum integrable systems with special emphasis on their description in terms of quantum
algebras. We then provide a detailed account of the Yangian of $\mathfrak{gl}(n)$ in particular
the Bethe algebra, fusion, and T- and Q-systems. We then introduce the notion of separation of variables
in integrable systems and build on Sklyanin's work in rank 1 models and extend to higher rank. By exploiting
a novel link between SoV and quantum algebra representation theory we construct the separated variables
for $\mathfrak{gl}(n)$ spin chains for arbitrary compact representations of the symmetry algebra
and develop various new tools along the way. Next, we build on the previous part and develop a new technique
for the computation of scalar products in the SoV framework which we call Functional SoV or FSoV.
Unlike the work in the previous, operatorial, part this approach is based on the Baxter TQ equations.
After developing this technique we supplement it with a new operator construction providing a unified
view of functional and operatorial SoV. Then, we generalise the results of the previous part from
compact spin chains to non-compact spin chains. The final part of this work is based on the development
of tools for solving the Yang- Baxter equation. We develop a bottom-up approach for this based on
the so-called Boost automorphism and uses the spin chain Hamiltonian as a starting point. Our approach
allows us to classify numerous families of solutions in particular a complete classification of
4 x 4 solutions which preserve fermion number which have applications in the AdS/CFT correspondence.

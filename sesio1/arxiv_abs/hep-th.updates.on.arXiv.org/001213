In this study, we revisit the absorption and scattering process by which a massless bosonic field
impinges on a charged dilatonic black hole. Using the partial wave method, we determine numerically
the total absorption cross-section in terms of the decoupling parameter called $M\omega$, finding
that the amplitude of the dilatonic black hole is lower than the Reissner-Nordstr\"om one for mild
frequencies. In the limit of high-frequency, the absorption cross-section exhibits two different
kinds of complex behaviors, one is referred to as the fine structure and the other as the hyperfine
structure. To fully grasp the main properties of the charged dilatonic black hole, we consider a
different framework where the compact object is impinged by a charged massive bosonic field. In
the low-frequency limit, we argue that the absorption cross-section presents two different phases,
which are indicated by the value of a critical velocity. Depending on the dark matter model and the
black hole mass, we show that both phases are relevant. We verify that the superradiance scattering
takes place, being enhanced by smaller scalar field mass but larger values of the scalar field charge.
For intermediate frequency, the superradiant effect is lessened in relation to the Reissner-Nordstr\"om
case. However, this effect does not necessarily imply the existence of any instability. In order
to trigger the superradiant instability, two conditions must be met. There must be unstable modes
that remain trapped outside the event horizon with a mechanism based on the reflecting-mirror boundary
conditions. This mechanism allows for the system composed of a charged scalar field plus a charged
black hole to produce a charged black hole bomb. We provide an analytic formula (lower bound) for
the values of the charge field which can trigger this superradiant instability.

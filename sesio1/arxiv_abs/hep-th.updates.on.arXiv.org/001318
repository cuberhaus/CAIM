In this paper, we continue the analysis of the effective model of quantum Schwarzschild black holes
recently proposed by some of the authors in [1,2]. In the resulting spacetime the central singularity
is resolved by a black-to-white hole bounce, quantum effects become relevant at a unique mass independent
curvature scale, while they become negligible in the low curvature region near the horizon and classical
geometry is approached asymptotically. This is the case independently of the relation between
the black and white hole masses, which are thus freely specifiable independent observables. A natural
question then arises about the phenomenological implications of the resulting non-singular effective
spacetime and whether some specific relation between the masses can be singled out from a phenomenological
perspective. Here we focus on the thermodynamic properties of the effective polymer black hole
and analyse the corresponding quantum corrections as functions of black and white hole masses.
The study of the relevant thermodynamic quantities such as temperature, specific heat and horizon
entropy reveals that the effective spacetime generically admits an extremal minimal-sized configuration
of quantum-gravitational nature characterised by vanishing temperature and entropy. For large
masses, the classically expected results are recovered at leading order and quantum corrections
are negligible, thus providing us with a further consistency check of the model. The explicit form
of the corrections depends on the specific relation among the masses. In particular, a first-order
logarithmic correction to the entropy is obtained for a quadratic mass relation. The latter corresponds
to the case of proper finite length effects which turn out to be compatible with a minimal length generalised
uncertainty principle associated with an extremal Planck-sized black hole.

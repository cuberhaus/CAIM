The quantum gravitational effects on the region near the horizon may alter the black hole (BH)'s
horizon drastically. The horizon becomes partially reflective, portrayed by a quantum membrane.
With this modification, the object can be considered as an exotic compact object (ECO). Therefore,
the existence of a quantum membrane makes the properties of BHs differ from those of ECOs. Furthermore,
quantum effects on the strong gravitational regime may also give rise to a non-conserved matter
tensor that can be described phenomenologically using Rastall theory of gravity. We study the properties
of BHs and ECOs within Rastall theory of gravity using Kerr/CFT correspondence. We systematically
investigate the properties of the most general rotating BHs in Rastall gravity, i.e., Kerr-Newman-NUT-Kiselev
BHs, and reveal its hidden conformal symmetry. The Cardy microscopic entropy formula and absorption
cross-sections from 2D CFT are computed and then matched with gravity calculation. We also extend
the dual CFT analysis for studying the properties of ECOs that resemble Kerr-Newman-NUT-Kiselev
BHs in Rastall gravity to see the role of the reflective quantum membrane. The existence of the quantum
membrane leads to the appearance of the gravitational echoes in ringdown signal from the gravitational
wave observations that is manifested as an oscillatory feature on the absorption cross-section.
We compute the absorption cross-section and quasi-normal modes in the dual CFT picture for ECOs.
We also compare the absorption cross-section of ECOs to that of BHs. We find that the Rastall coupling
constant plays a significant role of both objects. We obtain that time delay of the ringdown signal
depends explicitly on the Rastall coupling constant. This coupling constant may play the role to
recover the correction on time delay that is believed as a non-linear physics effect.

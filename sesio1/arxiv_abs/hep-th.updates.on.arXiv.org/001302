In the context of a ghost free $f(R,\mathcal{G})$ model, we present a non-singular cosmological
scenario in which the universe initially contracts through an ekpyrotic phase having a bouncing
like behaviour, and following the bounce, it smoothly transits to a matter or radiation like deceleration
era which is further smoothly connected to the dark energy era at present epoch. We consider the Gauss-Bonnet
(GB) coupling function in such a way that it gets compatible with the event GW170817. Using suitable
reconstruction technique, we obtain the non-trivial scalar field potential as well as the GB coupling
function. Such scalar potential and GB coupling function source a smooth unified scenario from
an ekpyrotic bounce to the dark energy era with an intermediate deceleration era. The occurrence
of ekpyrotic contraction phase justifies the resolution of the anisotropic problem (also known
as BKL instability) in the background evolution. The Hubble radius shows an asymmetric behaviour
around the bounce, in particular, the evolution of the Hubble radius leads to the generation era
of the primordial perturbation modes far before the bounce in the deep sub-Hubble regime. Accordingly
we perform the scalar and tensor perturbation evolution in the present context, and as a result,
the scalar power spectrum at large scale modes is found to be problematic. Thus an extended scenario
is proposed where we consider a pre-ekpyrotic phase having the equation of state parameter is less
than unity, and re-examine the scalar and tensor power spectra, on large scales that cross the Hubble
radius during the pre-ekpyrotic stage. In this regard, the GB coupling function shows considerable
effects in reducing the tensor to scalar ratio compared to the case where the GB coupling is absent.
Furthermore the dark energy epoch is consistent with the Planck+SNe+BAO data.

This thesis proposes a framework based on a notion of combinatorial cell complex (cc) whose cells
are defined simply as finite sets of vertices. The cells of a cc are subject to four axioms involving
a rank function that assigns a rank (or a dimension) to each cell. Our framework focuses on classes
of cc admitting an inclusion-reversing duality map. We introduce a combinatorial notion of cobordism
that allows us to single out a category whose morphisms are cobordisms having a causal structure.
Our aim is to offer an approach to look for a combinatorial notion of quantum field theory having a
built-in duality operation acting on the underlying space and not relying on any manifold structure.
The introduction includes links with fields in Theoretical and Mathematical Physics related to
Quantum Gravity and motivating our framework. We start by introducing cc and the duality map on a
class of cc with empty boundary called closed cc. We then focus on the problem of reconstructing a
certain class of cc from their cells of rank 2 and lower. Such cc are in particular duals to simplicial
complexes with no boundary and their reconstruction is realized using a discrete notion of connection.
Our next main result extends the duality map we defined on closed cc to a class of cc with boundary.
An important by-product of the study of this extended duality map is the combinatorial notion of
cobordism used in this work. We also introduce a general notion of subdivision of a cc via a map called
reduction, as well as the dual notion of reduction called collapse. These two types of map characterize
the structure of certain cc called slices, using sequences of maps called slice sequences. Slices
are the basic building blocs of our definition of causal cobordisms and the dual of a slice sequence
defines the composition of cobordisms, providing us with a category whose morphisms are causal
cobordisms.

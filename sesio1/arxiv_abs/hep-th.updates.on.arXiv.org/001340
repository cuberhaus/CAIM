This thesis is concerned with heterotic E8 x E8 string models that can produce quasirealistic N =
1 supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model in the low-energy limit. We start rather generally
by deriving the four-dimensional spectrum and Lagrangian terms from the ten-dimensional theory,
through a process of compactification over six-dimensional Calabi-Yau manifolds, upon which
holomorphic poly-stable vector bundles are defined. We then specialise to a class of heterotic
string models for which the vector bundle is split into a sum of line bundles and the Calabi-Yau manifold
is defined as a complete intersection in projective ambient spaces. We develop a method for calculating
holomorphic Yukawa couplings for such models, by relating bundle-valued forms on the Calabi-Yau
manifold to their ambient space counterparts, so that the relevant integrals can be evaluated over
projective spaces. The method is applicable for any of the 7890 CICY manifolds known in the literature,
and we show that it can be related to earlier algebraic techniques to compute holomorphic Yukawa
couplings. We provide explicit calculations of the holomorphic Yukawa couplings for models compactified
on the tetra-quadric and on a co-dimension two CICY. A vanishing theorem is formulated, showing
that in some cases, topology rather than symmetry is responsible for the absence of certain trilinear
couplings. In addition, some Yukawa matrices are found to be dependent on the complex structure
moduli and their rank is reduced in certain regions of the moduli space. In the final part, we focus
on a method to evaluate the matter field Kahler potential without knowing the Ricci-flat Calabi-Yau
metric. This is possible for large internal gauge fluxes, for which the normalisation integral
localises around a point on the compactification manifold.

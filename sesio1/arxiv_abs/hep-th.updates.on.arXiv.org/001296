Investigating principles for storage of quantum information at finite temperature with minimal
need for active error correction is an active area of research. We bear upon this question in two-dimensional
holographic conformal field theories via the quantum null energy condition (QNEC) that we have
shown earlier to implement the restrictions imposed by quantum thermodynamics on such many-body
systems. We study an explicit encoding of a logical qubit into two similar chirally propagating
excitations of finite von-Neumann entropy on a finite temperature background whose erasure can
be implemented by an appropriate inhomogeneous and instantaneous energy-momentum inflow from
an infinite energy memoryless bath due to which the system transits to a thermal state. Holographically,
these fast erasure processes can be depicted by generalized AdS-Vaidya geometries described previously
in which no assumption of specific form of bulk matter is needed. We show that the quantum null energy
condition gives analytic results for the minimal finite temperature needed for the deletion which
is larger than the initial background temperature in consistency with Landauer's principle. In
particular, we find a simple expression for the minimum final temperature needed for the erasure
of a large number of encoding qubits. We also find that if the encoding qubits are localized over an
interval shorter than a specific localization length, then the fast erasure process is impossible,
and furthermore this localization length is the largest for an optimal amount of encoding qubits
determined by the central charge. We estimate the optimal encoding qubits for realistic protection
against fast erasure. We discuss possible generalizations of our study for novel constructions
of fault-tolerant quantum gates operating at finite temperature.

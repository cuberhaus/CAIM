In this book we prove unified classification results for equivariant principal bundles when the
topological structure group is truncated. The conceptually transparent proof invokes a smooth
Oka principle, which becomes available after faithfully embedding traditional equivariant topology
into the singular-cohesive homotopy theory of globally equivariant higher smooth stacks. This
works for discrete equivariance groups acting properly on smooth manifolds with resolvable singularities,
whence we are equivalently describing principal bundles on good orbifolds. In preparation, we
re-develop the theory of equivariant principal bundles from scratch by systematic use of Grothendieck's
internalization method. In particular we prove that all equivariant local triviality conditions
considered in the literature are implied by regarding G-equivariant principal bundles as principal
bundles internal to the BG-slice of the ambient cohesive infinity-topos. Generally we find that
the characteristic subtle phenomena of equivariant classifying theory all reflect basic "modal"
properties of singular-cohesive homotopy theory. Classical literature has mostly been concerned
with compact Lie structure groups. Where these are truncated, our classification recovers and
generalizes results of Lashof, May, Segal and Rezk. A key non-classical example is the infinite
projective unitary structure group, in which case we are classifying degree-3 twists of equivariant
KU-theory, recovering results of Atiyah, Segal, Lueck and Uribe. Our theorem enhances this to conjugation-equivariance,
where we are classifying the geometric twists of equivariant KR-theory, restricting on "O-planes"
to the geometric twists of KO-theory. This is the generality in which equivariant K-theory twists
model quantum symmetries of topological phases and the B-field in string theory on orbi-orientifolds.

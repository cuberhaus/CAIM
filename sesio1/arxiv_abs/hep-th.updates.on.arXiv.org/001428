The polarized Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (pSZ) effect is sourced by the Thomson scattering of CMB photons
from distant free electrons and yields a novel view of the CMB quadrupole throughout the observable
Universe. Galaxy shear measures the shape distortions of galaxies, probing both their local environment
and the intervening matter distribution. Both observables give interesting constraints on the
cosmological model; here we ask: what can be learnt from their combination? The pSZ-shear cross-spectrum
measures the shear-galaxy-polarization bispectrum and contains contributions from (1) the Sachs-Wolfe
(SW) effect, (2) the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, and (3) inflationary gravitational
waves. Since the modes contributing to the pSZ signal are not restricted to the Earth's past lightcone,
the low-redshift cross-spectra could provide a novel constraint on dark energy via the ISW effect,
whilst the SW signal couples scalar modes at very different times but at similar positions; this
provides a unique probe of the Universe's homogeneous time evolution. We give expressions for all
major contributions to the shear, galaxy, and pSZ auto- and cross-spectra, and evaluate their detectability
via Fisher forecasts. Despite significant theoretical utility, the cross-spectra will be challenging
to detect: combining CMB-S4 with Rubin yields a $1.6\sigma$ detection of the ISW contribution,
which increases to $5.2\sigma$ for a futuristic experiment involving CMB-HD and a higher galaxy
sample density. For parity-even (parity-odd) tensors, we predict a $1\sigma$ limit of $\sigma(r)
= 0.9$ ($0.2$) for CMB-S4 and Rubin, or $0.3$ ($0.06$) for the more futuristic setup. Whilst this
is significantly better than the constraints from galaxy shear alone (and less sensitive to systematics),
it is unlikely to be competitive, but may serve as a useful cross-check.

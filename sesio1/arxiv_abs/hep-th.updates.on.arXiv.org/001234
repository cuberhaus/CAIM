Considering the setup of arXiv:hep-th/0902.1540 involving UV-complete top-down type IIB holographic
dual of large-N thermal QCD with a fluxed resolved warped deformed conifold, in arXiv:hep-th/1306.4339
delocalized type IIA S(trominger)-Y(au)-Z(aslow)mirror of the type IIB background of arXiv:hep-th/0902.1540
was constructed via three T dualities along a special Lagrangian $T^{3}$ fibered over a large base
and then uplifted, locally, to the 11-dimensional ${\cal M}$-theory. Considering the aforementioned
setup arXiv:hep-th/1306.4339 in the `MQGP' limit, in arXiv:1703.01306 [hep-th] we obtained the
masses of the $0^{++}, 0^{-+},0^{--}, 1^{++}, 2^{++}$ (`glueball') states. We also obtained analytical
expressions for the vector and scalar meson spectra in arXiv:1707.02818 [hep-th]. We used WKB quantization
conditions and Neumann/Dirichlet boundary conditions at an IR cut-off (`$r_0$')/horizon radius
(`$r_h$') on the solutions to the equations of motion. We also discussed the $r_h=0$-limits of all
calculations which correspond to the thermal background. Subsequently, in arXiv:1808.01182
[hep-th] we obtained the interaction Lagrangian corresponding to exotic scalar glueball $\left(
G_{E}\right)-\rho/\pi$- meson. Assuming $M_G>2M_\rho$, we then computed $\rho\rightarrow2\pi,
G_E\rightarrow2\pi, 2\rho, \rho+2\pi$ decay widths as well as the direct and indirect (mediated
via $\rho$ mesons) $G_E\rightarrow4\pi$ decays. In arXiv:2004.07259 [hep-th] we obtained ${\cal
O}\left(l_p^6\right)$ corrections to the MQGP background of arXiv:hep-th/1306.4339 to study
a top-down holographic dual of the thermal QCD-like theories at intermediate 't Hooft coupling
and in arXiv:2011.04660 [hep-th] we obtained the values of the coupling constants of the ${\cal
O}(p^4)$ $\chi$PT Lagrangian in the chiral limit, inclusive of the ${\cal O}(R^4)$ corrections.

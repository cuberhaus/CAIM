Primordial non-Gaussianity can source $\mu$-distortion anisotropies that are correlated with
the large-scale temperature and polarization signals of the cosmic microwave background (CMB).
A measurement of $\mu T$ and $\mu E$ correlations can therefore be used to constrain it on wavelengths
of perturbations not directly probed by the standard CMB anisotropies. In this work, we carry out
a first rigorous search for $\mu$-type spectral distortion anisotropies with \Planck data, applying
the well-tested constrained ILC component-separation method combined with the needlet framework.
We reconstruct a $\mu$ map from \Planck data, which we then correlate with the CMB anisotropies to
derive constraints on the amplitude $\fNL$ of the local form bispectrum, specifically on the highly
squeezed configurations with effective wavenumbers $k_s \simeq \SI{740}{Mpc^{-1}}$ and $k_L
\simeq \SI{0.05}{Mpc^{-1}}$. We improve previously estimated constraints by more than an order
of magnitude. This enhancement is owing to the fact that for the first time we are able to use the full
multipole information by carefully controlling biases and systematic effects in the final analysis.
We also for the first time incorporate constraints from measurements of $\mu E$ correlations, which
further tighten the limits. A combination of the derived \Planck $\mu T$ and $\mu E$ power spectra
yields $|\fNL| \lesssim 6800$ (95\% c.l.) on this highly squeezed bispectrum. This is only $\simeq
3$ times weaker than the anticipated constraint from \LiteBIRD alone. We show that a combination
of \LiteBIRD with \Planck will improve the expected future constraint by $\simeq 20\%$ over \LiteBIRD
alone. These limits can be used to constrain multi-field inflation models and primordial black
hole formation scenarios, thus providing a promising novel avenue forward in CMB cosmology.

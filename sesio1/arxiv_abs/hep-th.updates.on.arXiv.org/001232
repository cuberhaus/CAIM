We study the Standard Model (SM) in Weyl conformal geometry. This embedding is natural and truly
minimal {\it with no new fields} required beyond the SM spectrum and Weyl geometry. The action inherits
a gauged scale symmetry $D(1)$ (known as Weyl gauge symmetry) from the underlying geometry. The
associated Weyl quadratic gravity undergoes spontaneous breaking of $D(1)$ by a geometric Stueckelberg
mechanism in which the Weyl gauge field ($\omega_\mu$) acquires mass by "absorbing" the spin-zero
mode ($\phi_0$) of the $\tilde R^2$ term in the action. This mode also generates the Planck scale
and the cosmological constant. The Einstein-Proca action of $\omega_\mu$ emerges in the broken
phase. In the presence of the SM, this mechanism receives corrections (from the Higgs) and it can
induce electroweak (EW) symmetry breaking. The EW scale is proportional to the vev of the Stueckelberg
field ($\phi_0$). The Higgs field ($\sigma$) has direct couplings to the Weyl gauge field, and its
mass may be protected at quantum level by the D(1) symmetry. The SM fermions can acquire couplings
to $\omega_\mu$ only in the special case of a non-vanishing kinetic mixing of the gauge fields of
$D(1)\times U(1)_Y$. If this mixing is indeed present, part of $Z$ boson mass is not due to the Higgs
mechanism, but to its mixing with massive $\omega_\mu$. Precision measurements of $Z$ mass then
set lower bounds on the mass of $\omega_\mu$ which can be light (few TeV). In the early Universe the
Higgs field can have a {\it geometric} origin, by Weyl vector fusion, and the Stueckelberg-Higgs
potential can drive inflation. The dependence of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ on the spectral
index $n_s$ is similar to that in Starobinsky inflation but shifted to lower $r$ by the Higgs non-minimal
coupling to Weyl geometry.

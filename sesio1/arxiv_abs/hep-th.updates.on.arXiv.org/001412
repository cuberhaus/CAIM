We study solutions in non-linear electrodynamics (NED) and establish several general results.
We show, that the $SO(2)$ electric-magnetic duality symmetry is restrictive enough to allow for
reconstruction of the NED Lagrangian from the spherically-symmetric electrostatic (Coulomb-like)
solution -- although there are infinitely many different NED theories admitting a given solution,
there exists a unique $SO(2)$ invariant one among them. We introduce a general algorithm for constructing
new $SO(2)$ invariant NED theories in the conventional approach, where only a few examples are available.
We also show how to derive the Lagrangian of the $SO(2)$ invariant theory admitting a given electrostatic
solution. We further show on a simple example that some NED theories may require sources (particles)
of finite (non-zero) size. Such a non-zero size source not only regularizes the infinite energy
of the point charge but also satisfies the condition of regularity, that the electric field is zero
at the origin. The latter condition was identified earlier as necessary and sufficient for the NED
solution to generate a regular black hole via so-called double copy construction and is also satisfied
by solitons. We propose a large class of solitonic NED solutions that give rise to regular black holes
via double copy construction and contain solutions of Maxwell and Born-Infeld as different limits.
This class of NED solutions acquires two new properties in the limit where the corresponding regular
black hole's asymptotics becomes Minkowski: it gives rise to regular higher-spin black holes via
generalization of double copy -- ``higher-copy'' construction, and for very short distances changes
the sign of the force becoming repulsive/attractive for opposite/similar signs of charges.

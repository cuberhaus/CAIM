Based on string theory's framework, the gauge/gravity duality, also known as holography, has the
ability to solve practical problems in low energy physical systems like metals and fluids. Holographic
applications open a path for conversation and collaboration between the theory-driven, high energy
culture of string theory and fields like nuclear and condensed matter physics, which in contrast
place great emphasis on the empirical evidence that experiment provides. This paper takes a look
at holography's history, from its roots in string theory to its present-day applications that are
challenging the cultural identity of the field. I will focus on two of these applications: holographic
QCD and holographic superconductivity, highlighting some of the (often incompatible) historical
influences, motives, and epistemic values at play, as well as the subcultural shifts that help the
collaborations work. The extent to which holographic research -- arguably string theory's most
successful and prolific area -- must change its subcultural identity in order to function in fields
outside of string theory reflects its changing nature and the field's uncertain future. Does string
theory lose its identity in the low-energy applications that holography provides? Does holography
still belong under string theory's umbrella, or is it destined to form new subcultures with each
of its fields of application? I find that the answers to these questions are dynamic, interconnected,
and highly dependent on string theory's relationship with its field of application. In some cases,
holography can maintain the goals and values it inherited from string theory. In others, it instead
adopts the goals and values of the field in which it is applied. These examples highlight a need for
the STS community to expand its treatment of string theory beyond its relationship with empiricism
and role as a theory of quantum gravity.

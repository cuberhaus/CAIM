We demonstrate that rotating dyonic black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion (EMDA) theory
is holographically dual with 2D conformal field theory. We first investigate the duality on dyonic
Kerr-Sen black hole with non-vanishing dilaton and axion charges. The near-horizon geometry of
extremal dyonic Kerr-Sen spacetime possesses the $SL(2,R) \times U (1)$ isometry allowing to employ
the asymptotic symmetry group method to find the corresponding central charge. We find two different
branches of the mass which correspond to CFT with two different central charges $c_L=12am_+$ and
$c_L=12am_-$. The exact agreement between the Bekenstain-Hawking entropy and entropy from CFT
is then found also in two different branches of extremal entropy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
this duality is robust insofar for non-zero AdS length. We show that the duality holds for both dyonic
Kerr-Sen-AdS black hole and its ultraspinning counterpart. In both cases, we obtain the expected
entropy from CFT which matches exactly with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Since dyonic and axion
charges are proportional to $1/m$, we note that there are possibly more than two branches of the central
charge for non-zero AdS length in terms of mass. When we turn off dyonic charge, the axion charge vanishes
showing the results of Kerr-Sen-AdS black hole. Moreover, when we assume the equal electromagnetic
charges, it recovers the results when the dilaton charge vanishes. In the end, we compare the results
of dyonic Kerr-Sen-AdS black hole and its ultraspinning counterpart to those of the dyonic Kerr-Newman-AdS
black hole and the ultraspinning counterpart. Depending on the dyonic charge parameters, it is
found that extremal ultraspinning dyonic Kerr-Sen-AdS black hole is not always superentropic.

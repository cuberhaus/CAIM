Within the functional renormalization group approach to Background Independent quantum gravity,
we explore the scale dependent effective geometry of the de Sitter solution dS${}_4$. The investigation
employs a novel approach whose essential ingredient is a modified spectral flow of the metric dependent
d'Alembertian, or of similar hyperbolic kinetic operators. The corresponding one-parameter
family of spectra and eigenfunctions encodes information about the nonperturbative backreaction
of the dynamically gravitating vacuum fluctuations on the mean field geometry of the quantum spacetime.
Used as a diagnostic tool, the power of the spectral flow method resides in its ability to identify
the scale dependent subsets of field modes that supply the degrees of freedom which participate
in the effective field theory description of the respective scale. A central result is that the ultraviolet
of Quantum Einstein Gravity comprises far less effective degrees of freedom than predicted (incorrectly)
by background dependent reasoning. Exploring the quantum spacetime's spatial geometry carried
by physical fields, we find that 3-dimensional space disintegrates into a collection of coherent
patches which individually can, but in their entirety cannot be described by one of the effective
average actions occurring along the renormalization group trajectory. A natural concept of an
entropy is introduced in order to quantify this fragmentation effect. Tentatively applied to the
real Universe, surprising analogies to properties of the observed cosmic microwave background
are uncovered. Furthermore, a set of distinguished field modes is found which, in principle, has
the ability to transport information about the asymptotic fixed point regime from the ultraviolet,
across almost the entire "scale history", to cosmological distances in the observed Universe.

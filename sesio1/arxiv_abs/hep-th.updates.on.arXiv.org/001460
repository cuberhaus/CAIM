A basic assumption in classical GR is that the metric field is nowhere degenerate in spacetime. In
particular the induced metric on Cauchy surfaces must be nowhere degenerate. It is only under this
assumption that one can derive the hypersurace deformation algebra between the initial value constraints
which is absolutely transparent from the fact that the {\it inverse} of the induced metric is needed
to close the algebra. This statement is independent of the density weight that one may want to equip
the spatial metric with. Accordingly, the very definition of a non-anomalous representation of
the hypersurface defomation algebra in quantum gravity has to address the issue of non-degenracy
of the induced metric that is needed in the classical theory. In the Hilbert space representation
employed in Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) most emphasis has been layed to define an inverse metric operator
on the dense domain of spin network states although they represent induced quantum geometries which
are degenerate almost everywhere. It is no surprise that demonstration of closure of the constraint
algebra on this domain meets difficulties because it is a sector of the quantum theory which is classically
forbidden and which lies outside the domain of definition of the classical hypersurface deformation
algebra. Various suggestions for addressing the issue such as non-standard operator topologies,
dual spaces (habitats) and density weights have been propposed to address this issue with respect
to the quantum dynamics of LQG. In this article we summarise these developments and argue that insisting
on a dense domain of non-degenerate states within the LQG representation may provide a natural resolution
of the issue thereby possibly avoiding the above mentioned non-standard constructions.

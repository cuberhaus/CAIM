Bubble universes and traversable wormholes in general relativity can be realized as two sides of
the same concept. To exemplify, we find, display, and study in a unified manner a Minkowski-Minkowski
closed universe and a Minkowski-Minkowski traversable wormhole. By joining two 3-dimensional
flat balls along a thin shell two-sphere of matter, i.e., a spherical domain wall, into a single spacetime
one gets a Minkowski-Minkowski static closed universe, i.e., a bubble universe. By joining two
3-dimensional complements of flat balls along a thin shell two-sphere of matter, i.e., a spherical
throat, into a single spacetime one gets a Minkowski-Minkowski static open universe which is a traversable
wormhole. Thus, Minkowski-Minkowski bubble universes and wormholes can be seen as complementary.
It is also striking that these two spacetimes have resemblances with two well-known static universes.
The Minkowski-Minkowski static closed universe resembles the Einstein universe, a static closed
spherical universe homogeneously filled with dust matter and with a cosmological constant. The
Minkowski-Minkowski static open universe resembles the Friedmann static universe, a static open
hyperbolic universe homogeneously filled with negative energy density dust and with a negative
cosmological, a universe with two disjoint branes that can be considered a failed wormhole. In this
light, the Einstein and Friedmann universes are also two sides of the same concept. A linear stability
analysis for all these spacetimes is performed. The complementarity between bubble universes
and traversable wormholes, that exists for these static spacetimes, can be can carried out for dynamical
spacetimes, indicating that such a complementarity is general. The study suggests that bubble
universes and traversable wormholes can be seen as coming out of the same concept, and thus, if ones
exist the others should also exist.

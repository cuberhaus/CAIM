The Riemann Hypothesis states that the Riemann zeta function $\zeta(z)$ admits a set of ``non-trivial''
zeros that are complex numbers supposed to have real part $1/2$. Their distribution on the complex
plane is thought to be the key to determine the number of prime numbers before a given number. Hilbert
and P\'olya suggested that the Riemann Hypothesis could be solved through the mathematical tools
of physics, finding a suitable Hermitian or unitary operator that describe classical or quantum
systems, whose eigenvalues distribute like the zeros of $\zeta(z)$. A different approach is that
of finding a correspondence between the distribution of the $\zeta(z)$ zeros and the poles of the
scattering matrix $S$ of a physical system. Our contribution is articulated in two parts: in the
first we apply the infinite-components Majorana equation in a Rindler spacetime and compare the
results with those obtained with a Dirac particle following the Hilbert-P\'olya approach showing
that the Majorana solution has a behavior similar to that of massless Dirac particles and finding
a relationship between the zeros of zeta end the energy states. Then, we focus on the $S$-matrix approach
describing the bosonic open string scattering for tachyonic states with the Majorana equation.
Here we find that, thanks to the relationship between the angular momentum and energy/mass eigenvalues
of the Majorana solution, one can explain the still unclear point for which the poles and zeros of
the $S$-matrix of an ideal system that can satisfy the Riemann Hypothesis, exist always in pairs
and are related via complex conjugation. As claimed in the literature, if this occurs and the claim
is correct, then the Riemann Hypothesis could be in principle satisfied, tracing a route to a proof.

Role of quenched randomness in metallic quantum criticality is one of the long standing problems
in condensed matter physics. An aspect of the fundamental difficulties lies in the fact that such
nonmagnetic disorders lead effective interactions between abundant soft modes near the Fermi
surface to be drastically enhanced particularly in the diffusive regime, where the perturbative
framework does not work. Here, we revisit the problem of dirty quantum critical metals in a different
angle, focusing on the hydrodynamic regime instead of the diffusive regime near the non-Fermi liquid
quantum critical point. More concretely, we study effects of mutual correlations between quantum
critical nematic fluctuations and weak localization corrections, and show the existence of a weak-disorder
non-Fermi liquid fixed point, based on the renormalization group (RG) analysis up to the two-loop
order. The two-loop order RG analysis suggests that the absence of quantum coherence in two-particle
composite excitations weakens the role of weak localization corrections and allows a weakly disordered
non-Fermi liquid metallic state in the hydrodynamic regime of the nematic quantum critical point.
Although this dirty non-Fermi liquid metallic state may not be the true infrared stable fixed point
at zero temperature, expected to be characterized by the diffusive Ohmic regime, we argue that this
weak-disorder non-Fermi liquid metallic fixed point would govern the region of an intermediate
energy scale, described by effective hydrodynamics of nematic quantum criticality. In this respect
we believe that this research would be an important step in understanding the $T-$linear electrical
resistivity as a characteristic feature of non-Fermi liquids and the origin of unconventional
superconductivity from effective hydrodynamics of quantum criticality.

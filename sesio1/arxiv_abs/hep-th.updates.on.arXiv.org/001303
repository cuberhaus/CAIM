We study the properties of holographic $s$-wave and $p$-wave superconductors with higher order
corrections in Gauss-Bonnet gravity in $3$ and $4$-dimensional space-time. We employ shooting
method to solve equations of motion numerically and obtain the effect of different values of mass,
nonlinear and Gauss-Bonnet parameters on critical temperature and condensation. Based on our
results, increasing each of these three parameters leads to lower temperatures and larger values
of condensation. This phenomenon is rooted in the fact that conductor/superconductor phase transition
faces with difficulty for higher effect of nonlinear and Gauss-Bonnet terms in the presence of a
massive field. In addition, we study the electrical conductivity in holographic setup. In $D=4$,
real and imaginary parts of conductivity in holographic $s$- and $p$-wave models behave similarly
and follow the same trend as higher dimensions by showing the delta function and pole at low frequency
regime that Kramers-Kronig relation can connect these two parts of conductivity to each other.
We observe the appearance of a gap energy at $\omega_{g}\approx 8T_{c}$ at which shifts toward higher
frequencies by diminishing temperature and increasing the effect of nonlinear and Gauss-Bonnet
terms. Conductivity in $D = 3$ is far different from other dimensions. Even the real and imaginary
parts in $s$- and $p$-wave modes pursue various trends. For example in $\omega \rightarrow 0$ limit,
imaginary part in holographic $s$-wave model tends to infinity but in $p$-wave model approaches
to zero. However, the real parts in both models show a delta function behavior. In general, real and
imaginary parts of conductivity in all cases that we study tend to a constant value in $\omega \rightarrow
\infty$ regime.

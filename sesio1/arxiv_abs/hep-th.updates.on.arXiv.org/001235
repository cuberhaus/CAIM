Computing superconducting properties starting from an exactly solvable model for a doped Mott
insulator stands as a grand challenge. We have recently\cite{hksupercon} shown that this can be
done starting from the Hatsugai-Kohmoto\cite{HKmodel} (HK) model which can be understood\cite{HKrenorm}
generally as the minimal model that breaks the non-local $\mathbb Z_2$ symmetry of a Fermi liquid,
thereby constituting a new quartic fixed point for Mott physics. In the current work, we compute
the thermodynamics, condensation energy, and electronic properties such as the NMR relaxation
rate $1/T_1$ and ultrasonic attenuation rate. Key differences arise with the standard BCS analysis
from a Fermi liquid: 1) the free energy exhibits a local minimum at $T_p$ where the pairing gap turns
on discontinuously above a critical value of the repulsive HK interaction, thereby indicating
a first-order transition, 2) a tri-critical point emerges, thereby demarcating the boundary between
the standard second-order superconducting transition and the novel first-order regime, 3) Mottness
changes the sign of the quartic coefficient in the Landau-Ginzburg free-energy fuctional relative
to that in BCS, 4) as this obtains in the strongly interacting regime, it is Mott physics that underlies
the generic first-order transition, 5) the condensation energy exceeds that in BCS theory suggesting
that multiple Mott bands might be a way of enhancing superconducting, 6) the heat-capacity jump
is non-universal and increases with the Mott scale, 7) Mottness destroys the Hebel-Slichter peak
in NMR, and 8) Mottness enhances the fall-off of the ultrasonic attenuation at the pairing temperature
$T_p$. As several of these properties are observed in the cuprates, our analysis here points a way
forward in computing superconducting properties of strongly correlated electron matter.

Quasi-normal mode (QNM) modeling is an invaluable tool for characterizing remnant black holes,
studying strong gravity, and testing GR. Only recently have QNM studies begun to focus on multimode
fitting to numerical relativity (NR) strain waveforms. As GW observatories become even more sensitive
they will be able to resolve higher-order modes. Consequently, multimode QNM fits will be critically
important, and in turn require a more thorough treatment of the asymptotic frame at $\mathscr{I}^+$.
The first main result of this work is a method for systematically fitting a QNM model containing many
modes to a numerical waveform produced using Cauchy-characteristic extraction (CCE), an extraction
technique which is known to resolve memory effects. We choose the modes to model based on their power
contribution to the residual between numerical and model waveforms. We show that the all-mode strain
mismatch improves by a factor of $\sim10^5$ when using multimode fitting as opposed to only fitting
the $(2,\pm2,n)$ modes. Our most significant result addresses a critical point that has been overlooked
in the QNM literature: the importance of matching the Bondi-van der Burg-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) frame
of the numerical waveform to that of the QNM model. We show that by mapping the numerical waveforms$-$which
exhibit the memory effect$-$to a BMS frame known as the super rest frame, there is an improvement
of $\sim10^5$ in the all-mode strain mismatch compared to using a strain waveform whose BMS frame
is not fixed. Furthermore, we find that by mapping CCE waveforms to the super rest frame, we can obtain
all-mode mismatches that are, on average, a factor of $\sim4$ better than using the publicly-available
extrapolated waveforms. We illustrate the effectiveness of these modeling enhancements by applying
them to families of waveforms produced by NR and comparing our results to previous QNM studies.

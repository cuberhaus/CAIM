In our previous work, a novel idea that the NUT charge can be thought of as a thermodynamical multi-hair
has been advocated to describe perfectly the thermodynamical character of the generic four-dimensional
Taub-NUT spacetimes. According to this scheme, the Komar mass M, the gravito-magnetic charge and/or
the dual (magnetic) mass N, together with a new secondary hair J_N=MN, namely, a Kerr-like conserved
angular momentum, enter into the standard forms of the first law and Bekenstein-Smarr mass formula.
Distinguished from other recent attempts, our consistent thermodynamic differential and integral
mass formulae are both obtainable from a meaningful Christodoulou-Ruffini-type squared mass
formula of almost all of the four-dimensional NUT-charged spacetimes. As an excellent consequence,
the famous Bekenstein-Hawking one-quarter area-entropy relation can be naturally restored not
only in the Lorentzian sector and but also in the Euclidian counterpart of the generic Taub-NUT-type
spacetimes without imposing any constraint condition. However, only purely electric-charged
cases in the four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell gravity theory with a NUT charge have been addressed
there. In this paper, we shall follow the simple, systematic way proposed in that article to further
investigate the dyonic NUT-charged case. It is shown that the standard thermodynamic relations
continue to hold true provided that no new secondary charge is added, however, the so-obtained electrostatic
and magneto-static potentials are not coincident with those computed via the standard method.
To rectify this inconsistence, a simple strategy is provided by further introducing two additional
secondary hairs: Q_N=QN and P_N=PN, together with their thermodynamical conjugate potentials,
so that the first law and Bekenstein-Smarr mass formula are still satisfied.

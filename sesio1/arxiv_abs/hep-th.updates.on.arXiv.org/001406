We study real-time local correlators $\langle\mathcal{O}(\mathbf{x},t)\mathcal{O}(0,0)\rangle$
in chaotic quantum many-body systems. These correlators show universal structure at late times,
determined by the dominant operator-space Feynman trajectories for the evolving operator $\mathcal{O}(\mathbf{x},t)$.
The relevant trajectories involve the operator contracting to a point at both the initial and final
time and so are structurally different from those dominating the out-of-time-order correlator.
In the absence of conservation laws, correlations decay exponentially: $\langle\mathcal{O}(\mathbf{x},t)\mathcal{O}(0,0)\rangle\sim\exp(-s_\mathrm{eq}
r(\mathbf{v}) t)$, where $\mathbf{v}= \mathbf{x}/ t$ defines a spacetime ray, and $r(\mathbf{v})$
is an associated decay rate. We express $r(\mathbf{v})$ in terms of cost functions for various spacetime
structures. In 1+1D, operator histories can show a phase transition at a critical ray velocity $v_c$,
where $r(\mathbf{v})$ is nonanalytic. At low $v$, the dominant Feynman histories are "fat": the
operator grows to a size of order $t^\alpha\gg 1$ before contracting to a point again. At high $v$
the trajectories are "thin": the operator always remains of order-one size. In a Haar-random unitary
circuit, this transition maps to a simple binding transition for a pair of random walks (the two spatial
boundaries of the operator). In higher dimensions, thin trajectories always dominate. We discuss
ways to extract the butterfly velocity $v_B$ from the time-ordered correlator, rather than the
OTOC. Correlators in the random circuit may alternatively be computed with an effective Ising-like
model: a special feature of the Ising weights for the Haar brickwork circuit gives $v_c=v_B$. This
work addresses lattice models, but also suggests the possibility of morphological phase transitions
for real-time Feynman diagrams in quantum field theories.

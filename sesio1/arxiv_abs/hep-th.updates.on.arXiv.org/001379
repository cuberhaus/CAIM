In this work we study the effects on relevant observational parameters of an inflationary universe
from a chaotic potential with a step. We evolve numerically the perturbations equations within
both cold and warm inflation. On the one hand, in a cold inflation scenario we analyse the scalar power
spectrum $P_{\mathcal{R}}$ in terms of the number of e-folds $N_{e}$, and in terms of the ratio $k/k_{0}$,
where $k_{0}$ is our pivot scale. We show how $P_{\mathcal{R}}$ oscillates around $0.2< k/k_{0}
< 20$. Also, we present the evolution of two relevant parameters: the scalar spectral index $n_{s}$
and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. Actually, more than one region of $(n_{s},r)$ lies within the
observable window (Planck 2018). On the other hand, in the warm inflationary instance we present
two examples, both related to previous samples. We examine the evolution of the scalar power spectrum
in terms of $N_{e}$, where it can be observed a growth of its amplitude with respect to bigger $k/k_{0}$.
This result might imply that a warm step potential enhances the evolution of $P_{\mathcal{R}}$
at larger fluctuation scales. Finally, one key aspect of this research was to contrast the features
of an inflationary potential between both paradigms; and in fact they show similarities and differences
among various cases. One remarkable upshot in both scenarios is that certain fluctuation scales
are not longer "freeze in" on super-horizon scales. Thus, this outcome might suggest that purely
adiabatic primordial density perturbations no longer holds at the time of the step. Nonetheless,
a deeper study is needed to assure that entropy production is indeed happening at super-horizon
scales. And on the other hand, warm inflation could function as a screening mechanism capable of
smoothing the feature of the inflationary potential.

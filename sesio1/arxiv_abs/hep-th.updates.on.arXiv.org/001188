This thesis concerns the dynamics and integrability of the Rajeev-Ranken (RR) model, a mechanical
system with 3 degrees of freedom describing screw-type nonlinear wave solutions of a scalar field
theory dual to the 1+1D SU(2) Principal Chiral Model. This field theory is strongly coupled in the
UV and could serve as a toy model to study nonperturbative features of theories with a perturbative
Landau pole. We begin with a Lagrangian and a pair of Hamiltonian formulations based on compatible
degenerate nilpotent and Euclidean Poisson brackets. Darboux coordinates, Lax pairs and classical
r-matrices are found. Casimirs are used to identify the symplectic leaves on which a complete set
of independent conserved quantities in involution are found, establishing Liouville integrability.
Solutions are expressible in terms of elliptic functions and their stability is analyzed. The model
is compared and contrasted with those of Neumann and Kirchhoff. Common level sets of conserved quantities
are generically 2-tori, though horn tori, circles and points also arise. On the latter, conserved
quantities develop relations and solutions degenerate from elliptic to hyperbolic, circular
and constant functions. The common level sets are classified using the nature of roots of a cubic
polynomial. We also discover a family of action-angle variables that are valid away from horn tori.
On the latter, the dynamics is expressed as a gradient flow. In Darboux coordinates, the model is
reinterpreted as an axisymmetric quartic oscillator. It is quantized and variables are separated
in the Hamilton-Jacobi and Schrodinger equations. Analytic properties and weak and strong coupling
limits of the radial equation are studied. It is shown to reduce to a generalization of the Lame equation.
Finally, we use this quantization to find an infinite-dimensional unitary representation of the
above nilpotent Lie algebra.

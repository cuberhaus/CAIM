The r\^ole of string loop corrections on the existence of de Sitter vacua and the moduli stabilization
problem is examined in the framework of type IIB effective models. The fundamental building blocks
of the proposed model are a geometric configuration with a minimum of three intersecting D7 brane
stacks and an equal number of K\"ahler moduli, as well as a novel Einstein-Hilbert term associated
with higher derivative terms of the 10-dimensional effective action. It was shown in previous works
that, within this context, loop corrections appear which induce novel logarithmic volume-dependent
terms in the effective potential. Furthermore, when D-term contributions (associated with the
universal abelian factors of the D7 brane stacks) are considered, and certain bounds on the parameter
space are imposed, all K\"ahler moduli are stabilized and de Sitter vacua are supported. In the present
work, extending the previous analysis, a comprehensive study of the additional effects of multiple
non-perturbative terms in the superpotential is undertaken. In particular, the combined effects
of the logarithmic loop corrections and two non-perturbative terms with exponential dependence
on different K\"ahler moduli have been investigated in various compactification limits. The implications
of a nilpotent field are also discussed. Due to the complicated form of effective potential, various
approximations are employed to probe different regions of the parameter space. In the large volume
limit, a generic simple form of the potential is achieved. It is shown that a variety of fluxes exist
for large as well as moderate volume compactifications which are capable of defining a de Sitter
space and stabilizing the moduli fields. Finally, the so obtained effective potential appears
to be promising for cosmological applications.

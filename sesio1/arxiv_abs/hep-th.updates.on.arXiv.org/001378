Root bundles appear prominently in studies of vector-like spectra of 4d F-theory compactifications.
Of particular importance to phenomenology are the Quadrillion F-theory Standard Models (F-theory
QSMs). In this work, we identify $\mathcal{O}(10^{11})$ F-theory QSM geometries without vector-like
exotics in the representations $(\mathbf{3}, \mathbf{2})_{1/6}$, $(\mathbf{\bar{3}}, \mathbf{1})_{-2/3}$
and $(\mathbf{1}, \mathbf{1})_{1}$. The QSM geometries come in families of toric 3-folds $B_3(
\Delta^\circ )$ obtained from triangulations of certain 3-dimensional polytopes $\Delta^\circ$.
The matter curves in $X_\Sigma \in B_3( \Delta^\circ )$ can be deformed to nodal curves which are
the same for all spaces in $B_3( \Delta^\circ )$. Therefore, one can probe the vector-like spectra
on the entire family $B_3( \Delta^\circ )$ from studies of five nodal curves. For the family $B_3(
\Delta_4^\circ )$, consisting of $\mathcal{O}(10^{11})$ 3-folds, we argue that all limit root
bundles on the nodal curves $C_{(\mathbf{3}, \mathbf{2})_{1/6}}^\bullet$, $C_{(\mathbf{\bar{3}},
\mathbf{1})_{-2/3}}^\bullet$ and $C_{(\mathbf{1}, \mathbf{1})_{1}}^\bullet$ have exactly
three sections. This rules out vector-like exotics. We compute the cohomologies of all limit roots
on selected nodal curves. In our applications, for the majority of limit roots this requires line
bundle cohomology on rational tree-like curves. For this, we present a computer algorithm. The
remaining limit roots, corresponding to circuit-like graphs, are handled by hand. The cohomologies
are independent of the relative position of the nodes, except for a few circuits. On these \emph{jumping
circuits}, jumps happen if the nodes are specially aligned. This mirrors classical Brill-Noether
jumps. $B_3(\Delta_4^\circ)$ admits one jumping circuit. We derive explicit conditions which
guarantee the absence of vector-like exotics.

We study the mechanism of topological mass-generation for 3d Chern-Simons (CS) gauge theories,
where the CS term can retain the gauge symmetry and make gauge boson topologically massive. Without
CS term the 3d massless gauge boson has a single physical transverse polarization state, while adding
the CS term converts it into a massive physical polarization state and conserves the total physical
degrees of freedom. We newly formulate the mechanism of topological mass-generation at $S$-matrix
level. For this, we propose and prove a new Topological Equivalence Theorem (TET) which connects
the $N$-point scattering amplitude of the gauge boson's physical polarization states ($A^a_{\rm{P}}$)
to that of the transverse polarization states ($A^a_{\rm{T}}$) under high energy expansion. We
present a general 3d power counting method on the leading energy dependence of $N$-point scattering
amplitudes in both topologically massive Yang-Mills (TMYM) and topologically massive gravity
(TMG) theories. With these, we uncover a general energy cancellation mechanism for $N$-gauge boson
scattering amplitudes which predicts the cancellation $E^4 \to E^{4-N}$ at tree level. Then, we
compute the four-point amplitudes of $A^a_{\rm{P}}$'s and of $A^a_{\rm{T}}$'s, with which we
explicitly demonstrate the TET and establish such energy cancellations. We further extend the
double-copy approach and construct the four-point massive graviton amplitude of the TMG theory
from the massive gauge boson amplitude of the TMYM theory. With these, we newly uncover striking
large energy cancellations $E^{12}\to E^1$ in the four-graviton amplitude of the TMG, and establish
its new correspondence to the leading energy cancellations $E^4 \to E^0$ in the four-gauge boson
amplitude of the TMYM.

We follow a new pathway to the definition of the Stochastic Quantization (SQ), first proposed by
Parisi and Wu, of the action functional yielding the Einstein equations. Hinging on the functional
similarities between the Ricci-Flow equation and the SQ Langevin equations, we push forward a novel
approach in which the stochastic time converges to the proper time of a space-like foliation in the
equilibrium limit. This procedure in turn requires adding to the usual symmetric connection a projective
Weyl term that does not modify the classical equations of motion. Furthermore, we express the starting
system of equations using the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) variables and their conjugated Hamiltonian
momenta. Such a choice is instrumental for understanding the newly derived equations in terms of
the breaking the diffeomorphism invariance of the classical theory, which will hold on average
at the steady state. We comment on the physical interpretation of the Ricci flow equations, and argue
how they can naturally provide, in a geometrical way, the renormalization group equation for gravity
theories. In the general setting, the equation associated to the shift vector yields the Navier-Stokes
equation with a stochastic source. Moreover, we show that the fluctuations of the metric tensor
components around the equilibrium configurations, far away from the horizon of a Schwarzschild
black hole, are forced by the Ricci flow to follow the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation, whose probabilistic
distribution can yield an intermittent statistics. We finally comment on the possible applications
of this novel scenario to the cosmological constant, arguing that the Ricci flow may provide a solution
to the Hubble tension, as a macroscopic effect of the quantum fluctuation of the metric tensor.

In the present work, we examine the following points in the context of the recently proposed curvature
coupling helical magnetogenesis scenario \cite{Bamba:2021wyx} -- (1) whether the model is consistent
with the predictions of perturbative quantum field theory (QFT), and (2) whether the curvature
perturbation induced by the generated electromagnetic (EM) field during inflation is consistent
with the Planck data. Such requirements are well motivated in order to argue the viability of the
magnetogenesis model under consideration. Actually, the magnetogenesis scenario proposed in
\cite{Bamba:2021wyx} seems to predict sufficient magnetic strength over the large scales and
also leads to the correct baryon asymmetry of the universe for a suitable range of the model parameter.
However in the realm of inflationary magnetogenesis, these requirements are not enough to argue
the viability of the model, particularly one needs to examine some more important requirements
in this regard. We may recall that the calculations generally used to determine the magnetic field's
power spectrum are based on the perturbative QFT -- therefore it is important to examine whether
the predictions of such perturbative QFT are consistent with the observational bounds of the model
parameter. On other hand, the generated gauge field acts as a source of the curvature perturbation
which needs to be suppressed compared to that of contributed from the inflaton field in order to be
consistent with the Planck observation. These set our motivation. Interestingly, both the aforementioned
requirements in the context of the curvature coupling helical magnetogenesis scenario are found
to be simultaneously satisfied by that range of the model parameter which leads to the correct magnetic
strength over the large scale modes.

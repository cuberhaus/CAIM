Axion inflation coupled to the Standard Model (SM) hypercharge gauge sector represents an attractive
scenario for the generation of primordial hypermagnetic fields. The description of this scenario
is, however, complicated by the Schwinger effect, which gives rise to highly nonlinear dynamics.
Hypermagnetogenesis during axion inflation in the absence of nonlinear effects is well studied
and known to result in a hypermagnetic energy density that scales like $H^4\,e^{2\pi\xi}/\xi^5$,
where $\xi$ is proportional to the time derivative of the axion-vector coupling in units of the Hubble
rate $H$. In this paper, we generalize this result to the full SM case by consistently taking into
account the Schwinger pair production of all SM fermions. To this end, we employ the novel gradient-expansion
formalism that we recently developed in [2109.01651], and which is based on a set of vacuum expectation
values for bilinear hyperelectromagnetic functions in position space. We parametrize the numerical
output of our formalism in terms of three parameters ($\xi$, $H$, and $\Delta$, where the latter
accounts for the damping of subhorizon gauge-field modes because of the finite conductivity of
the medium) and work out semianalytical fit functions that describe our numerical results with
high accuracy. Finally, we validate our results by comparing them to existing estimates in the literature
as well as to the explicit numerical results in a specific inflationary model, which leads to good
overall agreement. We conclude that the systematic uncertainties in the description of hypermagnetogenesis
during axion inflation, which previously spanned up to several orders of magnitude, are now reduced
to typically less than 1 order of magnitude, which paves the way for further phenomenological studies.

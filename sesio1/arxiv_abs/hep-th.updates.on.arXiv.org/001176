Infectious diseases are a threat for human health with tremendous impact on our society at large.
The recent COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2, is the latest example of a highly infectious
disease ravaging the world, since late 2019. It is therefore imperative to develop efficient mathematical
models, able to substantially curb the damages of a pandemic by unveiling disease spreading dynamics
and symmetries. This will help inform (non)-pharmaceutical prevention strategies. For the reasons
above we wrote this report that goes at the heart of mathematical modelling of infectious disease
diffusion by simultaneously investigating the underlying microscopic dynamics in terms of percolation
models, effective description via compartmental models and the employment of temporal symmetries
naturally encoded in the mathematical language of critical phenomena. Our report reviews these
approaches and determines their common denominators, relevant for theoretical epidemiology
and its link to important concepts in theoretical physics. We show that the different frameworks
exhibit common features such as criticality and self-similarity under time rescaling. These features
are naturally encoded within the unifying field theoretical approach. The latter leads to an efficient
description of the time evolution of the disease via a framework in which (near) time-dilation invariance
is explicitly realised. As important test of the relevance of symmetries we show how to mathematically
account for observed phenomena such as multi-wave dynamics. The models presented here are of immediate
relevance for different realms of scientific enquiry from medical applications to the understanding
of human behaviour. Our review offers novel perspectives on how to model, capture, organise and
understand epidemiological data and disease dynamics for modelling real-world phenomena.

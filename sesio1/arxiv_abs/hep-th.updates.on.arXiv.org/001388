It is well-known that the Clifford algebra Cl(2n) can be given a description in terms of creation/annihilation
operators acting in the space of inhomogeneous differential forms on C^n. We refer to such inhomogeneous
differential forms as polyforms. The construction proceeds by choosing a complex structure J on
R^(2n). Spinors are then polyforms on one of the two totally-isotropic subspaces C^n that arise
as eigenspaces of J. There is a similar description in the split signature case Cl(n,n), with differential
forms now being those on R^n. In this case the model is constructed by choosing a paracomplex structure
I on R^(n,n), and spinors are polyforms on one of the totally null eigenspaces R^n of I. The main purpose
of the paper is to describe the geometry of an analogous construction in the case of a general Clifford
algebra Cl(r,s), r+s=2m. We show that in general a creation/annihilation operator model is in correspondence
with a new type of geometric structure on R^(r,s), which provides a splitting R^(r,s)=R^(2k,2l)
plus R^(n,n) and endows the first factor with a complex structure and the second factor with a paracomplex
structure. We refer to such geometric structure as a mixed structure. It can be described as a complex
linear combination K=I+i J of a paracomplex and a complex structure such that K^2=Id and K K^* is a
product structure. In turn, the mixed structure is in correspondence with a pair of pure spinors
whose null subspaces are the eigenspaces of K. The conclusion is then that there is in general not
one, but several possible creation/annihilation operator models for a given Clifford algebra.
The number of models is the number of different types of pure spinors (distinguished by the real index,
see the main text) that exists in a given signature. To illustrate this geometry, we explicitly describe
all the arising models for Cl(r,s) with r >= s, r+s = 2m <= 6.

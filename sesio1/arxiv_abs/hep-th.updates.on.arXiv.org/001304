Parity-violating extensions of Maxwell electromagnetism induce a rotation of the linear polarization
plane of photons during propagation. This effect, known as cosmic birefringence, impacts on the
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations producing a mixing of $E$ and $B$ polarization
modes which is otherwise null in the standard scenario. Such an effect is naturally parametrized
by a rotation angle which can be written as the sum of an isotropic component $\alpha_0$ and an anisotropic
one $\delta\alpha(\hat{\mathbf{n}})$. In this paper we compute angular power spectra and bispectra
involving $\delta\alpha$ and the CMB temperature and polarization maps. In particular, contrarily
to what happens for the cross-spectra, we show that even in absence of primordial cross-correlations
between the anisotropic birefringence angle and the CMB maps, there exist non-vanishing three-point
correlation functions carrying signatures of parity-breaking physics. Furthermore, we find
that such angular bispectra still survive in a regime of purely anisotropic cosmic birefringence,
which corresponds to the conservative case of having $\alpha_0=0$. These bispectra represent
an additional observable aimed at studying cosmic birefringence and its parity-violating nature
beyond power spectrum analyses. They provide also a way to perform consistency checks for specific
models of cosmic birefringence. Moreover, we estimate that among all the possible birefringent
bispectra, $\langle\delta\alpha\, TB\rangle$ and $\langle\delta\alpha\,EB\rangle$ are the
ones which contain the largest signal-to-noise ratio. Once the cosmic birefringence signal is
taken to be at the level of current constraints, we show that these bispectra are within reach of future
CMB experiments, as LiteBIRD.

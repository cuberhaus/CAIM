We continue the study of Confined Vortex Surfaces (\CVS{}) that we introduced in the previous paper.
We classify exact solutions of the \CVS{} equation and find finite closed loops in the cross-section
of the cylindrical tube. We find the corresponding velocity field inside and outside the tube as
a parametric equation involving hypergeometric functions. We use the dilute gas approximation
for the vorticity structures in a turbulent flow, assuming their size is much smaller than the mean
distance between them. We introduce the Gaussian random background strain for each vortex surface
as an accumulation of a large number of small random contributions coming from other surfaces far
away. We compute this self-consistent background strain, relating the variance of the strain to
the energy dissipation rate. This random matrix theory applied to the cylindrical solution leads
to a universal asymmetric distribution for the tube cross-section at fixed energy dissipation.
The fluctuations of the tube size naturally lead to something similar to multifractal scaling of
the moments of velocity difference $v(\vec r_1) - \vec v(\vec r_2)$. More precisely, these moments
have a nontrivial dependence of $n, \log |r_1 - r_2|$, which one can approximate as a power law with
nonlinear index $\zeta(n)$. We argue that the approximate relations for these moments suggested
in a recent paper by Sreenivasan and Yakhot are consistent with the \CVS{} theory. We reinterpret
their renormalization parameter $\alpha\approx 0.95$ in the Bernoulli law $ p = - \frac{1}{2}\alpha
\vec v^2$ as a probability to find no vortex surface at a random point in space. Numerical computation
of multidimensional integrals involved in our formulas for velocity moments and comparison with
the DNS we leave for future study.

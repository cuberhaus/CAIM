In celestial holography, four-dimensional scattering amplitudes are considered as two-dimensional
conformal correlators of a putative two-dimensional celestial conformal field theory (CCFT).
The simplest way of converting momentum space amplitudes into CCFT correlators is by taking their
Mellin transforms with respect to light-cone energies. For massless particles, like gluons, however,
such a construction leads to three-point and four-point correlators that vanish everywhere except
for a measure zero hypersurface of celestial coordinates. This is due to the four-dimensional momentum
conservation law that constrains the insertion points of the operators associated with massless
particles. These correlators are reminiscent of Coulomb gas correlators that, in the absence of
background charges, vanish due to charge conservation. We supply the background momentum by coupling
Yang-Mills theory to a background dilaton field, with the (complex) dilaton source localized on
the celestial sphere. This picture emerges from the physical interpretation of the solutions of
the system of differential equations discovered by Banerjee and Ghosh. We show that the solutions
can be written as Mellin transforms of the amplitudes evaluated in such a dilaton background. The
resultant three-gluon and four-gluon amplitudes are single-valued functions of celestial coordinates
enjoying crossing symmetry and all other properties expected from standard CFT correlators. We
use them to extract OPEs and compare them with the OPEs extracted from multi-gluon celestial amplitudes
without a dilaton background. We perform the conformal block decomposition of the four-gluon single-valued
correlator and determine the dimensions, spin and group representations of the entire primary
field spectrum of the Yang-Mills sector of CCFT.

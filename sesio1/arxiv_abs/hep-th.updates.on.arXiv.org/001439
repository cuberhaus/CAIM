Supergravity, a locally supersymmetric gauge theory, may provide to describe new physics beyond
the Standard Model (BSM). In this sense, cosmological applications of supergravity can be the arena
for probing outcomes of supergravity. It is also attractive that supergravity can appear as a low-energy
effective theory of superstrings, a possible candidate of quantum gravity. Nevertheless, it is
not trivial to build inflationary models in supergravity due to difficulties arising mainly from
the extremely constrained form of supergravity scalar potentials, complicated structure of interaction
terms, and excessive scalar degrees of freedom. These obstructions generally make it challenging
to contrive a desirable inflationary trajectory, perform the moduli stabilization to obtain the
stable de-Sitter phase, and make extra scalars to be much heavier than the Hubble scale to get single
field inflation. Besides, supergravity predicts many non-renormalizable interactions. It thus
arises as effective field theory (EFT) which can be valid only up to typical energies $E$ below its
ultraviolet cutoff scale $\Lambda_{cut}$, and up to some accuracy of $(E/\Lambda_{cut})^n$ that
we desire. We note that these non-renormalizable terms may affect physics during and/or after inflation.
From such points of view, it is very important in supergravity to find the method for relaxing the
scalar potentials, and flexible scalar field dynamics (particularly for inflaton), and examine
self-consistency at the quantum level. In this thesis, therefore, we construct locally supersymmetric
effective field theories of inflation (with KKLT string background) by taking into account recently-proposed
reformulations of $\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravity that can enlarge the space of scalar potentials.

We present a short account of our work to provide quantum electrodynamics with a 'product picture'.
It aims to complement the longer exposition in a recent paper in 'Foundations of Physics' and to help
to make that work more accessible. The product picture is a formulation of QED, equivalent to standard
Coulomb gauge QED, but in which the Hilbert space arises as a product of a Hilbert space for the electromagnetic
field and a Hilbert space for charged matter (i.e. the Dirac field) and in which the Hamiltonian arises
as the sum of an electromagnetic Hamiltonian and a charged matter Hamiltonian and an interaction
term. (The Coulomb gauge formulation of QED is not a product picture because, in it, the longitudinal
part of the electromagnetic field is made out of charged matter operators.) We also recall a 'Contradictory
Commutator Theorem' for QED which exposes flaws in previous attempts at temporal gauge quantization
of QED and we explain how our product picture appears to offer a way to overcome those flaws. Additionally,
we present here a new generalization of that no-go theorem to Yang-Mills fields. We also develop
a product picture for nonrelativistic charged particles in interaction with the electromagnetic
field and point out how this leads to a novel way of thinking about the theory of many nonrelativistic
electrically charged particles with Coulomb interactions. In an afterword, we explain how the
provision of a product picture for QED gives hope that one will be able likewise to have a product picture
for (Yang Mills and for) quantum gravity -- the latter being needed to make sense of the author's 'matter-gravity
entanglement hypothesis'. Also, we briefly discuss some similarities and differences between
that hypothesis and its predictions and ideas of Roger Penrose related to a possible role of gravity
in quantum state reduction and related to cosmological entropy.

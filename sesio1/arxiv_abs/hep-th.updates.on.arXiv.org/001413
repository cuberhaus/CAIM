We construct several models to describe the scenario where two eternal black holes are entangled
by exchanging radiations. The increasing entanglement between two black holes is reflected in
the emergence of a wormhole phase, which could be considered as an incarnation of $ER=EPR$ conjecture.
In double holography, we compute the entanglement entropy and mutual information among of various
partitions and obtain the phase structure of the entanglement. We find that two black holes can be
entangled as long as they are not far apart; in general, the formation of a wormhole needs to overcome
the distance between two black holes, and unitarity is preserved by either the formation of a wormhole
or the emergence of islands. When the sizes of two black holes are not equal, we observe a loss of entanglement
between the smaller black hole and the radiation at late times. On the field theory side, we consider
a coupled SYK model at finite $N$, where two SYK models are applied as two black holes and a Majorana
chain connecting them resembles the radiation region. We explicitly compute the entanglement
among subsystems, and obtain the similar phase structure. In general, a time delay of entanglement
between two SYK sites is found in cases with longer Majorana chains. In particular, when two SYK sites
are different in size, similar entanglement loss between the smaller SYK cluster and the radiation
region are observed. To have a more intuitive understanding on the evolution of the entanglement,
we further investigate a chain model composed of EPR clusters where exchanging particles are only
allowed between neighbouring clusters. In this model, the outermost clusters serve as two black
holes, and all inner clusters serve as the radiation. Despite the drastic simplification, the main
features observed in previous models persist.

In a recent paper, Raju showed that the essential features of the monogamy paradox for old flat space
black holes could be modeled using a setup in empty AdS, leading to a violation in the monogamy of entanglement
there. A physically interesting question is whether such a violation in the monogamy of entanglement
can be posed in empty flat space. The answer is not immediately clear since flat space gravity has
an entirely different vacuum and infrared structure than the gapped and unique AdS vacuum, which
was exploited in Raju's toy model. We answer this question in the affirmative, with an explicit construction.
We formulate the paradox in terms of monogamy of CHSH correlations, which we use to quantify the monogamy
of entanglement. Extending Raju's analysis to empty flat space, within effective field theory,
we show that the entanglement of approximately local bulk modes just outside a light cone with modes
just inside the light cone as well as with modes situated far away at the past of future null infinity
gives rise to an O($1$) violation in the monogamy of entanglement. This cannot be resolved by small
corrections of O($\sqrt{G_N}$). The issues arising from the above-mentioned vacuum and infrared
features unique to flat spacetime are dealt with by introducing a physically motivated boundary
projector onto states below a given infrared cutoff, which allows us to construct suitable operators
at the past of future null infinity that give rise to the violation. We argue that the resolution of
the paradox is that our spatially separated observables probe the same underlying degrees of freedom,
i.e., such observables act on a non-factorized Hilbert space arising from the Gauss constraint,
thereby circumventing the conflict with monogamy of entanglement.

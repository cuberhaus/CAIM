For the 4d Standard Model (SM) with Lie group $G_{{\rm SM}_q} \equiv$ SU(3)$\times$SU(2)$\times$U(1)$_{\tilde
Y}/\mathbb{Z}_q$ of $q=1,2,3,6$ with $N_f$ family of 15 or 16 Weyl fermions, in addition to the continuous
baryon minus lepton U(1)$_{\bf B - L}$ symmetry, there is also a compatible discrete baryon plus
lepton $\mathbb{Z}_{2N_f, \bf B + L}$ symmetry. The $\mathbb{Z}_{2N_f, \bf B + L}$ is discrete due
to the ABJ anomaly under the BPST SU(2) instanton. Although both U(1)$_{\bf B - L}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{2N_f,
\bf B + L}$ symmetries are anomaly-free under the dynamically gauged $G_{{\rm SM}_q}$, it is important
to check whether they have mixed anomalies with the gravitational background field (spacetime
diffeomorphism under Spin group rotation) and higher symmetries (whose charged objects are Wilson
electric or 't Hooft magnetic line operators) of SM. We can also replace the U(1)$_{\bf B - L}$ with
a discrete variant $\mathbb{Z}_{4,X}$ for $X \equiv 5({\bf B - L})-\frac{2}{3} {\tilde Y}$ of electroweak
hypercharge ${\tilde Y}$. We explore a systematic classification of candidate perturbative local
and nonperturbative global anomalies of the 4d SM, including all these gauge and gravitational
backgrounds, via a cobordism theory, which controls the SM's deformation class. We discuss the
proton stability of the SM and Ultra Unification in the presence of (U(1)$_{\bf B - L} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2N_f,\bf
B + L})/{\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm F}}$ or $(\mathbb{Z}_{4,X} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2N_f, \bf B + L})/{\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm
F}}$ symmetry protection with the fermion parity $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm F}$. While many Grand Unified
Theories violating the discrete $\bf B + L$ symmetry suffer from the proton decay, the SM and some
versions of Ultra Unification can have a stable proton.

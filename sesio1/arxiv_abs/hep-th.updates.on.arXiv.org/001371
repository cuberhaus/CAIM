We generalize the Thomas-Fermi approach to galaxy structure to include self-consistently and
non-linearly central supermassive black holes. This approach naturally incorporates the quantum
pressure of the warm dark matter (WDM) particles and shows its full powerful and clearness in the
presence of supermassive black holes (SPMHs). We find the main galaxy and central black hole magnitudes:
halo radius r_h , halo mass M_h, black hole mass M_BH, velocity dispersion, phase space density,
with their realistic astrophysical values, masses and sizes over a wide galaxy range. The SMBH masses
arise naturally in this framework. Our extensive numerical calculations and detailed analytic
resolution show that with SMBH's, both WDM regimes: classical (Boltzmann dilute) and quantum (compact)
do necessarily co-exist in any galaxy: from the smaller and compact galaxies to the largest ones.
The transition from the quantum to the classical region occurs precisely at the same point r_A where
the chemical potential vanishes. A novel halo structure with three regions shows up: A small quantum
compact core of radius r_A around the SMBH, followed by a less compact region till the BH influence
radius r_i, and then for r> r_i the known halo galaxy shows up with its astrophysical size. Three representative
families of galaxy plus central SMBH solutions are found and analyzed:small, medium and large galaxies
having SMBH masses of 10^5, 10^7 and 10^9 M_sun respectively. A minimum galaxy size and mass ~ 10^7
M_sun larger than the one without SMBH is found. Small galaxies in the range 10^4 M_sun < M_h < 10^7
M_sun cannot harbor central SMBHs. We find novel scaling M_BH - r_h - M_h relations. The galaxy equation
of state is derived: The pressure P(r) takes huge values in the SMBH vecinity and then sharply decreases
entering the classical region following a local perfect gas behaviour.(Abridged)

In this paper we have considered the thermodynamics of a Born-Infeld $AdS$ black hole using inputs
from the dual boundary field theory. Here, we have varied the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and
the Newton's gravitational constant $G$ along with the Born-Infeld parameter $b$ in the bulk. A
novel universal critical behaviour of the central charge (occurring in the boundary conformal
field theory) in extended black hole thermodynamics for charged black holes has been recently observed
\cite{Phys. Rev. Lett. 127 (2021) 091301}, and we have extended this study to Born-Infeld $AdS$
black holes. The Born-Infeld parameter has the dimension of inverse length, therefore, when considered
in the first law of thermodynamics of the bulk in the mixed form which includes the central charge
of the boundary conformal field theory, it modifies the thermodynamic volume and the chemical potential
(which are conjugate to pressure and central charge respectively). We observe that due to this inclusion
of the Born-Infeld non-linearity in this analysis, the universal nature of the critical value of
the central charge observed in \cite{Phys. Rev. Lett. 127 (2021) 091301} breaks down. We also observe
an interesting phase transition structure of the black hole due to the variations in both the central
charge and the Born-Infeld parameter. Apart from the small black hole to large black hole phase transition
behaviour, it also shows Hawking-Page phase transition. It is also observed in our analysis that
for a sufficiently small value of the Born-Infeld parameter (small value of this parameter has more
prominent non-linear effects), there exists a critical value of the temperature below which there
is only Hawking radiation in the system, which in turn implies a thermal $AdS$ spacetime.

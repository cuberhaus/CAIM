We propose a new mechanism that adapts to string theory a perturbative method for stabilizing moduli
without leaving the domain of perturbative control, thereby evading the `Dine-Seiberg' problem.
The only required nonperturbative information comes from the standard renormalization-group
resummation of leading logarithms that allow us simultaneously to work to a fixed order in the perturbative
parameter $\alpha$ and to all orders in $\alpha \ln\tau$ where $\tau$ is a large extra-dimensional
modulus. The resulting potential is naturally minimized for moduli of order $\tau\sim e^{1/\alpha}$
and so can be exponentially large given ${\cal O}(10)$ input parameters. The mechanism relies on
accidental low-energy scaling symmetries known to be generic and so is robust against UV details.
The resulting compactifications generically break supersymmetry and 4D de Sitter solutions are
relatively easy to achieve without additional uplifting. Variations on the theme lead to inflationary
scenarios for which the size of the stabilized moduli differ significantly before and after inflation
and so provide a dynamical mechanism whereby inflationary scales are much larger than late-time
physical ($e.g.$~supersymmetry breaking) scales, with this hierarchy contingent on past cosmic
evolution with the inflaton playing a secondary late-time role as a relaxation field. We apply this
formalism to warped $\hbox{D3}$-$\overline{\hbox{D3}}$ inflation using non-linearly realized
supersymmetry to describe the antibrane tension and the Coulomb interaction, and show how doing
so our perturbative modulus stabilization mechanism evades the $\eta$-problem that usually plagues
this scenario. We speculate about the relevance of our formalism to tachyon condensation at later
stages of brane-antibrane annihilation.

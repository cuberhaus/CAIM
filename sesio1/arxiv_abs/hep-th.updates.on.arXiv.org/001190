This dissertation represents work on three different subjects relating to quantum gravity and
the AdS/CFT correspondence. First, we review a holographic computation of the one-loop corrections
to the Weyl anomaly on Ricci flat backgrounds in six dimensions. This allows us to determine the correction
to one linear combination of the anomaly coefficients. Then, we will show that these corrections
may be obtained from the six-dimensional superconformal index. The second section covers consistent
truncations on the Lunin-Maldacena background. We show how to restore minimal supersymmetry to
this background by determining the reduction ansatz which includes the graviton and a gauge field
of 5d $\mathcal{N} = 2$ supergravity. We also discuss our previously unpublished attempt to construct
a truncation which includes a scalar field corresponding to the $\beta$-deformation parameter
of the dual field theory. We show that if such a solution exists, it must differ drastically from the
LM background. Finally, we discuss higher-derivative corrections to black hole solutions and
the weak gravity conjecture in a few settings. First we compute higher-derivative corrections
to the extremality bounds for black holes which are charged under an arbitrary number of $U(1)$ gauge
fields, and determine the constraints implied by the WGC. Next we consider the higher-derivative
corrections to thermodynamic quantities for charged black holes in Anti-de Sitter space. We confirm
and clarify a previously noted relationship between the shift to the extremality bound and the shift
to the Wald entropy. We also show that if the shift in the Wald entropy is assumed to be positive, then
the coefficient of the $R_{\mu \nu \rho \sigma} R^{\mu \nu \rho \sigma}$ term in the effective Lagrangian
must be positive as well.

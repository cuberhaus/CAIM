Light primordial black holes may comprise a dominant fraction of the dark matter in our Universe.
This paper critically assesses whether planned and future gravitational wave detectors in the
ultra-high-frequency band could constrain the fraction of dark matter composed of sub-solar primordial
black holes. Adopting the state-of-the-art description of primordial black hole merger rates,
we compare various signals with currently operating and planned detectors. As already noted in
the literature, our findings confirm that detecting individual primordial black hole mergers
with currently existing and operating proposals remains difficult. Current proposals involving
gravitational wave to electromagnetic wave conversion in a static magnetic field and microwave
cavities feature a technology gap with respect to the loudest gravitational wave signals from primordial
black holes of various orders of magnitude. However, we point out that one recent proposal involving
resonant LC circuits represents the best option in terms of individual merger detection prospects
in the range $(1\div 100) \, \text{MHz}$. In the same frequency range, we note that alternative setups
involving resonant cavities, whose concept is currently under development, might represent a
promising technology to detect individual merger events. We also show that a detection of the stochastic
gravitational wave background produced by unresolved binaries is possible only if the theoretical
sensitivity of the proposed Gaussian beam detector is achieved. Such a detector, whose feasibility
is subject to various caveats, may be able to rule-out some scenarios for asteroidal mass primordial
black hole dark matter. We conclude that pursuing dedicated studies and developments of gravitational
wave detectors in the ultra-high-frequency band remains motivated and may lead to novel probes
on the existence of light primordial black holes.

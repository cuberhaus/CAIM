Based on the fact that any massless free-field with spin higher than $\frac{1}{2}$ can be constructed
from scalar fields (spin-0) and Dirac-Weyl fields (spin-$\frac{1}{2}$), we introduce a map between
spin-$2$ massless free-fields (gravity fields) and spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ massless free-fields
(Dirac-Weyl fields) in spinor formalism. The associated Dirac-Weyl spinors can live in certain
spacetime are identified. Regarding them as basic units, other higher spin massless free-fields
are then constructed. In this way, some hidden fundamental features related to massless-free fields
are revealed. In particular, for type N vacuum spacetimes, we show that all higher spin massless
free-fields can be constructed by the same type of Dirac-Weyl spinors and an auxiliary scalar field,
which satisfies the wave equation not only on curved spacetime but also on Minkowski spacetime.
For type D vacuum spacetimes, we show that there exist similar relationships among different spin
massless free-fields. Furthermore, we systematically rebuild the Weyl double copy for non-twisting
type N vacuum spacetimes and type D vacuum spacetimes. We show that the zeroth copy not only connects
the gravity fields with a single copy but also connects those degenerate electromagnetic fields
with the Dirac-Weyl fields living in the curved spacetime, both for type N and type D cases. Afterward,
we extend the study to type III non-twisting vacuum solutions. Independent of the proposed map,
we find that there is a special Dirac-Weyl scalar whose square is just proportional to the Weyl scalar.
A degenerate Maxwell field and an auxiliary scalar field are then solved. Both of them play the similar
roles as the double copy. The result further confirms that there must exist a deep connection between
gravity theory and gauge theory.

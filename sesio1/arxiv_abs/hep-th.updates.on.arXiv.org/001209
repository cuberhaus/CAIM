Generating an effective theory of lower-dimensional gravity on a submanifold within an original
higher-dimensional theory can be achieved even if the reduction space is non-compact. Localisation
of gravity on such a lower-dimensional worldvolume can be interpreted in a number of ways. The first
scenario, Type I, requires a mathematically consistent Kaluza-Klein style truncation down to
a theory in the lower dimension, in which case solutions purely within that reduced theory exist.
However, that situation is not a genuine localisation of gravity because all such solutions have
higher-dimensional source extensions according to the Kaluza-Klein ansatz. Also, there is no
meaningful notion of Newton's constant for such Type I constructions. Types II and III admit coupling
to genuinely localised sources in the higher-dimensional theory, with corresponding solutions
involving full sets of higher-dimensional modes. Type II puts no specific boundary conditions
near the worldvolume aside from regularity away from sources. In a case where the wave equation separated
in the non-compact space transverse to the worldvolume admits a normalisable zero mode, the Type
III scenario requires boundary conditions near the worldvolume that permit the inclusion of that
zero mode in mode expansions for gravitational wave fluctuations or potentials. In such a case,
an effective theory of lower-dimensional gravity can emerge at sufficiently large worldvolume
distance scales. This taxonomy of brane gravity localisations is developed in detail for linearised
perturbations about a background incorporating the vacuum solution of Salam-Sezgin theory when
embedded into ten-dimensional supergravity with a hyperbolic non-compact transverse space.
Interpretations of the Newton constant for the corresponding Type III localisation are then analysed.

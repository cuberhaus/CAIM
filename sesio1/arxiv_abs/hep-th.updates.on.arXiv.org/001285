We demonstrate that the known expressions for the thermal partition function of large $N$ Chern-Simons
matter theories admit a simple Hilbert space interpretation as the partition function of an associated
ungauged large $N$ matter theory with one additional condition: the Fock space of this associated
theory is projected down to the subspace of its \emph{quantum} singlets i.e.~singlets under the
Gauss law for Chern-Simons gauge theory. Via the Chern-Simons / WZW correspondence, the space of
quantum singlets are equivalent to the space of WZW conformal blocks. One step in our demonstration
involves recasting the Verlinde formula for the dimension of the space of conformal blocks in $SU(N)_k$
and $U(N)_{k,k'}$ WZW theories into a simple and physically transparent form, which we also rederive
by evaluating the partition function and superconformal index of pure Chern-Simons theory in the
presence of Wilson lines. A particular consequence of the projection of the Fock space of Chern-Simons
matter theories to quantum (or WZW) singlets is the `Bosonic Exclusion Principle': the number of
bosons occupying any single particle state is bounded above by the Chern-Simons level. The quantum
singlet condition (unlike its Yang-Mills Gauss Law counterpart) has a nontrivial impact on thermodynamics
even in the infinite volume limit. In this limit the projected Fock space partition function reduces
to a product of partition functions, one for each single particle state. These single particle state
partition functions are $q$-deformations of their free boson and free fermion counterparts and
interpolate between these two special cases. We also propose a formula for the large $N$ partition
function that is valid for arbitrary finite volume of the spatial $S^2$ and not only at large volume.

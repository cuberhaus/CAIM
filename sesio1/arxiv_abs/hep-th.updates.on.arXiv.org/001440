We develop a new technique, based on a low-energy theorem (LET) of NSVZ type derived in arXiv:1701.07833,
for the nonperturbative investigation of SU(N) QCD with N${}_f$ massless quarks - or, more generally,
of massless QCD-like theories - in phases where the beta function, $\beta(g)$, with $g=g(\mu)$
the renormalized gauge coupling, admits an isolated zero, $g_*$, in the infrared (IR) or ultraviolet
(UV). We point out that the LET sets constraints on 3-point correlators involving the insertion
of $Tr\, F^2$, its anomalous dimension $\gamma_{F^2}$, and the anomalous dimensions of multiplicatively
renormalizable operators at $g_*$. These constraints intertwine with the exact conformal scaling
for $g(\mu)\rightarrow g_*$ with $\mu\neq 0,+\infty$ fixed and the IR/UV asymptotics - which may
or may not coincide with the IR/UV limit of the aforementioned conformal scaling - for $\Lambda_{\scriptscriptstyle{IR/UV}}$
fixed. In the conformal case we also discuss how the LET for bare correlators is the rationale for
the existence in massless QCD of the mysterious divergent contact term in the OPE of $Tr\,F^2$ with
itself discovered in perturbation theory in arXiv:1209.1516, arXiv:1407.6921 and computed to
all orders in arXiv:1601.08094. Specifically, if $\gamma_{F^2}$ does not vanish, the divergent
contact term in the rhs of the LET for the 2-point correlator of $Tr\,F^2$ has to match - and we verify
by direct computation that it actually does - the divergence in the lhs due to the nontrivial anomalous
dimension of $Tr\,F^2$. Hence, remarkably, the additive renormalization due to the divergent
contact term in the rhs is related by the LET to the multiplicative renormalization in the lhs, in
such a way that a suitably renormalized version of the LET has no ambiguity for additive renormalization.

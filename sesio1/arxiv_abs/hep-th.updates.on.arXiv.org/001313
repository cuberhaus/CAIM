There is great interest in the construction of brane worlds, where matter and gravity are forced
to be effective only in a lower dimensional surface , the brane . How these could appear as a consequence
of string theory is a crucial question and this has been widely discussed. Here we will examine a distinct
scenario that appears in dynamical tension theories and where string tension is positive between
two surfaces separated by a short distance and at the two surfaces themselves the string tensions
become infinite, therefore producing an effective confinement of the strings and therefore of
all matter and gravity to the space between these to surfaces, which is in fact a new type of stringy
brane world scenario. The basic formulation for obtaining this scenario consist of assuming two
types of strings characterized by a different constant of integration related to the spontaneous
string tension generation. These string tension multiplied by the embedding metric define conformally
related metrics that both satisfy Einsteins equation. The braneworlds appear very naturally when
these two metrics are both flat spaces related by a special conformal transformation. The two types
of string tensions are determined and they blow up at two close expanding surfaces. A puzzling aspect
appears then: the construction is based on flat spaces, but then there are also strings with very
large tension near the boundaries of the braneworld,so can the back reaction from the infinite tension
strings destroy the flat space background?. Fortunatelly that can be resolved using the mechanism
Universe creation from almost flat (or empty) spaces, which incorporates a gas of very large string
tensions in a membrane, studied before in 1+1 membranes in a 2+1 embedding space and now is generalized
for a 1+(D-2) membrane moving in a 1+(D-1) space.

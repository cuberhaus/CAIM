The dressed state formalisms, which incorporate interactions of soft particles into an asymptotic
state, are known as the prescriptions expected to solve the problem of infrared (IR) divergence
in the quantum field theory (QFT). A particularly famous example is the dressed state formalism
proposed by Kulish and Faddeev in quantum electrodynamics (QED). As pointed out by Hirai and Sugishita,
however, this formalism has problems in gauge invariance and the IR divergence. These problems
are mainly caused by the existence of ghosts or unphysical photon modes. Therefore, we start by studying
the asymptotic states in the Coulomb gauge, which excludes ghosts and/or unphysical photon modes.
In this paper, we propose a formalism to construct the asymptotic states directly from the interaction
of the theory by setting a sufficiently large time scale $T$. In this dressed state formalism, we
define the asymptotic interaction remaining at $|t|>T$ in terms of some fixed order of $1/T$, and
we are performing all calculations according to that order. We study the asymptotic states in QED
specifically, but we can formally apply the dressed state formalism proposed in this paper to any
perturbative QFT. We show that, at least in QED, we can construct divergence-free and unitary $S$-matrix
using dressed states proposed in this paper. Furthermore, we discuss the transition rate to show
that we can predict experimental results. We also show that the $\mathrm{U}(1)$ gauge symmetry
of $S$-matrix leads to the QED large gauge symmetry, and deviation of the expectation values of the
vector potential between initial and final spacelike hypersurfaces emerges as a QED memory effect.
The dressed state formalism in this paper may give a unified and new insight into IR physics, including
asymptotic symmetries, memory effects, and unitarity of the state evolution.

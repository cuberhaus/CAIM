In this thesis, we study interactions between topological defects in two-dimensional spacetimes.
These defects are called kinks. They are solutions of scalar field theories with localized energy
which propagate without losing its shape. In order to understand the resonance phenomenon exhibited
by those models, we built a toy model where the kink's vibrational mode turns into a quasinormal mode.
This causes the suppression of resonance windows and, consequently, its fractal structure is lost.
Considering a higher order polynomial as the scalar field potential, we find kinks with long-range
tails, which decay as a power law. We developed a numerical method to correctly initialize this systems
and applied it to a scalar field model containing kinks with long-range tails in both sides. After
the collision, the kink-antikink pair is annihilated for velocities below an ultra-relativistic
critical velocity without bion formation. We also investigated a collision between wobbling kinks
of the double sine-Gordon model. When the kinks are already wobbling before colliding, there appears
resonance windows with separation after a single bounce. On the second half of the thesis, we focused
on fermion-kink interactions. We studied what happens when a fermion binds to a wobbling kink. The
result is that the fermion escapes from the kink as radiation and at a constant rate. This occurs if
the energy gap between the initial state and the continuum threshold is not too large. Lastly, we
investigated the interaction of a fermion with a background scalar field with an impurity that preserves
half of the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) property. We found an adiabatic evolution near
the BPS regime, which means that the system is at a static BPS solution at every moment.

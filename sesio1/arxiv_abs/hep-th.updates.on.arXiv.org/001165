We describe in more detail the general relation uncovered in our previous work between boundary
correlators in de Sitter (dS) and in Euclidean anti-de Sitter (EAdS) space, at any order in perturbation
theory. Assuming the Bunch-Davies vacuum at early times, any given diagram contributing to a boundary
correlator in dS can be expressed as a linear combination of Witten diagrams for the corresponding
process in EAdS, where the relative coefficients are fixed by consistent on-shell factorisation
in dS. These coefficients are given by certain sinusoidal factors which account for the change in
coefficient of the contact sub-diagrams from EAdS to dS, which we argue encode (perturbative) unitary
time evolution in dS. dS boundary correlators with Bunch-Davies initial conditions thus perturbatively
have the same singularity structure as their Euclidean AdS counterparts and the identities between
them allow to directly import the wealth of techniques, results and understanding from AdS to dS.
This includes the Conformal Partial Wave expansion and, by going from single-valued Witten diagrams
in EAdS to Lorentzian AdS, the Froissart-Gribov inversion formula. We give a few (among the many
possible) applications both at tree and loop level. Such identities between boundary correlators
in dS and EAdS are made manifest by the Mellin-Barnes representation of boundary correlators, which
we point out is a useful tool in its own right as the analogue of the Fourier transform for the dilatation
group. The Mellin-Barnes representation in particular makes manifest factorisation and dispersion
formulas for bulk-to-bulk propagators in (EA)dS, which imply Cutkosky cutting rules and dispersion
formulas for boundary correlators in (EA)dS. Our results are completely general and in particular
apply to any interaction of (integer) spinning fields.

The signature of noncommutativity on various measures of entanglement has been observed by considering
the holographic dual of noncommutative super Yang-Mills theory. We have followed a systematic
analytical approach in order to compute the holographic entanglement entropy corresponding to
a strip like subsystem of length $l$. The relationship between the subsystem size (in dimensionless
form) $\frac{l}{a}$ and the turning point (in dimensionless form) introduces a critical length
scale $\frac{l_c}{a}$ which leads to three domains in the theory, namely, the deep UV domain ($l<
l_c$; $au_{t}\gg 1$, $au_{t}\sim au_{b}$), deep noncommutative domain ($l> l_c,~au_{b}>au_t\gg
1$) and deep IR domain ($l> l_c,~au_t\ll 1$). This in turn means that the length scale $l_c$ distinctly
points out the UV/IR mixing property of the non-local theory under consideration. We have carried
out the holographic study of entanglement entropy for each of these domains by employing both analytical
and numerical techniques. The broken Lorentz symmetry induced by noncommutativity has motivated
us to redefine the entropic $c$-function. We have obtained the noncommutative correction to the
$c$-function upto leading order in the noncommutative parameter. We then move on to compute the
minimal cross-section area of the entanglement wedge by considering two disjoint subsystems $A$
and $B$. On the basis of $E_P = E_W$ duality, this leads to the holographic computation of the entanglement
of purification. The correlation between two subsystems, namely, the holographic mutual information
$I(A:B)$ has also been computed. Moreover, the computations of $E_W$ and $I(A:B)$ has been done
for each of the domains in the theory. Finally, we consider a black hole geometry with a noncommutative
parameter and study the influence of both noncommutativity and finite temperature on the various
measures of quantum entanglement.

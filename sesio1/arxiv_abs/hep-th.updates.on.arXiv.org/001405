Probabilities in eternal inflation are traditionally defined as limiting frequency distributions,
but a unique and unambiguous probability measure remains elusive. In this paper, we present a different
approach, based on Bayesian reasoning. Our starting point is the master equation governing vacuum
dynamics, which describes a random walk on the network of vacua. Our probabilities require two pieces
of prior information, both pertaining to initial conditions: a prior density $\rho(t)$ for the
time of nucleation, and a prior probability $p_\alpha$ for the ancestral vacuum. For ancestral
vacua, we advocate the uniform prior as a conservative choice, though our conclusions are fairly
insensitive to this choice. For the time of nucleation, we argue that a uniform prior is consistent
with the time-translational invariance of the master equation and represents the minimally-informative
choice. The resulting predictive probabilities coincide with Bousso's "holographic" prior probabilities
and are closely related to Garriga and Vilenkin's "comoving" probabilities. Despite making the
least informative priors, these probabilities are surprisingly predictive. They favor vacua
whose surrounding landscape topography is that of a deep funnel, akin to the folding funnels of naturally-occurring
proteins. They predict that we exist during the approach to near-equilibrium, much earlier than
the mixing time for the landscape. We also consider a volume-weighted $\rho(t)$, which amounts
to weighing vacua by physical volume. The predictive probabilities in this case coincide with the
GSVW measure. The Bayesian framework allows us to compare the plausibility of the uniform-time
and volume-weighted hypotheses to explain our data by computing the Bayesian evidence for each.
We argue, under general and plausible assumptions, that posterior odds overwhelmingly favor the
uniform-time hypothesis.

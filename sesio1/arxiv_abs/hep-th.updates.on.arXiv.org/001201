In the quantum treatment of collapsing matter, a viable mode analysis is supposed to give information
regarding emission during the collapse. Nevertheless, partly owing to operator ordering ambiguities
involved in a typical quantum gravity analysis, the availability of such well-defined modes is
not guaranteed. We study the mode decomposition of the unitarily evolving wave packet constructed
for the quantum model of spherically symmetric dust collapsing in a marginally bound Lema\^{\i}tre-Tolman-Bondi
(LTB) model. We identify the observable depicting mode decomposition, and using the freedom of
operator ordering ambiguity, we obtain the Hermitian extension of this operator alongside the
Hermitian Hamiltonian. After identifying incoming and outgoing modes with this operator's eigenstates,
we estimate their contributions to the radiation profile. The infrared sector of this process demonstrates
some characteristic features which turn out to be highly sensitive to the near-bounce dynamics
of the dust cloud. Near the epoch of classical singularity, there is a significant contribution
from incoming/outgoing modes of small wavenumber in the expanding/collapsing phase of the dust
cloud, which keeps on decreasing as one moves away from the singularity. The information of the bounce
is carried over to the infrared modes through a flip from largely incoming to largely outgoing radiation
as the evolution progresses from collapsing to expanding phase, much before the information of
bounce comes about to any observer. In the infrared sector, the saturation value of the amplitude
marks the bounce radius. Thus, we argue that the information of the short scale physics is essentially
carried over to the longest wavelength in this quantum gravity model, which we argue is rather more
prominent for low energy processes.

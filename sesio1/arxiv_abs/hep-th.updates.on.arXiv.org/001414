In the context of this dissertation, we study the emergence of black-string and black-hole solutions
in the framework of five-dimensional braneworld models. The main motivation for studying such
theories stems from the Randall-Sundrum model, which was formulated by Lisa Randall and Raman Sundrum
back in 1999. We investigate thoroughly the physical characteristics of analytic solutions which
concern both black strings and five-dimensional localized black holes. To be more precise, the
black-string solutions emerge in the context of a five-dimensional scalar-tensor theory, where
the brane line-element is found to describe a Schwarzschild-(anti-)de Sitter spacetime. The cases
of de Sitter, anti-de Sitter and Minkowski branes are examined separately and in great detail. As
far as the five-dimensional black holes are concerned, at first, we present an "algorithm" that
one may use in order to construct from first principles the geometry of analytic and exponentially
localized five-dimensional braneworld black holes. In each case, the point-like singularity
of the black hole lies entirely on the 3-brane, while its event horizon is exponentially localized
close to the 3-brane thus exhibiting a pancake shape. In the first case, the induced line-element
on the brane assumes the form of the Schwarzschild solution while the bulk geometry is effectively
AdS$_5$ outside the horizon. In the second case, the induced brane geometry is described by the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m-(A)dS
line-element, where a careful classification of the horizons takes place as well. In both cases,
the derived geometry is supported by an anisotropic fluid in the bulk described only by two independent
components, the energy density and tangential pressure, whereas no matter needs to be introduced
on the brane for its consistent embedding in the bulk.

Root bundles appear prominently in studies of vector-like spectra of 4d F-theory compactifications.
Of particular importance to phenomenology are the Quadrillion F-theory Standard Models (F-theory
QSMs). In this work, we analyze a superset of the physical root bundles whose cohomologies encode
the vector-like spectra for the matter representations $(\mathbf{3}, \mathbf{2})_{1/6}$, $(\mathbf{\overline{3}},
\mathbf{1})_{-2/3}$ and $(\mathbf{1}, \mathbf{1})_{1}$. For the family $B_3( \Delta_4^\circ
)$ consisting of $\mathcal{O}(10^{11})$ F-theory QSM geometries, we argue that more than $99.995\%$
of the roots in this superset have no vector-like exotics. This indicates that absence of vector-like
exotics in those representations is a very likely scenario. The QSM geometries come in families
of toric 3-folds $B_3( \Delta^\circ )$ obtained from triangulations of certain 3-dimensional
polytopes $\Delta^\circ$. The matter curves in $X_\Sigma \in B_3( \Delta^\circ )$ can be deformed
to nodal curves which are the same for all spaces in $B_3( \Delta^\circ )$. Therefore, one can probe
the vector-like spectra on the entire family $B_3( \Delta^\circ )$ from studies of a few nodal curves.
We compute the cohomologies of all limit roots on these nodal curves. In our applications, for the
majority of limit roots the cohomologies are determined by line bundle cohomology on rational tree-like
curves. For this, we present a computer algorithm. The remaining limit roots, corresponding to
circuit-like graphs, are handled by hand. The cohomologies are independent of the relative position
of the nodes, except for a few circuits. On these \emph{jumping circuits}, line bundle cohomologies
can jump if nodes are specially aligned. This mirrors classical Brill-Noether jumps. $B_3( \Delta_4^\circ
)$ admits a jumping circuit, but the root bundle constraints pick the canonical bundle and no jump
happens.

In this paper, we study the mass spectrum, the effective action and the first law of entanglement
entropy for a novel doubly holographic model called wedge holography. Remarkably, there is always
a massless mode of gravitons on the end-of-the-world branes in wedge holography. This happens because
one imposes Neumann boundary condition on both branes. On the other hand, the massless mode disappears
if one imposes Dirichlet boundary condition on one of the branes as in brane world theory and AdS/BCFT.
We also study the effective action of quantum gravity on the branes. In the perturbative formulation,
it is given by an infinite sum of Pauli-Fierz actions. In the non-perturbative formulation, the
effective action is composed of a higher derivative gravity and a matter action. Usually, a higher
derivative gravity can be renormalizable but suffers the ghost problem. For our case, since the
effective theory on the brane is equivalent to Einstein gravity in the bulk, it must be ghost-free.
We notice that the matter action plays an important role in eliminating the ghost. We also provide
evidences that the higher derivative gravity on the brane is equivalent to a ghost-free multi-gravity.
Besides, we prove that the non-perturbative effective action yields the correct Weyl anomaly.
Remarkably, although the effective action on the brane is an infinite tower of higher derivative
gravity, the holographic Weyl anomaly is exactly the same as that of Einstein gravity. Finally,
we verify the first law of entanglement entropy for wedge holography. Interestingly, the massive
fluctuations are irrelevant to the first order perturbation of the holographic entanglement entropy.
Thus, in many aspects, the effective theory on the brane behaves like massless Einstein gravity.

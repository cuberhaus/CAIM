We construct a class of 4D `yoga' (naturally relaxed) models for which the vacuum energies of heavy
particles do not gravitate. The models contain three ingredients: (i) a relaxation mechanism driven
by a scalar field (the `relaxon'), (ii) a very supersymmetric gravity sector coupled to the Standard
Model in which supersymmetry is non-linearly realised, and (iii) an accidental approximate scale
invariance expressed through the presence of a low-energy dilaton supermultiplet. All three are
common in higher-dimensional and string constructions. Although none suffices on its own, taken
together they predict a current Dark Energy density that is of order $(M_W^2/M_p)^4$ and a gravitino
mass of order $M_W^3/M_p^2,$ with $M_W, M_p$ the weak and Planck scales respectively. The dilaton's
vev $\tau$ determines the weak scale $M_W \sim M_p/\sqrt\tau$ and because the relevant part of the
scalar potential arises as a function of $\ln\tau$ it stabilizes $\tau$ in a local de Sitter minimum
with exponentially large fields obtained using input parameters no larger than O(60), thereby
explaining both the size of the electroweak hierarchy and the cosmological constant. Scale invariance
implies the dilaton couples to matter like a Brans-Dicke scalar with coupling large enough to be
naively ruled out by solar-system tests of gravity. Yet because it comes paired with an axion it escapes
fifth-force bounds through the novel screening mechanism described in ArXiV:2110.10352. Cosmological
axio-dilaton evolution provides a natural quintessence model for Dark Energy, whose evolution
might realize recent proposals to resolve the Hubble tension, and whose axion contributes to Dark
Matter. We summarize some of the remaining challenges, comment on implications for inflation and
sketch possible UV completions of our approach.

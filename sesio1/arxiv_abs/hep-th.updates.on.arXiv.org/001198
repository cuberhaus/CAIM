We analyze possibilities to obtain a globally regular stationary generalization for the ultrastatic
wormhole with a repulsive scalar field found by Bronnikov and by Ellis in 1973. The extreme simplicity
of this static solution suggests that its stationary version could be obtainable analytically
and should be globally regular, but no such generalization has been found. We analyze the problem
and find that the difficulty originates in the vacuum theory, since the scalar field can be eliminated
within the Eris-Gurses procedure. The problem then reduces to constructing the spinning generalization
for the vacuum wormhole sourced by a thin ring of negative tension. Solving the vacuum Ernst equations
determines the $g_{00}$, $g_{0\varphi}$ metric components and hence the AMD mass ${\rm M}$ and
angular momentum ${\rm J}$, all of these being specified by the ring source. The scalar field can
be included into consideration afterwords, but this only affects $g_{rr}$ and $g_{\vartheta\vartheta}$
without changing the rest. Within this approach, we analyze a number of exact stationary generalizations
for the wormhole, but none of them are satisfactory. However, the perturbative expansion around
the static vacuum background contains only bounded functions and presumably converges to an exact
solution. Including the scalar field screens the singularity at the ring source and renders the
geometry regular. This solution describes a globally regular spinning wormhole with two asymptotically
flat regions. Even though the source itself is screened and not visible, the memory of it remains
in $g_{00}$ and $g_{0\varphi}$ and accounts for the ${\rm M}\propto {\rm J}^2$ relation typical
for a rotating extended source. Describing stationary spacetimes with an extended source is a complicated
problem, which presumably explains the difficulty in finding the solution.

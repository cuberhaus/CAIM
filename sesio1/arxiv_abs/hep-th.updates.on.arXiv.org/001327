Several phenomenological approaches to quantum gravity assume the existence of a minimal measurable
length and/or a maximum measurable momentum near the Planck scale. When embedded into the framework
of quantum mechanics, such constraints induce a modification of the canonical commutation relations
and thus a generalization of the Heisenberg uncertainty relations, commonly referred to as generalized
uncertainty principle (GUP). Different models of quantum gravity imply different forms of the
GUP. For instance, in the framework of string theory the GUP is quadratic in the momentum operator,
while in the context of doubly special relativity it includes an additional linear dependence.
Among the possible physical consequences, it was recently shown that the quadratic GUP induces
a universal decoherence mechanism, provided one assumes a foamy structure of quantum spacetime
close to the Planck length. Along this line, in the present work we investigate the gravitational
decoherence associated to the linear-quadratic GUP and we compare it with the one associated to
the quadratic GUP. We find that, despite their similarities, the two generalizations of the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle yield decoherence times that are completely uncorrelated and significantly
distinct. Motivated by this result, we introduce a theoretical and experimental scheme based on
cavity optomechanics to measure the different time evolution of nonlocal quantum correlations
corresponding to the two aforementioned decoherence mechanisms. We find that the deviation between
the two predictions occurs on time scales that are macroscopic and thus potentially amenable to
experimental verification. This scenario provides a possible setting to discriminate between
different forms of the GUP and therefore different models of quantum gravity.

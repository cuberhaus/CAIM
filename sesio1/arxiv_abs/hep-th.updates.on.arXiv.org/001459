We construct exact solutions of magnetically charged black holes in the vector-tensor Horndeski
gravity and discuss their main features. Unlike the analogous electric case, the field equations
are linear in a simple (quite standard) parametrization of the metric tensor and they can be solved
analytically even when a cosmological constant is added. The solutions are presented in terms of
hypergeometric functions which makes the analysis of the black hole properties relatively straightforward.
Some of the aspects of these black holes are quite ordinary like the existence of extremal configurations
with maximal magnetic charge for a given mass, or the existence of a mass with maximal temperature
for a given charge, but others are somewhat unexpected, like the existence of black holes with a repulsive
gravitational field. We perform our analysis for both signs of the non-minimal coupling constant
and find black hole solutions in both cases but with significant differences between them. The most
prominent difference is the fact that the black holes for the negative coupling constant have a spherical
surface of curvature singularity rather than a single point. On the other hand, the gravitational
field produced around this kind of black holes is always attractive. Also, for small enough magnetic
charge and negative coupling constant, extremal black holes do not exist and all magnetic black
holes have a single horizon. In addition we study the trajectories around these magnetic black holes
for light as well as massive particles either neutral or electrically charged. Finally, we compare
the main features of these black holes with their electric counterparts, adding some aspects that
have not been discussed before, like temperature, particle trajectories and light deflection
by electrically charged Horndesky black holes.

Asymptotic symmetries are a general and important feature of theories with long-ranging fields,
such as gravity, electromagnetism, and Yang-Mills. They appear in the formalism once the analytic
behaviour of fields near infinity is specified and have received a renewed interest in the last years
after a possible connection with the information-loss paradox has been conjectured. One of the
various methods used to study the asymptotic symmetries of field theories relies on the Hamiltonian
formalism and was introduced in the seminal work of Henneaux and Troessaert, who successfully applied
it to the case of gravity and electrodynamics. The main advantage of this approach is that the study
of the asymptotic symmetries ensues from clear-cut first principles. After an extensive review
of how the Hamiltonian approach to study asymptotic symmetries of gauge theories works, we apply
these methods to two specific situations of physical interest. First, we deal with the non-abelian
Yang-Mills case and we show that the above principles lead to trivial asymptotic symmetries (nothing
else than the Poincar\'e group) and, as a consequence, to a vanishing total colour charge. This is
a new and somewhat unexpected result. It implies that no globally colour-charged states exist in
classical non-abelian Yang-Mills theory. The second situation considered is a scalar field minimally-coupled
to an abelian gauge field, which can be used to study, at the same time, two specific cases: scalar
electrodynamics and the abelian Higgs model. We show that the situation in scalar electrodynamics
amply depends on whether the scalar field is massive or massless, insofar as, in the latter case,
one cannot canonically implement asymptotic symmetries. Furthermore, we illustrate that, in
the abelian Higgs model, the asymptotic canonical symmetries reduce to the Poincar\'e group in
an unproblematic fashion.

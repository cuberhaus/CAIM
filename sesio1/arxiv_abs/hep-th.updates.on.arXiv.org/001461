We proceed to investigate the non-Abelian T-duality of $AdS_{2}$, $AdS_{2}\times S^1$ and $AdS_{3}$
physical backgrounds, as well as the metric of the analytic continuation of $AdS_{2}$ from the point
of view of Poisson-Lie (PL) T-duality. To this end, we reconstruct these metrics of the $AdS$ families
as backgrounds of non-linear $\sigma$-models on two- and three-dimensional Lie groups. By considering
the Killing vectors of these metrics and by taking into account the fact that the subgroups of isometry
Lie group of the metrics can be taken as one of the subgroups of the Drinfeld double (with Abelian duals)
we look up the PL T-duality. To construct the dualizable metrics by the PL T-duality we find all subalgebras
of Killing vectors that generate subgroup of isometries which acts freely and transitively on the
manifolds defined by aforementioned $AdS$ families. We then obtain the dual backgrounds for these
families of $AdS$ in such a way that we apply the usual rules of PL T-duality without further corrections.
We have also investigated the conformal invariance conditions of the original backgrounds ($AdS$
families) and their dual counterparts. Finally, by using the T-duality rules proposed by Kaloper
and Meissner (KM) we calculate the Abelian T-duals of BTZ black hole up to two-loop by dualizing on
the coordinates $ \varphi$ and $ t $. When the dualizing is implemented by the shift of direction $\varphi$,
we show that the horizons and singularity of the dual spacetime are the same as in charged black string
derived by Horne and Horowitz without $\alpha'$-corrections, whereas in dualizing on the coordinate
$t$ we find a new three-dimensional black string whose structure and asymptotic nature are clearly
determined. For this case, we show that the T-duality transformation changes the asymptotic behavior
from $AdS_3$ to flat.

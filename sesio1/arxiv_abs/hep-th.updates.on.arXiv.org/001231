We investigate the rotating quark matter in the three-flavor Nambu and Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model.
The chiral condensation, spin polarization and number susceptibility of the light and strange
quarks are carefully studied at finite temperature without or with finite chemical potential in
this model. We find that the rotation suppresses the chiral condensation and enhances the first-order
quark spin polarization, however for the second-order quark spin polarization and quark number
susceptibility the effect is complicated and interesting. When extending to the situation with
finite chemical potential, we find the angular velocity also plays a crucial role, at small angular
velocity the chemical potential enhances the susceptibility, however in the middle region of angular
velocity the effect of the chemical potential is suppressed by the angular velocity and susceptibility
can be changed considerably, it can be observed that at very low temperature in the presence of quark
chemical potential the quark number susceptibility has two maxima with increasing angular velocity.
Furthermore, it is found that at sufficiently large angular velocity the contributions played
by light quark and strange quark to these phenomena are almost equal. we also explored the phase diagram
in the $T$-$\omega$ plane, we observe that there exist first order phase transitions for the rotating
system and the first order phase transition lines move toward a higher temperature for decreasing
angular velocity. It is also found that the different chemical potentials change the boundary of
phase diagram, and that a larger chemical potential shifts down the critical temperature. We expect
these studies to be used to understand the chiral symmetry breaking and restoration as well as probe
the QCD phase transition.

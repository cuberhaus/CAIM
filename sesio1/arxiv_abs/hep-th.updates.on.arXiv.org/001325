In this paper we investigate the presence of exotic matter and the energy conditions of the generalized
Ellis-Bronnikov solutions proposed in \cite{Kar:1995jz}, a generalization of the Ellis-Bronnikov
spacetime that has two parameters defining it ($n$ and $r_t$) in the context of asymptotically safe
gravity (ASG). These generalized solutions was a attempt to solve the problem of exotic matter,
and we investigate if the ASG cured these problems.Further, as pointed in \cite{DuttaRoy:2019hij},
these generalized solutions needs an extra matter beyond phantom to exist. Therefore we investigated
if the ASG brings what kind of matter these extra matter can be. For this, we have choose the models
that use the Ricci scalar, squared Ricci and the Kretschmann scalar to define the antiscreening
function. We found that we have corrections at the throat due the ASG only for the Ricci scalar and
the squared Ricci as improvement and this only for a specific generalized wormhole (those with $n=4$).
For the Ricci scalar case we have solved the problem with exotic matter at the throat of the wormhole,
however, the radial energy conditions are not satisfied at the throat, as we have in the usual case.
But, we have shown that non-exotic matter at throat implies regions where the radial energy conditions
can be satisfied, contrary to what is predicted by classical theory. For this we have regions with
extra matter (quintessence and non-exotic) beyond Phantom, which naturally appears in the ASG
context. When using the squared Ricci as improvement, we have shown that only Phantom is allowed
at the throat, but, in this case, the radial energy conditions are always satisfied at the throat,
and for this we have regions with exotic matter with $\omega>1$ and non-exotic matter. Once again
the ASG shows naturally what kind of extra matter we have to support this generalized solutions.

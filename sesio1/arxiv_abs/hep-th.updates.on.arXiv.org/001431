To explore the possible clues for the extra dimension from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations,
we study the shadow of the rotating 5D black string in General Relativity (GR). Instead of investigating
the shadow in the effective 4D theory, we concern the motion of photons along the extra dimension
$z$ with a conserved momentum $P_z$, which appears as an effective mass in the geodesic equations
of photons. The existence of $P_z$ enlarges the photon regions and the shadow of the rotating 5D black
string while it has slight impact on the distortion. Considering the momentum $P_z$ along the extra
dimension is same for all the photons, we constrain the dimensionless quantity $c P_z/E_0\lesssim
0.35$ from the lower bound $39~\rm{\mu as}$ of the angular diameter in the EHT observations of M87*.
However, for an infinite extra dimension, there is no reason to keep all the photons in same $P_z/E_0$,
and the scenario permitting all values of $P_z/E_0$ within $0\sim 1$ is contradictory with the observations.
Nevertheless, a compact extra dimension can give a reasonable excuse for the discrete values of
$P_z$, and using the upper bound $45~\rm{\mu as}$ for the ring diameter of M87* we can obtain the range
for the length of the compact extra dimension as $2.03125~\rm{mm} \lesssim \ell \lesssim 2.6~\rm{mm}$
(radius $0.323283~mm\lesssim R_z \lesssim 0.413803~mm$). This is a very interesting result for
the first consideration, which supports the hypothesis that the extra dimension is compact to avoid
the Gregory-Laflamme (GL) instability. Similarly, from the observations of SgrA*, the constraints
$2.28070~\rm{mm} \lesssim \ell \lesssim 2.6~\rm{mm}$ and $2.13115~\rm{mm} \lesssim \ell \lesssim
2.6~\rm{mm}$ can be given by the upper bounds of the emission ring and the angular shadow diameter
respectively.

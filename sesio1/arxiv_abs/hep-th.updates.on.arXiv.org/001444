In this thesis we have studied various applications of asymptotic Hodge theory in string compactifications.
This mathematical framework captures how physical couplings of the resulting effective theories
behave near field space boundaries where the internal Calabi-Yau manifold degenerates. Below
we summarize the three parts in which this thesis is divided. Part I introduces the techniques from
asymptotic Hodge theory we used throughout this thesis. We review the results of the nilpotent orbit
theorem of Schmid and the multi-variable sl(2)-orbit theorem of Cattani, Kaplan and Schmid. This
discussion is tailored to applications in string compactifications, explaining how to describe
important physical couplings such as K\"ahler potentials and flux superpotentials near boundaries
in moduli spaces. Part II discusses a geometrical application with the construction of general
models for asymptotic periods. Taking the constraints imposed by asymptotic Hodge theory as consistency
principles, we develop new methods for constructing these periods. We explicitly carry out our
program for all possible one- and two-moduli boundaries. Part III discusses two applications of
asymptotic Hodge theory in string compactifications. The first investigates bounds put by the
Weak Gravity Conjecture in the setting of 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravity theories arising from
Type IIB Calabi-Yau compactifications. The second application studies flux potentials in asymptotic
regimes in complex structure moduli space, where we develop two schemes for moduli stabilization.
The first scheme sets up an approximation procedure for finding flux vacua divided in three steps:
the sl(2)-approximation, the nilpotent orbit approximation, and the fully corrected result.
The second scheme constructs flux vacua with a small flux superpotential by using essential exponential
corrections controlled by asymptotic Hodge theory.

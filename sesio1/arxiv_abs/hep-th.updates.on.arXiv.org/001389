This thesis is devoted to the study of 3-dimensional quantum gravity as a spin foam model and group
field theory. In the first part of this thesis, we review some general physical and mathematical
aspects of 3-dimensional gravity, focusing on its topological nature. Afterwards, we review some
important aspects of the Ponzano-Regge spin foam model for 3-dimensional Riemannian quantum gravity
and explain in some details how it is related to the discretized path integral of general relativity
in its first-order formulation. Furthermore, we discuss briefly some related spin foam models
and review the notion of spin network states in order to properly define transition amplitudes of
these models. The main results of this thesis are contained in the second part. We start by reviewing
the Boulatov group field theory and explain how it is related to the Ponzano-Regge model and some
advantages of introducing colouring. Afterwards, we give a very detailed review of the topology
of coloured graphs with non-empty boundary and review techniques, which are devolved in crystallization
theory, a branch of geometric topology. In the last part of this chapter, we apply these techniques
in order to define suitable boundary observables and transition amplitudes of this model and in
order to set up a formalism for dealing with transition amplitudes in the coloured Boulatov model
in a more systematic way by writing them as topological expansions. We also apply these techniques
to the simplest possible boundary state representing a 2-sphere. Last but not least, we review some
results regarding quasi-local holography in the Ponzano-Regge model, construct some explicit
examples of coloured graphs representing manifolds with torus boundary and discuss the transition
amplitude of some fixed boundary graph representing a 2-torus.

Gravitational memory effect has emerged as a new window and opened up several intriguing avenues
in the field of gravitational wave astronomy together with its inter-connection to asymptotic
symmetries (AS). The recent developments in this direction have drawn considerable attention
from theoretical as well as observational perspectives. It has been shown that such effects can
also be recovered near the horizon of black holes which might play a crucial role in understanding
the information paradox. With this motivation, we have studied the gravitational memory effect
near the horizon of black holes analogous to the one obtained at asymptotic null infinity. We first
study how the AS emerge near the horizon of black holes and how they can be detected via some ideal detectors
as some permanent change of configurations (Memory) once GW passes through the setup. The emergence
of AS is studied from two different perspectives. First, how AS emerge as soldering freedoms when
two black holes are being glued along a common null surface. Secondly, in the form of AS that preserve
the asymptotic form of the near horizon metric of a black hole. We have established an analogous form
of the displacement memory near the horizon of non-extreme and extreme black holes for both these
perspectives. We also discuss the detection prospects of the supertranslation memory or hair.
In this direction, other than the memory effect, we have explored the possibility of detecting a
supertranslated black hole through standard tests of General Relativity. We propose a scenario
in which such a configuration may be distinguished from ordinary black holes by examining the photon
trajectories near the horizon. As we know that the gravitational memory has not been detected yet,
in this direction, our study might serve as a useful contribution towards investigation of the signatures
of AS in the future.

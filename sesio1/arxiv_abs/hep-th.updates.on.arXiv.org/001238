We study quantum fields on an arbitrary, rigid background with boundary. We derive the action for
a scalar in the holographic basis that separates the boundary and bulk degrees of freedom. From this
holographic action, a relation between Dirichlet and Neumann propagators valid for any background
is obtained. As an application in a warped background, we derive an exact formula for the flux of bulk
modes emitted from the boundary. We also derive the holographic action in the presence of two boundaries.
Integrating out free bulk modes, we derive a formula for the Casimir pressure on a $(d-1)$-brane
depending only on the boundary-to-bulk propagators. In AdS$_{2}$ we find that the quantum force
pushes a point particle toward the AdS$_2$ boundary. In higher dimensional AdS$_{d+1}$ the quantum
pressure amounts to a detuning of the brane tension, which gets renormalized for even $d$. We evaluate
the one-loop boundary effective action in the presence of interactions by means of the heat kernel
expansion. We integrate out a heavy scalar fluctuation with scalar interactions in AdS$_{d+1}$,
obtaining the long-distance effective Lagrangian encoding loop-generated boundary-localized
operators. We integrate out nonabelian vector fluctuations in AdS$_{4,5,6}$ and obtain the associated
holographic Yang-Mills $\beta$ functions. Turning to the expanding patch of dS, following recent
proposals, we provide a boundary effective action generating the perturbative cosmological correlators
by analytically continuing from dS to EAdS. We obtain the "cosmological" heat kernel coefficients
in the scalar case and work out the divergent part of the dS$_4$ effective action which renormalizes
the cosmological correlators. More developments are needed to extract all one-loop information
from the cosmological effective action.

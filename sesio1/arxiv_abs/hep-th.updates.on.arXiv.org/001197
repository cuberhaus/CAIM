In this paper we study a cosmological model inspired in axionic matter, with two canonical scalar
fields $\phi_1,\,\phi_2$ interacting through a term added to its potential $V\left(\phi_1,\phi_2\right)=
V_{\text{decl.}}\left(\phi_1,\phi_2\right)+ V_{\text{int}}(\phi_1, \phi_2)$. The decoupled
part $V_{\text{decl.}}$, satisfies periodicity property $\phi\to\phi+2\pi C$, shift symmetry
$\phi\to\phi+C$, and time-reversal symmetry $t\to-t$. Time-reversal symmetry is not imposed
to the coupling term $V_{int}$. Introducing novel dynamical and dimensionless time variables,
which have not been used in analyzing these cosmological dynamics, the resulting dynamical systems
are studied. In the uncoupled case the equilibrium points can be fully identified and characterized.
However, in the coupled case transcendental equations have to be solved, and a little progress is
made. The main difficulties arising in the standard dynamical systems approach, where expansion
normalized dynamical variables are usually adopted, are due to the oscillations entering the nonlinear
system through the Klein-Gordon (KG) equations. This motivates the analysis of the oscillations
with averaging techniques. Methods from the theory of averaging nonlinear dynamical systems allow
us to prove that time-dependent systems and their corresponding time-averaged versions have the
same late-time dynamics. Therefore, simple time-averaged systems determine the future asymptotic
behavior. Then, we study the time-averaged system using standard techniques of dynamical systems.
Therefore, with this approach, oscillations entering a nonlinear system through the KG equation
can be controlled and smoothed out as the Hubble factor $H$ - acting as a time-dependent perturbation
parameter - tends monotonically to zero. We present numerical simulations as evidence of such behavior.

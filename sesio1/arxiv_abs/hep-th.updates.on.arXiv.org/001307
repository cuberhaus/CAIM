We present exact expressions for certain integrated correlators of four superconformal primary
operators in the stress tensor multiplet of $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang--Mills (SYM)
theory with classical gauge group, $G_N$ $= SO(2N)$, $SO(2N+1)$, $USp(2N)$. These integrated
correlators are expressed as two-dimensional lattice sums by considering derivatives of the localised
partition functions, generalising the expression obtained for $SU(N)$ in our previous works.
These expressions are manifestly covariant under Goddard-Nuyts-Olive duality. The integrated
correlators can also be formally written as infinite sums of non-holomorphic Eisenstein series
with integer indices and rational coefficients. Furthermore, the action of the hyperbolic Laplace
operator with respect to the complex coupling $\tau=\theta/(2\pi) + 4\pi i /g^2_{_{YM}}$ on any
integrated correlator for gauge group $G_N$ relates it to a linear combination of correlators with
gauge groups $G_{N+1}$, $G_N$ and $G_{N-1}$. These "Laplace-difference equation" determine
the expressions of integrated correlators for all classical gauge groups for any value of $N$ in
terms of the correlator for the gauge group $SU(2)$. The perturbation expansions of these integrated
correlators for any finite value of $N$ agree with properties obtained from perturbative Yang--Mills
quantum field theory, together with various multi-instanton calculations which are also shown
to agree with those determined by supersymmetric localisation. The coefficients of terms in the
large-$N$ expansion are sums of non-holomorphic Eisenstein series with half-integer indices,
which extend recent results and make contact with low order terms in the low energy expansion of type
IIB superstring theory in an $AdS_5\times S^5/\mathbb{Z}_2$ background.

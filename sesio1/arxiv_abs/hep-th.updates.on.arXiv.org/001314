We carry out an extensive study of the holographic aspects of any-dimensional higher-derivative
Einstein-Maxwell theories in a fully analytic and non-perturbative fashion. We achieve this by
introducing the $d$-dimensional version of Electromagnetic Quasitopological gravities: higher-derivative
theories of gravity and electromagnetism that propagate no additional degrees of freedom and that
allow one to study charged black hole solutions analytically. These theories contain non-minimal
couplings, that in the holographic context give rise to a modified $\langle JJ\rangle$ correlator
as well as to a general $\langle TJJ \rangle$ structure whose coefficients we compute. We constrain
the couplings of the theory by imposing CFT unitarity and positivity of energy (which we show to be
equivalent to causality in the bulk) as well as positive-entropy bounds from the weak gravity conjecture.
The thermodynamic properties of the dual plasma at finite chemical potential are studied in detail,
and we find that exotic zeroth-order phase transitions may appear, but that many of them are ruled
out by the physical constraints. We further compute the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio,
and we show that it can be taken to zero while respecting all the constraints, providing that the chemical
potential is large enough. We also obtain the charged R\'enyi entropies and we observe that the chemical
potential always increases the amount of entanglement and that the usual properties of R\'enyi
entropies are preserved if the physical constraints are met. Finally, we compute the scaling dimension
and magnetic response of twist operators and we provide a holographic derivation of the universal
relations between the expansion of these quantities and the coefficients of $\langle JJ\rangle$
and $\langle TJJ \rangle$.

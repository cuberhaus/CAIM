Valuable theoretical predictions of nuclear dipole excitations in the whole nuclear chart are
of great interest for different applications, including in particular nuclear astrophysics.
We present here the systematic study of the electric dipole (E1) photon strength functions (PSFs)
combining the microscopic Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov plus Quasiparticle Random Phase Approximation
(HFB+QRPA) model and the parametrizations constrained by the available experimental giant dipole
resonance (GDR) data. For about 10000 nuclei with 8<Z<124 lying between the proton and the neutron
drip-lines on nuclear chart, the particle-hole strength distributions are computed using the
HFB+QRPA model under the assumption of spherical symmetry and making use of the BSk27 Skyrme effective
interaction derived from the most accurate HFB mass model (HFB-27) so far achieved. Large-scale
calculations of the BSk27+QRPA E1 PSFs are performed in the framework of a specific folding procedure,
in which three phenomenological improvements are considered. First, two interference factors
are introduced and adjusted to reproduce at best the available experimental GDR data. Second, an
empirical expression accounting for the deformation effect is applied to describe the peak splitting
of the strength function. Third, the width of the strength function is corrected by a temperature-dependent
term, which effectively increases the de-excitation photon strength function at low-energy.
The E1 PSFs as well as the extracted GDR peaks and widths are compared with available experimental
data. A relatively good agreement with data indicates the reliability of the calculations. Eventually,
the astrophysical (n,g) rates for all the 10000 nuclei with 8<Z<124 are estimated using the present
E1 PSFs. The resulting reaction rates are compared with previous BSk7+QRPA results and Gogny-HFB+QRPA
predictions based on the D1M interaction.

We propose an ekpyrotic bounce scenario driven by a second rank antisymmetric Kalb-Ramond field,
where the universe initially contracts through an ekpyrotic stage having a non-singular bouncing
like behaviour, and consequently, it smoothly transits to an expanding phase. In particular, the
KR field has an interaction with a scalaron field (coming from higher curvature d.o.f) by a linear
coupling. The interaction energy density between the KR and the scalaron grows faster than $a^{-6}$
during the contraction phase -- which has negligible effects at the distant past, however as the
universe continues to contract, this interaction energy density gradually grows and plays a significant
role to trigger a non-singular bounce at a minimum value of the scale factor. The existence of the
ekpyrotic phase justifies the resolution of the BKL instability, where the anisotropic energy
density gets diluted compared to that of the bouncing agent. The bounce being symmetric and ekpyrotic,
the energy density of the bouncing agent rapidly decreases after the bounce during the expanding
phase of the universe, and consequently the standard Big-Bang cosmology gets recovered. We find
that the comoving Hubble radius diverges at the distant past, which leads to the generation era of
the primordial perturbation modes at the deep contracting phase far away from the bounce. In effect,
the curvature perturbation gets a blue tilted spectrum over the large scale modes -- not consistent
with the Planck data. To circumvent this problem, we propose an extended scenario where the ekpyrotic
phase is preceded by a quasi-matter dominated pre-ekpyrotic phase, and re-investigate the perturbation
power spectrum. As a result, the primordial curvature perturbation, at scales that cross the horizon
during the pre-ekpyrotic stage, turns out to be nearly scale invariant that is indeed consistent
with the recent Planck data.

We present MORDOR (MORphological DecOmposeR, a new algorithm for structural decomposition of
simulated galaxies based on stellar kinematics. The code measures the properties of up to five structural
components (a thin/cold and a thick/warm disc, a classical and a secular bulge, and a spherical stellar
halo), and determines the properties of a stellar bar (if present). A comparison with other algorithms
presented in the literature yields overall good agreement, with MORDOR displaying a higher flexibility
in correctly decomposing systems and identifying bars in crowded environments (e.g. with ongoing
fly-bys, often observable in cosmological simulations). We use MORDOR to analyse galaxies in the
TNG50 simulation and find the following: ($i$) the thick disc component undergoes the strongest
evolution in the binding energy-circularity plane, as expected when disc galaxies decrease their
turbulent-rotational support with cosmic time; ($ii$) smaller galaxies (with stellar mass, $10^{9}
\lesssim M_{*} / {\rm M_{\odot}} \leq 5 \times 10^{9}$) undergo a major growth in their disc components
after $z\sim 1$, whereas ($iii$) the most massive galaxies ($5 \times 10^{10} < M_{*} / {\rm M_{\odot}}
\leq 5\times10^{11}$) evolve toward more spheroidal dominated objects down to $z=0$ due to frequent
gravitational interactions with satellites; ($iv$) the fraction of barred galaxies grows rapidly
at high redshift and stabilizes below $z\sim 2$, except for the most massive galaxies that show a
decrease in the bar occupation fraction at low redshift; ($v$) galaxies with $M_{*} \sim 10^{11}~{\rm
M_{\odot}}$ exhibit the highest relative occurrence of bars at $z=0$, in agreement with observational
studies. We publicly release MORDOR and the morphological catalogue of TNG50 galaxies.

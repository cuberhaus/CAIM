We present ALMA continuum and molecular line emission maps at $\sim$1 mm of OH 231.8, a well studied
bipolar nebula around an AGB star. The excellent angular resolution of our maps ($\sim$20 mas) allows
us to scrutinise the central nebular regions of OH 231.8, which hold the clues to unravel how this
iconic object assembled its complex nebular architecture. We report, for the first time in this
object and others of its kind, the discovery of a rotating circumbinary disk selectively traced
by NaCl, KCl, and H$_2$O emission lines. This represents the first detection of KCl in an oxygen-rich
AGB circumstellar envelope. The rotating disk, of radius $\sim$30 au, lies at the base of a young
bipolar wind traced by SiO and SiS emission, which also presents signs of rotation at its base. The
NaCl equatorial structure is characterised by a mean rotation velocity of $\sim$4 km s$^{-1}$ and
extremely low expansion speeds, $\sim$3 km s$^{-1}$. The outflow has a predominantly expansive
kinematics characterised by a constant radial velocity gradient of $\sim$65 km s$^{-1}$ arcsec$^{-1}$
at its base. Beyond $r$$\sim$350 au, the gas in the outflow continues radially flowing at a constant
terminal speed of $\sim$16 km s$^{-1}$. Our continuum maps reveal a spatially resolved dust disk-like
structure perpendicular to the outflow, with the NaCl, KCl and H$_2$O emission arising from the
disk's surface layers. Within the disk, we also identify an unresolved point continuum source,
which likely represents the central Mira-type star QX Pup enshrouded by a $\sim$3 $R_{\star}$ component
of hot ($\sim$1400 K) freshly formed dust. The point source is slightly off-centered from the disk
centroid, enabling us for the first time to place constraints to the orbital separation and period
of the central binary system, $a$$\sim$20 au and $P_{\rm orb}$$\sim$55 yr, respectively. (abridged).

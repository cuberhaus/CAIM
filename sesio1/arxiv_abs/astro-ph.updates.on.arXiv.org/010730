The low surface brightness visible wavelength Universe below 29 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ is teeming with
unexplored astrophysical phenomena. Structures fainter than this surface brightness are extremely
difficult to image due to systematic errors of sky subtraction and scattered light in the atmosphere
and in the telescope. In Chapter 1, I show how The Dragonfly Telephoto Array (Dragonfly for short)
addresses these systematics via a combination of hardware and software and is able to image at a level
of 30 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ or fainter. In Chapter 2, I describe the Dragonfly Pipeline and how it is optimized
for low surface brightness imaging, how it automatically rejects problematic exposures, and its
cloud-orchestration. In Chapter 3, I present a study of the outer disk of the nearby spiral galaxy
NGC 2841 using Dragonfly as well as archival data in UV from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer Satellite
and rest frame 21 cm data using the Very Large Array. While it is commonly accepted that gas dominates
over stars in galaxy outer disks, I find that in NGC 2841, this is not the case. The stellar disk extends
to five times R25, and there is more stellar than gas mass at all radii. Surprisingly there is a constant
ratio of stellar to gas mass beyond 30 kpc, where the disk is also warped. I propose the most likely
formation mechanism for this outer disk is co-planar satellite accretion. In Chapter 4, I present
a study of thermally emitted and scattered light from dust in the optically thin regions of the Spider
HI Cloud, using Dragonfly and Herschel Space Observatory data. In closing the thesis (Chapter 5),
I look forward to further improvements in the Dragonfly Pipeline, a population study of the formation
mechanisms of galaxy disks and to carrying out tests of dust models.

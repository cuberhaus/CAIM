Gravity shapes stars to become almost spherical because of the isotropic nature of gravitational
attraction in Newton's theory. However, several mechanisms break this isotropy like for instance
their rotation generating a centrifugal force, magnetic pressure or anisotropic equations of
state. The stellar surface therefore deviates slightly or significantly from a sphere depending
on the strength of these anisotropic perturbations. In this paper, we compute analytical and numerical
solutions of the electromagnetic field produced by a rotating spheroidal star of oblate or prolate
nature. This study is particularly relevant for millisecond pulsars for which strong deformations
are produced by the rotation or a strong magnetic field, leading to indirect observational signatures
of the polar cap thermal X-ray emission. First we solve the time harmonic Maxwell equations in vacuum
by using oblate and prolate spheroidal coordinates adapted to the stellar boundary conditions.
The solutions are expanded in series of radial and angular spheroidal wave functions. Particular
emphasize is put on the magnetic dipole radiation. Second, we compute approximate solutions by
integrating numerically the time-dependent Maxwell equations in spheroidal coordinates. We
show that the spin down luminosity corrections compared to a perfect sphere are to leading order
given by terms involving $(a/r_L)^2$ and $(a/R)^2$ where $a$ is the stellar oblateness or prolateness,
$R$ the smallest star radius and $r_L$ the light-cylinder radius. The corresponding perturbations
in the electromagnetic field are only perceptible close to the surface, deforming the polar cap
rims. At large distances $r\gg a$, the solution tends asymptotically to the perfect spherical case
of a rotating dipole.

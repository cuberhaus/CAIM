Astrophysical binary systems including neutron stars represent exciting sources for multi-messenger
astrophysics. A little considered source of electromagnetic transients accompanying compact
binary systems is a neutron star ocean, the external fluid layer encasing a neutron star. We present
a groundwork study into tidal waves in neutron star oceans and their consequences. Specifically,
we investigate how oscillation modes in a neutron star's ocean can be tidally excited during neutron
star-black hole binary inspirals, binary neutron star inspirals, and parabolic encounters between
neutron stars to produce resonant tidal waves. We find that neutron star oceans can sustain tidal
waves with frequencies under 100 mHz. Our results suggest that resonant neutron star ocean tidal
waves may serve as a never-before studied source for precursor electromagnetic emission prior
to neutron star-black hole and binary neutron star mergers. Resonant neutron star ocean tidal waves,
whose energy budget can reach $10^{46}$ erg, may serve as very early warning signs ($\sim1-10$ yr
before merger) for compact binary mergers if accompanied by electromagnetic flares. Similarly,
excitations of ocean tidal waves will be coincident with neutron star parabolic encounters. We
find that depending on the neutron star ocean model and a flare emission scenario, flares may be detectable
by Fermi and NuSTAR out to $\sim100$ Mpc with detection rates as high as $\sim 7$ yr$^{-1}$ for binary
neutron stars and $\sim0.6$ yr$^{-1}$ for neutron star-black hole binaries. Observations of emission
from neutron star ocean tidal waves in addition to other astrophysical messengers such as gravitational
waves will provide insight into the equation of state at the surface of neutron stars, the composition
of neutron star oceans and crusts, and the geophysics of neutron stars.

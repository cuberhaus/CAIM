General relativity predicts that the rotational momentum flux of matter twists the spacetime via
a vector gravitomagnetic (frame-dragging) field, which so far remains undetected in cosmology.
This vector field induces an additional gravitational lensing effect; at the same time, the momentum
field sources the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect. The common origin of these two effects
allows us to probe the gravitomagnetic signal via their cross-correlations. In this paper, we explore
the possibility of detecting the gravitomagnetic field in $\Lambda$CDM by cross-correlating
the weak lensing convergence field with the CMB temperature map, which is imprinted with the kSZ
signal. This approach allows us to extract the gravitomagnetic effect because the cross correlation
between the standard Newtonian contribution to the weak-lensing convergence field, $\kappa_\Phi$,
and the kSZ effect is expected to vanish. We study the cross correlations with a suite of large-volume
Newtonian $N$-body simulations and a small-volume, high-resolution, general-relativistic
$N$-body simulation counterpart. We show that insufficient simulation resolution can introduce
significant spurious correlations between $\kappa_\Phi$ and kSZ. Based on the high-resolution
simulation, we find that the cumulative signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the kSZ-gravitomagnetic
convergence field can reach almost 15 (30) at $\ell\simeq5000$ ($10^4$) if only cosmic variance
is considered. We make forecast for next-generation lensing surveys such as \textsc{euclid} and
\textsc{lsst}, and CMB experiments such as Simons Observatory and \textsc{cmb}-\textsc{s4},
and find that the cumulative SNR can exceed 5 (9) at $\ell\simeq5000$ ($10^4$), indicating that
the cosmological gravitomagnetic effect can be detected, provided that several foreground contaminations
can be reliably removed.

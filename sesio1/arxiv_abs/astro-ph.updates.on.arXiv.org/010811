Observation of CO emission around asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars is the primary method to determine
gas mass-loss rates. While radiative transfer models have shown that molecular levels of CO can
become mildly inverted, causing maser emission, CO maser emission has yet to be confirmed observationally.
High-resolution observations of the CO emission around AGB stars now have the brightness temperature
sensitivity to detect possible weak CO maser emission. We used high angular resolution observations
taken with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to observe the small-scale
structure of CO $J=3-2$ emission around the oxygen-rich AGB star W Hya. We find CO maser emission
amplifying the stellar continuum with an optical depth $\tau\approx-0.55$. The maser predominantly
amplifies the limb of the star because CO $J=3-2$ absorption from the extended stellar atmosphere
is strongest towards the centre of the star. The CO maser velocity corresponds to a previously observed
variable component of high-frequency H$_2$O masers and with the OH maser that was identified as
the amplified stellar image. This implies that the maser originates beyond the acceleration region
and constrains the velocity profile since we find the population inversion primarily in the inner
circumstellar envelope. We find that inversion can be explained by the radiation field at 4.6 $\mu$m
and that the existence of CO maser emission is consistent with the estimated mass-loss rates for
W Hya. However, the pumping mechanism requires a complex interplay between absorption and emission
lines in the extended atmosphere. Excess from dust in the circumstellar envelope of W Hya is not sufficient
to contribute significantly to the required radiation field at 4.6 $\mu$m. The interplay between
molecular lines that cause the pumping can be constrained by future multi-level CO observations.

Blue large-amplitude pulsators (BLAPs) form a small group of hot objects pulsating in a fundamental
radial mode with periods of the order of 30 minutes. Proposed evolutionary scenarios explain them
as evolved low-mass stars: either ~0.3 M$_\odot$ shell-hydrogen-burning objects with a degenerated
helium core, or more massive (0.5 - 0.8) M$_\odot$ core-helium-burning stars, or ~0.7 M$_\odot$
surviving companions of type Ia supernovae. Therefore, their origin remains to be established.
Using data from Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, we discovered that HD 133729 is a binary
consisting of a late B-type main-sequence star and a BLAP. The BLAP pulsates with a period of 32.37
min decreasing at a rate of $(-7.11 \pm 0.33)\times 10^{-11}$. Due to light dilution by a brighter
companion, the observed amplitude of pulsation is much smaller than in other BLAPs. From available
photometry, we derived times of maximum light, which revealed the binary nature of the star via O-C
diagram. The diagram shows variations with a period of 23.08433 d that we attribute to the light-travel-time
effect in the system. The analysis of these variations allowed to derive the spectroscopic parameters
of the BLAP's orbit around the center of the mass of the binary. The presence of a hot companion in the
system was confirmed by the analysis of its spectral energy distribution, which was also used to
place the components in the H-R diagram. The obtained position of the BLAP fully agrees with the location
of the other members of the class. With the estimated V~11 mag and the Gaia distance of less than 0.5
kpc, the BLAP is the brightest and the nearest of all known BLAPs. It may become a clue object in the
verification of the evolutionary scenarios for this class of variable. We argue that low-mass progenitors
of the BLAP are excluded if the components are coeval and no mass transfer between the components
took place.

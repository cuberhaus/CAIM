Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration signals that are highly dispersed at distant
galaxies. However, the physical origin of FRBs is still unknown. Coherent curvature emission by
bunches, e.g., powered by starquakes, has already been proposed for repeating FRBs. It has the nature
of understanding narrowband radiation exhibiting time--frequency drifting. Recently, a highly
active FRB source, i.e., FRB 20201124A, was reported to enter a newly active episode and emit at least
some highly circular-polarized bursts. In this study, we revisit the polarized FRB emission, particularly
investigating the production mechanisms of a highly circular polarization (CP) by deriving the
intrinsic mechanism and propagative effect. The intrinsic mechanisms of invoking charged bunches
are approached with radiative coherence. Consequently, a highly CP could naturally be explained
by the coherent summation of outcome waves, generated or scattered by bunches, with different phases
and electric vectors. Different kinds of evolutionary trajectories are found on the Poincare sphere
for the bunch-coherent polarization, and this behavior could be tested through future observations.
Cyclotron resonance can result in the absorption of R-mode photons at a low altitude region of the
magnetosphere, and an FRB should then be emitted from a high-altitude region if the waves have strong
linear polarization. Circularly polarized components could be produced from Faraday conversion
exhibiting a \lambda^3-oscillation, but the average CP fraction depends only on the income wave,
indicating a possibility of a highly circular-polarized income wave.The analysis could be welcome
if extremely high CP from repeating FRBs is detected in the future. Finally, the production of a bulk
of energetic bunches in the pulsar-like magnetosphere is discussed, which is relevant to the nature
of the FRB central engine.

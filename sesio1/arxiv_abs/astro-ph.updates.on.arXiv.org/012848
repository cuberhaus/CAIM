Numerical simulations of dwarf galaxies have so far failed to reproduce the observed metallicity-luminosity
relation, down to the ultra-faint dwarfs (UFDs). We address this issue exploring how the first generations
of metal-free stars (Pop III) could help increase the mean metallicity of those faint galaxies.
We run zoom-in chemo-dynamical simulations of nineteen halos extracted from a cosmological box
and follow down to redshift 0. Models are validated not only on the basis of galaxy global properties,
but also the stellar abundance ratios. We identify the necessary conditions for the formation of
first stars in mini-halos and derive constraints on the metal ejection schemes. The impact of Pop
III stars on the final metallicity of UFDs is evaluated by considering different IMFs, the influence
of pair-instability supernovae (PISNe) and their energetic feedback, as well as the metallicity
threshold marks the transition from first stars to the formation of low-mass long-lived stars.
The inclusion of Pop III stars does increase the global metallicity of UFDs, though insufficient
to resolve the tension with observations. PISNe with progenitor masses above 140Msun do allow to
further increase the metal content of UFDs. However, as PISNe are rare and sometimes absent in the
faintest UFDs, they have a limited impact on the global faint end of the metallicity-luminosity
relation. Despite a limited number of spectroscopically confirmed members in UFDs, that makes
the metallicity distribution of some UFDs uncertain, our analysis reveals this is the metal-rich
tail that is missing in the models. The remaining challenges are thus both observational and numerical:
i) to extend high resolution spectroscopy data samples and confirm the mean metallicity of the faintest
UFDs, ii) to explain the presence of chemically enriched stars in galaxies with very short star formation
histories.

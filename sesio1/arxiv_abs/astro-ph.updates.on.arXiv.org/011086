Aims. We aim to expand our understanding of radio wave emission and propagation in the pulsar magnetosphere
by studying the polarization of drifting sub-pulses in highly sensitive observations of PSR~B1919+21
recorded at the Arecibo Observatory. Methods. We apply and compare several methods of analysis
and visualization, including eigenvalue analysis of the longitude-resolved covariances between
the Stokes parameters; longitude-resolved scatter plots of the normalised Stokes vectors in the
Poincar\'e sphere; auto- and cross-correlations between the Stokes parameters as a function of
offset in pulse longitude and lag in pulse number; and mean drift bands of polarization state, formed
by averaging the Stokes parameters and quantities derived from them synchronously with the drifting
sub-pulse modulation period. Results. We observe regions of pulse longitude where the superposition
of orthogonally polarised modes is best described as incoherent and regions where the superposition
appears to be at least partially coherent. Within the region of coherent superposition, over a range
of pulse longitudes spanning $\sim 2\circ$, the distribution of the Stokes polarization vectors
forms a torus centered near the origin of the Poincar\'e sphere. Furthermore, the polarization
vectors rotate about the axis of revolution of the torus synchronously with the drifting sub-pulse
modulation of the total intensity. Conclusions. The nearly uniform circular modulation of polarization
state, clearly evident in both the toroidal distribution of the Stokes polarization vectors and
the mean drift bands of the Stokes parameters, is not predicted by current theoretical models of
pulsar emission. We propose different scenarios to explain the generation of the torus, based on
either incoherent or phase-coherent superposition of orthogonally polarised modes.

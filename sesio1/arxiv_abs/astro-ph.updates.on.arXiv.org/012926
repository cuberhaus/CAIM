We study the origin of the UV-excess in star clusters by performing N-body simulations of six clusters
with N=10k and N=100k (single stars & binary systems) and metallicities of Z=0.01, 0.001, and 0.0001,
using PETAR. All models initially have a 50 percent primordial binary fraction. Using GalevNB we
convert the simulated data into synthetic spectra and photometry for the China Space Station Telescope
(CSST) and Hubble Space Telescope (HST). From the spectral energy distributions we identify three
stellar populations that contribute to the UV-excess: (1) second asymptotic giant branch stars,
which contribute to the UV flux at early times; (2) naked helium stars, and (3) white dwarfs, which
are long-term contributors to the FUV spectra. Binary stars consisting of a white dwarf and a main-sequence
star are cataclysmic variable (CV) candidates. The magnitude distribution of CV candidates is
bimodal up to 2 Gyr. The bright CV population is particularly bright in FUV-NUV. The FUV-NUV color
of our model clusters is 1-2 mag redder than the UV-excess globular clusters in M 87 and in the Milky
Way. This discrepancy may be induced by helium enrichment in observed clusters. Our simulations
are based on simple stellar evolution; we do not include the effects of variations in helium and light
elements or multiple stellar populations. A positive radial color gradient is present in CSST NUV-y
for main-sequence stars of all models with a color difference of 0.2-0.5 mag, up to 4 half-mass radii.
The CSST NUV-g color correlates strongly with HST FUV-NUV for NUV-g>1 mag, with the linear relation
$FUV-NUV=(1.09\pm0.12)\times(NUV-g)+(-1.01\pm0.22)$. This allows for conversion of future
CSST NUV-g colors into HST FUV-NUV colors, which are sensitive to UV-excess features. We find that
CSST will be able to detect UV-excess in galactic/extra-galactic star clusters with ages >200 Myr.

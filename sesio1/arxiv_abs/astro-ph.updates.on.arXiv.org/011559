The atmospheres of ultra-hot Jupiters are highly interesting and unique chemical laboratories.
Due to the very high atmospheric temperatures, formation of aerosols is unlikely on their day-sides.
Furthermore, molecules usually present in atmospheres of other extrasolar gas giants are mostly
dissociated, yielding a chemical composition dominated by atoms and ions instead. Thus, these
planets offer the potential of detailed chemical characterisation by directly detecting elements
through high-resolution day-side and transit spectroscopy. This allows, in principle, to directly
infer the element abundances of these objects, which may provide crucial constraints on their formation
process and evolution history. In atmospheres of cooler planets, deriving metallicities is much
more complicated because elements are usually bound in a multitude of molecules or even condensates.
In the recent past, several chemical species, mostly in the form of atoms and ions, have already been
detected using high-resolution spectroscopy in combination with the cross-correlation technique.
With this study, we provide a grid of standard templates designed to be used together with the cross-correlation
method. This allows for straightforward detection of chemical species in the atmospheres of hot
extrasolar planets. In total, we calculate high-resolution templates for more than 140 different
species across several atmospheric temperatures. In addition to the high-resolution templates,
we also provide line masks that just include the position of line peaks and their absorption depths
relative to the spectral continuum. A separate version of these line masks also takes potential
blending effects with lines of other species into account. All templates and line masks are publicly
available on the CDS data server.

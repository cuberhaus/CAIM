The relation between warm absorber (WA) outflows of AGN and nuclear obscuration activities caused
by optically-thick clouds (obscurers) crossing the line of sight is unclear. NGC 3227 is a suitable
target to study the properties of both WAs and obscurers, because it matches the following selection
criteria: WAs in both ultraviolet (UV) and X-rays, suitably variable, bright in UV and X-rays, good
archival spectra for comparing with the obscured spectra. To investigate WAs and obscurers of NGC~3227,
we used a broadband spectral-energy-distribution model built in our Paper I and the photoionization
code of SPEX software to fit archival XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations in 2006 and 2016. Using
unobscured observations, we find four WAs with different ionization states (log$\xi$ [erg cm/s]~-1.0,
2.0, 2.5, 3.0). The highest-ionization WA has a higher hydrogen column density (~$10^{22}$/cm$^2$)
than the other three WAs (~$10^{21}$/cm$^2$). Their outflow velocities range from 100 to 1300 km/s,
and show a positive correlation with the ionization parameter. These WAs are estimated to be between
the outer broad-line-region (BLR) and the narrow line region. Besides, we find an X-ray obscuration
event in 2006, which was missed by previous studies. It can be explained by a single obscurer. We also
study the previously published obscuration event in 2016, which needs two obscurers in the fit.
A high-ionization obscurer (log$\xi$~2.80; covering factor $C_f$~30%) only appears in 2016,
which has a high column density (~$10^{23}$/cm$^2$). A low-ionization obscurer (log$\xi$~1.0-1.9;
$C_f$~20%-50%) exists in both 2006 and 2016, which has a lower column density (~$10^{22}$/cm$^2$).
These obscurers are estimated to be in the BLR by their crossing time of transverse motions. The obscurers
and WAs of NGC 3227 have different distances and number densities, which indicate that they might
have different origins.

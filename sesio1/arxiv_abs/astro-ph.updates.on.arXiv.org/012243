Rocky planets hosted by close-in extrasolar systems are likely to be tidally locked in 1:1 spin-orbit
resonance, a configuration where they exhibit permanent dayside and nightside. Because of the
resulting day-night temperature gradient, the climate and large-scale circulation of these planets
are strongly determined by their atmospheric stability against collapse, which designates the
runaway condensation of greenhouse gases. To better constrain the surface conditions of rocky
planets located in the habitable zone of their host star, it is therefore crucial to elucidate the
mechanisms that govern the day-night heat redistribution. As a first attempt to bridge the gap between
multiple modelling approaches ranging from idealised models to 3-D General Circulation Models
(GCM), we developed a General Circulation Meta-Model (GCMM) able to reproduce both the closed-form
solutions provided by analytical models and the numerical solutions obtained from GCM simulations.
We used this approach to characterise the atmospheric stability of Earth-sized rocky planets with
dry atmospheres containing CO2, and we benchmarked it against 3-D GCM simulations using THOR GCM.
We observe that the collapse pressure below which collapse occurs can vary by ~40% around the value
predicted by analytical scaling laws depending on the mechanisms taken into account among radiative
transfer, atmospheric dynamics, and turbulent diffusion. Particularly, we find (i) that the turbulent
diffusion taking place in the dayside planetary boundary layer (PBL) globally tends to warm up the
nightside surface hemisphere except in the transition zone between optically thin and optically
thick regimes, (ii) that the PBL also significantly affects the day-night advection timescale,
and (iii) that the slow rotator approximation holds from the moment that the normalised equatorial
Rossby deformation radius is greater than 2.

G305 star-forming complex was observed in the 3-2 lines of 12 & 13CO to investigate the effect of feedback
from the central OB stars on the complex. The region was decomposed into clumps using dendrogram
analysis. A catalog of the clump properties was created. The surface mass densities of the clumps
were plotted as a function of the incident 8um flux. A mask of the region with 8um flux >100 MJy/sr was
created and clumps were categorized based on the extent of overlap with the mask into "mostly inside"
, "partly inside'", & "outside". The surface mass density distribution of each of these populations
were plotted. This was followed by comparing the G305 clumps with the Galactic average taken from
the ATLASGAL and CHIMPS clumps. Finally, the cumulative distribution functions (CDF) of the clump
masses in G305 and their L/M ratios were compared to that of the Galactic sample. The surface mass
densities of clumps showed a positive correlation with the incident 8um flux. The data did not have
sufficient velocity resolution to discern the effects of feedback on the linewidths of the clumps.
The sub-sample of clumps named "mostly inside" had the highest surface mass densities followed
by "partly inside" and "outside" sub-samples. These differences between the three sub-samples
were shown to be statistically significant using the KS test. The "mostly inside" sample also showed
the highest level of fragmentation compared to the other two. These prove that the clumps inside
the G305 region are triggered. The G305 clump population is also statistically different from the
Galactic average population rejecting redistribution as a likely consequence of feedback. The
CDFs of clump masses and their L/M ratios are both flatter than the Galactic average, indicating
that feedback in G305 has triggered star formation. The collect and collapse method is the dominant
mechanism at play in G305.

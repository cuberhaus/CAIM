We present specific star-formation rates for 40 UV-bright galaxies at $z\sim7-8$ observed as part
of the Reionization Era Bright Emission Line Survey (REBELS) ALMA large program. The sSFRs are derived
using improved measures of SFR and stellar masses, made possible by measurements of far-infrared
(FIR) continuum emission and [CII]-based spectroscopic redshifts. For each source in the sample,
we derive stellar masses from SED fitting and total SFRs from calibrations of the UV and FIR emission.
The median sSFR is $18_{-5}^{+7}$ Gyr$^{-1}$, significantly larger than literature measurements
lacking constraints in the FIR. The increase in sSFR reflects the larger obscured SFRs we derive
from the dust continuum relative to that implied by the UV+optical SED. We suggest that such differences
may reflect spatial variations in dust across these luminous galaxies, with the component dominating
the FIR distinct from that dominating the UV. We demonstrate that the inferred stellar masses (and
hence sSFRs) are strongly-dependent on the assumed star formation history (SFH) in reionization-era
galaxies. When large sSFR galaxies are modeled with non-parametric SFHs, the derived stellar masses
can increase by an order of magnitude relative to constant star formation models, owing to the presence
of a significant old stellar population that is outshined by the recent burst. The [CII] line widths
in the largest sSFR systems are often very broad, suggesting dynamical masses that are easily able
to accommodate the dominant old stellar population suggested by non-parametric models. Regardless
of these systematic uncertainties in the derived parameters, we find that the sSFR increases rapidly
toward higher redshifts for massive galaxies ($9.6<\log(\rm M_*/M_{\odot})<9.8$), with a power
law that goes as $(1+z)^{1.7\pm0.3}$, broadly consistent with expectations from the evolving
baryon accretion rates.

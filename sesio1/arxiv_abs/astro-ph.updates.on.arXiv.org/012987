Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) have been extensively used as standardisable candles in the optical
for several decades. However, SNe Ia have shown to be more homogeneous in the near-infrared (NIR),
where the effect of dust extinction is also attenuated. In this work, we explore the possibility
of using a low number of NIR observations for accurate distance estimations, given the homogeneity
at these wavelengths. We found that one epoch in $J$ and/or $H$ band, plus good $gr$-band coverage,
gives an accurate estimation of peak magnitudes in $J$ ($J_{max}$) and $H$ ($H_{max}$) bands. The
use of a single NIR epoch only introduces an additional scatter of $\sim0.05$ mag for epochs around
the time of $B$-band peak magnitude ($T_{max}$). We also tested the effect of optical cadence and
signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) in the estimation of $T_{max}$ and its uncertainty propagation to
the NIR peak magnitudes. Both cadence and S/N have a similar contribution, where we constrained
the introduced scatter of each to $<0.02$ mag in $J_{max}$ and $<0.01$ in $H_{max}$. However, these
effects are expected to be negligible, provided the data quality is comparable to that obtained
for observations of nearby SNe ($z\lesssim0.1$). The effect of S/N in the NIR was tested as well.
For SNe Ia at $0.08<z\lesssim0.1$, NIR observations with better S/N than that found in the CSP sample
is necessary to constrain the introduced scatter to a minimum ($\lesssim0.05$ mag). These results
provide confidence for our FLOWS project that aims in using SNe Ia with public ZTF optical light curves
and few NIR epochs to map out the peculiar velocity field of the local Universe. This will allow us
to determine the distribution of dark matter in our own supercluster, Laniakea, and test the standard
cosmological model by measuring the growth rate of structures, parameterised by $fD$, and the Hubble-Lema\^itre
constant, $H_0$.

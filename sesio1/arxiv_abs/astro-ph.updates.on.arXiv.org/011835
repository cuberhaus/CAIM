Observations of the SNR Cassiopeia A (Cas A) show asymmetries in the reverse shock that cannot be
explained by models describing a remnant expanding through a spherically symmetric wind of the
progenitor star. We investigate whether a past interaction of Cas A with a massive asymmetric shell
of the circumstellar medium can account for the observed asymmetries. We performed 3D MHD simulations
that describe the remnant evolution from the SN to its interaction with a circumstellar shell. The
initial conditions are provided by a 3D neutrino-driven SN model whose morphology resembles Cas
A. We explored the parameter space of the shell, searching for a set of parameters able to produce
reverse shock asymmetries at the age of 350 years analogous to those observed in Cas A. The interaction
of the remnant with the shell can match the observed reverse shock asymmetries if the shell was asymmetric
with the densest portion in the nearside to the northwest (NW). According to our models, the shell
was thin with radius 1.5 pc. The reverse shock shows the following asymmetries at the age of Cas A:
i) it moves inward in the observer frame in the NW region, while it moves outward in other regions;
ii) the geometric center of the reverse shock is offset to the NW by 0.1 pc from the geometric center
of the forward shock; iii) the reverse shock in the NW region has enhanced nonthermal emission because,
there, the ejecta enter the reverse shock with a higher relative velocity (between 4000 and 7000
km/s) than in other regions (below 2000 km/s). Our findings suggest the interaction of Cas A with
an asymmetric circumstellar shell between 180 and 240 years after the SN event. We suggest that the
shell was, most likely, the result of a massive eruption from the progenitor star that occurred about
10^5 years prior to core-collapse. We estimate a total mass of the shell of approximately 2.6 Msun.

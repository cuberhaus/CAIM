The solar nebula contained a number of short-lived radionuclides (SLRs) with half-lives of tens
of Myr or less, comparable to the timescales for formation of protostars and protoplanetary disks.
Therefore, determining the origins of SLRs would provide insights into star formation and the Sun's
astrophysical birth environment. In this chapter, we review how isotopic studies of meteorites
reveal the existence and abundances of these now-extinct radionuclides; and the evidence that
the SLR ${}^{10}{\rm Be}$, which uniquely among the SLRs is not produced during typical stellar
nucleosynthesis, was distributed homogeneously in the solar nebula. We review the evidence that
the SLRs ${}^{26}{\rm Al}$, ${}^{53}{\rm Mn}$, and ${}^{182}{\rm Hf}$, and other radionuclides,
were also homogeneously distributed and can be used to date events during the Solar System's planet-forming
epoch. The homogeneity of the SLRs, especially ${}^{10}{\rm Be}$, strongly suggests they were
all inherited from the Sun's molecular cloud, and that production by irradiation within the solar
nebula was very limited, except for ${}^{36}{\rm Cl}$. We review astrophysical models for the origin
of ${}^{10}{\rm Be}$, showing that it requires that the Sun formed in a spiral arm of the Galaxy with
higher star formation rate than the Galaxy-wide average. Likewise, we review the astrophysical
models for the origins of the other SLRs and show that they likely arose from contamination of the
Sun's molecular cloud by massive stars over tens of Myr, most likely dominated by ejecta from Wolf-Rayet
stars. The other SLRs also demand formation of the Sun in a spiral arm of the Galaxy with a star formation
rate as high as demanded by the Solar System initial ${}^{10}{\rm Be}$ abundance. We discuss the
astrophysical implications, and suggest further tests of these models and future directions for
the field.

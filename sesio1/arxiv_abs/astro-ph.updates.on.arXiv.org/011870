The Friedman-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric is one of the cornerstones of contemporary
cosmology and, together with general relativity, it forms the core of the prevailing $\Lambda$CDM
`concordance' paradigm. A century has now passed since Alexander Friedman first described this
metric in 1922, and we mark this milestone with a review of the history of its development. Arguably,
the $\Lambda$CDM model faces an existential crisis. This has largely been brought about by its reliance
on the twin concepts of dark matter and dark energy, and the continued inability of the observational
and theoretical physics community to find viable candidates for these postulated phenomena. While
it is still possible that this search will eventually prove successful, it is perhaps worthwhile
looking at alternatives, and in particular, re-examining the very foundations of our current cosmological
model to see whether an entirely new cosmological paradigm might provide a better explanation.
The main failures of the prevailing cosmological paradigm are reviewed, concentrating on the coincidences
and contradictions presented by the relationship between dark matter and dark energy. Revisiting
the core features of this paradigm, the FLRW metric is identified as the likely root cause of current
issues with the $\Lambda$CDM model. Building on the concept of a `timeless' universe suggested
by a number of theorists in recent years, the exochronous metric is introduced and is shown to give
rise to a static solution to the Einstein field equations. The cosmological implications of this
model are explored, and we demonstrate that it can result in a universe with a critical energy density
that is close to the currently observed baryonic matter density, without the need to invoke dark
matter or dark energy.

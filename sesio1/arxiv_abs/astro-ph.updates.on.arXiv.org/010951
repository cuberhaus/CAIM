Abstract: Assuming that the numerical diffusivity triggered by violations of the force-free electrodynamics
constraints is a proxy for the physical resistivity, we examine its impact on the overall dynamics
of force-free aligned pulsar magnetospheres endowed with an equatorial current sheet. We assess
the constraint violations as a diffusivity source. The effects of modifications on electric fields
used to restore force-free conditions are not confined to the equatorial current sheet, but modify
the magnetospheric dynamics on timescales shorter than the pulsar rotational period. These corrections
propagate especially via a channel that was unexplored, namely, changes induced to the electric
charge density, $\rho$. We quantify the global consequences of diffusivity by comparing different
techniques to model $\rho$. By default, we combine a conservative $\rho$-evolution with hyperbolic/parabolic
cleaning of inaccuracies in the Maxwell equations. As an alternative, we enforce a constrained
evolution where $\rho$ is directly computed as the electric field divergence. The conservative
approach reduces the Poynting flux dissipated in the equatorial current sheet by an order of magnitude,
along with an increase of the pulsar luminosity driven by a shift of the Y-point location. The luminosity
changes according to $L_{\rm Y}\propto \alpha^{0.11}$, where $\alpha$ is the ratio of diffusion
to advection timescales, controlling the amount of (numerical) diffusivity. Our models suggest
interpreting the luminosity dependence on the Y-point location as differences in resistivities
encountered at the equatorial current sheet. Alternatively, they could be interpreted in terms
of the pair formation multiplicity, $\kappa$, smaller diffusion being consistent with $\kappa\gg
1$.

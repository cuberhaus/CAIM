The data from the event horizon telescope have provided a novel view of the vicinity of the horizon
of a black hole (BH), by imaging the region around the light-ring. They have also raised hopes for
measuring in the near future, features of the image (or the shadow) related to higher order effects
of photons traveling in these regions, such as the appearance of higher order bright rings. While
the prospect of measuring these fine features of Kerr BHs is very interesting in itself, there are
some even more intriguing prospects for observing novel features of possible non-Kerr objects,
in the case that the subjects of our images are not the BH solutions of GR. In the hope of sufficient
resolution being available in the future, we explore in this work the structure and properties of
null geodesics around a Hartle-Thorne spacetime that includes a deformation from the Kerr spacetime
characterised by the quadrupole deformation $\delta q$. These spacetimes have been found to exhibit
a bifurcation of the equatorial light-ring to two off-equatorial light-rings in a range of $\delta
q$s and spin parameters. In addition to this, there is a range of parameters where both the equatorial
and the off-equatorial light-rings are present. This results in the formation of a pocket that can
trap photons. We investigate the properties of these trapped orbits and find that chaotic behaviour
emerges. Some of these chaotic orbits are additionally found to be "sticky" and get trapped close
to periodic orbits for long times. We also explore how these novel features affect the shadow and
find that the off-equatorial light-rings produce distinctive features that deform its circular
shape, while the chaotic behaviour associated to the pocket creates features with fractal structure.
These results are shown to be quite general, extending to higher order Hartle-Thorne spacetimes.

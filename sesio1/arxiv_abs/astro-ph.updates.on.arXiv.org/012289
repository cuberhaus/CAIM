Space-borne gravitational wave detectors like TianQin are expected to detect GW signals emitted
by the mergers of massive black hole binaries. Luminosity distance information can be obtained
from GW observations, and one can perform cosmological inference if redshift information can also
be extracted, which would be straightforward if an electromagnetic counterpart exists. In this
paper, we concentrate on the conservative scenario where the EM counterparts are not available,
and comprehensively study if cosmological parameters can be inferred through a statistical approach,
utilizing the non-uniform distribution of galaxies as well as the black hole mass-host galaxy bulge
luminosity relationship. By adopting different massive black hole binary merger models, and assuming
different detector configurations, we conclude that the statistical inference of cosmological
parameters is indeed possible. TianQin is expected to constrain the Hubble constant to a relative
error of about 4%-7%, depending on the underlying model. The multidetector network of TianQin and
LISA can significantly improve the precision of cosmological parameters. In the most favorable
model, it is possible to achieve a level of 1.7% with a network of TianQin and LISA. We find that without
EM counterparts, constraints on all other parameters need a larger number of events or more precise
sky localization of GW sources, which can be achieved by the multidetector network or under a favorable
model for massive black hole mergers. However, in the optimistic case, where EM counterparts are
available, one can obtain useful constraints on all cosmological parameters in the Lambda-CDM
cosmology, regardless of the population model. Moreover, we can also constrain the equation of
state of the dark energy without the EM counterparts, and it is even possible to study the evolution
of EoS of the DE when the EM counterparts are observed.

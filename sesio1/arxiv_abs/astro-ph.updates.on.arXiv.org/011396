Plasma loops or plumes rooted in sunspot umbrae often harbor downflows with speeds of 100 km/s. These
downflows are supersonic at transition region temperatures of 0.1 MK. The source of these flows
is not well understood. We aim to investigate the source of sunspot supersonic downflows (SSDs)
in AR 12740 using simultaneous spectroscopic and imaging observations. We identified SSD events
from multiple raster scans of a sunspot by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph, and calculated
the electron densities, mass fluxes and velocities of these SSDs. The EUV images provided by the
AIA onboard the SDO and the EUVI onboard the STEREO were employed to investigate the origin of these
SSDs and their associated coronal rain. Almost all the identified SSDs appear at the footpoints
of sunspot plumes and are temporally associated with appearance of chromospheric bright dots inside
the sunspot umbra. Dual-perspective EUV imaging observations reveal a large-scale closed magnetic
loop system spanning the sunspot region and a remote region. We observed that the SSDs are caused
by repeated coronal rain that forms and flows along these closed magnetic loops toward the sunspot.
One episode of coronal rain clearly indicates that reconnection near a coronal X-shaped structure
first leads to the formation of a magnetic dip. Subsequently, hot coronal plasma catastrophically
cools from 2 MK in the dip region via thermal instability. This results in the formation of a transient
prominence in the dip, from which the cool gas mostly slides into the sunspot along inclined magnetic
fields under the gravity. This drainage process manifests as a continuous rain flow, which lasts
for around 2 hrs and concurrently results in a nearly steady SSD event. Our results demonstrate that
coronal condensation in magnetic dips can result in the quasi-steady sunspot supersonic downflows.

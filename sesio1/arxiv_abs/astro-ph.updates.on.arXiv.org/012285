Runaway stars are ejected from their place of birth in the Galactic disk, with some young B-type runaways
found several tens of kiloparsecs from the plane traveling at speeds beyond the escape velocity.
Young open clusters are a likely place of origin, and ejection may be either through N-body interactions
or in binary supernova explosions. The excellent quality of Gaia astrometry opens up the path to
study the kinematics of young runaway stars to such a high precision that the place of origin in open
stellar clusters can be identified uniquely. We developed an efficient minimization method to
calculate whether two or more objects may come from the same place, which we tested against samples
of Orion runaways. Our fitting procedure was then used to calculate trajectories for known runaway
stars where we used Gaia data and updated radial velocities. We found that only half of the sample
could be classified as runaways while the others were walkaway stars. Most of the latter stars turned
out to be binaries. We identified parent clusters for runaways based on their trajectories and then
used cluster age and flight time of the stars to investigate whether the ejection was likely due to
a binary supernova or due to a dynamical ejection. In particular, we show that the classical runaways
AE Aurigae and $\mu$ Columbae might not have originated together, with $\mu$ Columbae having an
earlier ejection from Collinder 69, a cluster near the ONC. The second sample investigated comprises
a set of distant runaway B stars in the halo which have been studied carefully by quantitative spectral
analyses. We are able to identify candidate parent clusters for at least four stars including the
hyper-runaway candidate HIP 60350. The ejection events had to be very violent, ejecting stars at
velocities as large as 150 to 400 km/s.

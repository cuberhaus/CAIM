Oscillating red-giant stars in binary systems are an ideal testbed for investigating the structure
and evolution of stars in the advanced phases of evolution. With 83 known red giants in binary systems,
of which only ~40 have determined global seismic parameters and orbital parameters, the sample
is small compared to the numerous known oscillating stars. The detection of red-giant binary systems
is typically obtained from the signature of stellar binarity in space photometry. The time base
of such data biases the detection towards systems with shorter periods and orbits of insufficient
size to allow a red giant to fully extend as it evolves up the red-giant branch. Consequently, the
sample shows an excess of H-shell burning giants while containing very few stars in the He-core burning
phase. From the ninth catalogue of spectroscopic binary orbits (SB9), we identified candidate
systems hosting a red-giant primary component. Searching space photometry from the NASA missions
Kepler, K2, and TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) as well as the BRITE (BRIght Target
Explorer) constellation mission, we find 99 systems, which were previously unknown to host an oscillating
giant component. The revised search strategy allowed us to extend the range of orbital periods of
systems hosting oscillating giants up to 26000days. Such wide orbits allow a rich population of
He-core burning primaries, which are required for a complete view of stellar evolution from binary
studies. Tripling the size of the sample of known oscillating red-giant stars in binary systems
is an important step towards an ensemble approach for seismology and tidal studies. While for non-eclipsing
binaries the inclination is unknown, such a seismically well-characterized sample will be a treasure
trove in combination with Gaia astrometric orbits for binary~systems.

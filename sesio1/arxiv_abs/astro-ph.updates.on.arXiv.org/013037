We explore in this paper the heating and differentiation of rocky planets that grow by rapid pebble
accretion. Our terrestrial planets grow exterior of the water ice line and initially accrete 28%
water ice by mass. The accretion of water stops after the protoplanet reaches a mass of $0.01\,M_{\rm
E}$ where the gas envelope becomes hot enough to sublimate the ice and transport the vapour back to
the protoplanetary disc by recycling flows. The energy released by the decay of $^{26}$Al within
the growing protoplanet melts the accreted ice to form clay (phyllosilicates), oxidized iron (FeO)
and a surface layer of water with ten times the mass of the Earth's modern oceans. The ocean--atmosphere
system undergoes a run-away greenhouse effect after the effective accretion temperature of the
protoplanet crosses a threshold of around 300 K. The run-away greenhouse process vaporizes the
water layer, thereby trapping the accretion heat and heating the surface to more than 6,000 K. This
causes the upper part of the mantle to melt and form a global magma ocean. Metal melt separates from
silicate melt and sediments towards the bottom of the magma ocean; the gravitational energy released
by the sedimentation leads to a positive feedback where the beginning differentiation of the planet
causes the whole mantle to melt and differentiate. All rocky planets thus naturally experience
a magma ocean stage. We demonstrate that Earth's small excess of $^{182}$W (the decay product of
$^{182}$Hf) relative to the chondrites is consistent with such rapid core formation within 5 Myr
followed by equilibration of the W reservoir in the Earth's mantle with $^{182}$W-poor material
from the core of a planetary-mass impactor. The planetary collision must have occurred at least
35 Myr after the main accretion phase of the terrestrial planets.

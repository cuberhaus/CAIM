Gravitational-wave (GW) signals from coalescing compact binaries carry enormous information
about the source dynamics and are an excellent tool to probe unknown astrophysics and fundamental
physics. Though the updated catalog of compact binary signals reports evidence for slowly spinning
systems and unequal mass binaries, the data so far cannot provide convincing proof of strongly precessing
binaries. Here, we use the GW inference library parallel Bilby to compare the performance of two
waveform models for measuring spin-induced orbital precession. One of the waveform models incorporates
both spin-precession effects and sub-dominant harmonics. The other model accounts for precession
but only includes the leading harmonic. By simulating signals with varying mass ratios and spins,
we find that the waveform model with sub-dominant harmonics enables us to infer the presence of precession
in most cases accurately. In contrast, the dominant model often fails to extract enough information
to measure precession. In particular, it cannot distinguish a face-on highly precessing binary
from a slowly precessing binary system irrespective of the binary's mass ratio. As expected, we
see a significant improvement in measuring precession for edge-on binaries. Other intrinsic parameters
also become better constrained, indicating that precession effects help break the correlations
between mass and spin parameters. However, the precession measurements are prior dominated for
equal-mass binaries with face-on orientation, even if we employ waveform model including subdominant
harmonics. In this case, doubling the signal-to-noise ratio does not help to reduce these prior
induced biases. As we expect detections of highly spinning binary signals with misaligned spin
orientations in the future, simulation studies like ours are crucial for understanding the prospects
and limitations of GW parameter inferences.

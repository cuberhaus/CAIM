Gravitational wave (GW) standard sirens are well-established probes with which one can measure
cosmological parameters, and are complementary to other probes like the cosmic microwave background
or supernovae standard candles. Here we focus on dark GW sirens, specifically binary black holes
(BBHs) for which there is only GW data. W rely on the assumption of a source mass model for the BBH distribution,
and we consider four models that are representative of the BBH population observed so far. In addition
to inferring cosmological and mass model parameters, we use dark sirens to test modified gravity
theories. These theories often predict a different GW propagation, leading to a changed GW luminosity
distance which in some cases can be parametrized by variables $\Xi_0$ and $n$. General relativity
(GR) corresponds to $\Xi_0= 1$. We perform a joint estimate of the population parameters governing
mass, redshift, cosmology, and GW propagation. We use data from the third LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observation
run (O3) and find -- for the four mass models and three signal-to-noise cutoffs -- that GR is consistently
the preferred model to describe all observed BBH GW signals to date. Furthermore, all modified gravity
parameters have posteriors that are compatible with the values predicted by GR at the $90\%$ confidence
interval. We then focus on future observation runs O4 and O5. We show that there are strong correlations
between cosmological, astrophysical and modified gravity parameters. If GR is the correct theory
of gravity, and assuming narrow priors on the cosmological parameters, we recover the modified
gravity parameter $\Xi_0 = 1.47^{+0.92}_{-0.57} $ with O4, and $\Xi_0 = 1.08 ^{+0.27}_{-0.16}$
with O4 and O5. If, however, Nature follows a modified gravity model with $\Xi_0=1.8$ and $n=1.91$,
we exclude GR at the 1.7$\,\sigma$ level with O4 and at the $2.3\,\sigma$ level with O4 and O5 combined.

Recently Vernstrom et al. (2021) reported the first definitive detection of the synchrotron cosmic
web, obtained by `stacking' hundreds of thousands of pairs of close-proximity clusters in low-frequency
radio observations and looking for a residual excess signal spanning the intercluster bridge.
We attempt to reproduce these results by stacking similarly close-proximity clusters from the
FIlaments and GAlactic RadiO (FIGARO; Hodgson et al., 2021a) simulation. We do so to understand
whether these empirical cosmic web detection results are consistent with our current best models
of the radio sky, as well as to understand and constrain any potential confounding factors that could
introduce false positive signals. Specifically, in addition to testing whether the cosmic web
itself produces excess intercluster emission, we also test whether the stacking signal is polluted
by the presence of the intervening radio population of active galactic nucleii and star forming
galaxies, the low luminosity population of radio halos, and the effect of the sidelobes of the interferometric
dirty beam. Ultimately, we find that we are unable to reproduce their excess intercluster emission
in our own stacks, either due to the cosmic web or any additional polluting factors. We do, however,
predict the appearance of excess emission on the immediate interiors of cluster pairs as a result
of asymmetric, `radio relic'-like shocks surrounding cluster cores, and which we predict to be
on the cusp of detection in their stacks. This difference in the location of excess emission in the
stacked signal prohibits a simple resolution in the form of a scaling factor, leaving the discrepancy
between these simulation results and the empirical observations of Vernstrom et al. unresolved.

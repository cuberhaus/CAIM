The near-absence of compact massive quiescent galaxies in the local Universe implies a size evolution
since $z\sim2.5$. It is often theorised that such `red nuggets' have evolved into today's elliptical
(E) galaxies via an E-to-E transformation. We examine an alternative scenario in which a red nugget
develops a rotational disc through mergers and accretion, say, at $1\lesssim z\lesssim2$, thereby
cloaking the nugget as the extant bulge/spheroid component of a larger, now old, galaxy. We have
performed detailed, physically-motivated, multi-component decompositions of a volume-limited
sample of 103 massive ($M_*/\rm M_{\odot} \gtrsim 1\times 10^{11}$) galaxies within 110\,Mpc.
Among our 28 galaxies with existing elliptical classifications, we found that 18 have large-scale
discs, and two have intermediate-scale discs, and are reclassified here as lenticulars (S0) and
elliculars (ES). The local spheroid stellar mass function, size-mass diagram and bulge-to-total
($B/T$) flux ratio are presented. We report lower-limits for the volume number density of compact
massive spheroids, $n_\mathrm{c,Sph}\sim (0.17$-$1.2) \times 10^{-4}\,\rm Mpc^{-3}$, based
on different definitions of `red nuggets' in the literature. Similar number densities of local
compact massive bulges were reported by de la Rosa et al. using automated two-component decompositions
and their existence is now abundantly clear with our multi-component decompositions. We find disc-cloaking
to be a salient alternative for galaxy evolution. In particular, instead of an E-to-E process, disc
growth is the dominant evolutionary pathway for at least low-mass ($1\times10^{10}<M_*/\rm M_{\odot}
\lessapprox 4 \times 10^{10}$) red nuggets, while our current lower-limits are within an alluring
factor of a few of the peak abundance of high-mass red nuggets at $1\lesssim z\lesssim2$.

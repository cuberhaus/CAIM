We investigate the warm ionized gas in the blue compact galaxy (BCG) Haro 14 by means of integral field
spectroscopic observations taken with the MUSE/VLT. The large FoV of MUSE and its unprecedented
sensitivity enable observations of the galaxy nebular emission up to large galactocentric distances.
This allowed us to trace the ionized gas morphology and ionization structure up to kiloparsec scales
and, for the first time, to accurately investigate the excitation mechanism operating in the outskirts
of a typical BCG. The intensity and diagnostic maps reveal at least two highly distinct components
of ionized gas: the bright central regions, mostly made of individual clumps, and a faint component
which extends up to kiloparsec scales and consists of widespread diffuse emission, well-delineated
filamentary structures, and faint knots. Noteworthy are the two curvilinear filaments extending
up to 2 and 2.3 kpc southwest, which likely trace the edges of supergiant expanding bubbles driven
by galactic outflows. We find that while the central clumps in Haro 14 are HII-region complexes,
the morphology and line ratios of the whole low-surface-brightness component are not compatible
with star formation photoionization. In the spatially resolved emission-line-ratio diagnostic
diagrams, spaxels above the maximum starburst line form the majority. Moreover, our findings suggest
that more than one alternative mechanism is ionizing the outer galaxy regions. The properties of
the diffuse component are consistent with ionization by diluted radiation and the large filaments
and shells are most probably shocked areas at the edge of bubbles. The mechanism responsible for
the ionization of the faint individual clumps observed in the galaxy periphery is more difficult
to assess. These clumps could be the shocked debris of fragmented shells or regions where star formation
is proceeding under extreme conditions.

The complexity of atmospheric retrieval models is largely data-driven and one-dimensional models
have generally been considered adequate with current data quality. However, recent studies have
suggested that using 1D models in retrievals can result in anomalously cool terminator temperatures
and biased abundance estimates even with existing transmission spectra of hot Jupiters. Motivated
by these claims and upcoming high-quality transmission spectra we systematically explore the
limitations of 1D models using synthetic and current observations. We use 1D models of varying complexity,
both analytic and numerical, to revisit claims of biases when interpreting transmission spectra
of hot Jupiters with inhomogeneous terminator compositions. Overall, we find the reported biases
to be resulting from specific model assumptions rather than intrinsic limitations of 1D atmospheric
models in retrieving current observations of asymmetric terminators. Additionally, we revise
atmospheric retrievals of the hot Jupiter WASP-43b ($T_{\rm eq}=1440$ K) and the ultra-hot Jupiter
WASP-103b ($T_{\rm eq}=2484$ K ) for which previous studies inferred abnormally cool atmospheric
temperatures. We retrieve temperatures consistent with expectations. We note, however, that
in the limit of extreme terminator inhomogeneities and high data quality some atmospheric inferences
may conceivably be biased, although to a lesser extent than previously claimed. To address such
cases, we implement a 2D retrieval framework for transmission spectra which allows accurate constraints
on average atmospheric properties and provides insights into the spectral ranges where the imprints
of atmospheric inhomogeneities are strongest. Our study highlights the need for careful considerations
of model assumptions and data quality before attributing biases in retrieved estimates to unaccounted
atmospheric inhomogeneities.

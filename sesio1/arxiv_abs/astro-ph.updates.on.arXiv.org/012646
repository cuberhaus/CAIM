Atomic gas in the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) is organized in filamentary structures. These
structures usually host cold and dense molecular clumps. The Galactic magnetic field is considered
to play an important role in the formation of these clumps. Our goal is to explore the role of the magnetic
field in the HI - H$_{2}$ transition process. We targeted a filamentary cloud where gas transitions
from atomic to molecular. This cloud is located at the edges of an expanding structure, known as the
North Celestial Pole Loop (NCPL). We probed the magnetic field properties of the cloud with optical
polarization observations. We performed multi-wavelength spectroscopic observations of different
species in order to probe the gas phase properties of the cloud. We identified two distinct sub-regions
within the cloud. One of the regions hosts purely atomic gas, while the other is dominated by molecular
gas although most of it is CO-dark. The estimated plane-of-the-sky magnetic field strength between
the two regions remains constant within uncertainties and lies in the range 20 ~ 30$~\mu$G. The total
magnetic field strength does not scale with density which implies that gas is compressed along the
field lines. We also found that turbulence is sub-Alfv\'enic. The HI velocity gradients are in general
perpendicular to the mean magnetic field orientation, except for the region close to the CO clump
where they tend to become parallel. The latter is likely related to gas undergoing gravitational
infall. The magnetic field morphology of the target cloud is parallel to the HI column density structure
of the cloud in the atomic region, while it tends to become perpendicular to the HI structure in the
molecular region. If this is verified in more cases it has important consequences for the ISM magnetic
field modeling with HI data.

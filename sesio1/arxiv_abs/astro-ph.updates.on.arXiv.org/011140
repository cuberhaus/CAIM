Next-generation surveys will provide photometric and spectroscopic data of millions to billions
of galaxies with unprecedented precision. This offers a unique chance to improve our understanding
of the galaxy evolution and the unresolved nature of dark matter (DM). At galaxy scales, the density
distribution of DM is strongly affected by the astrophysical feedback processes, which are difficult
to fully account for in classical techniques to derive mass models. In this work, we explore the capability
of supervised learning algorithms to predict the DM content of galaxies from luminous observational-like
parameters, using the public catalog of the TNG100 simulation. In particular, we use Photometric,
Structural and Kinematic parameters to predict the total DM mass, DM half-mass radius, DM mass inside
one and two stellar half-mass radii. We adopt the coefficient of determination, $R^2$, as a reference
metric to evaluate the accuracy of these predictions. We find that the Photometric features alone
are able to predict the total DM mass with fair accuracy, while Structural and Photometric features
together are more effective to determine the DM inside the stellar half mass radius, and the DM within
twice the stellar half mass radius. However, using all observational quantities together (Photometry,
Structural and Kinematics) incredibly improves the overall accuracy for all DM quantities. This
first test shows that Machine Learning tools are promising approaches to derive predictions of
the DM in real galaxies. The next steps will be to improve observational realism of the training sets,
by closely select samples which accurately reproduce the typical observed luminous scaling relations.
The trained pipelines will be suitable for real galaxy data collected from the next-generation
surveys like Rubin/LSST, Euclid, CSST, 4MOST, DESI, to derive, e.g., the properties of their central
DM fractions.

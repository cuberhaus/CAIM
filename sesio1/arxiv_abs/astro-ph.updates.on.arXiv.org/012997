The fate of a massive star during the latest stages of its evolution is highly dependent on its mass-loss
history and geometry, with the yellow hypergiants being key objects to study those phases of evolution.
We present near-IR interferometric observations of the famous yellow hypergiant IRC +10420 and
blue spectra taken between 1994-2019. Our 2.2 $\mu$m GRAVITY/VLTI observations attain a spatial
resolution of $\sim$5 stellar radii and probe the hot emission in the K-band tracing the gas via Na
i double emission and the Br$\gamma$ emission. The observed configurations spatially resolve
the 2.2 $\mu$m continuum as well as the Br$\gamma$ and the Na i emission lines. Our geometric modelling
demonstrates the presence of a compact neutral zone (Na i) which is slightly larger than the continuum
but within an extended Br$\gamma$ emitting region. Our geometric models of the Br$\gamma$ emission
confirm an hour-glass geometry of the wind. To explain this peculiar geometry we investigate the
presence of a companion at 7-800 au separations and find no signature at the contrast limit of our
observations (3.7 mag at 3$\sigma$). We report an evolution of the ejecta over a time span of 7 years,
which allows us to constrain the opening angle of the hour-glass geometry at $<$10$^\circ$. Lastly,
we present the first blue optical spectra of IRC +10420 since 1994. The multi-epoch data indicate
that the spectral type, and thus temperature, of the object has essentially remained constant during
the intervening years. This confirms earlier conclusions that following an increase in temperature
of 2000 K in less than two decades prior to 1994, the temperature increase has halted. This suggests
that this yellow hypergiant has "hit" the White Wall in the HR-diagram preventing it from evolving
blue-wards, and will likely undergo a major mass-loss event in the near future.

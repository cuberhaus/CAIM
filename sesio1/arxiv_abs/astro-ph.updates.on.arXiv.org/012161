We describe a versatile pipeline for processing the data collected by the Ultra-Violet Imaging
Telescope (UVIT) on board Indian Multi-wavelength astronomical satellite AstroSat.The UVIT
instrument carries out simultaneous astronomical imaging through selected filters / gratings
in Far-Ultra-Violet (FUV), Near-Ultra-Violet & visible (VIS) bands of the targeted circular sky
field (~ 0.5 deg dia). This pipeline converts the data (Level-1) emanating from UVIT in their raw
primitive format supplemented by inputs from the spacecraft sub-systems into UV sky images (& slitless
grating spectra) and associated products readily usable by astronomers (Level-2). The primary
products include maps of Intensity (rate of photon arrival), error on Intensity and effective Exposure.
The pipeline is open source, extensively user configurable with many selectable parameters and
its execution is fully automated. The key ingredients of the pipeline includes - extraction of drift
in pointing of the spacecraft, and disturbances in pointing due to internal movements; application
of various corrections to measured position in the detector for each photon - e.g. differential
pointing with respect to a reference frame for shift and add operation, systematic effects and artifacts
in the optics of the telescopes and detectors, exposure tracking on the sky, alignment of sky products
from multi-episode exposures to generate a consolidated set and astrometry. Detailed logs of operations
and intermediate products for every processing stage are accessible via user selectable options.
While large number of selectable parameters are available for the user, a well characterized standard
default set is used for executing this pipeline at the Payload Operation Centre (POC) for UVIT and
selected products are archived and disseminated by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO)
through its ISSDC portal.

The present study investigates a mini-filament eruption associated with cancelling magnetic
fluxes. The eruption originates from a small-scale loop complex commonly known as a Coronal Bright
Point (CBP). The event is uniquely recorded in both the imaging and spectroscopic data taken with
IRIS. We analyse IRIS spectroscopic and slit-jaw imaging observations as well as images taken in
the extreme-ultraviolet channels of AIA, and line-of-sight magnetic-field data from HMI onboard
the SDO. We also employ an NLFFF relaxation approach based on the HMI magnetogram time series. We
identify a strong small-scale brightening as a micro-flare in a CBP. The mini-eruption manifests
with the ejection of hot (CBP loops) and cool (mini-filament) plasma recorded in both the imaging
and spectroscopic data. The micro-flare is preceded by the appearance of an elongated bright feature
in the IRIS slit-jaw 1400 A images located above the polarity inversion line. The micro-flare starts
with an IRIS pixel size brightening and propagates bi-directionally along the elongated feature.
We detect in both the spectral and imaging IRIS data and AIA data, strong flows along and at the edges
of the elongated feature which we believe represent reconnection outflows. Both edges of the elongated
feature that wrap around the edges of the erupting MF evolve into a J-type shape creating a sigmoid
appearance. A quasi-separatrix layer (QSL) is identified in the vicinity of the polarity inversion
line by computing the squashing factor Q in different horizontal planes of the NLFFF model. The QSL
reconnection site has the same spectral appearance as the so-called explosive events identified
by strong blue- and red-shifted emission, thus answering a long outstanding question about the
true nature of this spectral phenomenon.

[abridged] We present a 1+1D global magnetically-driven disk accretion model that captures the
essence of the MRI-driven accretion, without resorting to 3D global non-ideal MHD simulations.
The gas dynamics is assumed to be solely controlled by the MRI and hydrodynamic instabilities. For
given stellar and disk parameters, the Shakura-Sunyaev viscosity parameter $\alpha$ is determined
self-consistently under the framework of viscously-driven accretion from detailed considerations
of the MRI with non-ideal MHD effects (Ohmic resistivity and ambipolar diffusion), accounting
for disk heating by stellar irradiation, non-thermal sources of ionization, and dust effects on
the ionization chemistry. Additionally, the magnetic field strength is constrained and adopted
to maximize the MRI activity. We demonstrate the use of our framework by investigating steady-state
MRI-driven accretion in a fiducial protoplanetary disk model around a solar-type star. We find
that the equilibrium solution displays no pressure maximum at the dead zone outer edge, except if
a sufficient amount of dust particles have accumulated there before the disk reaches a steady-state
accretion regime. Furthermore, the steady-state accretion solution describes a disk that displays
a spatially extended long-lived inner disk gas reservoir (the dead zone) accreting a few $10^{-9}\,
M_{\odot}.\rm{yr}^{-1}$. By conducting a detailed parameter study, we find that the extend to
which the MRI can drive efficient accretion is primarily determined by the total disk gas mass, the
representative grain size, the vertically-integrated dust-to-gas mass ratio, and the stellar
X-ray luminosity. A self-consistent time-dependent coupling between gas, dust, stellar evolution
models and our general framework on million-year timescales is required to fully understand the
formation of dead zones and their potential to trap dust particles.

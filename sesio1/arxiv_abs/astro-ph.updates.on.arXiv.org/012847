Spectroscopic data are necessary to break degeneracies in asteroseismic modelling of the interior
structure in high- and intermediate-mass stars. We derive precise photospheric stellar parameters
for a sample of 166 B-type stars with TESS light curves, suitable for detailed asteroseismic studies,
through a homogeneous spectroscopic analysis. The variability types of these stars are classified
based on all currently available TESS sectors. We obtained high-resolution spectra for all 166
targets with the FEROS spectrograph in the context of a large program. The Least-Squares Deconvolution
method is employed to investigate spectral line profile variability and to detect binary systems.
We identify 26 spectroscopic double-lined binaries; the remainder of the sample are 42 supergiants
in the LMC galaxy and 98 Galactic stars. The spectra of the Galactic stars are analysed with the zeta-Payne,
a machine learning-based spectrum analysis algorithm. We determine the five main surface parameters
with average formal precisions of 70 K (Teff), 0.03 dex (logg), 0.07 dex ([M/H]), 8 km/s (vsini),
and 0.7 km/s (vmicro). The average internal uncertainties we find for FEROS spectra with our spectrum
analysis method are 430 K (Teff), 0.12 dex (logg), 0.13 dex ([M/H]), 12 km/s (vsini), and 2 km/s (vmicro).
We find spectroscopic evidence that eight of the 98 Galactic targets are fast rotating g-mode pulsators
occurring in between the slowly pulsating B (SPB) stars and delta Scuti instability strips. The
g-mode frequencies of these pulsators are shifted to relatively high frequency values due to their
rotation. Their apparently too low Teff relative to the SPB instability region can in most cases
be explained by the gravity darkening effect. We also discover 13 new HgMn stars of which only one
is found in a spectroscopic binary, resulting in a biased and therefore unreliable low binary rate
of only 8%.

The hot ($>10^6$ K) phase of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) contains a large fraction of baryons
in galaxies. It also retains signatures of the processes that shaped the galaxies, such as feedback
from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and supernovae, and offers a unique and powerful way to constrain
theoretical models of feedback. It is, however, notoriously difficult to detect. By stacking 2643
optically selected galaxies in the eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth Survey (eFEDS), we present spatially
resolved properties of the large-scale CGM in both star-forming and quiescent galaxies spanning
an order of magnitude in stellar mass. We mask out resolved point sources and galaxy groups/clusters
and model the contribution from X-ray binaries and the hot ISM, producing accurate radial profiles
of the CGM. We compare these data with mock X-ray observations of galaxy stacks in the IllustrisTNG100
(TNG) and EAGLE cosmological simulations. We detect extended emission from both the high-mass
($10.7<\log(M_*/M_\odot)<11.2$) and low-mass ($10.2<\log(M_*/M_\odot)<10.7$) galaxy stacks.
Galaxies have somewhat more luminous CGM between $10-100$~kpc if they are more massive or star-forming.
However, the CGM luminosity increases slower with stellar mass than predicted in simulations.
In star-forming galaxies, the observed profiles are shallower than in simulations, suggesting
that stellar feedback models are not efficient enough at blowing gas out. In quenched, high-mass
galaxies the observed profiles are cuspier than observed, suggesting that AGN feedback models
are too efficient at blowing gas out. Low-mass, quenched galaxies, where both supernova and AGN
feedback models are inefficient, agree with simulations. Our results highlight the need to modify
future prescriptions of galaxy formation models, particularly as they pertain to feedback and
chemical enrichment of the CGM.

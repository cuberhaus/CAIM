In order to allow for a comparison with the measurements from other antenna systems, the voltage
power spectral density measured by the Radio and Plasma waves receiver (RPW) on board Solar Orbiter
needs to be converted into physical quantities that depend on the intrinsic properties of the radiation
itself.The main goal of this study is to perform a calibration of the RPW dipole antenna system that
allows for the conversion of the voltage power spectral density measured at the receiver's input
into the incoming flux density. We used space observations from the Thermal Noise Receiver (TNR)
and the High Frequency Receiver (HFR) to perform the calibration of the RPW dipole antenna system.
Observations of type III bursts by the Wind spacecraft are used to obtain a reference radio flux density
for cross-calibrating the RPW dipole antennas. The analysis of a large sample of HFR observations
(over about ten months), carried out jointly with an analysis of TNR-HFR data and prior to the antennas'
deployment, allowed us to estimate the reference system noise of the TNR-HFR receivers. We obtained
the effective length of the RPW dipoles and the reference system noise of TNR-HFR in space, where
the antennas and pre-amplifiers are embedded in the solar wind plasma. The obtained $l_{eff}$ values
are in agreement with the simulation and measurements performed on the ground. By investigating
the radio flux intensities of 35 type III bursts simultaneously observed by Solar Orbiter and Wind,
we found that while the scaling of the decay time as a function of the frequency is the same for the Waves
and RPW instruments, their median values are higher for the former. This provides the first observational
evidence that Type III radio waves still undergo density scattering, even when they propagate from
the source, in a medium with a plasma frequency that is well below their own emission frequency.

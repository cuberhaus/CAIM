Stripped-envelope supernovae (SE SNe) of Type Ib and Type Ic are thought to result from explosions
of massive stars having lost their outer envelopes. The favoured explosion mechanism is by core-collapse,
with the shock later revived by neutrino heating. However, there is an upper limit to the amount of
radioactive Nickel-56 that such models can accomplish. Recent literature point to a tension between
the maximum luminosity from such simulations and observations. We use a well characterized sample
of SE SNe from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Bright Transient Survey (BTS) to collect a sample
of spectroscopically classified normal Type Ibc SNe for which we use the ZTF light curves to determine
the maximum luminosity. We cull the sample further based on data quality, light-curve shape, distance
and colors. The methodology of the sample construction from this BTS sample can be used for many other
future investigations. In total we use 129 Type Ib or Type Ic BTS SNe with an initial rough luminosity
distribution peaked at Mr = -17.61 +- 0.72, and where 36% are apparently brighter than the theoretically
predicted maximum brightness of Mr = -17.8. When we further cull this sample to ensure that the SNe
are normal Type Ibc with good LC data within the Hubble flow, the sample of 94 objects has Mr = -17.64
+- 0.54. A main uncertainty in absolute magnitude determinations for SNe is the host galaxy extinction
correction, but the reddened objects only get more luminous after corrections. If we simply exclude
objects with red, unusual or uncertain colors, we are left with 14 objects at M = -17.90 +- 0.73, whereof
a handful are most certainly brighter than the suggested theoretical limit. The main result of this
study is thus that normal SNe Ibc do indeed reach luminosities above $10^{42.6}$ erg/s, apparently
in conflict with existing explosion models.

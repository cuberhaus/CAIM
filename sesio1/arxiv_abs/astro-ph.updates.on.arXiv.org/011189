We present detailed elemental abundances, radial velocity, and orbital elements for Patchick~125,
a recently discovered metal-poor globular cluster (GC) in the direction of the Galactic bulge.
Near-infrared high-resolution ($R\sim22,500$) spectra of two members were obtained during the
second phase of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment at Las Campanas Observatory
as part of the sixteenth Data Release (DR 16) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We investigated elemental
abundances for four chemical species, including $\alpha$- (Mg, Si), Fe-peak (Fe), and odd-Z (Al)
elements. We find a metallicity covering the range from [Fe/H] $= -1.69$ to $-1.72$, suggesting
that Patchick~125 likely exhibits a mean metallicity $\langle$[Fe/H]$\rangle \sim -1.7$, which
represents a significant increase in metallicity for this cluster compared to previous low-resolution
spectroscopic analyses. We also found a mean radial velocity of 95.9 km s$^{-1}$, which is $\sim$21.6
km s$^{-1}$ higher than reported in the literature. The observed stars exhibit an $\alpha$-enrichment
([Mg/Fe]$\lesssim+0.20$, and [Si/Fe]$\lesssim +0.30$) that follows the typical trend of metal-poor
GCs. The aluminum abundance ratios for the present two member stars are enhanced in [Al/Fe]$\gtrsim
+0.58$, which is a typical enrichment characteristic of the so-called `second-generation' of
stars in GCs at similar metallicity. This supports the possible presence of the multiple-population
phenomenon in Patchick~125, as well as its genuine GC nature. Further, Patchick~125 shows a low-energy,
low-eccentric ($<0.4$) and retrograde orbit captured by the inner Galaxy, near the edge of the bulge.
We confirm that Patchick~125 is a genuine metal-poor GC, which is currently trapped in the vicinity
of the Milky Way bulge.

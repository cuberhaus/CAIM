Some intermediate polars show outbursts that are much shorter than those observed in normal dwarf
novae, and whose origin has remained unelucidated for a long time. We examine here the case of V1223
Sgr, an intermediate polar that showed a short outburst in 1984, and compare the outburst characteristics
with the predictions of the magnetospheric gating model. We use the archival data from the AAVSO
from which we extract the outburst profiles. We use our code for computing the time-dependent evolution
of an accretion disc truncated by the white dwarf magnetic field, using a simple description of the
interaction between the disc and the magnetic field, as in D'Antona and Spruit (2010). We find that
V1223 Sgr underwent a series of short outbursts, with a rise lasting for typically two to three hours,
and a slightly longer decay. When applied to intermediate polars, the model by D'Antona and Spruit
(2010) accounts well for the observed outburst duration and intensity. We confirm, however, that
the model outcome depends sensitively on the rather poorly constrained model's assumptions. We
have also searched the AAVSO database for short outbursts in other IPs, identifying individual
short outbursts in FO Aqr, TV Col, NY Lup and EI UMa, but no series as those observed in V1223 Sgr. We
also found a superoutburst, followed by a reflare in CTCV J2056-3014. Although the magnetic-gating
accretion instability model is clearly responsible for the series of V1223 Sgr short outbursts
and most probably for similar events in other intermediate polars, the model describing this process
needs improving, in particular concerning the interaction of the white-dwarf's magnetic field
with the accretion disc. This difficult task might benefit from further comparison of the model
outcome with additional observations having good time coverage and time resolution.

We are in an era of large catalogs and, thus, statistical analysis tools for large data sets, such
as machine learning, play a fundamental role. One example of such a survey is the Sloan Moving Object
Catalog (MOC), which lists the astrometric and photometric information of all moving objects captured
by the Sloan field of view. One great advantage of this telescope is represented by its set of five
filters, allowing for taxonomic analysis of asteroids by studying their colors. However, until
now, the color variation produced by the change of phase angle of the object has not been taken into
account. In this paper, we address this issue by using absolute magnitudes for classification.
We aim to produce a new taxonomic classification of asteroids based on their magnitudes that is unaffected
by variations caused by the change in phase angle. We selected 9481 asteroids with absolute magnitudes
of Hg, Hi and Hz, computed from the Sloan Moving Objects Catalog using the HG12 system. We calculated
the absolute colors with them. To perform the taxonomic classification, we applied a unsupervised
machine learning algorithm known as fuzzy C-means. This is a useful soft clustering tool for working
with {data sets where the different groups are not completely separated and there are regions of
overlap between them. We have chosen to work with the four main taxonomic complexes, C, S, X, and V,
as they comprise most of the known spectral characteristics. We classified a total of 6329 asteroids
with more than 60% probability of belonging to the assigned taxonomic class, with 162 of these objects
having been characterized by an ambiguous classification in the past. By analyzing the sample obtained
in the plane Semimajor axis versus inclination, we identified 15 new V-type asteroid candidates
outside the Vesta family region.

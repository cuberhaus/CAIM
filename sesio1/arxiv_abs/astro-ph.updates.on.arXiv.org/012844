Aims. We constrain the role of different Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) sub-classes in the chemical enrichment
of the Galaxy by studying the abundances of iron and manganese in Galactic stars. We investigate
four different SN Ia sub-classes, including the classical single-degenerate near-Chandrasekhar
mass (Mch) SN Ia, the fainter SN Iax systems associated with He accretion from the companion, as well
as two sub-Chandrasekhar mass (sub-Mch) SN Ia models. The latter include the double-detonation
of a white dwarf accreting helium-rich matter and violent white dwarf mergers. Methods. The chemical
abundances in Galactic stars are determined using Gaia eDR3 astrometry and photometry, and the
publicly released spectra obtained within the Gaia-ESO large spectroscopic survey. Non-local
thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) models are used in the spectroscopic analysis. The GCE models
have been updated to include detailed delay time distributions arising from binary population
synthesis simulations and the different SN Ia channels, as well as recent yields for core-collapse
supernovae and AGB stars. The data-model comparison is performed using a Markov chain Monte Carlo
framework that allows us to explore the entire parameter space allowed by the diversity of explosion
mechanisms and the Galactic SN Ia rate, taking into account the uncertainties of the observed data.
Results. Comparison of the new data with GCE models suggests that the observations can only be explained
if the fraction of sub-Mch SNe in the models varies between 50 % and 73 %. The standard Mch SNe are not
the dominant channel, but are still needed to account for the elevated [Mn/Fe] ratio in the thin disc.
Our results only weakly depend on the assumptions on AGB and core collapse SN yields, providing a
strong evidence that sub-Mch SNe play a major role in the chemical evolution of our Galaxy.

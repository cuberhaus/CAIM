It has been well established that galaxy clusters have magnetic fields. The exact properties and
origin of these magnetic fields are still uncertain even though these fields play a key role in many
astrophysical processes. Various attempts have been made to derive the magnetic field strength
and structure of nearby galaxy clusters using Faraday rotation of extended cluster radio sources.
This approach needs to make various assumptions that could be circumvented when using background
radio sources. However, because the number of polarised radio sources behind clusters is low, at
the moment such a study can only be done statistically. In this paper, we investigate the depolarisation
of radio sources inside and behind clusters in a sample of 124 massive clusters at $z<0.35$ observed
with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. We detect a clear depolarisation trend with the cluster
impact parameter, with sources at smaller projected distances to the cluster centre showing more
depolarisation. By combining the radio observations with ancillary X-ray data from Chandra, we
compare the observed depolarisation with expectations from cluster magnetic field models using
individual cluster density profiles. The best-fitting models have a central magnetic field strength
of $5-10\,\mu$G with power-law indices between $n=1$ and $n=4$. We find no strong difference in
the depolarisation trend between sources embedded in clusters and background sources located
at similar projected radii, although the central region of clusters is still poorly probed by background
sources. We also examine the depolarisation trend as a function of cluster properties such as the
dynamical state, mass, and redshift. Our findings show that the statistical depolarisation of
radio sources is a good probe of cluster magnetic field parameters. [abridged]

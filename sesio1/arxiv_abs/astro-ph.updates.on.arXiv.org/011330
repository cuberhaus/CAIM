Understanding nonlinear structure formation is crucial for the full exploration of the data generated
by forthcoming stage IV surveys, which will require accurate modelling of the matter power spectrum.
This is particularly challenging for deviations from $\Lambda$CDM. We need to ensure that alternative
cosmologies are well tested and avoid false detections. In this work we present an extension of the
halo model reaction framework for interacting dark energy. We describe modifications to the halo
model to include the additional force acting on dark matter within the Dark Scattering model, and
implement them into the code ReACT. The halo model reaction is then combined with a pseudo spectrum
from the EuclidEmulator2 and compared to Dark Scattering N-body simulations. Using a standard
halo mass function and concentration-mass relation, we find these predictions to be 1% accurate
at $z=0$ up to $k=0.8~h/{\rm Mpc}$ for the largest interaction strength tested ($\xi=50$ b/GeV),
improving to $k=2~h/{\rm Mpc}$ at $z=1$. For a smaller interaction strength ($\xi=10$ b/GeV),
we find 1%-agreement at $z=1$ up to at least $k=3.5~h/{\rm Mpc}$, being close to $k=1~h/{\rm Mpc}$
at $z=0$. Finally, we improve our predictions with the inclusion of baryonic feedback and massive
neutrinos and search for degeneracies between the nonlinear effects of these two contributions
and those of the dark sector interaction. By limiting the scales to those where our modelling is 1%
accurate, we find a degeneracy between the effects of the interaction and those of baryonic feedback,
but not with those generated by massive neutrinos. We expect the degeneracy with baryonic feedback
to be resolvable when smaller scales are included. This work represents the first analytical tool
for calculating the nonlinear matter power spectrum for coupled dark matter - dark energy models.

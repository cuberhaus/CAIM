This work uses observed galaxy surface brightness profiles at high redshifts to determine the cosmological
model best suited to interpret these observations. Theoretical predictions of galactic surface
brightness profiles are compared to observational data in two cosmological models, $\Lambda$CDM
and Einstein-de Sitter, to calculate the evolutionary effects of different spacetime geometries
in these profiles in order to try to find out if the available data is capable of indicating the cosmology
that best represents actual galactic brightness profiles observations. Starting from the connection
between the angular diameter distance and the galactic surface brightness as advanced by Ellis
and Perry (1979), we derived scaling relations using data from the Virgo galactic cluster in order
to obtain theoretical predictions of the galactic surface brightness modeled by the Sersic profile
at redshift values equal to a sample of galaxies in the range $1.5 \lesssim z \lesssim 2.3$ composed
by a subset of Szomoru's et al. (2012) observations. We then calculated the difference between theory
and observation in order to determine the changes required in the effective radius and effective
surface brightness so that the observed galaxies may evolve to have features similar to the Virgo
cluster ones. Our results show that within the data uncertainties of this particular subset of galaxies
it is not possible to distinguish which of the two cosmological models used here predicts theoretical
curves in better agreement with the observed ones, that is, one cannot identify a clear and detectable
difference in galactic evolution incurred by the galaxies of our sample when applying each cosmology.
We also concluded that the Sersic index $n$ does not seem to play a significant effect in the evolution
of these galaxies.

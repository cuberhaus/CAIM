Brown dwarfs and exoplanets provide unique atmospheric regimes that hold information about their
formation routes and evolutionary states. Modelling mineral cloud particle formation is key to
prepare for missions and instruments like CRIRES+, JWST and ARIEL as well as possible polarimetry
missions like {\sc PolStar}. The aim is to support more detailed observations that demand greater
understanding of microphysical cloud processes. We extend our kinetic cloud formation model that
treats nucleation, condensation, evaporation and settling of mixed material cloud particles
to consistently model cloud particle-particle collisions. The new hybrid code, {\sc HyLandS},
is applied to a grid of {\sc Drift-Phoenix} (T, p)-profiles. Effective medium theory and Mie theory
are used to investigate the optical properties. Turbulence is the main driving process of collisions,
with collisions becoming the dominant process at the cloud base ($p>10^{-4}\,{\rm bar}$). Collisions
produce one of three outcomes: fragmenting atmospheres ($\log_{10}(g)=3$), coagulating atmospheres
($\log_{10}(g)=5$, $T_{\rm eff} \leq 1800\, {\rm K}$) and condensational growth dominated atmospheres
($\log_{10}(g\,)=5$, $T_{\rm eff} > 1800\, {\rm K}$). Cloud particle opacity slope at optical
wavelengths (HST) is increased with fragmentation, as are the silicate features at mid-infrared
wavelengths. The hybrid moment-bin method {\sc HyLandS} demonstrates the feasibility of combining
a moment and a bin method whilst assuring element conservation. It provides a powerful and fast tool
for capturing general trends of particle collisions, consistently with other microphysical processes.
Collisions are important in exoplanet and brown dwarf atmospheres but cannot be assumed to be hit-and-stick
only. The spectral effects of collisions complicates inferences of cloud particle size and material
composition from observational data.

A fundamental prediction of the LambdaCDM cosmology is the hierarchical build-up of structure
and therefore the successive merging of galaxies into more massive ones. As one can only observe
galaxies at one specific time in cosmic history, this merger history remains in principle unobservable.
By using the TNG100 simulation of the IllustrisTNG project, we show that it is possible to infer the
unobservable stellar assembly and merger history of central galaxies from their observable properties
by using machine learning techniques. In particular, in this first paper of ERGO-ML (Extracting
Reality from Galaxy Observables with Machine Learning), we choose a set of 7 observable integral
properties of galaxies (i.e. total stellar mass, redshift, color, stellar size, morphology, metallicity,
and age) to infer, from those, the stellar ex-situ fraction, the average merger lookback times and
mass ratios, and the lookback time and stellar mass of the last major merger. To do so, we use and compare
a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network and a conditional Invertible Neural Network (cINN): thanks
to the latter we are also able to infer the posterior distribution for these parameters and hence
estimate the uncertainties in the predictions. We find that the stellar ex-situ fraction and the
time of the last major merger are well determined by the selected set of observables, that the mass-weighted
merger mass ratio is unconstrained, and that, beyond stellar mass, stellar morphology and stellar
age are the most informative properties. Finally, we show that the cINN recovers the remaining unexplained
scatter and secondary cross-correlations. Our tools can be applied to large galaxy surveys in order
to infer unobservable properties of galaxies' past, enabling empirical studies of galaxy evolution
enriched by cosmological simulations.

The ion escape of Mars' CO$_2$ atmosphere caused by its dissociation products C and O atoms is {simulated}
from present time to $\sim 4.1$ billion years ago (Ga) by {numerical models of the upper atmosphere
and its interaction with the solar wind}. The planetward-scattered pick-up ions are used for sputtering
estimates of exospheric particles including $^{36}$Ar and $^{38}$Ar isotopes. Total ion escape,
sputtering and photochemical escape rates are compared. For solar EUV fluxes $\geq$\,3 times that
of today's Sun (earlier than $\sim 2.6$ Ga) ion escape becomes the dominant atmospheric non-thermal
loss process until thermal escape takes over during the pre-Noachian eon (earlier than $\sim 4.0\,-\,4.1$
Ga). If we extrapolate the total escape of CO$_2$-related dissociation products back in time until
$\sim$ 4.1 Ga we obtain a {maximum} theoretical equivalent to CO$_2$ partial pressure of more than
{$\sim 0.4$ bar through non-thermal escape during quiet solar wind conditions}. {However, surface-atmosphere
interaction and/or extreme solar events such as frequent CMEs could have increased this value even
further. By including the surface as a sink, up to 0.9\,bar, or even up to 1.8\,bar in case of hidden
carbonate reservoirs, could have been present at 4.1\,Ga} The fractionation of $^{36}$Ar/$^{38}$Ar
isotopes through sputtering and volcanic outgassing from its initial chondritic value of 5.3,
as measured in the 4.1 billion years old Mars meteorite ALH 84001, until the present day, however,
can be reproduced for assumed CO$_2$ partial pressures of {$\sim0.01 -- 0.4$\,bar without, and
$\sim0.4 -- 1.8$\,bar including surface sinks, and} depending on the cessation time of the Martian
dynamo (assumed between 3.6\,--\,4.0 Ga) - if atmospheric sputtering of Ar started afterwards.

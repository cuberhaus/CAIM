We develop and implement an inclination-dependent attenuation prescription for spectral energy
distribution (SED) fitting and study its impact on derived star-formation histories. We apply
our prescription within the SED fitting code Lightning to a clean sample of 82, z = 0.21-1.35 disk-dominated
galaxies in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) North and South fields. To compare
our inclination-dependent attenuation prescription with more traditional fitting prescriptions,
we also fit the SEDs with the inclination-independent Calzetti et al. (2000) attenuation curve.
From this comparison, we find that fits to a subset of 58, z < 0.7 galaxies in our sample, utilizing
the Calzetti et al. (2000) prescription, recover similar trends with inclination as the inclination-dependent
fits for the FUV-band attenuation and recent star-formation rates. However, we find a difference
between prescriptions in the optical attenuation (AV) that is strongly correlated with inclination
(p-value < 10^-10). For more face-on galaxies, with i < 50 deg, (edge-on, i = 90 deg), the average derived
AV is 0.30 +/- 0.10 magnitudes lower (0.55 +/- 0.15 magnitudes higher) for the inclination-dependent
model compared to traditional methods. Further, the ratio of stellar masses between prescriptions
also has a significant (p-value < 10^-2) trend with inclination. For i = 0-65 deg, stellar masses
are systematically consistent between fits, with log(Mstar_inc/Mstar_Calzetti) = -0.05 +/-
0.03 dex, and scatter of 0.11 dex. However, for i = 80-90 deg, derived stellar masses are lower for
the Calzetti et al. (2000) fits by an average factor of 0.17 +/- 0.02 dex, and scatter of 0.13 dex. Therefore,
these results suggest that SED fitting assuming the Calzetti et al. (2000) attenuation law potentially
underestimates stellar masses in highly inclined disk-dominated galaxies.

Line intensity mapping (LIM) is rapidly emerging as a powerful technique to study galaxy formation
and cosmology in the high-redshift Universe. We present LIM estimates of select spectral lines
originating from the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies and 21 cm emission from neutral hydrogen
gas in the Universe using the large volume, high resolution THESAN reionization simulations. A
combination of sub-resolution photo-ionization modelling for HII regions and Monte Carlo radiative
transfer calculations is employed to estimate the dust-attenuated spectral energy distributions
(SEDs) of high-redshift galaxies ($z\gtrsim5.5$). We show that the derived photometric properties
such as the ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function and the UV continuum slopes match observationally
inferred values, demonstrating the accuracy of the SED modelling. We provide fits to the luminosity--star
formation rate relation (L-SFR) for the brightest emission lines and find that important differences
exist between the derived scaling relations and the widely used low-$z$ ones because the interstellar
medium of reionization era galaxies is generally less metal-enriched than in their low redshift
counterparts. We use these relations to construct line intensity maps of nebular emission lines
and cross correlate with the 21 cm emission. Interestingly, the wavenumber at which the correlation
switches sign ($k_\mathrm{transition}$) depends heavily on the reionization model and to a lesser
extent on the targeted emission line, which is consistent with the picture that $k_\mathrm{transition}$
probes the typical sizes of ionized regions. The derived scaling relations and intensity maps represent
a timely state-of-the-art framework for forecasting and interpreting results from current and
upcoming LIM experiments.

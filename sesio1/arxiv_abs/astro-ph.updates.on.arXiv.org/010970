Determining the properties of solar-like oscillating stars can be subject to many biases. A particularly
important example is the helium-mass degeneracy, where the uncertainties regarding the internal
physics can cause a poor determination of both the mass and surface helium content. Accordingly,
an independent helium estimate is needed to overcome this degeneracy. A promising way to obtain
such an estimate is to exploit the so-called ionisation glitch, i.e. a deviation from the asymptotic
oscillation frequency pattern caused by the rapid structural variation in the He ionisation zones.
Although progressively becoming more sophisticated, the glitch-based approach faces problems
inherent to its current modelling such as the need for calibration by realistic stellar models.
This requires a physical model of the ionisation region explicitly involving the parameters of
interest such as the surface helium abundance, $Y_s$. Through a thermodynamic treatment of the
ionisation region, an analytical approximation for the first adiabatic exponent $\Gamma_1$ is
presented. The induced stellar structure is found to depend on only three parameters including
the surface helium abundance $Y_s$ and the electron degeneracy $\psi_\textrm{CZ}$ in the convective
region. The model thus defined allows a wide variety of structures to be described and, in particular,
is able to approximate a realistic model in the ionisation region. The modelling work conducted
enables us to study the structural perturbations causing the glitch. More elaborate forms of perturbations
than the ones usually assumed are found. It is also suggested that there might be a stronger dependence
of the structure on both the electron degeneracy in the convection zone and on the position of the
ionisation region rather than on the amount of helium itself.

Distances to the $k$-nearest-neighbor ($k$NN) data points from volume-filling query points are
a sensitive probe of spatial clustering. Here we present the first application of $k$NN summary
statistics to observational clustering measurement, using the 1000 richest redMaPPer clusters
($0.1\leqslant z\leqslant 0.3$) from the SDSS DR8 catalog. A clustering signal is defined as a difference
in the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) or counts-in-cells functions (CICs) of $k$NN
distances from fixed query points to the observed clusters versus a set of unclustered random points.
We find that the $k=1,2$-NN CDFs (and CICs) of redMaPPer deviate significantly from the randoms'
across scales of 35 to 155 Mpc, which is a robust signature of clustering. In addition to $k$NN, we
also measure the two-point correlation function for the same set of redMaPPer clusters versus random
points, which shows a noisier and less significant clustering signal within the same radial scales.
Quantitatively, the $\chi^2$ distribution for both the $k$NN-CDFs and the two-point correlation
function measured on the randoms peak at $\chi^2\sim 50$ (null hypothesis), whereas the $k$NN-CDFs
($\chi^2\sim 300$, $p = 1.54\times 10^{-36}$) pick up a much more significant clustering signal
than the two-point function ($\chi^2\sim 100$, $p = 1.16\times 10^{-6}$) when measured on redMaPPer.
Finally, the measured 3NN and 4NN CDFs deviate significantly from the predicted $k=3, 4$-NN CDFs
assuming an ideal Gaussian field, indicating that redMaPPer clusters trace a non-Gaussian density
field which is sensitively picked up by $k$NN summary statistics. Therefore, the $k$NN method serves
as a more sensitive probe of clustering complementary to the two point correlation function in sparse
(beyond-Gaussian) observational data sets at large scales, providing a novel approach for constraining
cosmology and galaxy-halo connection.

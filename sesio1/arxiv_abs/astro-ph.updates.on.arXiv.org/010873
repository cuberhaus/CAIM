Abbreviated. We aim to identify new low-mass companions to young stars using the astrometric measurements
provided by the Gaia space mission and complementary VLT/SPHERE data. We identify companion candidates
from a sample of K-type, pre-main sequence stars in the Scorpius Centaurus association using the
early version of the third data release of the Gaia space mission. Based on the provided positions,
proper motions, and magnitudes, we identify all objects within a predefined radius whose differential
proper motions are consistent with a gravitationally bound system. We derive companion masses
through comparison with evolutionary tracks. For seven identified companion candidates we use
additional data collected with VLT/SPHERE and VLT/NACO to assess the accuracy of the properties
of the companions based on Gaia photometry alone. We identify 110 comoving companions that have
a companionship likelihood of more than $95\,\%$. We identify ten especially intriguing companions
that have masses in the brown dwarf regime down to $20\,M_\mathrm{Jup}$. Our high-contrast imaging
data confirm both astrometry and photometric masses derived from Gaia alone. We discover a new brown
dwarf companion, TYC 8252-533-1 B, with a projected separation of approximately $570\,\mathrm{au}$
from its Sun-like primary. SED modeling provides a companion mass of $52^{+17}_{-11}\,M_\mathrm{Jup}$.
We show that the Gaia database can identify low-mass companions at wide separations from their host
stars. For K-type Sco-Cen members Gaia can detect sub-stellar objects at projected separations
larger than $300\,\mathrm{au}$ and is sensitivity limited beyond $1,000\,\mathrm{au}$ with
a lower mass limit down to $20\,M_\mathrm{Jup}$. A similar analysis of other star-forming regions
could significantly enlarge the sample size of such objects and test formation and evolution theories
of planetary systems.

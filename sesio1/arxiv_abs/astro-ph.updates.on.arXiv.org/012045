The electromagnetic energy flux in the lower atmosphere of the Sun is a key tool to describe the energy
balance of the solar atmosphere. Current investigations on energy flux in the solar atmosphere
focus primarily on the vertical electromagnetic flux through the photosphere, ignoring the Poynting
flux in other directions and its possible contributions to local heating. Based on a realistic Bifrost
simulation of a quiet-Sun (coronal hole) atmosphere, we find that the total electromagnetic energy
flux in the photosphere occurs mainly parallel to the photosphere, concentrating in small regions
along intergranular lanes. Thereby, it was possible to define a proxy for this energy flux based
on only variables that can be promptly retrieved from observations, namely, horizontal velocities
of the small-scale magnetic elements and their longitudinal magnetic flux. Our proxy accurately
describes the actual Poynting flux distribution in the simulations, with the electromagnetic
energy flux reaching $10^{10}$ erg\,cm$^{-2}$\,s$^{-1}$. To validate our findings, we extended
the analysis to SUNRISE/IMaX data. First, we show that Bifrost realistically describes photospheric
quiet-Sun regions, as the simulation presents similar distributions for line-of-sight magnetic
flux and horizontal velocity field. Second, we found very similar horizontal Poynting flux proxy
distributions for the simulated photosphere and observational data. Our results also indicate
that the horizontal Poynting flux in the observations is considerably larger than the vertical
electromagnetic flux from previous observational estimates. Therefore, our analysis confirms
that the electromagnetic energy flux in the photosphere is mainly horizontal and is most intense
in localized regions along intergranular lanes.

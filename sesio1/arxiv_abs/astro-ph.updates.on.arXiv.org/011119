Aluminum oxide (alumina, Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$) is a promising candidate as a primary dust condensate
in the atmospheres of oxygen-rich evolved stars. Therefore, alumina \textit{seed} particles
might trigger the onset of stellar dust formation and of stellar mass loss in the wind. However, the
formation of alumina dust grains is not well understood.} {To shed light on the initial steps of cosmic
dust formation (i.e. nucleation) in oxygen-rich environments by a quantum-chemical bottom-up
approach.} {Starting with an elemental gas-phase composition, we construct a detailed chemical-kinetic
network describing the formation and destruction of aluminium-bearing molecules and dust-forming
(Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$)$_n$ clusters up to the size of dimers ($n$=2) coagulating to tetramers ($n=$4).
Intermediary species include the prevalent gas-phase molecules AlO and AlOH, and Al$_x$O$_y$
clusters with $x=$1$-$5, $y=$1$-$6. The resulting extensive network is applied to two model stars,
representing a semi-regular variable and a Mira-type, and to different circumstellar gas trajectories
including a non-pulsating outflow and a pulsating model. The growth of larger-sized (Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$)$_n$
clusters with $n=$4$-$10 is described by the temperature-dependent Gibbs free energies of the
most favourable structures (i.e. the global minima clusters) as derived from global optimisation
techniques and calculated by density functional theory. We provide energies, bond characteristics,
electrostatic properties and vibrational spectra of the clusters as a function of size $n$ and compare
these to corundum corresponding to the crystalline bulk limit ($n\rightarrow \infty$). {The circumstellar
aluminium gas-phase chemistry in oxygen-rich giants is primarily controlled by AlOH and AlO, which
are tightly coupled by the reactions AlO+H$_2$, AlO+H$_2$O, and their reverse. Models of ...}

We identify spectral similarities between asteroids and meteorites. We identify spectral matches
between 500 asteroid spectra and over 1,000 samples of RELAB meteorite spectra over 0.45-2.5 microns.
We reproduce many major and previously known meteorite-asteroid connections and find possible
new, more rare or less-established connections. Well-established connections include: ordinary
chondrites (OC) with S-complex asteroids; pristine CM carbonaceous chondrites with Ch-type asteroids
and heated CMs with C-type asteroids; HED meteorites with V-types; enstatite chondrites with Xc-type
asteroids; CV meteorites with K-type asteroids; Brachinites, Pallasites and R chondrites with
olivine-dominated A-type asteroids. We find a trend from Q, Sq, S, Sr to Sv correlates with LL to H,
with Q-types matching predominately to L and LL ordinary chondrites, and Sr and Sv matching predominantly
with L and H ordinary chondrites. Ordinary chondrite samples that match to the X-complex, all measurements
of slabs and many labeled as dark or black (shocked) OCs. We find carbonaceous chondrite samples
having spectral slopes large enough to match D-type asteroid spectra. In many cases the asteroid
type to meteorite type links are not unique. While there are well established matches between an
asteroid class and meteorite class, there are less common but still spectrally compatible matches
between many asteroid types and meteorite types. This result emphasizes the diversity of asteroid
and meteorite compositions and highlights the degeneracy of classification by spectral features
alone. Recent and upcoming spacecraft missions will shed light on the compositions of many of the
asteroid classes, particularly those without diagnostic features, (C-, B-, X-, and D-types),
with measurements of Ceres, Ryugu, Bennu, Psyche, and C-, P-, and D-types as part of the Lucy mission.

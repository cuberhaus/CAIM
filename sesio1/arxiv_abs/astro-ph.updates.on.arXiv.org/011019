Modeling the evolution of the number density distribution of quasars through the Quasar Luminosity
Function (QLF) is critical to improve our understanding of the connection between black holes,
galaxies and their halos. Here we present a novel semi-empirical model for the evolution of the QLF
that is fully defined after the specification of a free parameter, the internal duty cycle, $\varepsilon_{DC}$
along with minimal other assumptions. All remaining model parameters are fixed upon calibration
against the QLF at two redshifts, $z=4$ and $z=5$. Our modeling shows that the evolution at the bright
end results from the stochasticity in the median quasar luminosity versus halo mass relation, while
the faint end shape is determined by the evolution of the Halo Mass Function (HMF) with redshift.
Additionally, our model suggests the overall quasar density is determined by the evolution of the
HMF, irrespective of the value of $\varepsilon_{DC}$. The $z\ge4$ QLFs from our model are in excellent
agreement with current observations for all $\varepsilon_{DC}$, with model predictions suggesting
that observations at $z\gtrsim7.5$ are needed to discriminate between different $\varepsilon_{DC}$.
We further extend the model at $z\le4$, successfully describing the QLF between $1\le z\le4$, albeit
with additional assumptions on $\Sigma$ and $\varepsilon_{DC}$. We use the existing measurements
of quasar duty cycle from clustering to constrain $\varepsilon_{DC}$, finding $\varepsilon_{DC}\sim0.01$
or $\varepsilon_{DC}\gtrsim0.1$ dependent on observational datasets used for reference. Finally,
we present forecasts for future wide-area surveys with promising expectations for the Nancy Grace
Roman Telescope to discover $N\gtrsim10$, bright, $m_{UV}<26.5$ quasars at $z\sim8$.

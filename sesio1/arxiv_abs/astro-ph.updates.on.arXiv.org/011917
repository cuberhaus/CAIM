A halo-based non-projection approach is proposed to study scale/redshift dependence of distributions
(PDF) in dark matter flow. All particles are divided into halo and out-of-halo particles such that
PDF can be studied separately. Without projecting particle fields onto grid, scale dependence
is analyzed by counting all pairs on different scales $r$. Redshift dependence is studied via generalized
kurtosis. From this analysis, we demonstrate: i) Root-mean-square acceleration (~$10^{-10}m/s^2$)
in halos matches critical acceleration $a_0$ in MOND that can be determined by the rate of energy
transfer $\epsilon_u$, where $a_0=-(3\pi)^2\epsilon_u/u$ and $u^2(a=1)=u^2_0$ is velocity
dispersion. Particle energy is dependent on its speed as $\propto{v^2}$ if its acceleration $a_p$>>$a_0$
and $\propto{v^1}$ if $a_p$<<$a_0$. Both deep-MOND and Newtonian behavior can be recovered in
dark matter flow; ii) $m$th moment of pairwise velocity $\langle(\Delta u_L)^m\rangle$ is analytically
modelled. On small scale, even moments can be modelled by a two-thirds law $\propto{(-\epsilon_ur)}^{2/3}$,
odd moments $\propto{r}$ and satisfy GSCH; iii) Scale dependence is studied for longitudinal velocity
$u_L$ or $u_L^{'}$, pairwise velocity $\Delta u_L$=$u_L^{'}$-$u_L$ and sum velocity $\Sigma
u_L$=$u^{'}_L$+$u_L$. Fully developed velocity fields are never Gaussian on any scale. On small
scale, both $u_L$ and $\Sigma u_L$ can be modelled by a X distribution for maximum entropy. PDF of
$\Delta u_L$ is different with its moments derived. On large scale, both $\Delta u_L$ and $\Sigma
u_L$ can be modelled by a logistic function. Time evolution of velocity distributions follows prediction
of X distribution with a decreasing shape parameter $\alpha$ to maximize system entropy; iv) Delaunay
tessellation is used to reconstruct density field. Density correlations/spectrum are obtained,
modeled and compared with theory.

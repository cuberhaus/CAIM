This is the fourth paper of a series investigating the AGN fuelling/feedback processes in a sample
of eleven nearby low-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs). In this paper we present follow-up Atacama
Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of one source, NGC3100, targeting
the $^{12}$CO(1-0), $^{12}$CO(3-2), HCO$^{+}$(4-3), SiO(3-2) and HNCO(6-5) molecular transitions.
$^{12}$CO(1-0) and $^{12}$CO(3-2) lines are nicely detected and complement our previous $^{12}$CO(2-1)
data. By comparing the relative strength of these three CO transitions, we find extreme gas excitation
conditions (i.e. $T_{\rm ex}\gtrsim50$ K) in regions that are spatially correlated with the radio
lobes, supporting the case for a jet-ISM interaction. An accurate study of the CO kinematics demonstrates
that, although the bulk of the gas is regularly rotating, two distinct non-rotational kinematic
components can be identified in the inner gas regions: one can be associated to inflow/outflow streaming
motions induced by a two-armed spiral perturbation; the second one is consistent with a jet-induced
outflow with $v_{\rm max}\approx 200$ km s$^{-1}$ and $\dot{M}\lesssim 0.12$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$.
These values indicate that the jet-CO coupling ongoing in NGC3100 is only mildly affecting the gas
kinematics, as opposed to what expected from existing simulations and other observational studies
of (sub-)kpc scale jet-cold gas interactions. HCO$^{+}$(4-3) emission is tentatively detected
in a small area adjacent to the base of the northern radio lobe, possibly tracing a region of jet-induced
gas compression. The SiO(3-2) and HNCO(6-5) shock tracers are undetected: this - along with the
tentative HCO$^{+}$(4-3) detection - may be consistent with a deficiency of very dense (i.e. $n_{\rm
crit} > 10^{6}$ cm$^{-3}$) cold gas in the central regions of NGC3100.

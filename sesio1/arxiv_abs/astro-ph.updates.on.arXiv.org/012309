String theory enjoys an elevated role among quantum gravity theories, since it seems to be the most
consistent UV completion of general relativity and the Standard Model. However, it is hard to verify
the existence of this underlying theory on terrestrial accelerators. One way to probe string theory
is to study its imprints on the low-energy effective inflationary Lagrangian, which are quantified
in terms of high energy correction terms. It is highly likely, thus, to find higher order curvature
terms combined with string moduli, that is scalar fields, since both these types of interactions
and matter fields appear in string theory. In this work we aim to stress the probability that the inflationary
dynamics are controlled by the synergy of scalar fields and higher order curvature terms. Specifically,
we shall consider a well motivated quantum corrected canonical scalar field theory, with the quantum
corrections being of the $\mathcal{R}^2$ type. The reason for choosing minimally coupled scalar
theory is basically because if scalar fields are evaluated in their vacuum configuration, they
will either be minimally coupled or conformally coupled. Here we choose the former case, and the
whole study shall be performed in the string frame (Jordan frame), in contrast to similar studies
in the literature where the Einstein frame two scalar theory is considered. We derive the field equations
of the quantum-corrected theory at leading order and we present the form the slow-roll indices obtain
for the quantum corrected theory. We exemplify our theoretical framework by using the quadratic
inflation model, and as we show, the $\mathcal{R}^2$ quantum corrected quadratic inflation model
produces a viable inflationary phenomenology, in contrast with the simple quadratic inflation
model.

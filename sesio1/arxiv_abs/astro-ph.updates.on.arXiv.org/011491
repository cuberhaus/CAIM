The 21cm line of neutral hydrogen (HI) opens a new avenue in our exploration of the structure and evolution
of the Universe. It provides complementary data to the current large-scale structure observations
with different systematics, and thus it will be used to improve our understanding of the $\Lambda$CDM
model. Among several radio cosmological surveys designed to measure this line, BINGO is a single-dish
telescope mainly designed to detect baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) at low redshifts ($0.127<
z<0.449$). Our goal is to assess the fiducial BINGO setup and its capabilities of constraining the
cosmological parameters, and to analyze the effect of different instrument configurations. We
used the Phase 1 fiducial configuration of the BINGO telescope to perform our cosmological forecasts.
In addition, we investigated the impact of several instrumental setups, taking into account some
instrumental systematics, and different cosmological models. Combining BINGO with Planck temperature
and polarization data, the projected constraint improves from a $13\%$ and $25\%$ precision measurement
at the $68\%$ confidence level with Planck only to $1\%$ and $3\%$ for the Hubble constant and the
dark energy equation of state (EoS), respectively, within the wCDM model. Assuming a Chevallier-Polarski-Linder
parameterization, the EoS parameters have standard deviations given by $\sigma_{w_0} = 0.30$
and $\sigma_{w_a} = 1.2$, which are improvements on the order of $30\%$ with respect to Planck alone.
Also, we can access information about the HI density and bias, obtaining $\sim 8.5\%$ and $\sim 6\%$
precision, respectively, assuming they vary with redshift at three independent bins. The fiducial
BINGO configuration will be able to extract significant cosmological information from the HI distribution
and provide constraints competitive with current and future cosmological surveys. (Abridged)

We present the optical photometric and spectroscopic observations of the nearby Type Ia supernova
(SN) 2021hpr. The observations covered the phase of $-$14.37 to +63.68 days relative to its maximum
luminosity in the $B$ band. The evolution of multiband light/color curves of SN 2021hpr is similar
to that of normal Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) with the exception of some phases, especially a plateau
phase that appeared in the $V-R$ color curve before peak luminosity, which resembles that of SN 2017cbv.
The first spectrum we observed at t $\sim -$14.4 days shows a higher velocity for the Si II $\lambda$6355
feature ($\sim$ 21,000 km s$^{-1}$) than that of other normal Velocity (NV) SNe Ia at the same phase.
Based on the Si II $\lambda$6355 velocity of $\sim$ 12,420 km s$^{-1}$ around the maximum light,
we deduce that SN 2021hpr is a transitional object between high velocity (HV) and NV SNe Ia. Meanwhile,
the Si II $\lambda$6355 feature shows a high velocity gradient (HVG) of about 800 km s$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$
from roughly $-$14.37 to $-$4.31 days relative to the $B$-band maximum, which indicates that SN
2021hpr can also be classified as an HVG SN Ia. The evolution of SN 2021hpr is similar to that of SN 2011fe.
Including SN 2021hpr, there have been six supernovae observed in the host galaxy NGC 3147, and the
supernovae explosion rate in the last 50 yr is slightly higher for SNe Ia, while lower for SNe Ibc and
SNe II it is lower than expected rate from the radio data. Inspecting the spectra, we find that SN 2021hpr
has a metal-rich (12 + log(O/H) $\approx$ 8.648) circumstellar environment, where HV SNe tend to
reside. Based on the decline rate of SN 2021hpr in the $B$ band, we determine the distance modulus
of the host galaxy NGC 3147 using the Phillips relation to be 33.46 $\pm$ 0.21 mag, which is close to
that found by previous works.

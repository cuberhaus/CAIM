Deriving metallicities for solar-like stars follows well-established methods, but for cooler
stars such as M dwarfs, the determination is much more complicated due to forests of molecular lines
that are present. Several methods have been developed in recent years to determine accurate stellar
parameters for these cool stars ($T_{\rm eff} \lesssim$ 4000 K). However, significant differences
can be found at times when comparing metallicities for the same star derived using different methods.
In this work, we determine the effective temperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities of
18 well-studied M dwarfs observed with the CARMENES high-resolution spectrograph following different
approaches, including synthetic spectral fitting, analysis of pseudo-equivalent widths, and
machine learning. We analyzed the discrepancies in the derived stellar parameters, including
metallicity, in several analysis runs. Our goal is to minimize these discrepancies and find stellar
parameters that are more consistent with the literature values. We attempted to achieve this consistency
by standardizing the most commonly used components, such as wavelength ranges, synthetic model
spectra, continuum normalization methods, and stellar parameters. We conclude that although
such modifications work quite well for hotter main-sequence stars, they do not improve the consistency
in stellar parameters for M dwarfs, leading to mean deviations of around 50-200 K in temperature
and 0.1-0.3 dex in metallicity. In particular, M dwarfs are much more complex and a standardization
of the aforementioned components cannot be considered as a straightforward recipe for bringing
consistency to the derived parameters. Further in-depth investigations of the employed methods
would be necessary in order to identify and correct for the discrepancies that remain.

Hot corinos are compact regions around solar-mass protostellar objects that are very rich in interstellar
complex organic molecules (iCOMs). They are believed to represent the very early phases of our Solar
System's birth, which was very likely also characterized by rich organic chemistry. While most
of the studied hot corinos are either isolated or born in a loose protocluster, our Sun was born in
a densely packed star cluster, near massive stars whose ultraviolet radiation must have contributed
to shaping the evolution of the surrounding environment. In addition, internal irradiation from
energetic particles ($>$10 Mev), whose imprint is seen today in the products of short-lived radionuclides
in meteoritic material, is also known to have occurred during the Solar System formation. How did
all these conditions affect the chemistry of the proto-Sun and its surroundings is still an open
question. To answer this question, we studied HOPS-108, the hot corino located in the protosolar
analogue OMC-2 FIR4. The study was carried out with ALMA at 1.3mm with an angular resolution of $\sim$100
AU. We detected 11 iCOMs such as CH$_{3}$OH HCOOCH$_{3}$ and CH$_{3}$OCH$_{3}$. Our results can
be summarized as follows: (1) an enhancement of HCOOCH3 with respect to other hot corinos, (2) a [CH$_{3}$OCH$_{3}$]/[HCOOCH$_{3}$]
abundance ratio of $\sim$0.2 marginally deviating from the usual trend seen in other sources ([CH$_{3}$OCH$_{3}$]/[HCOOCH$_{3}$]
$\sim$1), (3) a [CH$_{2}$DOH]/[CH$_{3}$OH] ratio of 2.5\% which is lower than what is seen in Perseus
and Ophiuchus hot corinos ($\sim$7\%-9\%) and similar to that seen in HH212 another source located
in Orion. This might result from different physical conditions in the Orion molecular complex compared
to other regions.

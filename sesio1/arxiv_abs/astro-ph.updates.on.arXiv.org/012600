We investigate the properties of stars born via gravitational instability in accretion discs around
supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in active galactic nuclei (AGN), and how this varies with the SMBH
mass, accretion rate, or viscosity. We show with geometrically thin, steady-state disc solutions
that fragmentation results in different populations of stars when one considers the initial conditions
(e.g. density and temperature of the gravitationally unstable regions). We find that opacity gaps
in discs around $10^6 \rm M_{\odot}$ SMBHs can trigger fragmentation at radii $\lesssim 10^{-2}$
pc, although the conditions lead to the formation of initially low stellar masses primarily at $0.1-0.5
M_{\odot}$. Discs around more massive SMBHs ($M_{\rm BH} =10^{7-8} M_{\odot}$) form moderately
massive or supermassive stars (the majority at $10^{0-2} M_{\odot}$). Using linear migration
estimates, we discuss three outcomes: stars migrate till they are tidally destroyed, accreted
as extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), or leftover after disc dispersal. For a single AGN activity
cycle, we find a lower-limit for the EMRI rate $R_{\rm emri}\sim 0-10^{-4} \rm yr^{-1}$ per AGN assuming
a SF efficiency $\epsilon=1 \%$. In cases where EMRIs occur, this implies a volumetric rate up to
$0.5-10 \rm yr^{-1} Gpc^{-3}$ in the local Universe. The rates are particularly sensitive to model
parameters for $M_{\rm BH}=10^6 M_{\odot}$, for which EMRIs only occur if stars can accrete to $10$s
of solar masses. Our results provide further evidence that gas-embedded EMRIs can contribute a
substantial fraction of events detectable by milliHz gravitational wave detectors such as LISA.
Our disc solutions suggest the presence of migration traps, as has been found for more massive SMBH
discs. Finally, the surviving population of stars after the disc lifetime leaves implications
for stellar disc populations in galactic nuclei.

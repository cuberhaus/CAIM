Quasars with periodic light curves are considered as candidates of supermassive binary black hole
(BBH) systems. One way for further confirmations may be searching for other characteristic signatures,
such as those in their broad emission lines (BELs), if any, which require a thorough understanding
on the response of BELs to the BBH systems. In Ji et al. (2021), we have investigated the response of
circumbinary broad line region (BLR) to the central active secondary black hole under the relativistic
Doppler boosting (BBH-DB) and intrinsic variation (BBH-IntDB) dominant mechanisms for continuum
variation by assuming the middle plane of the BLR aligned with the BBH orbital plane. In this paper,
we explore how the BEL profiles vary when the BLR is misaligned from the BBH orbital plane with different
offset angles under both the BBH-DB and BBH-IntDB scenarios. Given a fixed inclination angle of
the BBH orbital plane viewed in edge-on and similar continuum light curves produced by the two scenarios,
increasing offset angles make the initial opening angle of the circumbinary BLR enlarged due to
orbital precession caused by the BBH system, especially for clouds in the inner region, which result
in Lorentz-like BEL profiles for the BBH-DB model but still Gaussian-like profiles for the BBH-IntDB
model at the vertical BLR case. The amplitude of profile variations decrease with increasing offset
angles for the BBH-DB scenario, while keep nearly constant for the BBH-IntDB scenario, since the
Doppler boosting effect is motion direction preferred but the intrinsic variation is radiated
isotropically. If the circumbinary BLR is composed of a coplanar and a vertical components with
their number of clouds following the mass ratio of the BBHs, then the bi-BLR features are more significant
for the BBH-IntDB model that require larger mass ratio to generate similar continuum variation
than the BBH-DB model.

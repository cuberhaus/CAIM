We study evolution of galactic bars using a suite of very high-resolution zoom-in cosmological
simulations of galaxies at high redshifts, z ~ 9-2. Our models have been chosen to lie within similar
mass dark matter (DM) halos, log(Mvir}/Mo)~ 11.65 +/- 0.05, at redshifts 6, 4, and 2, in high and low
overdensity environments. We apply two galactic wind feedback mechanisms for each galaxy model.
All galaxies develop sub-kpc stellar bars which differ in their properties. We find that (1) The
high-z bars form in response to various perturbations, namely, mergers, close flybys, cold accretion
inflows along the cosmological filaments, etc.; (2) These bars account for a large-mass fraction
of the parent galaxies; (3) The bars display large corotation-to-bar size ratios, and are weaker
compared to their low-redshift counterparts, by measuring their Fourier amplitudes; (4) High-z
bars are very gas-rich, and (5) Their pattern speed evolution does not exhibit the monotonic decline
with time as a result of braking against the DM, as at low z; (6) The bar properties, including their
stellar population (star formation rates and metal enrichment) depend sensitively on the prevailing
feedback; (7) Finally, we find that bars can weaken substantially during cosmological evolution,
becoming weak oval distortions -- hence bars are destroyed and reformed multiple times unlike their
low-z counterparts. Moreover, in all cases, the bars in our simulations have been triggered by interactions.
In summary, stellar bars appear to be not only a contemporary phenomenon, but based on the increased
frequency of mergers, flybys and the strength of cold accretion flows at high $z$, we expect them
to be ubiquitous at redshifts > 2 -- the epoch of a rapid galaxy growth and larger stellar dispersion
velocities.

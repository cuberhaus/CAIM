The Kennicutt-Schmidt law is an empirical relation between the star formation rate surface density
($\Sigma_{SFR}$) and the gas surface density ($\Sigma_{gas}$) in disc galaxies. The relation
has a power-law form $\Sigma_{SFR} \propto \Sigma_{gas}^n$. Assuming that star formation results
from gravitational collapse of the interstellar medium, $\Sigma_{SFR}$ can be determined by dividing
$\Sigma_{gas}$ by the local free-fall time $t_{ff}$. The formulation of $t_{ff}$ yields the relation
between $\Sigma_{SFR}$ and $\Sigma_{gas}$, assuming that a constant fraction ($\varepsilon_{SFE}$)
of gas is converted into stars every $t_{ff}$. This is done here for the first time using Milgromian
dynamics (MOND). Using linear stability analysis of a uniformly rotating thin disc, it is possible
to determine the size of a collapsing perturbation within it. This lets us evaluate the sizes and
masses of clouds (and their $t_{ff}$) as a function of $\Sigma_{gas}$ and the rotation curve. We
analytically derive the relation $\Sigma_{SFR} \propto \Sigma_{gas}^{n}$ both in Newtonian
and Milgromian dynamics, finding that $n=1.4$. The difference between the two cases is a change
only to the constant pre-factor, resulting in increased $\Sigma_{SFR}$ of up to 25\% using MOND
in the central regions of dwarf galaxies. Due to the enhanced role of disk self-gravity, star formation
extends out to larger galactocentric radii than in Newtonian gravity, with the clouds being larger.
In MOND, a nearly exact representation of the present-day main sequence of galaxies is obtained
if $\epsilon_{SFE} = \text{constant} \approx 1.1\%$. We also show that empirically found correction
terms to the Kennicutt-Schmidt law are included in the here presented relations. Furthermore,
we determine that if star formation is possible, then the temperature only affects $\Sigma_{SFR}$
by at most a factor of $\sqrt{2}$.

Mrk926 is known to be a highly variable AGN with very broad line profiles. We studied the continuum
and line profile variations of this object with high temporal resolution in order to determine its
broad-line region structure and to derive its BH mass. We carried out a high-cadence spectroscopic
variability campaign of Mrk926 with the 10m HET telescope, aided by photometric V-band data taken
at the Wise Observatory, over a period of about five months. We extracted spectroscopic continuum
and line light curves, and computed CCFs as well as velocity-resolved CCFs with respect to the combined
continuum V-band light curve. The continuum luminosity of Mrk926 showed a drastic decrease during
our campaign: it dropped to less than 50% of its original value within only 2.5 months. The spectra
show complex and very broad Balmer line profiles, including outer Balmer satellites ranging from
+-5000 to +-13,000 kms-1. The Ha, Hb, and HeI5876 line light curves are delayed relative to the continuum
light curve. The Ha and Hb lines show two velocity-delay structures in the central part of their line
profile (within +- 5000 kms-1), at ~10 and ~57 ld and at ~5 and ~48 ld, respectively. These structures
might be interpreted as the signature of a line-emitting ring, inclined by ~50 deg to the line of sight
and orbiting the BH at radii, R, of 33.5 and 26.5 ld. We determined continuum luminosities, log(lambda\,L_(lambda)/erg
s-1), of 43.68 to 44.13, which are in good agreement with the established R_(BLR)-L_(AGN) relation.
We derive a black hole mass of 1.1 +- 0.2 * 10^8 M_solar; this indicates a low Eddington ratio, which
decreased from 8 to 3 percent during our campaign. The Balmer satellite components show a response
to the continuum variations on the order of only 3-5 days. We attribute this to the central line segment
and the Balmer satellites having different, spatially distinct regions of origin.

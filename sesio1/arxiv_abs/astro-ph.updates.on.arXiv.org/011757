Context. To better understand the formation of high-mass stars, it is fundamental to investigate
how matter accretes onto young massive stars, how it is ejected, and how all this differs from the
low-mass case. The massive protocluster G31.41+0.31 is the ideal target to study all these processes
because observations at millimeter and centimeter wavelengths have resolved the emission of the
Main core into at least four massive dust continuum sources, named A, B, C, and D, within 1" or 0.018
pc, and have identified signatures of infall and several outflows associated with the core. Aims.
We study the interplay between infall and outflow in G31.41+0.31 by investigating at a spatial resolution
of a few 100 au their properties and their possible impact on the core. Methods. We carried out molecular
line observations of typical high-density tracers, such as CH3CN or H2CO, and shock and outflow
tracers, such as SiO, with ALMA at 1.4 mm that achieved an angular resolution of 0.09" (340 au). Results.
The observations have revealed inverse P-Cygni profiles in CH3CN and H2CO toward the four sources
embedded in the Main core, suggesting that all of them are undergoing collapse. The infall rates,
estimated from the red-shifted absorption are on the order of 1E-2 Msun/yr. The individual infall
rates imply that the accretion timescale of the Main core is an order of magnitude smaller than its
rotation timescale. This confirms that rotating toroids such as the G31 Main core are non-equilibrium,
transient collapsing structures that need to be constantly replenished with fresh material from
a large-scale reservoir. For sources B, C, and D, the infall could be accelerating inside the sources,
while for source A, the presence of a second emission component complicates the interpretation.
The SiO observations have revealed the presence of at least six outflows in the G31.41+0.31 star-forming
region, ...

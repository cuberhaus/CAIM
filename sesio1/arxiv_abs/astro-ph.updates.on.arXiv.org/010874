We report observations of polarized line and continuum emission from the disk of TW~Hya using the
Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. We target three emission lines, $^{12}$CO (3-2),
$^{13}$CO (3-2) and CS (7-6), to search for linear polarization due to the Goldreich-Kylafis effect,
while simultaneously tracing the continuum polarization morphology at 332\,GHz (900\,\micron{}),
achieving a spatial resolution of 0.5\arcsec{} (30~au). We detect linear polarization in the dust
continuum emission; the polarization position angles show an azimuthal morphology, and the median
polarization fraction is $\sim$\,0.2\%, comparable to previous, lower frequency observations.
Adopting a `shift-and-stack' technique to boost the sensitivity of the data, combined with a linear
combination of the $Q$ and $U$ components to account for their azimuthal dependence, we detect weak
linear polarization of $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO line emission at a $\sim 10\sigma$ and $\sim 5\sigma$
significance, respectively. The polarization was detected in the line wings, reaching a peak polarization
fraction of $\sim 5\%$ and $\sim 3\%$ for the two molecules between disk radii of 0.5" and 1". The sign
of the polarization was found to flip from the blue-shifted side of the emission to the red-shifted
side, suggesting a complex, asymmetric polarization morphology. Polarization is not robustly
detected for the CS emission; however, a tentative signal, comparable in morphology to that found
for the $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO emission, is found at a $\lesssim 3\sigma$ significance. We are
able to reconstruct a polarization morphology, consistent with the azimuthally averaged profiles,
under the assumption that this is also azimuthally symmetric, which can be compared with future
higher-sensitivity observations.

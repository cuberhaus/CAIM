We report the detection of ten new binary black hole (BBH) merger signals in the publicly released
data from the the first half of the third observing run (O3a) of advanced LIGO and advanced Virgo.
Candidates are identified using an updated version of the IAS pipeline (Venumadhav et al.), and
events are declared according to criteria similar to those in the GWTC-2.1 catalog (Abbott et al.).
The updated search is sensitive to a larger region of parameter space, applies a template prior that
accounts for different search volume as a function of intrinsic parameters, and uses an improved
coherent detection statistic that optimally combines data from the Hanford and Livingston detectors.
Among the ten new events, we find interesting astrophysical scenarios including sources with confidently
large effective spin in both the positive and negative directions, high-mass black holes that are
difficult to form in stellar collapse models due to (pulsational) pair instability, and low-mass
mergers bridging the gap between neutron stars and the lightest observed black holes. We detect
events populating the upper and lower black hole mass gaps with both extreme and near-unity mass
ratios, and one of the possible neutron star--black hole mergers is well localized for electromagnetic
counterpart searches. We see a substantial increase in significance for many of the events previously
reported by other pipelines, and we detect all of the GWTC-2.1 BBH mergers with coincident data in
Hanford and Livingston except for three loud events that get vetoed (compatible with the false-positive
rate of our veto procedure) and three that fall below the detection threshold. We also return to significance
the event GW190909_114149, which was reduced to a sub-threshold trigger in GWTC-2.1. This makes
a total of 42 BBH mergers detected by our pipeline's Hanford--Livingston coincident search of the
O3a data.

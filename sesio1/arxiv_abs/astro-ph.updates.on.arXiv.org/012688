We present a convolutional neural network that is capable of searching for continuous gravitational
waves, quasi-monochromatic, persistent signals arising from asymmetrically rotating neutron
stars, in $\sim 1$ year of simulated data that is plagued by non-stationary, narrow-band disturbances,
i.e., lines. Our network has learned to classify the input strain data into four categories: (1)
only Gaussian noise, (2) an astrophysical signal injected into Gaussian noise, (3) a line embedded
in Gaussian noise, and (4) an astrophysical signal contaminated by both Gaussian noise and line
noise. In our algorithm, different frequencies are treated independently; therefore, our network
is robust against sets of evenly-spaced lines, i.e., combs, and we only need to consider perfectly
sinusoidal line in this work. We find that our neural network can distinguish between astrophysical
signals and lines with high accuracy. In a frequency band without line noise, the sensitivity depth
of our network is about $\mathcal{D}^{95\%} \simeq 43.9$ with a false alarm probability of $\sim
0.5\%$, while in the presence of line noise, we can maintain a false alarm probability of $\sim 10\%$
and achieve $\mathcal{D}^\mathrm{95\%} \simeq 3.62$ when the line noise amplitude is $h_0^\mathrm{line}/\sqrt{S_\mathrm{n}(f_k)}
= 1.0$. We evaluate the computational cost of our method to be $O(10^{19})$ floating point operations,
and compare it to those from standard all-sky searches, putting aside differences between covered
parameter spaces. Our results show that our method is more efficient by one or two orders of magnitude
than standard searches. Although our neural network takes about $O(10^8)$ sec to employ using our
current facilities (a single GPU of GTX1080Ti), we expect that it can be reduced to an acceptable
level by utilizing a larger number of improved GPUs.

The role played by environment in galaxy evolution is a current debate in astronomy. The degree to
which environment can alter, re-shape, or drive galaxy evolution is a topic of discussion in both
fronts, observations and simulations. This paper analyses the gas metallicity gradients for a
sample of 10 Fornax cluster galaxies observed with MUSE as part of the Fornax3D project. Detailed
maps of emission lines allowed a precise determination of gas metallicity and metallicity gradients.
The integrated gas metallicity of our Fornax cluster galaxies show slightly higher metallicities
(~0.045 dex) in comparison to a control sample. In addition, we find signs of a mass and metallicity
segregation from the center to the outskirts of the cluster. By comparing our Fornax cluster metallicity
gradients with a control sample we find a general median offset of ~0.04 dex/Re, with 8 of our galaxies
showing flatter or more positive gradients. We find no systematic difference between the gradients
of recent and intermediate infallers when considering the projected distance of each galaxy to
the cluster center. To identify the origin of the observed offset in the metallicity gradients,
we perform a similar analysis with data from the TNG50 simulation. We identify 12 subhalos in Fornax-like
clusters and compare their metallicity gradients with a control sample of field subhalos. This
exercise also shows a flattening in the metallicity gradients for galaxies in Fornax-like halos,
with a median offset of ~0.05 dex/Re We also analyse the merger history, Mach numbers (M), and ram
pressure stripping of our TNG50 sample. We conclude that the observed flattening in metallicity
gradients is likely due to a combination of galaxies traveling at supersonic velocities (M>1) that
are experiencing high ram pressure stripping and flybys.

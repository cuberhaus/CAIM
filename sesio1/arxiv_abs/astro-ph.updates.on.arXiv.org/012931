We present a tomographic weak lensing analysis of the Kilo Degree Survey Data Release 4 (KiDS-1000),
using a new pseudo angular power spectrum estimator (pseudo-$C_{\ell}$) under development for
the ESA Euclid mission. Over 21 million galaxies with shape information are divided into five tomographic
redshift bins, ranging from 0.1 to 1.2 in photometric redshift. We measured pseudo-$C_{\ell}$
using eight bands in the multipole range $76<\ell<1500$ for auto- and cross-power spectra between
the tomographic bins. A series of tests were carried out to check for systematic contamination from
a variety of observational sources including stellar number density, variations in survey depth,
and point spread function properties. While some marginal correlations with these systematic
tracers were observed, there is no evidence of bias in the cosmological inference. B-mode power
spectra are consistent with zero signal, with no significant residual contamination from E/B-mode
leakage. We performed a Bayesian analysis of the pseudo-$C_{\ell}$ estimates by forward modelling
the effects of the mask. Assuming a spatially flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we constrained the structure
growth parameter $S_8 = \sigma_8(\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3)^{1/2} = 0.754_{-0.029}^{+0.027}$. When
combining cosmic shear from KiDS-1000 with baryon acoustic oscillation and redshift space distortion
data from recent Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) measurements of luminous red galaxies, as well
as the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest and its cross-correlation with quasars, we tightened these constraints
to $S_8 = 0.771^{+0.006}_{-0.032}$. These results are in very good agreement with previous KiDS-1000
and SDSS analyses and confirm a $\sim 3\sigma$ tension with early-Universe constraints from cosmic
microwave background experiments.

A new, more comprehensive model of gas-grain chemistry in hot molecular cores is presented, in which
nondiffusive reaction processes on dust-grain surfaces and in ice mantles are implemented alongside
traditional diffusive surface/bulk-ice chemistry. We build on our nondiffusive treatments used
for chemistry in cold sources, adopting a standard collapse/warm-up physical model for hot cores.
A number of other new chemical model inputs and treatments are also explored in depth, culminating
in a final model that demonstrates excellent agreement with gas-phase observational abundances
for many molecules, including some (e.g.~methoxymethanol) that could not be reproduced by conventional
diffusive mechanisms. Observed ratios of structural isomers methyl formate, glycolaldehyde
and acetic acid are well reproduced by the models. The main temperature regimes are identified in
which various complex organic molecules (COMs) are formed. Nondiffusive chemistry advances the
production of many COMs to much earlier times and lower temperatures than in previous model implementations.
Those species may form either as by-products of simple-ice production, or via early photochemistry
within the ices while external UV photons can still penetrate. Cosmic ray-induced photochemistry
is less important than in past models, although it affects some species strongly over long timescales.
Another production regime occurs during the high-temperature desorption of solid water, whereby
radicals trapped in the ice are released onto the grain/ice surface, where they rapidly react. Several
recently-proposed gas-phase COM-production mechanisms are also introduced, but they rarely
dominate. New surface/ice reactions involving CH and CH$_2$ are found to contribute substantially
to the formation of certain COMs.

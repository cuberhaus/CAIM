Linking atmospheric characteristics of planets to their formation pathways is a central theme
in the study of extrasolar planets. Although the 12C/13C isotope ratio shows little variation in
the solar system, the atmosphere of a super-Jupiter was recently shown to be rich in 13CO, possibly
as a result of dominant ice accretion beyond the CO snowline during its formation. In this paper we
aim to measure the 12CO/13CO isotopologue ratio of a young, isolated brown dwarf. While the general
atmospheric characteristics of young, low mass brown dwarfs are expected to be very similar to those
of super-Jupiters, their formation pathways may be different, leading to distinct isotopologue
ratios. We analyse archival K-band spectra of the L dwarf 2MASS J03552337+1133437 taken with NIRSPEC
at the Keck telescope. A free retrieval analysis is applied to the data to determine the isotopologue
ratio 12CO/13CO in its atmosphere. The isotopologue 13CO, is detected in the atmosphere through
the cross-correlation method at a signal-to-noise of ~8.4. The detection significance is determined
to be ~9.5 sigma using Bayesian model comparison between two retrieval models. We retrieve an isotopologue
ratio 12CO/13CO of 97(+25/-18), marginally higher than the local interstellar standard. Its C/O
ratio of ~0.56 is consistent with the solar value. Although only one super-Jupiter and one brown
dwarf have now a measured 12CO/13CO ratio, it is intriguing that they are different, possibly hinting
to distinct formation pathways. Albeit spectroscopic similarities, isolated brown dwarfs may
experience a top-down formation via gravitational collapse, which resembles star formation,
while giant exoplanets favorably form through core accretion, which potentially alters isotopologue
ratios in their atmospheres depending on the material they accrete from protoplanetary disks.

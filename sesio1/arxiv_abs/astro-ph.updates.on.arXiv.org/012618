The internal composition of neutron stars is still an open issue in astrophysics. Their innermost
regions are impervious to light propagation and gravitational waves mostly carry global aspects
of stars, meaning that only indirect inferences of their interiors could be obtained. Here we assume
a hypothetical future scenario in which an equation of state softening due to a phase transition
is identified and estimate the observational accuracy to differentiate a sharp phase transition
from a smoother one (associated with a mixed phase/state due to the unknown value of the surface tension
of dense matter) in a region of a hybrid star by means of some electromagnetic and gravitational wave
observables. We show that different transition constructions lead to similar sequences of stellar
configurations due to their shared thermodynamic properties. In the most optimistic case - a strong
quark-hadron density jump phase transition - radius observations require fractional uncertainties
smaller than $1\%-2\%$ to differentiate mixed states from sharp phase transitions. For tidal deformabilities,
relative uncertainties should be smaller than $5\%-10\%$. However, for masses around the onset
of stable quark cores, relative tidal deformability differences associated with strong sharp
phase transitions and mixed states could be much larger (up to around $20\%-30\%$). All the above
suggests that 2.5- and 3rd generation gravitational wave detectors and near-term electromagnetic
missions may be able to start assessing some particular aspects of phase transitions in neutron
stars. In addition, it points to some limitations on the equation of state recovery using typical
neutron star observables and the impact of systematic uncertainties on modellings of the equation
of state of hybrid stars. Finally, we briefly discuss other observables that may also be relevant
for the probe of mixed states in stars.

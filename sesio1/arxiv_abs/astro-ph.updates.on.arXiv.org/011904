Dust plays a pivotal role in determining the observed spectral energy distribution (SED) of galaxies.
Yet our understanding of dust attenuation is limited and our observations suffer from the dust-metallicity-age
degeneracy in SED fitting (single galaxies), large individual variances (ensemble measurements),
and the difficulty in properly dealing with uncertainties (statistical considerations). In this
study, we create a population Bayesian model to rigorously account for correlated variables and
non-Gaussian error distributions and demonstrate the improvement over a simple Bayesian model.
We employ a flexible 5-D linear interpolation model for the parameters that control dust attenuation
curves as a function of stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), metallicity, redshift, and inclination.
Our setup allows us to determine the complex relationships between dust attenuation and these galaxy
properties simultaneously. Using Prospector fits of nearly 30,000 3D-HST galaxies, we find that
the attenuation slope ($n$) flattens with increasing optical depth ($\tau$), though less so than
in previous studies. $\tau$ increases strongly with SFR, though when $\log~{\rm SFR}\lesssim
0$, $\tau$ remains roughly constant over a wide range of stellar masses. Edge-on galaxies tend to
have larger $\tau$ than face-on galaxies, but only for $\log~M_*\gtrsim 10$, reflecting the lack
of triaxiality for low-mass galaxies. Redshift evolution of dust attenuation is strongest for
low-mass, low-SFR galaxies, with higher optical depths but flatter curves at high redshift. Finally,
$n$ has a complex relationship with stellar mass, highlighting the intricacies of the star-dust
geometry. We have publicly released software (https://github.com/Astropianist/DustE) for
users to access our population model.

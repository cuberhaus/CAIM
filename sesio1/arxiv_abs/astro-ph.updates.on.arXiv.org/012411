An important future goal in exoplanetology is to detect and characterize potentially habitable
planets. Using nulling interferometry, LIFE will allow us to constrain the radius and effective
temperature of (terrestrial) exoplanets, as well as provide unique information about their atmospheric
structure and composition. We explore the potential of LIFE in characterizing emission spectra
of Earth at various stages of its evolution. We perform Bayesian retrievals on simulated spectra
of 8 different scenarios, which correspond to cloud-free and cloudy spectra of four different epochs
of the evolution of the Earth. Assuming a distance of 10 pc and a Sun-like host star, we simulate observations
obtained with LIFE using its simulator LIFEsim, considering all major astrophysical noise sources.
With the nominal spectral resolution (R=50) and signal-to-noise ratio (assumed to be S/N=10 at
11.2 $\mu$m), we can identify the main spectral features of all the analyzed scenarios (most notably
CO$_2$, H$_2$O, O$_3$, CH$_4$). This allows us to distinguish between inhabited and lifeless scenarios.
Results suggest that particularly O$_3$ and CH$_4$ yield an improved abundance estimate by doubling
the S/N from 10 to 20. We conclude that the baseline requirements for R and S/N are sufficient for LIFE
to detect O$_3$ and CH$_4$ in the atmosphere of an Earth-like planet with an abundance of O$_2$ of
around 2% in volume mixing ratio. This information is relevant in terms of the LIFE mission planning.
We also conclude that cloud-free retrievals of cloudy planets can be used to characterize the atmospheric
composition of terrestrial habitable planets, but not the thermal structure of the atmosphere.
From the inter-model comparison performed, we deduce that differences in the opacity tables (caused
by e.g. a different line wing treatment) may be an important source of systematic errors.

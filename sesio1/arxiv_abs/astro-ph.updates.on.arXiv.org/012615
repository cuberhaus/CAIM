29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1 is a distant Centaur/comet, showing persistent CO-driven activity
and frequent outbursts. We used the Herschel space observatory in 2010, 2011, and 2013 to observe
H$_2$O and NH$_3$ and to image the dust coma. Observations with the IRAM 30 m were undertaken in 2007,
2010, 2011, and 2021 to monitor the CO production rate and to search for HCN. Modeling was performed
to constrain the size of the sublimating icy grains and to derive the dust production rate. HCN is
detected for the first time in comet 29P (at 5$\sigma$ in the line area). H$_2$O is detected as well,
but not NH$_3$. H$_2$O and HCN line shapes differ strongly from the CO line shape, indicating that
these two species are released from icy grains. CO production rates are in the range (2.9--5.6) $\times$
10$^{28}$ s$^{-1}$ (1400--2600 kg s$^{-1}$). A correlation between the CO production rate and
coma brightness is observed, as is a correlation between CO and H$_2$O production. The correlation
obtained between the excess of CO production and excess of dust brightness with respect to the quiescent
state is similar to that established for the continuous activity of comet Hale-Bopp. The measured
$Q$(H$_2$O)/$Q$(CO) and $Q$(HCN)/$Q$(CO) production rate ratios are 10.0 $\pm$ 1.5 \% and 0.12
$\pm$ 0.03 \%, respectively, averaging the April-May 2010 measurements ($Q$(H$_2$O) = (4.1 $\pm$
0.6) $\times$ 10$^{27}$ s$^{-1}$, $Q$(HCN) = (4.8 $\pm$ 1.1) $\times$ 10$^{25}$ s$^{-1}$). We
derive three independent and similar values of the effective radius of the nucleus, $\sim$ 31 $\pm$
3 km. The inferred dust mass-loss rates during quiescent phases are in the range 30--120 kg s$^{-1}$,
indicating a dust-to-gas mass ratio $<$ 0.1 during quiescent activity. We conclude that strong
local heterogeneities exist on the surface of 29P, with quenched dust activity from most of the surface,
but not in outbursting regions.

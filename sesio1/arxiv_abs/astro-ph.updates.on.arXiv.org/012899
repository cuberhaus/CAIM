The accretion rates needed to fuel the central black hole in a galaxy can be achieved via viscous torques
in thick disks and rings, which can be resolved by millimetre interferometry within the inner ~20pc
of the active galaxy NGC1068 at comparable scales and sensitivity to single dish observations of
the Circumnuclear Disk (CND) in the Galactic Center. To interpret observations of these regions
and determine the physical properties of their gas distribution, we present a modelling effort
that includes (i) a simple dynamical simulations involving partially inelastic collisions between
disk gas clouds, (ii) an analytical model of a turbulent clumpy gas disk calibrated by the dynamical
model and observations, (iii) local turbulent and cosmic ray gas heating and cooling via H2O, H2,
and CO emission, and (iv) determination of the molecular abundances. We also consider photodissociation
regions (PDR) where gas is directly illuminated by the central engine. We compare the resulting
model datacubes of the CO, HCN, HCO+, and CS brightness temperatures to available observations.
In both cases the kinematics can be explained by one or two clouds colliding with a pre-existing ring,
in a prograde sense for the CND and retrograde for NGC1068. And, with only dense disk clouds, the line
fluxes can be reproduced to within a factor of about two. To avoid self-absorption of the intercloud
medium, turbulent heating at the largest scales, comparable to the disk height, has to be decreased
by a factor of 50-200. Our models indicate that turbulent mechanical energy input is the dominant
gas heating mechanism within the thick gas disks. In N1068, while the bulk of the AGN X-ray radiation
is absorbed in a layer of Compton-thick gas inside the dust sublimation radius, the optical/UV radiation
may enhance the molecular line emission from photodissociation regions by ~50% at the inner edge
of the gas ring.

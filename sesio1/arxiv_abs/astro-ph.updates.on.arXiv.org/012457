In a previous paper we studied the effect of latitudinal rotation on solar equatorial Rossby modes
in the beta-plane approximation. Since then, a rich spectrum of inertial modes has been observed
on the Sun, which is not limited to the equatorial Rossby modes and includes high-latitude modes.
Here we extend the computation of toroidal modes in 2D to spherical geometry, using realistic solar
differential rotation and including viscous damping. The aim is to compare the computed mode spectra
with the observations and to study mode stability. At fixed radius, we solve the eigenvalue problem
numerically using a spherical harmonics decomposition of the velocity stream function. Due to
the presence of viscous critical layers, the spectrum consists of four different families: Rossby
modes, high-latitude modes, critical-latitude modes, and strongly damped modes. For each longitudinal
wavenumber m<4, up to three Rossby-like modes are present on the sphere, in contrast to the equatorial
beta plane where only the equatorial Rossby mode is present. The least damped modes in the model have
eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions that resemble the observed modes; the comparison improves
when the radius is taken in the lower half of the convection zone. For radii above 0.75R and Ekman numbers
E<10^{-4}, at least one mode is unstable. For either m=1 or m=2, up to two Rossby modes are unstable
when the radial dependence of the Ekman number follows a quenched diffusivity model (E=2. 10^{-5}
at the base of the convection zone). For m=3, up to two Rossby modes can be unstable, including the
equatorial Rossby mode. Although the 2D model discussed here is highly simplified, the spectrum
of toroidal modes appears to include many of the observed solar inertial modes. The self-excited
modes in the model have frequencies close to those of the observed modes with the largest amplitudes.

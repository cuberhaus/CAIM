We present a new method to obtain the interstellar radiation field (ISRF) of regions that contain
stars, dust and gas. Starting from stellar spectra, we first run the radiative transfer code Skirt
to compute the mean intensity field due to the stellar component alone. Then, we import that result
to the photoionisation code Cloudy to compute the emissivity and opacity of the given mixture of
gas and dust as a function of wavelength. Finally, we ask Skirt again to compute the mean intensity
field, adding the total contribution of stars, gas and dust. This process is repeated iteratively,
calling both codes sequentially in order to obtain increasingly accurate estimates. We have designed
a first test, reminiscent of an HII region, that consists of a B star, approximated as a black-body,
surrounded by a spherical shell of gas and dust with uniform density. We find that the results of our
three-dimensional radiative transfer method are in excellent agreement with a spherically symmetric
Cloudy simulation. As a realistic scientific application, we calculate the interstellar radiation
field of a Milky Way-like galaxy based on two different chemical evolution models. Both of them give
results broadly consistent with previous ones reported in the literature for the interstellar
radiation field of our Galaxy, albeit they systematically underestimate the mid-infrared emission,
with significant differences in this range, as well as in the ultraviolet, stemming from the input
stellar and ISM properties. These results show the feasibility of our method to incorporate radiative
transfer to chemical evolution models, increasing their predictive power and using this interstellar
radiation field to further constrain their parameters. Python source code to implement our method
is publicly available at https://github.com/MarioRomeroC/Mixclask.

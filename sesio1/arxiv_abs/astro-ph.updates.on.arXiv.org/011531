We investigate the occurrence of classical (type-I) Cepheid variable stars (henceforth: Cepheids)
in dynamically evolving star clusters from birth to an age of approximately 300 Myr. The clusters
are modelled by the Aarseth code nbody6, and they feature a realistic stellar initial mass function
and initial binary star population, single star and binary star evolution, expulsion of the primordial
gas, and the tidal field of the galaxy. Our simulations provide the first detailed dynamical picture
of how frequently Cepheids remain gravitationally bound to their birth clusters versus how frequently
they occur in the field. They allow us to quantify the relevance of various cluster escape mechanisms
and how they depend on stellar mass. Overall, the simulations agree with the empirical picture that
a small fraction ($\approx 10\%$) of Cepheids reside in clusters, that cluster halo membership
is relatively common, and that the majority of Cepheid hosting clusters have only a single Cepheid
member. Additionally, the simulations predict that a) Cepheid progenitors are much more likely
to escape from low-mass than higher-mass clusters; b) higher-mass (long-period) Cepheids are
$\approx 30\%$ more likely to be found in clusters than low-mass (short-period) Cepheids; c) the
clustered Cepheid fraction increases with galactocentric radius since cluster dispersal is less
efficient at greater radii; d) a lower metallicity reduces the overall clustered Cepheid fraction;
e) high-mass clusters are much more likely to have more than one Cepheid member at any given time,
in particular at a lower metallicity. We interpret the results as outcomes of various aspects of
star cluster dynamics. The comparison of predicted and observed clustered Cepheid fractions,
$f_{\rm CC}$, highlights the need for additional cluster disruption mechanisms, most likely encounters
with giant molecular clouds.

(Abridged) The Euclid mission is expected to discover thousands of z>6 galaxies in three Deep Fields,
which together will cover a ~40 deg2 area. However, the limited number of Euclid bands and availability
of ancillary data could make the identification of z>6 galaxies challenging. In this work, we assess
the degree of contamination by intermediate-redshift galaxies (z=1-5.8) expected for z>6 galaxies
within the Euclid Deep Survey. This study is based on ~176,000 real galaxies at z=1-8 in a ~0.7 deg2
area selected from the UltraVISTA ultra-deep survey, and ~96,000 mock galaxies with 25.3$\leq$H<27.0,
which altogether cover the range of magnitudes to be probed in the Euclid Deep Survey. We simulate
Euclid and ancillary photometry from the fiducial, 28-band photometry, and fit spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) to various combinations of these simulated data. Our study demonstrates
that identifying z>6 with Euclid data alone will be very effective, with a z>6 recovery of 91(88)%
for bright (faint) galaxies. For the UltraVISTA-like bright sample, the percentage of z=1-5.8
contaminants amongst apparent z>6 galaxies as observed with Euclid alone is 18%, which is reduced
to 4(13)% by including ultra-deep Rubin (Spitzer) photometry. Conversely, for the faint mock sample,
the contamination fraction with Euclid alone is considerably higher at 39%, and minimized to 7%
when including ultra-deep Rubin data. For UltraVISTA-like bright galaxies, we find that Euclid
(I-Y)>2.8 and (Y-J)<1.4 colour criteria can separate contaminants from true z>6 galaxies, although
these are applicable to only 54% of the contaminants, as many have unconstrained (I-Y) colours.
In the most optimistic scenario, these cuts reduce the contamination fraction to 1% whilst preserving
81% of the fiducial z>6 sample. For the faint mock sample, colour cuts are infeasible.

The recently discovered population of interstellar objects presents us with the opportunity to
characterize material from extrasolar planetary and stellar systems up close. The forthcoming
Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will provide an unprecedented increase
in sensitivity to these objects compared to the capabilities of currently operational observational
facilities. In this paper, we generate a synthetic population of interstellar objects drawn from
their galactic kinematics, and identify the distribution of impact parameters, eccentricities,
hyperbolic velocities and sky locations of objects detectable with the LSST. This population is
characterized by a clustering of trajectories in the direction of the solar apex and anti-apex,
centered at orbital inclinations of $\sim90^\circ$. We identify the ecliptic or solar apex as the
optimal sky locations to search for future interstellar objects as a function of survey limiting
magnitude. Moreover, we identify the trajectories of detectable objects that will be reachable
for $\textit{in situ}$ rendezvous with a dedicated mission with the capabilities of the forthcoming
$\textit{Comet Interceptor}$ or proposed $\textit{BRIDGE}$ concept. By scaling our fractional
population statistics with the inferred spatial number density, we estimate that the LSST will
detect of order $\sim50$ interstellar objects over the course of its $\sim10$ year observational
campaign. Furthermore, we find that there should be of order $\sim10$ and $\sim0.05$ reachable
targets for missions with propulsion capabilities comparable to $\textit{BRIDGE}$ and $\textit{Comet
Interceptor}$, respectively. These number estimates will be readily updateable when the number
density and size frequency distribution of interstellar objects is better constrained.

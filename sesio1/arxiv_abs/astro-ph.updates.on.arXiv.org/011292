Stable mass transfer from a massive post-main sequence (post-MS) donor is thought to be a short-lived
event of thermal-timescale mass transfer which strips the donor star of nearly its entire H-rich
envelope, producing a hot helium star. This long-standing picture is based on stellar models with
Hertzprung gap (HG) donors. Motivated by a finding that in low-metallicity binaries, post-MS mass
transfer may instead be initiated by core-helium burning (CHeB) donors, we use the MESA code to compute
grids of detailed massive binary models at three metallicities: Solar and that of the Large and the
Small Magellanic Cloud (LMC, SMC). We find that metallicity strongly influences the course and
outcome of mass transfer. We identify two novel types of post-MS mass transfer: (a) mass exchange
on the long nuclear timescale that continues until the end of the CHeB phase, and (b) rapid mass transfer
leading to detached binaries with mass-losers that are only partially stripped of their envelopes.
In neither (a) or (b) does the donor become a fully stripped helium star by the end of CHeB. Boundaries
between the different types of post-MS mass transfer are associated with the degree of rapid post-MS
expansion and, for a given metallicity, are sensitive to the assumptions about internal mixing.
At low metallicity, we predict fewer hot fully stripped stars formed through binary interactions
and higher compactness of pre-supernova cores. Nuclear-timescale post-MS mass transfer suggests
a strong preference for metal-poor host galaxies of ultra-luminous X-ray sources with black-hole
(BH) accretors and massive donors, some of which might be the immediate progenitors of binary BH
mergers. It also implies a population of interacting binaries with blue and yellow supergiant donors.
Partially-stripped stars could potentially explain the puzzling nitrogen-enriched slowly-rotating
(super)giants in the LMC.

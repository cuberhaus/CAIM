Precise measurements of black hole masses are essential to understanding the coevolution of these
sources and their host galaxies. We develop a novel approach for computing black hole virial masses
using measurements of continuum luminosities and emission line widths from partially overlapping,
narrow-band observations of quasars; we refer to this technique as single-epoch photometry. This
novel method relies on forward-modelling quasar observations for estimating emission line widths,
which enables unbiased measurements even for lines coarsely resolved by narrow-band data. We assess
the performance of this technique using quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) observed
by the miniJPAS survey, a proof-of-concept project of the Javalambre Physics of the Accelerating
Universe Astrophysical Survey (J-PAS) collaboration covering $\simeq1\,\mathrm{deg}^2$ of
the northern sky using the 56 J-PAS narrow-band filters. We find remarkable agreement between black
hole masses from single-epoch SDSS spectra and single-epoch miniJPAS photometry, with no systematic
difference between these and a scatter ranging from 0.4 to 0.07 dex for masses from $\log(M_\mathrm{BH})\simeq8$
to 9.75, respectively. Reverberation mapping studies show that single-epoch masses present approximately
0.4 dex precision, letting us conclude that our novel technique delivers black hole masses with
only mildly lower precision than single-epoch spectroscopy. The J-PAS survey will soon start observing
thousands of square degrees without any source preselection other than the photometric depth in
the detection band, and thus single-epoch photometry has the potential to provide details on the
physical properties of quasar populations that do not satisfy the preselection criteria of previous
spectroscopic surveys.

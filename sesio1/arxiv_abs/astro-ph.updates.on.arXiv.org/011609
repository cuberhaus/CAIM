Being the most massive binary black hole merger event observed to date, GW190521 is in a class of its
own. The exceptionally loud ringdown of this merger makes it an ideal candidate to search for gravitational
wave echoes, a proposed smoking gun for the quantum structure of black hole horizons. We perform
an unprecedented multi-pronged search for echoes via two well-established and independent pipelines:
a template-based search for stimulated emission of Hawking radiation, or Boltzmann echoes, and
the model-agnostic coherent WaveBurst (cWB) search. Stimulated Hawking radiation from the merger
is expected to lead to post-merger echoes at horizon mode frequency of $\sim 50$ Hz (for quadrupolar
gravitational radiation), repeating at intervals of $\sim 1$ second, due to partial reflection
off Planckian quantum structure of the horizon. A careful analysis using dynamic nested sampling
yields a Bayesian evidence of $ 7\pm 2$ (90% confidence level) for this signal following GW190521,
carrying an excess of $10^{+9}_{-7}\%$ in gravitational wave energy, relative to the main event.
Similarly, the reconstructed waveform of the first echo in cWB carries an energy excess of $13^{+16}_{-7}\%$.
Accounting for the "look-elsewhere" effects, we estimate a p-value for false detection probability
of $5.1 \times 10^{-3}$ (or 2.6$\sigma$) using cWB pipeline, although the verdict on the co-localization
of the post-merger echo and the main event in the sky is inconclusive. While the current evidence
for stimulated Hawking radiation does not reach the gold standard of $5\sigma$, our findings are
in line with expectations for stimulated Hawking radiation at current detector sensitivities.
The next generation of gravitational wave observatories can thus draw a definitive conclusion
on the quantum nature of black hole horizons.

Ultraviolet (UV) light plays a key role in surficial theories of the origin of life, and numerous
studies have focused on constraining the atmospheric transmission of UV radiation on early Earth.
However, the UV transmission of the natural waters in which origins-of-life chemistry (prebiotic
chemistry) is postulated to have occurred is poorly constrained. In this work, we combine laboratory
and literature-derived absorption spectra of potential aqueous-phase prebiotic UV absorbers
with literature estimates of their concentrations on early Earth to constrain the prebiotic UV
environment in marine and terrestrial natural waters, and consider the implications for prebiotic
chemistry. We find that prebiotic freshwaters were largely transparent in the UV, contrary to assumptions
by some models of prebiotic chemistry. Some waters, e.g., high-salinity waters like carbonate
lakes, may be deficient in shortwave ($\leq220$ nm) UV flux. More dramatically, ferrous waters
can be strongly UV-shielded, particularly if the Fe$^{2+}$ forms highly UV-absorbent species
like Fe(CN)$_6^{4-}$. Such waters may be compelling venues for UV-averse origin-of-life scenarios,
but are disfavorable for some UV-dependent prebiotic chemistries. UV light can trigger photochemistry
even if attenuated through photochemical transformations of the absorber (e.g., $e^{-}_{aq}$
production from halide irradiation), which may have both constructive and destructive effects
for prebiotic syntheses. Prebiotic chemistries invoking waters containing such absorbers must
self-consistently account for the chemical effects of these transformations. The speciation
and abundance of Fe$^{2+}$ in natural waters on early Earth is a major uncertainty, and should be
prioritized for further investigation as it plays a major role in UV transmission in prebiotic natural
waters.

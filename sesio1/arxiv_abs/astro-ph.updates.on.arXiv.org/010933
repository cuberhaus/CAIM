In the standard cosmology, it is believed that there are two relatively weak and distinct band-limited
absorption features, with the first absorption minima near 20 MHz ($z\sim70$) and the other minima
at higher frequencies between 50-110 MHz ($z\sim12-27$) in the global cosmological 21cm signal,
which are signatures of collisional gas dynamics in the cosmic dark ages and Lyman-$\alpha$ photons
from the first stars at cosmic dawn, respectively. A similar prediction of two distinct band-limited,
but stronger, absorption features is expected in models with excess gas cooling, which have been
invoked to explain the EDGES signal. In this work, we explore a novel mechanism, where dark matter
spin-flip interactions with electrons through a light axial-vector mediator could directly induce
a 21cm absorption signal which is characteristically different from either of these. We find generically,
that our model predicts a strong, broadband absorption signal extending from frequencies as low
as 1.4 MHz ($z\sim1000$), from early in the cosmic dark ages where no conventional signal is expected,
all the way up to higher frequencies where star formation and X-ray heating effects are expected
to terminate the absorption signal. In the standard cosmology and in excess gas cooling models it
is expected that the gas spin temperature as inferred from the absorption signal is a tracer of the
gas kinetic temperature. However, in our model we find in certain regions of parameter space that
the spin temperature and kinetic temperature of the gas evolve differently, and the absorption
signal only measures the spin temperature evolution. Large swathes of our model parameter space
of interest are safe from existing constraints, however future searches for short range spin-dependent
forces between electrons on the mm to nm scale have the potential to discover the light mediator responsible
for our predicted signal.

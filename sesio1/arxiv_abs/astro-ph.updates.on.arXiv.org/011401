We present the photometric analysis of Gaia19bld, a high-magnification ($A\approx60$) microlensing
event located in the southern Galactic plane, which exhibited finite source and microlensing parallax
effects. Due to a prompt detection by the Gaia satellite and the very high brightness of $I = 9.05~$mag
at the peak, it was possible to collect a complete and unique set of multi-channel follow-up observations,
which allowed us to determine all parameters vital for the characterisation of the lens and the source
in the microlensing event. Gaia19bld was discovered by the Gaia satellite and was subsequently
intensively followed up with a network of ground-based observatories and the Spitzer Space Telescope.
We collected multiple high-resolution spectra with Very Large Telescope (VLT)/X-Shooter to characterise
the source star. The event was also observed with VLT Interferometer (VLTI)/PIONIER during the
peak. Here we focus on the photometric observations and model the light curve composed of data from
Gaia, Spitzer, and multiple optical, ground-based observatories. We find the best-fitting solution
with parallax and finite source effects. We derived the limit on the luminosity of the lens based
on the blended light model and spectroscopic distance. We compute the mass of the lens to be $1.13
\pm 0.03~M_{\odot}$ and derive its distance to be $5.52^{+0.35}_{-0.64}~\mathrm{kpc}$. The
lens is likely a main sequence star, however its true nature has yet to be verified by future high-resolution
observations. Our results are consistent with interferometric measurements of the angular Einstein
radius, emphasising that interferometry can be a new channel for determining the masses of objects
that would otherwise remain undetectable, including stellar-mass black holes.

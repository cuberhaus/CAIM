Context: The star cluster R136 inside the LMC hosts a rich population of massive stars, including
the most massive stars known. The strong stellar winds of these very luminous stars impact their
evolution and the surrounding environment. We currently lack detailed knowledge of the wind structure
that is needed to quantify this impact. Aims: To observationally constrain the stellar and wind
properties of the massive stars in R136, in particular the parameters related to wind clumping.
Methods: We simultaneously analyse optical and UV spectroscopy of 53 O-type and 3 WNh-stars using
the FASTWIND model atmosphere code and a genetic algorithm. The models account for optically thick
clumps and effects related to porosity and velocity-porosity, as well as a non-void interclump
medium. Results: We obtain stellar parameters, surface abundances, mass-loss rates, terminal
velocities and clumping characteristics and compare these to theoretical predictions and evolutionary
models. The clumping properties include the density of the interclump medium and the velocity-porosity
of the wind. For the first time, these characteristics are systematically measured for a wide range
of effective temperatures and luminosities. Conclusions: We confirm a cluster age of 1.0-2.5 Myr
and derive an initial stellar mass of $\geq 250 {\rm M}_\odot$ for the most massive star in our sample,
R136a1. The winds of our sample stars are highly clumped, with an average clumping factor of $f_{\rm
cl}=29\pm15$. We find tentative trends in the wind-structure parameters as a function of mass-loss
rate, suggesting that the winds of stars with higher mass-loss rates are less clumped. We compare
several theoretical predictions to the observed mass-loss rates and terminal velocities and find
that none satisfactorily reproduces both quantities. The prescription of Krti\v{c}ka & Kub\'at
(2018) matches best the observed mass-loss rates.

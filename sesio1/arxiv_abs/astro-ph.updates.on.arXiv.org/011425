A cluster intermediate in age between the Pleiades (150 Myr) and the Hyades (600 Myr) is needed to
probe the rotational evolution, especially the transition between fast and slow rotation that
occurs between the two ages. We study the rich 300 Myr-old open cluster NGC 3532 to provide constraints
on angular momentum loss. Measuring the rotation periods builds on our prior work of providing spectroscopic
membership information for the cluster, and it supports the chromospheric activity measurements
of cluster stars that we provide in a companion paper. Using 42 d-long photometric time series observations,
we measured rotation periods for members of NGC 3532 and compared them with the predictions of angular
momentum evolution models. We directly measured 176 photometric rotation periods for the cluster
members. An additional 113 photometric rotation periods were identified using activity information
resulting in a total sample containing 279 rotation periods for FGKM stars in NGC 3532. The colour-period
diagram constructed from this rich data set shows a well-populated and structured slow rotator
sequence, and a fast rotator sequence evolved beyond zero-age main sequence age whose stars are
in transition from fast to slow rotation. We also identify an extended slow rotator sequence, apparently
the analogue of the one we previously identified in NGC 2516. We compare our period distribution
to rotational isochrones in colour-period space and find that all considered models have certain
shortcomings. Using more detailed spin-down models, we evolve the rotation periods of the younger
NGC 2516 forward in time and find that the spindown of the models is too aggressive with respect to
the slow rotators. In contrast, stars on the evolved fast rotator sequence are not spun down strongly
enough by these models. Our observations suggest a shorter crossing time for the rotational gap.

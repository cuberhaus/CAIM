Transmission spectra of exoplanets orbiting active stars suffer from wavelength-dependent effects
due to stellar photospheric heterogeneity. WASP-19b, an ultra-hot Jupiter (T$_{eq}$ $\sim$ 2100
K), is one such strongly irradiated gas-giant orbiting an active solar-type star. We present optical
(520-900 nm) transmission spectra of WASP-19b obtained across eight epochs using the Gemini Multi-Object
Spectrograph (GMOS) on the Gemini-South telescope. We apply our recently developed Gaussian Processes
regression based method to model the transit light curve systematics and extract the transmission
spectrum at each epoch. We find that WASP-19b's transmission spectrum is affected by stellar variability
at individual epochs. We report an observed anticorrelation between the relative slopes and offsets
of the spectra across all epochs. This anticorrelation is consistent with the predictions from
the forward transmission models, which account for the effect of unocculted stellar spots and faculae
measured previously for WASP-19. We introduce a new method to correct for this stellar variability
effect at each epoch by using the observed correlation between the transmission spectral slopes
and offsets. We compare our stellar variability corrected GMOS transmission spectrum with previous
contradicting MOS measurements for WASP-19b and attempt to reconcile them. We also measure the
amplitude and timescale of broadband stellar variability of WASP-19 from TESS photometry, which
we find to be consistent with the effect observed in GMOS spectroscopy and ground-based broadband
photometric long-term monitoring. Our results ultimately caution against combining multi-epoch
optical transmission spectra of exoplanets orbiting active stars before correcting each epoch
for stellar variability.

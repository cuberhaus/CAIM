The shear signal required for weak lensing analyses is small, so any detector-level effects which
distort astronomical images can contaminate the inferred shear. The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope
(Roman) will fly a focal plane with 18 Teledyne H4RG-10 near infrared (IR) detector arrays; these
have never been used for weak lensing and they present unique instrument calibration challenges.
A pair of previous investigations (Hirata & Choi 2020; Choi & Hirata 2020) demonstrated that spatiotemporal
correlations of flat fields can effectively separate the brighter-fatter effect (BFE) and interpixel
capacitance (IPC). Later work (Freudenburg et al. 2020) introduced a Fourier-space treatment
of these correlations which allowed the authors to expand to higher orders in BFE, IPC, and classical
nonlinearity (CNL). This work expands the previous formalism to include quantum yield and charge
diffusion. We test the updated formalism on simulations and show that we can recover input characterization
values. We then apply the formalism to visible and IR flat field data from three Roman flight candidate
detectors. We fit a 2D Gaussian model to the charge diffusion at 0.5 $\mu$m wavelength, and find variances
of $C_{11} = 0.1066\pm 0.0011$ pix$^2$ in the horizontal direction, $C_{22} = 0.1136\pm 0.0012$
pix$^2$ in the vertical direction, and a covariance of $C_{12} = 0.0001\pm 0.0007$ pix$^2$ (stat)
for SCA 20829. Last, we convert the asymmetry of the charge diffusion into an equivalent shear signal,
and find a contamination of the shear correlation function to be $\xi_+ \sim 10^{-6}$ for each detector.
This exceeds Roman's allotted error budget for the measurement by a factor of $\mathcal{O}(10)$
in power (amplitude squared) but can likely be mitigated through standard methods for fitting the
point spread function (PSF) since charge diffusion can be treated as a contribution to the PSF.

Investigating the heliospheric evolution and consequences of Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is
critical to understanding the solar-terrestrial relationship. For the first time, Heliospheric
Imagers (HIs) onboard STEREO, providing multiple views of CMEs in the heliosphere, observed the
vast and crucial observational gap between the Sun and the Earth. Using J-maps constructed from
coronagraphs (CORs) and HIs observations, we continuously tracked different density enhanced
features of CMEs. We implemented several reconstruction methods to estimate the three-dimensional
(3D) kinematics of CMEs during their evolution from the Sun to Earth. Our study provides evidence
that the 3D speeds of CMEs near the Sun are not reasonably sufficient for understanding the propagation
and accurate forecasting of the arrival time at the Earth of a majority of CMEs. This finding can be
due to many factors that significantly change the CME kinematics beyond the COR field of view, such
as the interaction/collision of two or more CMEs or the interaction of CMEs with the ambient solar
wind medium. We attempted to understand the evolution and consequences of the interacting/colliding
CMEs in the heliosphere using STEREO/HI, WIND, and ACE observations. The study found a significant
change in the dynamics of the CMEs after their collision and interaction. The in situ observations
show the signatures of CME-CME interaction as heating and compression, formation of magnetic holes
(MHs), and interaction region (IR). We also noticed that long-lasting IR, formed at the rear edge
of preceding CME, is responsible for large geomagnetic perturbations. Our study highlights the
significance of using HIs observations in studying heliospheric evolution of CMEs, CME-CME collision,
identifying and associating the three-part structure of CMEs in their remote and in situ observations,
and hence for improved space weather forecasting.

The extreme contrast ratios between stars and their planets at optical wavelengths make it challenging
to isolate the light reflected by exoplanet atmospheres. Yet, these reflective properties reveal
key processes occurring in the atmospheres, and they also span wavelengths that include the potential
O$_2$ biosignature. High resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy (HRCCS) offers a robust
avenue for developing techniques to extract exoplanet reflection spectra. We aimed to extract
the optical reflected light spectrum of the non-transiting hot Jupiter 51 Peg b by adapting techniques
designed to remove tellurics in infrared HRCCS to instead remove optical stellar lines. Importantly,
we investigated the so far neglected impact of the broadening of the reflected host star spectrum
due to the difference between the stellar rotation and the planet's orbital velocity. We used 484,
R=115000 optical spectra of 51 Peg b from HARPS-N and HARPS, which we aligned to the exact stellar
rest frame in order to effectively remove the contaminating host star. However, some stellar residuals
remained, likely due to stellar activity. We cross-correlated with an appropriately broadened
synthetic stellar model to search for the planet's Doppler-shifting spectrum. We detect no significant
reflected light from 51 Peg b and report a S/N=3 upper limit on the contrast ratio of 76.0 ppm (7.60x10$^{-5}$)
when including broadening, and 24.0 ppm (2.40x10$^{-5}$) without. These upper limits rule out
radius and albedo combinations of previously claimed detections. Broadening can significantly
impact the ability of HRCCS to extract reflected light spectra and must be considered when determining
the contrast ratio, radius, and albedo of the planet. Asynchronous systems (Prot,$_{\star}\ne$
Porb) are most affected, including most hot Jupiters as well as Earth-size planets in the traditional
habitable zones of some M-dwarfs.

Recent high-spatial-resolution observations have revealed dust substructures in protoplanetary
disks such as rings and gaps, which do not always correlate with gas. Because radial gas flow induced
by low-mass, non-gas-gap-opening planets could affect the radial drift of dust, it potentially
forms these dust substructures in disks. We investigate the potential of gas flow induced by low-mass
planets to sculpt the rings and gaps in the dust profiles. We first perform three-dimensional hydrodynamical
simulations, which resolve the local gas flow past a planet. We then calculate the trajectories
of dust influenced by the planet-induced gas flow. Finally, we compute the steady-state dust surface
density by incorporating the influences of the planet-induced gas flow into a one-dimensional
dust advection-diffusion model. The outflow of the gas toward the outside of the planetary orbit
inhibits the radial drift of dust, leading to dust accumulation (the dust ring). The outflow toward
the inside of the planetary orbit enhances the inward drift of dust, causing dust depletion around
the planetary orbit (the dust gap). Under weak turbulence ($\alpha_{\rm diff}\lesssim10^{-4}$,
where $\alpha_{\rm diff}$ is the turbulence strength parameter), the gas flow induced by the planet
with $\gtrsim1\,M_{\oplus}$ (Earth mass) generates the dust ring and gap in the distribution of
small dust grains ($\lesssim1$ cm) with the radial extent of $\sim1\text{--}10$ times gas scale
height around the planetary orbit without creating a gas gap and pressure bump. The gas flow induced
by low-mass, non-gas-gap-opening planets can be considered a possible origin of the observed dust
substructures in disks. Our results may be helpful to explain the disks whose dust substructures
were found not to correlate with those of the gas.

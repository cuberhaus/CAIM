Classical Cepheids are primary distance indicators and a crucial stepping stone to determining
the present-day Hubble constant Ho to the precision and accuracy required to constrain apparent
deviations from the LCDM Concordance Cosmological Model. We have measured the iron and oxygen abundances
of a sample of 90 Cepheids in the LMC, one of the anchors of the local Distance Scale, quadrupling the
prior sample and including 68 of the 70 Cepheids used to constrain Ho by the SH0ES program. The goal
is to constrain the extent to which the Cepheid luminosity is influenced by their chemical composition,
an important contributor to the uncertainty on the determination of the Ho itself and a critical
factor in the internal consistency of the distance ladder. We have derived stellar parameters and
abundances from a self-consistent spectroscopic analysis based on Equivalent Width of absorption
lines. The [Fe/H] distribution of LMC Cepheids can be very accurately described by a single Gaussian
with a mean of -0.407+-0.003 dex and sigma 0.076+-0.003 dex.The latter is fully compatible with
the measurement error and supports the low dispersion of 0.069 mag seen in the NIR HST LMC period-luminosity
relation. The uniformity of the abundance has the important consequence that the LMC Cepheids alone
cannot provide any meaningful constraint on the dependence of the Cepheid Period-Luminosity relation
on chemical composition at any wavelength. This revises a prior claim based on a small sample of 22
LMC Cepheids that there was little dependence (or uncertainty) between composition and NIR luminosity,
a conclusion which would produce a conflict between anchors of the distance ladder with different
mean abundance. The chemical homogeneity of the LMC Cepheid population makes it an ideal environment
to calibrate the metallicity dependence between the more metal poor SMC and metal rich Milky Way
and NGC4258.

A solar-type system starts from an initial molecular core that acquires organic complexity as it
evolves. The so-called prestellar cores that can be studied are rare, which has hampered our understanding
of how organic chemistry sets in and grows. Aims. We selected the best prestellar core targets from
the cold core catalogue that represent a diversity in terms of their environment to explore their
chemical complexity: 1390 (in the compressed shell of Lambda Ori), 869 (in the MBM12 cloud), and
4149 (in the California nebula). We obtained a spectral survey with the IRAM 30 m telescope in order
to explore the molecular complexity of the cores. We carried out a radiative transfer analysis of
the detected transitions in order to place some constraints on the physical conditions of the cores
and on the molecular column densities. We also used the molecular ions in the survey to estimate the
cosmic-ray ionisation rate and the S/H initial elemental abundance using a gas-phase chemical
model to reproduce their abundances. We found large differences in the molecular complexity (deuteration,
complex organic molecules, sulphur, carbon chains, and ions) and compared their chemical properties
with a cold core and two prestellar cores. The chemical diversity we found in the three cores seems
to be correlated with their chemical evolution: two of them are prestellar (1390 and 4149), and one
is in an earlier stage (869). The influence of the environment is likely limited because cold cores
are strongly shielded from their surroundings. The high extinction prevents interstellar UV radiation
from penetrating deeply into the cores. Higher spatial resolution observations of the cores are
therefore needed to constrain the physical structure of the cores, as well as a larger-scale distribution
of molecular ions to understand the influence of the environment on their molecular complexity.

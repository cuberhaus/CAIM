We show how $\varsigma$, the radial location of the minimum of the differential radial mass profile
$M^\prime(r)$ of a galaxy cluster, can probe the theory of gravity. We derive $M^\prime(r)$ of the
dark matter halos of galaxy clusters from N-body cosmological simulations that implement two different
theories of gravity: standard gravity in the $\Lambda$CDM model and $f(R)$. We extract 49169 dark
matter halos in 11 redshift bins in the range $0\leq z\leq 1$ and in three different mass bins in the
range $0.9<M_{200}/10^{14}h^{-1}$M$_\odot<11$. We investigate the correlation of $\varsigma$
with the redshift and the mass accretion rate (MAR) of the halos. We show that $\varsigma$ decreases
from $\sim 3R_{200}$ to $\sim 2R_{200}$ when $z$ increases from 0 to $1$ in the $\Lambda$CDM model;
at $z\sim 0.1$, $\varsigma$ decreases from $2.75R_{200}$ to $\sim 2.5R_{200}$ when the MAR increases
from $\sim 10^4h^{-1}$M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ to $\sim 2\times 10^5h^{-1}$M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$;
in the $f(R)$ model, $\varsigma$ is $\sim 15$% larger than in $\Lambda$CDM. We detect $\varsigma$
and its correlation with redshift and MAR in three samples of real clusters. We consider 129 clusters
of galaxies from the Cluster Infall Regions in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (CIRS) and the Hectospec
Cluster Survey (HeCS), and 10 additional stacked clusters from the HectoMAP survey. The clusters
span the redshift range $0.01 < z < 0.4$ and the mass range $\sim 10^{14}-10^{15} h^{-1}$M$_{\odot}$.
The values of $\varsigma$ of real clusters appear consistent with both the $\Lambda$CDM and $f(R)$
models, because the current uncertainties on the measured mass profiles are too large. We estimate
that decreasing the uncertainties by a factor of ten and distinguishing between the two theories
of gravity that we investigate here requires $\gtrsim 400$ clusters, each with $\sim 200$ spectroscopic
redshifts of galaxies.

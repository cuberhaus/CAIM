We report the archival discovery of Lyman-$\alpha$ emission from the bright ultraviolet galaxy
Y002 at $z=7.677$, spectroscopically confirmed by its ionized carbon [CII] 158$\mu$m emission
line. The Ly$\alpha$ line is spatially associated with the rest-frame UV stellar emission ($M_{\rm
UV}$~-22, 2x brighter than $M^\star_{\rm UV}$) and it appears offset from the peak of the extended
[CII] emission at the current ~1" spatial resolution. We derive an estimate of the unobscured SFR(UV)=$(22\pm1)\,M_\odot$
yr$^{-1}$ and set an upper limit of SFR(IR)$<15\,M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ from the far-infrared wavelength
range, which globally place Y002 on the SFR(UV+IR)-L([CII]) correlation observed at lower redshifts.
In terms of velocity, the peak of the Ly$\alpha$ emission is redshifted by $\Delta v$(Ly$\alpha$)~500
km s$^{-1}$ from the systemic redshift set by [CII] and a high-velocity tail extends to up to ~1000
km s$^{-1}$. The velocity offset is up to ~3.5x higher than the average estimate for similarly UV-bright
emitters at z~6-7, which might suggest that we are witnessing the merging of two clumps. A combination
of strong outflows and the possible presence of an extended ionized bubble surrounding Y002 would
likely facilitate the escape of copious Ly$\alpha$ light, as indicated by the large equivalent
width EW(Ly$\alpha$)=$24\pm1$ \r{A}. Assuming that [CII] traces the neutral hydrogen, we estimate
a HI gas fraction of $M({\rm HI})/M_\star\gtrsim8$ for Y002 as a system and speculate that patches
of high HI column densities could contribute to explain the observed spatial offsets between Ly$\alpha$
and [CII] emitting regions. The low dust content, implied by the non-detection of the far-infrared
continuum emission at rest-frame ~160 $\mu$m, would be sufficient to absorb any potential Ly$\alpha$
photons produced within the [CII] clump as a result of large HI column densities.

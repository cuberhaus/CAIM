We study the relationships between stellar mass, size and age within the quiescent population,
using two mass-complete spectroscopic samples with $\mathrm{log_{10}}(M_{\star}/\mathrm{M_{\odot}})>10.3$,
taken from VANDELS at $1.0<z<1.3$, and LEGA-C at $0.6<z<0.8$. Using robust D$_{n}$4000 values,
we demonstrate that the well-known 'downsizing' signature is already in place by $z\simeq1.1$,
with D$_{n}$4000 increasing by $\simeq0.1$ across a $\simeq$ 1 dex mass interval for both VANDELS
and LEGA-C. We then proceed to investigate the evolution of the quiescent galaxy stellar mass-size
relation from $z\simeq1.1$ to $z\simeq0.7$. We find the median size increases by a factor of $1.9\pm{0.1}$
at $\mathrm{log_{10}}(M_{\star}/\mathrm{M_{\odot}})=10.5$, and see tentative evidence for
flattening of the relation, finding slopes of $\alpha=0.72\pm0.06$ and $\alpha=$ $0.56\pm0.04$
for VANDELS and LEGA-C respectively. We finally split our sample into galaxies above and below our
fitted mass-size relations, to investigate how size and D$_{n}$4000 correlate. For LEGA-C, we
see a clear difference, with larger galaxies found to have smaller D$_{n}$4000 at fixed stellar
mass. Due to the faintness and smaller numbers of the VANDELS sample, we cannot confirm whether a
similar relation exists at $z\simeq1.1$. We consider whether differences in stellar age or metallicity
are most likely to drive this size-D$_{n}$4000 relation, finding that any metallicity differences
are unlikely to fully explain the observed offset, meaning smaller galaxies must be older than their
larger counterparts. We find the observed evolution in size, mass and D$_{n}$4000 across the $\simeq2$
Gyr from $z\sim1.1$ to $z\sim0.7$ can be explained by a simple toy model in which VANDELS galaxies
evolve passively, whilst experiencing a series of minor mergers.

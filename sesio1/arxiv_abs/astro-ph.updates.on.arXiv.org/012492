Stably-stratified layers may be present at the top of the electrically-conducting fluid layers
of many planets either because the temperature gradient is locally subadiabatic or because a stable
composition gradient is maintained by the segregation of chemical elements. Here we study the double-diffusive
processes taking place in such a stable layer, considering the case of Mercury's core where the temperature
gradient is stable but the composition gradient is unstable over a 800km-thick layer. The large
difference in the molecular diffusivities leads to the development of buoyancy-driven instabilities
that drive radial flows known as fingering convection. We model fingering convection using hydrodynamical
simulations in a rotating spherical shell and varying the rotation rate and the stratification
strength. For small Rayleigh numbers (i.e. weak background temperature and composition gradients),
fingering convection takes the form of columnar flows aligned with the rotation axis and with an
azimuthal size comparable with the layer thickness. For larger Rayleigh numbers, the flows retain
a columnar structure but the azimuthal size is drastically reduced leading to thin sheet-like structures
that are elongated in the meridional direction. The azimuthal length decreases when the thermal
stratification increases, following closely the scaling law expected from the linear non-rotating
planar theory (Stern, 1960). We find that the radial flows always remain laminar with local Reynolds
number of order 1-10. Equatorially-symmetric zonal flows form due to latitudinal variations of
the axisymmetric composition. The zonal velocity exceeds the non-axisymmetric velocities at
the largest Rayleigh numbers. We discuss plausible implications for planetary magnetic fields.

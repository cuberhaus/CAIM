We measure how the atomic gas (HI) fraction ($f_{HI}={\rm \frac{M_{HI}}{M_{*}}}$) of groups and
pairs taken as single units vary with average stellar mass ($\langle {\rm M_*} \rangle$) and average
star-formation rate ($\langle {\rm SFR} \rangle$), compared to isolated galaxies. The HI 21 cm
emission observation are from (i) archival ALFALFA survey data covering three fields from the GAMA
survey (provides environmental and galaxy properties), and (ii) DINGO pilot survey data of one
of those fields. The mean $f_{HI}$ for different units (groups/pairs/isolated galaxies) are measured
in regions of the log($\langle {\rm M_*} \rangle$) -- log($\langle {\rm SFR} \rangle$) plane, relative
to the z $\sim 0$ star-forming main sequence (SFMS) of individual galaxies, by stacking $f_{HI}$
spectra of individual units. For ALFALFA, $f_{HI}$ spectra of units are measured by extracting
HI spectra over the full groups/pair areas and dividing by the total stellar mass of member galaxies.
For DINGO, $f_{HI}$ spectra of units are measured by co-adding HI spectra of individual member galaxies,
followed by division by their total stellar mass. For all units the mean $f_{HI}$ decreases as we
move to higher $\langle {\rm M_*} \rangle$ along the SFMS, and as we move from above the SFMS to below
it at any $\langle {\rm M_*} \rangle$. From the DINGO-based study, mean $f_{HI}$ in groups appears
to be lower compared to isolated galaxies for all $\langle {\rm M_*} \rangle$ along the SFMS. From
the ALFALFA-based study we find substantially higher mean $f_{HI}$ in groups compared to isolated
galaxies (values for pairs being intermediate) for ${\langle{\rm M_*}\rangle}\lesssim10^{9.5}~{\rm
M_{\odot}}$, indicating the presence of substantial amounts of HI not associated with cataloged
member galaxies in low mass groups.

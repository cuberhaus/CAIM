Deep near-infrared photometric surveys are efficient in identifying high-redshift galaxies,
however they can be prone to systematic errors in photometric redshift. This is particularly salient
when there is limited sampling of key spectral features of a galaxy's spectral energy distribution
(SED), such as for quiescent galaxies where the expected age-sensitive Balmer/4000 A break enter
the $K$-band at $z>4$. With single filter sampling of this spectral feature, degeneracies between
SED models and redshift emerge. A potential solution to this comes from splitting the $K$-band into
multiple filters. We use simulations to show an optimal solution is to add two medium-band filters,
$K_\mathrm{blue}$ ($\lambda_\mathrm{cen}$=2.06 $\mu$m, $\Delta\lambda$=0.25 $\mu$m) and
$K_\mathrm{red}$ ($\lambda_\mathrm{cen}$=2.31 $\mu$m, $\Delta\lambda$=0.27 $\mu$m), that
are complementary to the existing $K_\mathrm{s}$ filter. We test the impact of the $K$-band filters
with simulated catalogues comprised of galaxies with varying ages and signal-to-noise. The results
suggest that the $K$-band filters do improve photometric redshift constraints on $z>4$ quiescent
galaxies, increasing precision and reducing outliers by up to 90$\%$. We find that the impact from
the $K$-band filters depends on the signal-to-noise, the redshift and the SED of the galaxy. The
filters we designed were built and used to conduct a pilot of the FLAMINGOS-2 Extra-galactic Near-Infrared
$K$-band Split (FENIKS) survey. While no new $z>4$ quiescent galaxies are identified in the limited
area pilot, the $K_\mathrm{blue}$ and $K_\mathrm{red}$ filters indicate strong Balmer/4000
A breaks in existing candidates. Additionally we identify galaxies with strong nebular emission
lines, for which the $K$-band filters increase photometric redshift precision and in some cases
indicate extreme star-formation.

The Astro2020 report outlines numerous recommendations that could significantly advance technosignature
science. Technosignatures refer to any observable manifestations of extraterrestrial technology,
and the search for technosignatures is part of the continuum of the astrobiological search for biosignatures.
The search for technosignatures is directly relevant to the "World and Suns in Context" theme and
"Pathways to Habitable Worlds" program in the Astro2020 report. The relevance of technosignatures
was explicitly mentioned in "E1 Report of the Panel on Exoplanets, Astrobiology, and the Solar System,"
which stated that "life's global impacts on a planet's atmosphere, surface, and temporal behavior
may therefore manifest as potentially detectable exoplanet biosignatures, or technosignatures"
and that potential technosignatures, much like biosignatures, must be carefully analyzed to mitigate
false positives. The connection of technosignatures to this high-level theme and program can be
emphasized, as the report makes clear the purpose is to address the question "Are we alone?" This
question is also presented in the Explore Science 2020-2024 plan as a driver of NASA's mission. This
white paper summarizes the potential technosignature opportunities within the recommendations
of the Astro2020 report, should they be implemented by funding agencies. The objective of this paper
is to demonstrate the relevance of technosignature science to a wide range of missions and urge the
scientific community to include the search for technosignatures as part of the stated science justifications
for the large and medium programs that include the Infrared/Optical/Ultraviolet space telescope,
Extremely Large Telescopes, probe-class far-infrared and X-ray missions, and various facilities
in radio astronomy.

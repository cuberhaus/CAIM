We analyse quasi-periodic pulsations (QPP) detected in the microwave and decimeter radio emission
of the SOL2017-09-05T07:04 solar flare, using simultaneous observations by the Siberian Radioheliograph
48 (SRH-48, 4-8 GHz) and Mingantu Spectral Radioheliograph (MUSER-I, 0.4-2 GHz). The microwave
emission was broadband with a typical gyrosynchrotron spectrum, while a quasi-periodic enhancement
of the decimetric emission appeared in a narrow spectral band (500-700 MHz), consistent with the
coherent plasma emission mechanism. The periodicity that we found in microwaves is about 30 s, coming
from a compact loop-like source with a typical height of about 31 Mm. The decimetric emission demonstrated
a periodicity about 6 s. We suggested a qualitative scenario linking the QPPs observed in both incoherent
and coherent spectral bands and their generation mechanisms. The properties of the QPPs found in
the microwave signal are typical for perturbations of the flare loop by the standing sausage mode
of a fast magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave. Our analysis indicated that this sausage-oscillating
flare loop was the primary source of oscillations in the discussed event. The suggested scenario
is that a fundamental sausage harmonic is the dominant cause for the observed QPPs in the microwave
emission. The initiation of oscillations in the decimetric emission is caused by the third sausage
harmonic via periodic and nonlinear triggering of the acceleration processes in the current sheets,
formed at the interface between the sausage-oscillating flare loop and the external coronal loop
that extended to higher altitudes. Our results demonstrate the possible role of MHD wave processes
in the release and transport of energy during solar flares, linking coherent and incoherent radio
emission mechanisms.

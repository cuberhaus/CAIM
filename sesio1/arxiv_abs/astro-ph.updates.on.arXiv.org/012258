Some protostellar systems show little or no millimetre line emission of complex organics. This
can be interpreted as a low abundance of these molecules, alternatively they could be present in
the system but are not seen in the gas. The goal is to investigate the latter hypothesis for methanol.
We will attempt to answer the question: Does the presence of a disk and optically thick dust reduce
methanol emission even if methanol is abundant in the ices and gas? Using the radiative transfer
code RADMC-3D, methanol emission lines from an envelope-only model and an envelope-plus-disk
model are calculated and compared with each other and the observations. Methanol emission from
the envelope-only model is always stronger than from the envelope-plus-disk model by at least a
factor 2 as long as the disk radius is larger than 30 au (for L=8 L$_{\odot}$). In most cases, this is
due to lower temperatures and, hence, the smaller amount of warm methanol inside the snow surface
of the envelope-plus-disk model. The intensities drop by more than an order of magnitude for models
including high mm opacity dust grains and disk radii of at least 50 au (for L=8 L$_{\odot}$) due to
continuum over-subtraction. The line intensities from the envelope-only models overproduce
the observations of protostars with lower methanol emission even with large dust optical depth
effects. The envelope-plus-disk models can explain the bulk of the observations. However, they
can only reproduce the observations of sources with high luminosities and low methanol emission
when dust optical depth effects especially continuum over-subtraction in the disk becomes effective.
Therefore, both the effects of disk and dust optical depth should be considered to explain the observations.
In conclusion: Absence of methanol emission does not imply absence of methanol molecules in either
gas or ice.

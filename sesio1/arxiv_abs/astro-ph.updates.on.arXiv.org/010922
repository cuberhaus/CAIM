We present panchromatic observations and modeling of supernova (SN) 2020tlf, the first normal
type II-P/L SN with confirmed precursor emission, as detected by the Young Supernova Experiment
transient survey with the Pan-STARRS1 telescope. Pre-explosion emission was detected in $riz-$bands
at 130 days prior to SN 2020tlf and persisted at relatively constant flux until first light. Soon
after discovery, "flash" spectroscopy of SN 2020tlf revealed prominent narrow symmetric emission
lines ($v_w < 300$ km s$^{-1}$) that resulted from the photo-ionization of unshocked circumstellar
material (CSM) shedded in progenitor mass loss episodes in the final weeks to months before explosion.
Surprisingly, this novel display of pre-SN emission and associated mass loss occurred in a RSG progenitor
with ZAMS mass of only 10-12 M$_{\odot}$, as inferred from nebular spectra. Modeling of the light
curve and multi-epoch spectra with the non-LTE radiative transfer code CMFGEN and radiation-hydrodynamical
(RHD) code HERACLES suggests a dense CSM limited to $r \approx 10^{15}$ cm, and mass loss rate of $10^{-2}$
M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The subsequent luminous light-curve plateau and persistent blue excess
indicates an extended progenitor, compatible with a RSG model with $R_{\star} = 1100$ R$_{\odot}$.
Inferences from the limits on the shock-powered X-ray and radio luminosity are consistent with
these conclusions and suggest a CSM density of $\rho < 2 \times 10^{-16}$ g cm$^{-3}$ for distances
of $r \approx 5 \times 10^{15}$ cm, as well as a mass loss rate of $\dot M<1.3 \times 10^{-5}\,\rm{M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}}$
at larger distances. A promising power source for the observed precursor emission is the ejection
of stellar material following energy disposition into the stellar envelope as a result of gravity
waves emitted during either neon/oxygen burning or a nuclear flash from silicon combustion.

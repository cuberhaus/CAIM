The Euclid space telescope will survey a large dataset of cosmic voids traced by dense samples of
galaxies. In this work we estimate its expected performance when exploiting angular photometric
void clustering, galaxy weak lensing and their cross-correlation. To this aim, we implement a Fisher
matrix approach tailored for voids from the Euclid photometric dataset and present the first forecasts
on cosmological parameters that include the void-lensing correlation. We examine two different
probe settings, pessimistic and optimistic, both for void clustering and galaxy lensing. We carry
out forecast analyses in four model cosmologies, accounting for a varying total neutrino mass,
$M_\nu$, and a dynamical dark energy (DE) equation of state, $w(z)$, described by the CPL parametrisation.
We find that void clustering constraints on $h$ and $\Omega_b$ are competitive with galaxy lensing
alone, while errors on $n_s$ decrease thanks to the orthogonality of the two probes in the 2D-projected
parameter space. We also note that, as a whole, the inclusion of the void-lensing cross-correlation
signal improves parameter constraints by $10-15\%$, and enhances the joint void clustering and
galaxy lensing Figure of Merit (FoM) by $10\%$ and $25\%$, in the pessimistic and optimistic scenarios,
respectively. Finally, when further combining with the spectroscopic galaxy clustering, assumed
as an independent probe, we find that, in the most competitive case, the FoM increases by a factor
of 4 with respect to the combination of weak lensing and spectroscopic galaxy clustering taken as
independent probes. The forecasts presented in this work show that photometric void-clustering
and its cross-correlation with galaxy lensing deserve to be exploited in the data analysis of the
Euclid galaxy survey and promise to improve its constraining power, especially on $h$, $\Omega_b$,
the neutrino mass, and the DE evolution.

We present the capabilities of Galapagos--2 and Galfitm in the context of fitting 2-component profiles
to galaxies, on the way to providing complete multi-band, multi-component fitting of large samples
of galaxies in future surveys. We release both the code and the fit results to 234,239 objects from
the DR3 of the Gama survey, a sample significantly deeper than previous works. We use stringent tests
on both simulated and real data, as well as comparison to public catalogues to evaluate the advantages
of using multi-band over single-band data. We show that multi-band fitting using Galfitm provides
significant advantages when trying to decompose galaxies into their individual constituents,
as more data are being used, by effectively being able to use the colour information buried in the
individual exposures to its advantage. Using simulated data, we find that multi-band fitting significantly
reduces the deviations from real parameter values, allows component sizes and S\'ersic indices
to be recovered more accurately, and, by design, constrains the band-to-band variations of these
parameters to more physical values. On both simulated and real data, we confirm that the SEDs of the
2 main components can be recovered to fainter magnitudes compared to using single-band fitting,
which tends to recover disks and bulges to - on average - have identical SEDs when the galaxies become
too faint, instead of the different SEDs they truly have. By comparing our results to those provided
by other fitting codes, we confirm that they agree in general, but measurement errors can be significantly
reduced by using the multi-band tools developed by the MegaMorph project. We conclude that the multi-band
fitting employed by Galapagos-2 and Galfitm significantly improves the accuracy of structural
galaxy parameters and enables much larger samples to be be used in a scientific analysis.

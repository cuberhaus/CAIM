Extragalactic Fast X-ray Transients (FXRTs) are short flashes of X-ray photons spanning a few seconds
to hours, with an uncertain origin. Our ignorance about their physical mechanisms and progenitor
systems is due in part to the lack of clear multi-wavelength counterparts in most cases because they
only have been identified serendipitously. We develop a systematic search of FXRTs using a straightforward
X-ray flare search algorithm, in the Chandra Source Catalog (Data Release 2.0; 169.6 Ms over 592.4
deg$^{2}$ using only observations with $|b|>10^{\circ}$ and before 2015), incorporating various
multi-wavelength constraints to rule out Galactic contamination and characterize the candidates.
We report the detection of 14 FXRT candidates from a parent sample of 214,701 sources. Candidates
have peak 0.5-7 keV fluxes between 1$\times$10$^{-13}$ to 2$\times$10$^{-10}$ erg cm$^{-2}$
s$^{-1}$ and $T_{90}$ values from 4 to 48 ks. The sample can be subdivided into two groups: six "nearby"
FXRTs that occurred within $d\lesssim$100 Mpc and eight "distant" FXRTs with likely redshifts
$\gtrsim$0.1. Three distant FXRT candidates exhibit light curves with a plateau (${\approx}$1-3
ks duration) followed by a power-law decay and X-ray spectral softening, similar to what was observed
for the previously reported FXRT CDF-S~XT2, a proposed magnetar-powered binary neutron star merger
event. After applying completeness corrections, we calculate event rates for the nearby and distant
samples of 53.7$_{-15.1}^{+22.6}$ and 28.2$_{-6.9}^{+9.8}$ deg$^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$, respectively.
This novel sample of Chandra-detected extragalactic FXRT candidates, although modest in size,
breaks new ground in terms of characterizing the diverse properties, nature, and possible progenitors
of these enigmatic events.

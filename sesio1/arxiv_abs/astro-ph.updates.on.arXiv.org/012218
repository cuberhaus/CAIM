It is widely believed that string theory easily allows for a QCD axion in the cosmologically favoured
mass range. The required small decay constant, $f_a\ll M_P$, can be implemented by using a large
compactification volume. This points to the Large Volume Scenario (LVS), which in turn makes certain
cosmological predictions: First, the axion behaves similarly to a field-theoretic axion in the
pre-inflationary scenario, i.e. the initial value can be tuned but one is constrained by isocurvature
fluctuations. In addition, the volume naively represents a long-lived modulus, that may lead to
an early matter-dominated phase. Finally, the volume modulus' decay to its own axion tends to produce
excessive dark radiation. In this paper we aim to carefully analyze the cosmology by studying models
that not only allow for a QCD axion but also include inflation. Quite generally, limits on isocurvature
fluctuations restrict us to relatively low-scale inflation, which in the present stringy context
points to Kahler or blowup inflation models. Moreover, we find as a novel and at first sight encouraging
feature that the lightest (volume) modulus is likely to couple strongly to the Higgs. It hence quickly
decays to the Standard Model, thus seemingly resolving the dark radiation problem. This decay is
much faster than that of the inflaton such that the latter comes to dominate the Universe. Since the
inflaton distributes its energy equally between the QCD axion and the Standard Model, this turns
out to be a curse rather than a blessing: Generically, the dark radiation abundance remains too high.
We briefly discuss possibilities to circumvent this issue. In particular, the rapid decay of the
volume modulus into Higgses demotes dark radiation from a generic LVS problem to an issue resolvable
by inflationary model building.

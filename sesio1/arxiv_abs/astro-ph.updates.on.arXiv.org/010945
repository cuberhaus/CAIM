Stephan's Quintet (SQ) is a nearby compact galaxy group and a perfect laboratory for studying the
process of galaxy evolution through galaxy harassment and interaction. By analysing the kinematics
of SQ we aim to provide an increased understanding of the group, the history of the interactions,
their cause and effect, and the details regarding the physical processes occurring as galaxies
interact. We have studied the ionised gas and stellar kinematics using the Large Binocular Telescope,
and the molecular gas kinematics via CO using the IRAM 30m. Large areas of the group have been mapped
and analysed. We obtain a total ionised gas mass in the regions chosen for closer analysis of 20.1$\pm$0.2x10^10
Msun and a total H2 gas mass of 21$\pm$2x10^9 Msun in the observed area (spectra integrated over the
velocity range of SQ), while the star-forming (SF) clouds show an impressive complexity, with gas
congregations at multiple velocities throughout the group. We map the large-scale nuclear wind
in NGC7319 and its decoupled gas and stellar disk. With our high resolution data we can, for the first
time, reveal the Seyfert 1 nature of NGC7319 and fit the narrow-line and broad-line regions. While
the 12CO(1-0) map shows significant emission in the area of NGC7319, the bridge, and the SF ridge,
the 12CO(2-1) emission shows a prevalence to the SF ridge, an area south of the NGC7318 pair, and an
extension towards NGC7317 - connecting NGC7317 to the centre of the group, indicating a previous
interaction. NGC7317 may also be a prime candidate for studies of the process of galaxy harassment.
Furthermore, we connect the kinematical structures in SQ to the history of the group and the ongoing
interaction with NGC7318B. Through our extensive observations of SQ we trace the kinematics and
evolution of the complex processes and structures occurring in this nearby interactive group.

Neutrinos in compact-object environments, such as core-collapse supernovae, can experience
various kinds of collective effects in flavor space, engendered by neutrino-neutrino interactions.
These include "bipolar" collective oscillations, which are exhibited by neutrino ensembles where
different flavors dominate at different energies. Considering the importance of neutrinos in
the dynamics and nucleosynthesis in these environments, it is desirable to ascertain whether an
Earth-based detection could contain signatures of bipolar oscillations that occurred within
a supernova envelope. To that end, we continue examining a cost-function formulation of statistical
data assimilation (SDA) to infer solutions to a small-scale model of neutrino flavor transformation.
SDA is an inference paradigm designed to optimize a model with sparse data. Our model consists of
two mono-energetic neutrino beams with different energies emanating from a source and coherently
interacting with each other and with a matter background, with time-varying interaction strengths.
We attempt to infer flavor transformation histories of these beams using simulated measurements
of the flavor content at locations in vacuum (that is, far from the source), which could in principle
correspond to earth-based detectors. Within the scope of this small-scale model, we found that:
(i) based on such measurements, the SDA procedure is able to infer \textit{whether} bipolar oscillations
had occurred within the protoneutron star envelope, and (ii) if the measurements are able to sample
the full amplitude of the neutrino oscillations in vacuum, then the amplitude of the prior bipolar
oscillations is also well predicted. This result intimates that the inference paradigm can well
complement numerical integration codes, via its ability to infer flavor evolution at physically
inaccessible locations.

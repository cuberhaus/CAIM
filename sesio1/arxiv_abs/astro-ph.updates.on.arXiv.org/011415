Understanding how the Galactic magnetic field threads the multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM)
remains a considerable challenge, as different magnetic field tracers probe dissimilar phases
and field components. We search for evidence of a common magnetic field shared between the ionized
and neutral ISM by comparing 1.4 GHz radio continuum polarization and HI line emission from the Galactic
Arecibo L-Band Feed Array Continuum Transit Survey (GALFACTS) and Galactic Arecibo L-Band Feed
Array HI (GALFA-HI) survey, respectively. We compute the polarization gradient of the continuum
emission and search for associations with diffuse/translucent HI structures. The polarization
gradient is sensitive to changes in the integrated product of the thermal electron density and line-of-sight
field strength ($B_\parallel$) in warm ionized gas, while narrow HI structures highlight the plane-of-sky
field orientation in cold neutral gas. We identified one region in the high-Galactic latitude Arecibo
sky, G216+26 centered on $(\ell,b)\sim(216\deg,+26\deg)$, containing filaments in the polarization
gradient that are aligned with narrow HI structures roughly parallel to the Galactic plane. We present
a comparison of multi-phase observations and magnetic field tracers of this region, demonstrating
that the warm ionized and cold neutral media are connected likely via a common magnetic field. We
quantify the physical properties of a polarization gradient filament associated with H$\alpha$
emission, measuring a line-of-sight field strength $B_\parallel=6{\pm}4 \mu$G and a plasma beta
$\beta=2.1^{+3.1}_{-2.1}$. We discuss the lack of widespread multi-phase magnetic field alignments
and consider whether this region is associated with a short-timescale or physically rare phenomenon.
This work highlights the utility of multi-tracer analyses for understanding the magnetized ISM.

Neutrinos from supernova (SN) bursts can give rise to detectable number of nuclear recoil (NR) events
through the neutral current (NC) process of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS)
in future large (multi-ton scale) liquid xenon (LXe) detectors employed for dark matter search,
depending on the SN progenitor mass and distance to the SN event. Here we show that the same detectors
will also be sensitive to inelastic charged current (CC) interactions of the SN electron neutrinos
with the xenon nuclei. Such interactions, while creating an electron in the final state, also leave
the post-interaction target nucleus in an excited state, the subsequent de-excitation of which
produces, among other particles, gamma rays and neutrons. The electron and de-excitation gamma
rays would give rise to "electron recoil" (ER) events, while the de-excitation neutrons -- the so
called "neutrino induced neutrons" -- would give rise, through their multiple scattering on the
xenon nuclei, to additional xenon nuclear recoils that dominate over the CE$\nu$NS origin NRs at
relatively large ($>\sim$ 30 keV) recoil energies. We discuss the observable scintillation and
ionization signals associated with these ER and NR events in a generic LXe detector and argue that
future sufficiently large LXe detectors should be able to detect these events from reasonably close
by SN bursts. We also note that since CC induced ER and NR signals receive contributions predominantly
from $\nu_e$s while the CE$\nu$NS contribution comes from NC interactions of all the six species
of neutrinos, identification of the CC origin ER and NR events on the one hand and the CE$\nu$NS origin
NR events on the other may offer the possibility of extracting useful information about the distribution
of the total SN explosion energy going into different neutrino flavors.

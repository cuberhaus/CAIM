Aims. We investigate the role of the accumulation of both magnetic helicity and magnetic energy
in the generation of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from emerging solar active regions (ARs). Methods.
Using vector magnetic field data obtained by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar
Dynamics Observatory, we calculate the magnetic helicity and magnetic energy injection rates
as well as the resulting accumulated budgets in 52 emerging ARs from the start time of magnetic flux
emergence until they reach heliographic longitude of 45\degr\ West (W45). Results. Seven of the
ARs produced CMEs while 45 did not. In a statistical sense, the eruptive ARs accumulate larger budgets
of both magnetic helicity and energy than the noneruptive ones over intervals that start from flux
emergence start time and end (i) at the end of flux emergence phase, and (ii) when the AR produces its
first CME or crosses W45, whichever happens first. We found magnetic helicity and energy thresholds
of $9 \times 10^{41}$ Mx$^2$ and $2 \times 10^{32}$ erg, respectively, which, if crossed, ARs are
likely to erupt. The segregation, in terms of accumulated magnetic helicity and energy budgets,
of the eruptive ARs from the noneruptive ones is violated in one case when an AR erupts early in its
emergence phase and in six cases with noneruptive ARs exhibiting large magnetic helicity and energy
budgets. Decay index calculations may indicate that these ARs did not erupt because the overlying
magnetic field provided stronger or more extended confinement than in eruptive ARs. Conclusions.
Our results indicate that emerging ARs tend to produce CMEs when they accumulate significant budgets
of both magnetic helicity and energy. Any study of their eruptive potential should place magnetic
helicity on equal footing with magnetic energy.

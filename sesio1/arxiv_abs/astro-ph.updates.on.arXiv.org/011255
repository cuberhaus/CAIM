Class I protostars are a bridge between Class 0 protostars, and Class II protoplanetary disks. Recent
studies show gaps and rings in the dust distribution of disks younger than 1 Myr, suggesting that
planet formation may start already at the Class I stage. To understand what chemistry planets will
inherit, it is crucial to characterize the chemistry of Class I sources and to investigate how chemical
complexity evolves from Class 0 protostars to protoplanetary disks. The goal is twofold: to obtain
a census of the molecular complexity in a sample of four Class I protostars, and to compare it with
the chemical compositions of earlier and later phases of the Sun-like star formation process. We
performed IRAM-30m observations towards Class I objects (L1489-IRS, B5-IRS1, L1455-IRS1, and
L1551-IRS5). The column densities of the detected species are derived assuming LTE or LVG. We detected
27 species: C-chains, N-bearing, S-bearing, Si-bearing species, deuterated molecules, and iCOMs.
Different spectral profiles are observed: narrow lines towards all the sources, broader lines
towards L1551-IRS5, and line wings due to outflows. Narrow c-C3H2 emission originates from the
envelope. The iCOMs in L1551-IRS5 reveal the occurrence of hot corino chemistry, with CH3OH and
CH3CN lines originating from a compact and warm region. Finally, OCS and H2S seem to probe the circumbinary
disks in the L1455-IRS1 and L1551-IRS5 binary systems. The deuteration in terms of elemental D/H
in the molecular envelopes and hot corino are derived. In addition, B5 IRS1, L1455-IRS1 and L1551-IRS5
show a low excitation methanol line, suggesting an origin from an extended structure, plausibly
UV illuminated. The abundance ratios of iCOMs with respect CH3OH measured towards the L1551-IRS5
hot corino and the deuteration in our sample are comparable to that estimated at earlier stages,
as well as to that found in comets.

We want to understand global observable consequences of different physical processes and initial
properties on the demographics of the planetary population. We use the Generation III Bern model
to perform planetary population synthesis. We synthesise five populations with each a different
initial number of Moon-mass embryos per disc: 1, 10, 20, 50, and 100. The last is our nominal population
around 1 Sun-mass stars. The properties of giant planets do not change much as long as there are at
least 10 embryos in each system. The study of giants can thus be done with simulations requiring less
computational resources. For inner terrestrial planets, only the 100-embryos population is able
to attain the giant-impact stage. In that population, each planetary system contains on average
8 planets more massive than 1 $M_\oplus$. The fraction of systems with giants planets at all orbital
distances is 18%, but only 1.6% are at > 10 au. Systems with giants contain on average 1.6 such planets.
The frequency of terrestrial and super-Earth planets peaks at a stellar [Fe/H] of -0.2 and 0.0, respectively,
being limited at lower [Fe/H] by a lack of building blocks, and by (for them) detrimental growth of
more massive dynamically active planets at higher [Fe/H]. The frequency of more massive planets
(Neptunian, giants) increases monotonically with [Fe/H]. The fast migration of planets in the
5-50 $M_\oplus$ range is reduced by the presence of multiple lower-mass inner planets in the multi-embryos
populations. We present one of the most comprehensive simulations of (exo)planetary system formation
and evolution to date. For theory, they provide the framework to observationally test the global
statistical consequences of theoretical models for specific physical processes. This is a important
ingredient towards the development of a standard model of planetary formation and evolution.

Great strides have been made in recent years in the understanding of the mechanisms involved in the
formation and evolution of planetary systems; despite this, many observational facts still do
not have an explanation. A great contribution to the study of planetary formation processes comes
from the study of young, low-mass planets, with short orbital periods. In the last years, the TESS
satellite has identified many planets of this kind, and their characterization is mandatory to
understand how they formed and evolved. Within the framework of the GAPS project, we performed the
validation and characterization of the ultra-short period planet (USPP) TOI-1807b, orbiting
its young host star BD+39 2643 (~300 Myr) in only 13 hours. This is the youngest USPP discovered so
far. Thanks to a joint modeling of the stellar activity and planetary signals in the TESS light curve
and in HARPS-N radial-velocity measurements, combined with accurate estimation of stellar parameters,
we validated the planetary nature of TOI-1807b and measured its orbital and physical parameters.
By using astrometric, photometric, and spectroscopic observations we found that BD+39 2643 is
a young, active K dwarf star, member of a 300+/-80 Myr old moving group and that it rotates in Prot=8.8+/-0.1
days. This star hosts an USPP with an orbital period of only P_b=0.54937+/-0.00001 d. Thanks to the
exquisite photometric and spectroscopic series, and the accurate information on the stellar activity,
we measured both the radius and the mass of TOI-1807b with high precision, obtaining R_b=1.37+/-0.09
R_Earth and M_b=2.57+/-0.50 M_Earth. These planet parameters correspond to a rocky planet with
an Earth-like density and no extended H/He envelope. From the analysis of the age-R_P distribution
for planets with well measured ages, we inferred that TOI-1807b may have already lost a large part
of its atmosphere during its 300 Myr life.

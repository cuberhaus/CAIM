Double-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB2) allow us to determine a lower limit of the masses of their
components directly to test stellar models. In this work, our aim is to derive the orbital and physical
parameters of GJ1284, a young SB2. We also revise the membership of this system and its two wide co-moving
companions, GJ898 and GJ897AB, to a young moving group to assess, along with other youth indicators,
their age. Afterwards, we compare the results from these analyses and the photometry of these systems
with several pre-main-sequence evolutionary models. We determine the orbit of the GJ1284 system
alongside its systemic velocity from high resolution spectra. Additionally, we use TESS photometry
to derive the rotational period of the GJ1284 and its two wide companions. GJ1284 is a binary system
located at approximately 16 pc with an eccentric orbit ($ e = 0.505 $) of 11.83 d period made up of an
M2-M2.5 + M3-M3.5. The revised systemic velocity of $ \gamma = 0.84 \pm 0.14\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}
$ suggests that it is a member of the Local Association. The kinematics together with other activity
and youth indicators imply an age of 110-800 Myr for this system and its two companions. The isochronal
ages derived from the comparison of the photometry with several evolutionary models are younger
than the age estimated from the activity indicators for the three co-moving systems. The masses
for the components of GJ1284, derived from their luminosity and age using the different models,
are not consistent with the masses derived from the photometry, except for the PARSEC models, but
are compatible with dynamical masses of double-lined eclipsing binaries with similar ages and
spectral types. The effect of magnetic activity in the form of spots can reconcile to some extent
the photometric and dynamical masses, but is not considered in most of the evolutionary models.

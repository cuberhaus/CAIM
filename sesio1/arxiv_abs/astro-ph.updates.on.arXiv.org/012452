The Gauss-Bonnet curvature invariant has attracted the attention of physicists and mathematicians
over the years. In particular, it has recently been proved that black holes can support external
matter configurations that are non-minimally coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet invariant of the curved
spacetime. Motivated by this physically interesting behavior of black holes in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet
theories, we present a detailed {\it analytical} study of the physical and mathematical properties
of the Gauss-Bonnet curvature invariant ${\cal G}_{\text{Kerr}}(r,\cos\theta;a/M)$ of spinning
Kerr black holes in the spacetime region outside the horizon. Interestingly, we prove that, for
all spinning Kerr spacetimes in the physically allowed regime $a/M\in[0,1]$, the spin-dependent
maximum curvature of the Gauss-Bonnet invariant is attained at the equator of the black-hole surface.
Intriguingly, we reveal that the location of the global minimum of the Gauss-Bonnet invariant has
a highly non-trivial functional dependence on the black-hole rotation parameter: (i) For Kerr
black holes in the dimensionless slow-rotation $a/M<(a/M)^{-}_{\text{crit}}=1/2$ regime,
the Gauss-Bonnet curvature invariant attains its global minimum asymptotically at spatial infinity,
(ii) for black holes in the intermediate spin regime $1/2=(a/M)^{-}_{\text{crit}}\leq a/M\leq(a/M)^{+}_{\text{crit}}=
\sqrt{\Big\{{{7+\sqrt{7}\cos\Big[3^{-1}\arctan\big(3\sqrt{3}\big)\Big]- \sqrt{21}\sin\Big[3^{-1}\arctan\big(3\sqrt{3}\big)\Big]\Big\}}/12}}$,
the global minima are located at the black-hole poles, and (iii) Kerr black holes in the super-critical
regime $a/M>(a/M)^{+}_{\text{crit}}$ are characterized by a non-trivial functional behavior
of the Gauss-Bonnet curvature invariant along the black-hole horizon with a spin-dependent polar
angle for the global minimum point.

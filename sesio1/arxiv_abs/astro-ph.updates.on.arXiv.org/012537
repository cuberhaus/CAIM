Some HII regions that surround young stellar clusters are bordered by molecular shells that appear
to expand at a rate inconsistent with our current model simulations. In this study we focus on the
dynamics of Sharpless 171 (including NGC 7822), which surrounds the cluster Berkeley 59. We aim
to compare the velocity pattern over the molecular shell with the mean radial velocity of the cluster
for estimates of the expansion velocities of different shell structures, and to match the observed
properties with model simulations. Optical spectra of 27 stars located in Berkeley 59 were collected
at the Nordic Optical Telescope, and a number of molecular structures scattered over the entire
region were mapped in $^{13}$CO(1-0) at Onsala Space Observatory. We obtained radial velocities
and MK classes for the cluster's stars. At least four of the O stars are found to be spectroscopic binaries,
in addition to one triplet system. From these data we obtain the mean radial velocity of the cluster.
From the $^{13}$CO spectra we identify three shell structures, expanding relative to the cluster
at moderate velocity (4 km/s), high velocity (12 km/s), and in between. The high-velocity cloudlets
extend over a larger radius and are less massive than the low-velocity cloudlets. We performed a
model simulation to understand the evolution of this complex. Our simulation of the Sharpless 171
complex and Berkeley 59 cluster demonstrates that the individual components can be explained as
a shell driven by stellar winds from the massive cluster members. However, our relatively simple
model produces a single component. Modelling of the propagation of shell fragments through a uniform
interstellar medium demonstrates that dense cloudlets detached from the shell are decelerated
less efficiently than the shell itself. They can reach greater distances and retain higher velocities
than the shell.

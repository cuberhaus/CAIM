We present the first data release of the Survey on extragALactic magnetiSm with SOFIA (SALSA Legacy
Program) with a set of 14 nearby ($<20$ Mpc) galaxies with resolved imaging polarimetric observations
using HAWC+ from $53$ to $214$ $\mu$m at a resolution of $5-18$" ($90$ pc $-$ $1$ kpc). We introduce
the definitions and background on extragalactic magnetism, and present the scientific motivation
and sample selection of the program. Here, we focus on the general trends in the emissive polarization
fraction. Far-infrared polarimetric observations trace the thermal polarized emission of magnetically
aligned dust grains across the galaxy disks with polarization fractions of $P=0-15$% in the cold,
$T_{\rm d} = [19,48]$ K, and dense, $\log_{10}(N_{\rm HI+H_{2}}) = [19.96,22.91]$, interstellar
medium. The spiral galaxies show a median $\langle P_{154\mu m} \rangle = 3.3\pm0.9 $% across the
disks. We report the first polarized spectrum of starburst galaxies showing a minimum within $89-154$
$\mu$m. The falling $53-154$ $\mu$m polarized spectrum may be due to a decrease in the dust grain
alignment efficiency produced by variations in dust temperatures along the line-of-sight in the
galactic outflow. We find that the starburst galaxies and the star-forming regions within normal
galaxies have the lowest polarization fractions. We find that 50% (7 out of 14) of the galaxies require
a broken power-law in the $P-N_{HI+H_{2}}$ and $P-T_{d}$ relations with three different trends.
Group 1 has a relative increase of anisotropic random B-fields produced by compression or shear
of B-fields in the galactic outflows, starburst rings, and inner-bar of galaxies; and Groups 2 and
3 have a relative increase of isotropic random B-fields driven by star-forming regions in the spiral
arms, and/or an increase of dust grain alignment efficiency caused by shock-driven regions or evolutionary
stages of a galaxy.

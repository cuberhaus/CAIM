The latest evolutionary phases of low- and intermediate mass stars are characterized by complex
physical processes like turbulence, convection, stellar pulsations, magnetic fields, condensation
of solid particles, and the formation of massive outflows that inject freshly produced heavy elements
and dust particles into the interstellar medium. We use the Northern Extended Millimeter Array
(NOEMA) to obtain spatially and spectrally resolved observations of the semi-regular Asymptotic
Giant Branch star RS Cancri to shed light on the morpho-kinematic structure of its inner, wind forming
environment by applying detailed 3-D reconstruction modeling and LTE radiative transfer calculations.
We detect 32 lines of 13 molecules and isotopologs (CO, SiO, SO, SO$_2$, H$_2$O, HCN, PN), including
several transitions from vibrationally excited states. HCN, H$^{13}$CN, millimeter vibrationally
excited H$_2$O, SO, $^{34}$SO, SO$_2$, and PN are detected for the first time in RS Cnc. Evidence
for rotation is seen in HCN, SO, SO$_2$, and SiO(v=1). From CO and SiO channel maps, we find an inner,
equatorial density enhancement, and a bipolar outflow structure with a mass loss rate of $1 \times
10^{-7}M_\odot{\rm yr}^{-1}$ for the equatorial region and of $2 \times 10^{-7}M_\odot{\rm yr}^{-1}$
for the polar outflows. The $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO ratio is measured to be $\sim20$ on average, $24\pm2$
in the polar outflows and $19\pm3$ in the equatorial region. We do not find direct evidence of a companion
that might explain this kind of kinematic structure, and explore the possibility that a magnetic
field might be the cause of it. The innermost molecular gas is influenced by stellar pulsation and
possibly by convective cells that leave their imprint on broad wings of certain molecular lines,
such as SiO and SO.

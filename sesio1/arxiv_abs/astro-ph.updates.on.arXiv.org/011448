Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves are routinely observed in the solar atmosphere. These waves are
important in the context of solar physics as it is widely believed they can contribute to the energy
budget of the solar atmosphere and are a prime candidate to contribute towards coronal heating.
Realistic models of these waves are required representing observed configurations such that plasma
properties can be determined more accurately which can not be measured directly. This work utilises
a previously developed numerical technique to find permittable eigenvalues under different non-uniform
equilibrium conditions in a Cartesian magnetic slab geometry. Here we investigate the properties
of magnetoacoustic waves under non-uniform equilibria in a cylindrical geometry. Previously
obtained analytical results are retrieved to emphasise the power and applicability of this numerical
technique. Further case studies investigate the effect that a radially non-uniform plasma density
and non-uniform plasma flow, modelled as a series of Gaussian profiles, has on the properties of
different MHD waves. For all cases the dispersion diagrams are obtained and spatial eigenfunctions
calculated which display the effects of the equilibrium inhomogeneity. It is shown that as the equilibrium
non-uniformity is increased, the radial spatial eigenfunctions are affected and extra nodes introduced,
similar to the previous investigation of a magnetic slab. Furthermore, azimuthal perturbations
are increased with increasing inhomogeneity introducing vortical motions inside the waveguide.
Finally, 2D and 3D representations of the velocity fields are shown which may be useful for observers
for wave mode identification under realistic magnetic waveguides with ever increasing instrument
resolution.

Radio relics are Mpc-size synchrotron sources located in the outskirts of some merging galaxy clusters.
Binary-merging systems with favorable orientation may host two almost symmetric relics, named
double radio relics. Double radio relics are seen preferentially edge-on and, thus, constitute
a privileged sample for statistical studies. Their polarization and Faraday rotation properties
give direct access to the relics origin and magnetic fields. In this paper, we present a polarization
and Rotation Measure (RM) synthesis study of four clusters hosting double radio relics, namely
8C 0212+703, Abell 3365, PLCK G287.0+32.9, previously missing polarization studies, and ZwCl
2341+0000, for which conflicting results have been reported. We used 1-2 GHz Karl G. Jansky Very
Large Array observations. We also provide an updated compilation of known double radio relics with
important observed quantities. We studied their polarization and Faraday rotation properties
at 1.4 GHz and we searched for correlations between fractional polarization and physical resolution,
distance from the cluster center, and shock Mach number. The weak correlations found between these
quantities are well reproduced by state-of-the-art magneto-hydrodynamical simulations of radio
relics, confirming that merger shock waves propagate in a turbulent medium with tangled magnetic
fields. Both external and internal Faraday depolarization should play a fundamental role in determining
the polarization properties of radio relics at 1.4 GHz. Although the number of double radio relics
with RM information is still low, their Faraday rotation properties (i.e., rest-frame RM and RM
dispersion below 40 rad m$^{-2}$ and non-Gaussian RM distribution) can be explained in the scenario
in which shock waves with Mach numbers larger than 2.5 propagate along the plane of the sky and compress
the turbulent intra-cluster medium.

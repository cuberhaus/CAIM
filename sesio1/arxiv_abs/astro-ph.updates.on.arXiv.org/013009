The arrival of the Keck Planet Finder (KPF) in 2022 represents a major advance in the precision radial
velocity (PRV) capabilities of the W. M. Keck Observatory. In preparation for KPF science, our committee
of PRV experts and WMKO staff studied the current implementation of cadence observing at Keck and
other PRV facilities. We find that many of KPF's major science cases are not feasible through Keck's
standard allocations of full or half nights to individual PIs. Pooling time among several PIs as
is currently done by the California Planet Search (CPS) collaboration with HIRES results in lower
quality science results than is possible when KPF is available at higher observational cadence.
This strategy also creates barriers to entry, particularly for researchers wishing to lead small
proposals. This report makes recommendations for optimizing PRV cadence at Keck subject to the
following constraints: preservation of clear boundaries between cadence observations and classically
scheduled time; and ensuring fairness and scientific independence of different Keck TACs and different
KPF PIs. We recommend establishing a new category of Keck time allocation, "KPF Community Cadence"
(KPF-CC). In many ways, KPF-CC will formalize observing strategies provided by CPS, but with higher
observational cadence appropriate for KPF science and with universal access to the program for
all Keck users. We recommend that KPF-CC time be scheduled classically into blocks as small as a quarter
night subject to considerations of bright/dark time, variations in proposal pressure with the
seasons, and the needs of non-KPF observing programs. Within KPF-CC time, the Keck Observing Assistants
would execute observations generated by a dynamic scheduler. We recommend that Keck staff and a
board of PRV experts design and maintain the scheduling software.

We present observations of CO(3-2) in 13 main-sequence $z=2.0-2.5$ star-forming galaxies at $\log(M_*/M_{\odot})=10.2-10.6$
that span a wide range in metallicity (O/H) based on rest-optical spectroscopy. We find that CO(3-2)/SFR
decreases with decreasing metallicity, implying that the CO luminosity per unit gas mass is lower
in low-metallicity galaxies at $z\sim2$. We constrain the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor ($\alpha_{\text{CO}}$)
and find that $\alpha_{\text{CO}}$ inversely correlates with metallicity at $z\sim2$. We derive
molecular gas masses ($M_{\text{mol}}$) and characterize the relations among $M_*$, SFR, $M_{\text{mol}}$,
and metallicity. At $z\sim2$, $M_{\text{mol}}$ increases and molecular gas fraction ($M_{\text{mol}}$/$M_*$)
decrease with increasing $M_*$, with a significant secondary dependence on SFR. Galaxies at $z\sim2$
lie on a near-linear molecular KS law that is well-described by a constant depletion time of 700 Myr.
We find that the scatter about the mean SFR-$M_*$, O/H-$M_*$, and $M_{\text{mol}}$-$M_*$ relations
is correlated such that, at fixed $M_*$, $z\sim2$ galaxies with larger $M_{\text{mol}}$ have higher
SFR and lower O/H. We thus confirm the existence of a fundamental metallicity relation at $z\sim2$
where O/H is inversely correlated with both SFR and $M_{\text{mol}}$ at fixed $M_*$. These results
suggest that the scatter of the $z\sim2$ star-forming main sequence, mass-metallicity relation,
and $M_{\text{mol}}$-$M_*$ relation are primarily driven by stochastic variations in gas inflow
rates. We place constraints on the mass loading of galactic outflows and perform a metal budget analysis,
finding that massive $z\sim2$ star-forming galaxies retain only 30% of metals produced, implying
that a large mass of metals resides in the circumgalactic medium.

The detection of the first exoplanet paved the way into the era of transit photometry space missions
with a revolutionary photometric precision that aim at discovering new exoplanetary systems around
different types of stars. With this high precision, it is possible to derive very accurately the
radii of exoplanets which is crucial for constraining their type and composition. However, it requires
an accurate description of host stars, especially their center-to-limb variation of intensities
(so called limb darkening) as it affects the planet-to-star radius ratio determination. We aim
at improving the accuracy of limb darkening calculations for stars with a wide range of fundamental
parameters. We used the recently developed 1D MPS-ATLAS code to compute model atmosphere structures
and to synthesize stellar limb darkening on a very fine grid of stellar parameters. For the computations
we utilized the most accurate information on chemical element abundances and mixing length parameters
including convective overshoot. The stellar limb darkening was fitted using the two most accurate
limb darkening laws: the power-2 and 4-parameters non-linear laws. We present a new extensive library
of stellar model atmospheric structures, the synthesized stellar limb darkening curves, and the
coefficients of parameterized limb-darkening laws on a very fine grid of stellar parameters in
the Kepler, TESS, CHEOPS, and PLATO passbands. The fine grid allows overcoming the sizable errors
introduced by the need to interpolate. Our computations of solar limb darkening are in a good agreement
with available solar measurements at different view angles and wavelengths. Our computations
of stellar limb darkening agree well with available measurements of Kepler stars. A new grid of stellar
model structures, limb darkening and their fitted coefficients in different broad filters is provided
in CDS.

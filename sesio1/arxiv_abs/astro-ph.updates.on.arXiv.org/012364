Accurate estimations of cosmological density parameters ($\Omega_{0m}h_{0}^{2}$, $\Omega_{0k}h_{0}^{2}$,
$\Omega_{0\Lambda}h_{0}^{2}$) and Hubble constant ($h_{0}$) provide detailed understanding
of our universe. We propose a new procedure to estimate these parameters for non-flat $\Lambda$CDM
universe in the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) background. We utilize the Hubble parameter
($H(z)$) measurements in our analysis. These $H(z)$ are measured using two techniques (DA and BAO).
We generalize the two-point diagnostic method first proposed by Sahni et al.(2008) to the case of
non-flat spatial curvature of the universe. Using three independent $H(z)$ measurements at a time,
we solve for three fundamental cosmological density parameters ($\Omega_{0m}h_{0}^{2}$, $\Omega_{0k}h_{0}^{2}$,
$\Omega_{0\Lambda}h_{0}^{2}$) and repeat the procedure for all possible combinations of three
measurements of Hubble parameters. We divide the $H(z)$ data into three groups comprising all,
$31$ DA only and $24$ BAO only measurements. We perform our analysis separately on each group. In
our method, we use weighted-mean and median statistics to estimate the values of density parameters.
Using these estimated values of density parameters, we also find the values of $h_{0}$ for each of
these three sets corresponding to each of two statistics. We conclude that median statistic is more
reliable in our analysis, since the sample specific uncertainties are non-Gaussian in nature.
Finally, we achieve the reliable results $\Omega_{0m}h_{0}^{2}=0.1485^{+0.0041}_{-0.0051}$,
$\Omega_{0k}h_{0}^{2}=-0.0137^{+0.0129}_{-0.0125}$, $\Omega_{0\Lambda}h_{0}^{2}=0.3126^{+0.0131}_{-0.009}$
and $h_{0}=0.6689^{+0.0141}_{-0.0121}$ using median statistic in our analysis corresponding
to the set of total $53$ $H(z)$. Our estimated median values of cosmological parameters agree with
Planck Collaboration VI.(2020) results excellently.

Massive stars lose a large fraction of their mass to radiation-driven winds throughout their entire
life. These outflows impact both the life and death of these stars and their surroundings. Theoretical
mass-loss rates of hot, massive stars are derived to be used in applications such as stellar evolution.
The behaviour of these rates in the OB-star regime is analysed, and their effects on massive-star
evolution predictions is studied. Dynamically-consistent models are computed by solving the
spherically symmetric, steady-state equation-of-motion for a large grid of hot, massive stars.
The radiative acceleration is derived from non-local thermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer
in the co-moving frame. The resulting mass-loss rates are used to derive a simple scaling recipe
with stellar parameters and to evaluate some first impacts upon evolution tracks. We provide a new
prescription for steady-state, radiation-driven mass-loss from hot, massive stars depending
on their fundamental parameters. The rates for O-stars are lower by about a factor ~3 than the rates
typically used in previous stellar-evolution calculations, where differences generally decrease
with increasing luminosity and temperature. For cooler B-giants/supergiants we find larger discrepancies.
This arises because we do not find any systematic increase in mass-loss rates below the so-called
bi-stability region; indeed, our results do not show any sign of a significant bi-stability jump
within the parameter range covered by the grid. Due to the lower mass-loss rates we find that envelopes
are not easily stripped by means of standard steady-state winds, making it difficult to create classical
Wolf-Rayet stars via this channel. However, a remaining key uncertainty regarding these predictions
concerns unsteady mass loss for very high-luminosity stars close to the Eddington limit as well
as the impact of non-line-driven winds.

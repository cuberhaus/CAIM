Very High Energy (VHE) gamma rays and charged cosmic rays (CCRs) provide an observational window
into the acceleration mechanisms of extreme astrophysical environments. One of the major challenges
at Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) designed to look for VHE gamma rays, is the separation
of air showers initiated by CCRs which form a background to gamma ray searches. Two other less well
studied problems at IACTs are a) the classification of different primary nuclei among the CCR events
and b) identification of anomalous events initiated by Beyond Standard Model particles that could
give rise to shower signatures which differ from the standard images of either gamma rays or CCR showers.
The problems of categorizing the primary particle that initiates a shower image, or the problem
of tagging anomalous shower events in a model independent way, are problems that are well suited
to a machine learning (ML) approach. Traditional studies that have explored gamma ray/CCR separation
have used a multivariate analysis based on derived shower properties, which contains significantly
reduced information about the shower. In our work, we address the problems outlined above by using
ML architectures trained on full simulated shower images, as opposed to training on just a few derived
shower properties. We illustrate the techniques of binary and multi-category classification
using convolutional neural networks, and we also pioneer the use of autoencoders for anomaly detection
at VHE gamma ray experiments. As a case study, we apply our techniques to the H.E.S.S. experiment.
However, the real strength of the techniques that we broach here in the context of VHE gamma ray observatories,
is that these methods can be applied broadly to any other IACT, such as the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope
Array (CTA), or can even be suitably adapted to CCR experiments.

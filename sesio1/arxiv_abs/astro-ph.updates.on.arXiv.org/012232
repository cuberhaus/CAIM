We study the prompt phase of low-luminosity Gamma-Ray Bursts (ll-GRBs) as potential source of very-high-energy
(VHE) gamma rays and Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs). Within the internal shock model we
choose parameters for the relativistic outflow such that our representative events have observed
properties similar to GRBs 980425, 100316D and 120714B and self-consistently calculate the full
spectral and temporal properties in a leptonic synchrotron self-Compton scenario. To investigate
the conditions under which inverse Compton radiation may lead to a peak in the GeV--TeV range, we
vary the fraction of internal energy supplying the magnetic field. Further, we determine the maximal
energies achievable for UHECR nuclei and derive constraints on the baryonic loading/typical duration
by comparing to the extragalactic gamma-ray background. We find that ll-GRBs are potential targets
for multiwavelength studies and in reach for Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs)
and optical/UV instruments. For comparable sub-MeV emission and similar dynamical evolution
of the outflow, weak (strong) magnetic fields induce high (low) fluxes in the VHE regime and low (high)
fluxes in the optical. VHE emission may be suppressed by $\gamma \gamma$-absorption close to the
engine or interactions with the extragalactic background light for redshifts $z > 0.1$. For UHECRs,
the maximal energies of iron nuclei (protons) can be as high as $\simeq 10^{11}$~GeV ($10^{10}$~GeV)
if the magnetic energy density is large (and the VHE component is correspondingly weak). These high
energies are possible by decoupling the production regions of UHECR and gamma-rays in our multizone
model. Finally, we find basic consistency with the energy budget needed to accommodate the UHECR
origin from ll-GRBs.

Hot subdwarf stars represent a late and peculiar stage in the evolution of low-mass stars, because
they are likely formed by close binary interactions. Here we performed a radial velocity (RV) variability
study of a sample of 646 hot subdwarfs with multi-epoch radial velocities from Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS) and Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fibre Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) spectra
[...] As diagnostics we used the fraction of RV-variable stars and the distribution of the maximum
RV variations $\Delta RV_{\rm max}$. Both indicators turned out to be quite inhomogeneous across
the studied parameter ranges. A striking feature is the completely different behaviour of He-poor
and He-rich hot subdwarfs. While the former have a high fraction of close binaries, almost no significant
RV variations could be detected for the latter. This led us to the conclusion that there likely is
no evolutionary connection between these subtypes. Intermediate He-rich- and extreme He-rich
sdOB/Os on the other hand are likely related. We conclude further that the vast majority of this population
is formed via one or several binary merger channels. Hot subdwarfs with temperatures cooler than
$\sim24\,000\,{\rm K}$ tend to show less and smaller RV-variations. These objects might constitute
a new subpopulation of binaries with longer periods and late-type or compact companions. The RV-variability
properties of the extreme horizontal branch (EHB) and corresponding post-EHB populations of the
He-poor hot subdwarfs match and confirm the predicted evolutionary connection between them. Stars
found below the canonical EHB at somewhat higher surface gravities show large RV-variations and
a high RV-variability fraction, which is consistent with most of them being low-mass EHB stars or
progenitors of low-mass helium white dwarfs in close binaries.

Compact obscured nuclei (CONs) are mainly found in local U/LIRGs. In the local Universe, these sources
are generally selected through the detection of the HCN-vib (3-2) emission line at submillimetre
wavelengths. In this work, we present a diagnostic method to select deeply buried nuclei based on
mid-infrared (mid-IR) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and continuum ratios. Using Spitzer/IRS
spectra of a representative sample of local ULIRGs (z<0.27), we examine their PAH and underlying
continuum emission ratios. For deeply embedded sources, we find that the 9.7 micron silicate absorption
band has a particularly pronounced effect on the 11.3 micron PAH feature. The low flux level in the
nuclear silicate absorption band enhances the 11.3 micron PAH feature contrast (high PAH equivalent
width) compared to that of the other PAH features. The technique has been extended to include the
use of the continuum ratios. However, the latter are affected both by the extinction coming from
the host galaxy as well as the nuclear region, whereas the foreground extinction is cancelled out
when using the PAH equivalent width ratios. We apply our method to the HERUS and GOALS samples and
classify as CON candidates 14 ULIRGs and 10 LIRGs, corresponding to 30% of ULIRGs and 7% of LIRGs from
these samples. We find that the observed continuum ratios of CON-dominated sources can be explained
by assuming torus models with a tapered disk geometry and a smooth dust distribution. This suggests
that the nuclear dusty structure of CONs has an extremely high dust coverage. We also demonstrate
that the use of mid-IR color-color diagrams is an effective way to select CON-dominated sources
at different redshifts. In particular, the combination of filters of the JWST/MIRI will enable
the selection of CONs out to z~1.5. This will allow extending the selection of CONs to high redshifts
where U/LIRGs are more numerous.

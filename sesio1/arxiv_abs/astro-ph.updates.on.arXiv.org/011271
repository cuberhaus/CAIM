Observations of molecular clouds, prestellar cores, and protoplanetary disks have established
that the HNC/HCN ratio may be a potent diagnostic of molecular gas physical conditions. The processes
that govern the relative abundances of these molecules nevertheless remain poorly understood.
We seek to exploit the wide range of UV irradiation strengths within the 1 pc diameter Helix planetary
nebula to explore the potential role of UV radiation in driving HNC/HCN. We performed IRAM 30 m and
APEX 12 m radio line observations across six positions within the Helix Nebula, making use of radiative
transfer and photodissociation modeling codes to interpret the results for line intensities and
line ratios in terms of the molecular gas properties. We have obtained the first detections of the
plasma-embedded Helix molecular knots (globules) in HCN, HNC, HCO+, and other trace molecules.
Analysis of the HNC/HCN integrated line intensity ratio reveals an increase with radial distance
from the Helix central star. In the context of molecular line ratios of other planetary nebulae from
the literature, the HNC/HCN ratio appears to be anticorrelated with UV emission over four orders
of magnitude in incident flux. Models of the photodissociation regions within the Helix using the
RADEX and Meudon codes reveal strong constraints on column density of the molecular gas, as well
as pressure and temperature. Analysis of the molecular ion HCO+ across the Helix indicates that
X-ray irradiation is likely driving HCO+ production in the outer regions of planetary nebulae,
where photodissociation is limited, yet cold gas and ionized molecules are abundant. Although
the observational results clearly indicate that UV irradiation is important in determining the
HNC/HCN ratio, our PDR modeling indicates that the UV flux gradient alone cannot reproduce the observed
variation of HNC/HCN across the Helix.

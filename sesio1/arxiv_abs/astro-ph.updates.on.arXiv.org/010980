(ABRIDGED) Recent near-IR surveys have uncovered a plethora of new globular cluster (GC) candidates
towards the Milky Way bulge. These new candidates need to be confirmed as real GCs and properly characterised.
We investigate the physical nature of FSR 1776. This object was originally classified as an intermediate-age
open cluster and has recently been re-discovered independently and classified as a GC candidate
(Minni 23). Firstly, we aim at confirming its GC nature; secondly we determine its physical parameters.
The confirmation of the cluster existence is checked using the radial velocity (RV) distribution
of a MUSE data cube centred at FSR 1776. The cluster parameters are derived from isochrone fitting
to the RV-cleaned colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) from visible and near-infrared photometry.
The predicted RV distribution for the FSR 1776 coordinates, considering only contributions from
the bulge and disc field stars, is not enough to explain the observed MUSE RV distribution. The extra
population (12\% of the sample) is FSR 1776 with an average RV of $-103.7\pm 0.4~{\rm km}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$.
The CMDs reveal that it is 10$\pm$1~Gyr old and metal-rich, with [Fe/H]$_{phot}\approx + 0.2\pm$0.2,
[Fe/H]$_{spec}=~+0.02\pm0.01~(\sigma~=~0.14$~dex), located at the bulge distance of 7.24$\pm$0.5~kpc
with A$_{\rm V}$ $\approx$ 1.1~mag. The mean cluster proper motions are ($\langle\mu_{\alpha}\rangle,\langle\mu_{\delta}\rangle$)
$=$ ($-2.3\pm1.1,-2.6\pm0.8$) ${\rm mas\, yr^{-1}}$.} FSR 1776 is an old GC located in the Galactic
bulge with a super-solar metallicity, among the highest for a Galactic GC. This is consistent with
predictions for the age-metallicity relation of the bulge, being FSR 1776 the probable missing
link between typical GCs and the metal-rich bulge field. High-resolution spectroscopy of a larger
field of view and deeper CMDs are now required for a full characterisation.

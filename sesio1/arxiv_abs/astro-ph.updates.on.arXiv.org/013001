Isotopologue abundance ratios are important to understand the evolution of astrophysical objects
and ultimately the origins of a planetary system like our own. Being nitrogen a fundamental ingredient
of pre-biotic material, understanding its chemistry and inheritance is of fundamental importance
to understand the formation of the building blocks of life. We present here single-dish observations
of the ground state rotational transitions of the $^{13}$C and $^{15}$N isotopologues of HCN, HNC
and CN with the IRAM 30m telescope. We analyse their column densities and compute the $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N
ratio map for HCN. The $^{15}$N-fractionation of CN and HNC is computed towards different offsets
across L1544. The $^{15}$N-fractionation map of HCN shows a clear decrease of the $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N
ratio towards the southern edge of L1544, where carbon chain molecules present a peak, strongly
suggesting that isotope-selective photodissociation has a strong effect on the fractionation
of nitrogen across pre-stellar cores. The $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratio in CN measured towards four
positions across the core also shows a decrease towards the South-East of the core, while HNC shows
opposite behaviour. The uneven illumination of the pre-stellar core L1544 provides clear evidence
that $^{15}$N-fractionation of HCN and CN is enhanced toward the region more exposed to the interstellar
radiation field. Isotope-selective photodissociation of N$_2$ is then a crucial process to understand
$^{15}$N fractionation, as already found in protoplanetary disks. Therefore, the $^{15}$N-fractionation
in pre-stellar material is expected to change depending on the environment within which pre-stellar
cores are embedded. The $^{12}$CN/$^{13}$CN ratio also varies across the core, but its variation
does not affect our conclusions on the effect of the environment on the fractionation of nitrogen.

Three-dimensional (3D) maps of Galactic interstellar dust are a tool for a wide range of uses. We
aim to construct 3D maps of dust extinction in the Local Arm and surrounding regions. Gaia EDR3 photometric
data were combined with 2MASS measurements to derive extinction towards stars with accurate photometry
and relative uncertainties on parallaxes of less than 20%. We applied our hierarchical inversion
algorithm adapted to inhomogeneous spatial distributions of target stars to this catalogue of
extinctions. We present the updated 3D dust extinction distribution and provide an estimate of
the error on integrated extinctions from the Sun to each area in the 3D map. The computational area
is similar to the one of the previous DR2 map, a 6 kpc x 6 kpc x 0.8 kpcAstrophysics volume around the
Sun. Due to the addition of fainter target stars, the volume in which the clouds can be reconstructed
has increased. Due to the improved accuracy of the parallaxes and photometric data in EDR3, extinctions
among neighbouring targets are more consistent, allowing one to reach an increased contrast in
the dense areas, while cavity contours are more regular. We show several comparisons with recent
results on dust and star distributions. The wavy pattern around the Plane of the dust concentrations
is better seen and exists over large regions. Its mean vertical peak-to-peak amplitude is of the
order of 300 pc; interestingly, it is similar to the vertical period of the spectacular snail-shaped
stellar kinematical pattern discovered in Gaia data. The Gaia EDR3 catalogue allows for a significant
improvement of the extinction maps to be made and the hierarchical technique confirms its efficiency
for massive datasets. Future comparisons between 3D maps of interstellar matter and stellar distributions
may help to understand which mergers or internal perturbations have shaped the Galaxy within the
first 3 kpc.

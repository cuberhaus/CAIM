A tight relation between [C II] $ 158 \ {\rm{\mu m}}$ line luminosity and star formation rate (SFR)
is observed in local galaxies. At $z > 5$, galaxies instead deviate downwards from the local $\Sigma_{\rm{[C
II]}}-\Sigma_{\rm{SFR}}$ relation. This deviation might be caused by different interstellar
medium (ISM) properties in galaxies at early epochs. We combine the [C II] and SFR data with C III]
$\lambda1909$ line observations and our physical models. We additionally investigate how the
ISM properties: burstiness $\kappa_s$, total gas density $n$, and metallicity $Z$, affect the
deviation from the $\Sigma_{\rm{[C II]}}-\Sigma_{\rm{SFR}}$ relation in these sources. We present
the VLT/X-SHOOTER observations targeting the C III] $\lambda1909$ line emission in three galaxies
at $5.5<z<7.0$. We extend our sample of galaxies by including archival X-SHOOTER and MUSE data of
eight sources at $2<z<7$ and eleven star-forming systems at $6 < z< 7.5$ with C III] or [C II] data reported
in the literature. We detect C III] $\lambda \lambda1907, 1909$ line emission in HZ10 and derive
the intrinsic flux of the C III] $ \lambda1909$ line. We constrain the ISM properties of our sample
of galaxies: $\kappa_s$, $n$, and $Z$, by applying our physically motivated model based on the MCMC
algorithm. For the most part, high-$z$, star-forming galaxies show subsolar metallicities. The
majority of the sources have $\log{(\kappa_s)} \gtrsim 1$, i.e., they overshoot the Kennicutt-Schmidt
relation by about one order of magnitude. This suggests that the whole KS relation might be shifted
upwards at early times. Next, all the high-$z$ galaxies of our sample lie below the $\Sigma_{\rm{[C
II]}}-\Sigma_{\rm{SFR}}$ local relation. The total gas density $n$ shows the strongest correlation
with the deviation from the local $\Sigma_{\rm{[C II]}}-\Sigma_{\rm{SFR}}$ relation, in agreement
with theoretical models.

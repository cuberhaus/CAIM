Current and future cosmological analyses with Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) face three critical challenges:
i) measuring redshifts from the supernova or its host galaxy; ii) classifying SNe without spectra;
and iii) accounting for correlations between the properties of SNe Ia and their host galaxies. We
present here a novel approach that addresses each challenge. In the context of the Dark Energy Survey
(DES), we analyze a SNIa sample with host galaxies in the redMaGiC galaxy catalog, a selection of
Luminous Red Galaxies. Photo-$z$ estimates for these galaxies are expected to be accurate to $\sigma_{\Delta
z/(1+z)}\sim0.02$. The DES-5YR photometrically classified SNIa sample contains approximately
1600 SNe and 125 of these SNe are in redMaGiC galaxies. We demonstrate that redMaGiC galaxies almost
exclusively host SNe Ia, reducing concerns with classification uncertainties. With this subsample,
we find similar Hubble scatter (to within $\sim0.01$ mag) using photometric redshifts in place
of spectroscopic redshifts. With detailed simulations, we show the bias due to using photo-$z$s
from redMaGiC host galaxies on the measurement of the dark energy equation-of-state $w$ is up to
$\Delta w \sim 0.01-0.02$. With real data, we measure a difference in $w$ when using redMaGiC photometric
redshifts versus spectroscopic redshifts of $\Delta w = 0.005$. Finally, we discuss how SNe in redMaGiC
galaxies appear to be a more standardizable population due to a weaker relation between color and
luminosity ($\beta$) compared to the DES-3YR population by $\sim5\sigma$; this finding is consistent
with predictions that redMaGiC galaxies exhibit lower reddening ratios ($\textrm{R}_\textrm{V}$)
than the general population of SN host galaxies. These results establish the feasibility of performing
redMaGiC SN cosmology with photometric survey data in the absence of spectroscopic data.

We present the first detailed study on the Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) G46.8-0.3 and its environment
since its discovery more than 50 years ago. With new flux measurements from radio surveys plus a compilation
from the literature we created an improved integrated radio spectrum of G46.8-0.3, which is well
fitted by a simple power-law with an index alpha = -0.535 +/- 0.012, then excluding the presence of
absorption by abundant ionised gas in the line of sight, or in the SNR's proximity. The analysis of
local changes in the radio spectral index across G46.8-0.3 suggests a slight steepening at about
1 GHz, which does not impact on the integrated spectrum of the source. From atomic hydrogen (HI) spectra
we placed the remnant at 8.7 +/- 1.0 kpc, and revisited the distance to the nearby HII region G046.495-00.241
to 7.3 +/- 1.2 kpc. From evolutionary models and our distance estimate, we conclude G46.8-0.3 is
a middle-aged ($\sim$1 x 10^4 yr) SNR. We recognised several 12CO and 13CO molecular structures
in the proximity of the remnant and used combined CO-HI profiles to derive the kinematic distances
to these features and characterise their physical properties. We also provided compelling evidences
for environmental molecular clouds physically linked to G46.8-0.3 at its centre, on its eastern
edge, and towards the northern and southwestern rims on the far side of the SNR shell. Our study does
not confirm that the remnant is embedded in a molecular cavity as previously suggested. G46.8-0.3
shows a line-of-sight coincidence with the gamma-ray source 4FGL J1918.1+1215c, detected at GeV
energies by the space telescope Fermi. A rough analysis based on the properties of the interstellar
matter close G46.8-0.3 indicates that the GeV gamma-rays photons detected in direction to the SNR
can be plausibly attributed to hadronic collisions and/or bremsstrahlung radiation.

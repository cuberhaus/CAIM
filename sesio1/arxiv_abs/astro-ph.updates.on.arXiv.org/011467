We report the detection of the propargyl radical (CH2CCH) in the cold dark cloud TMC-1 in the lambda
3 mm wavelength band. We recently discovered this species in space toward the same source at a wavelength
of lambda 8 mm. In those observations, various hyperfine components of the 2,0,2-1,0,1 rotational
transition, at 37.5 GHz, were detected using the Yebes 40m telescope. Here, we used the IRAM 30m telescope
to detect ten hyperfine components of the 5,0,5-4,0,4 rotational transition, lying at 93.6 GHz.
The observed frequencies differ by 0.2 MHz with respect to the predictions from available laboratory
data. This difference is significant for a radioastronomical search for CH2CCH in interstellar
sources with narrow lines. We thus included the measured frequencies in a new spectroscopic analysis
to provide accurate frequency predictions for the interstellar search for propargyl at mm wavelengths.
Moreover, we recommend that future searches for CH2CCH in cold interstellar clouds are carried
out at lambda 3 mm, rather than at lambda 8 mm. The 5,0,5-4,0,4 transition is about five times more
intense than the 2,0,2-1,0,1 one in TMC-1, which implies that detecting the former requires about
seven times less telescope time than detecting the latter. We constrain the rotational temperature
of CH2CCH in TMC-1 to 9.9 +/- 1.5 K, which indicates that the rotational levels of this species are
thermalized at the gas kinetic temperature. The revised value of the column density of CH2CCH (including
ortho and para species) is (1.0 +/- 0.2)e14 cm-2, and thus the CH2CCH/CH3CCH abundance ratio is revised
from slightly below one to nearly one. This study opens the door for future detections of CH2CCH in
other cold interstellar clouds, making possible to further investigate the role of this very abundant
hydrocarbon radical in the synthesis of large organic molecules such as aromatic rings.

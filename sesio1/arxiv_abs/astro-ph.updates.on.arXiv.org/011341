Hydrogen emission lines can provide extensive information about star-forming galaxies in both
the local and high-redshift Universe. We present a detailed Lyman continuum (LyC), Lyman-alpha
(Ly{\alpha}), and Balmer line (H{\alpha} and H\b{eta}) radiative transfer study of a high-resolution
isolated Milky-Way simulation using the Arepo-RT radiation hydrodynamics code with the SMUGGLE
galaxy formation model. The realistic framework includes stellar feedback, non-equilibrium
thermochemistry, and dust grain evolution in the interstellar medium (ISM). We extend our Cosmic
Ly{\alpha} Transfer (COLT) code with photoionization equilibrium Monte Carlo radiative transfer
for self-consistent end-to-end (non-)resonant line predictions. Accurate LyC reprocessing
to recombination emission requires modelling pre-absorption by dust (27.5%), helium ionization
(8.7%), and anisotropic escape fractions (7.9%), as these reduce the available budget for hydrogen
line emission (55.9%). We investigate the role of the multiphase dusty ISM, disc geometry, gas kinematics,
and star formation activity in governing the physics of emission and escape, focusing on the time
variability, gas phase structure, and spatial, spectral, and viewing angle dependence of the emergent
photons. Isolated disc simulations are well-suited for comprehensive observational comparisons
with local H{\alpha} surveys, but would require a proper cosmological circumgalactic medium (CGM)
environment as well as less dust absorption and rotational broadening to serve as analogs for high-redshift
Ly{\alpha} emitting galaxies. Future applications of our framework to next-generation cosmological
simulations of galaxy formation including radiation-hydrodynamics that resolve <10 pc multiphase
ISM and <1 kpc CGM structures will provide crucial insights and predictions for current and upcoming
Ly{\alpha} observations.

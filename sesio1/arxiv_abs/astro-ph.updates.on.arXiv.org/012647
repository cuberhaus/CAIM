Both the lack of observation of ultra-high energy (UHE) photons and the limitations of the state-of-the-art
methodology being applied for their identification motivate studies on alternative approaches
to the relevant simulations and the related observational strategies. One of such new approaches
is proposed in this report and it concerns new observables allowing indirect identification of
UHE photons through cosmic ray phenomena composed of many spatially correlated extensive air showers
or primary cosmic rays observed at one time. The study is based on simulations of interactions of
UHE photons with the magnetic field of the Sun using the PRESHOWER program with some essential modifications.
One of the expected results of such interactions is a generation of cosmic ray ensembles (CRE) in
the form of very thin and very elongated cascades of secondary photons of energies spanning the whole
cosmic ray energy spectrum. Upon entering the Earth's atmosphere, these cascades or their parts
may generate uniquely characteristic walls of spatially correlated extensive air showers, and
the effect is expected also in cases when primary UHE photons are not directed towards the Earth.
Particle distributions in these multi-primary UHE photon footprints are expected to have thicknesses
of the order of meters and elongations reaching even hundreds of millions kilometers, making them
potentially observable with a global, multi-experiment approach, including re-exploring of
the historical data, with the expected event rate exceeding the capabilities of even very large
cosmic ray observatories. The methods described in this report allow for simulating potentially
observable quantities related to CRE induced by UHE photons: densities, energy spectra and geographical
orientations of particles at the top of the Earth's atmosphere.

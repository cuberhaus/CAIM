It is already accepted that Be stars are surrounded by circumstellar envelopes, which are mostly
compatible with a disc geometry in Keplerian rotation. We aim to obtain a more complete characterisation
of the properties of the circumstellar environment of Be stars that helps to constrain the theoretical
models of the Be phenomenon. We present near-infrared, medium-resolution spectra of a sample of
galactic Be stars with different spectral subtypes and luminosity classes. We measure different
parameters of the hydrogen recombination lines from the Paschen, Brackett, Pfund, and Humphreys
series, and use them to diagnose physical conditions in the circumstellar environment. We analysed
the equivalent-width (EW) ratio between Br$\alpha$ and Br$\gamma$ lines and different diagrams
of flux ratios. We also identify lines from He I, C I, N I, O I, Na I, Mg I, Mg II, Si I, Fe I, and Fe II. Analysing
the EW measurements of particular He I, Mg II, Fe I, Fe II and O I lines, we find that for some lines they
correlate with the spectral type of the star. Particularly, the emission of the O I~$\lambda\,1.3168\,\mu$m
line decreases towards the later spectral types. We present an atlas of 22 Be stars, that covers a
wide infrared (IR) spectral range with quasi-simultaneous observations. From a detailed analysis,
we define new complementary criteria to Mennickent's classification of Be stars according to their
disc opacity. Some objects in our sample present compact thick envelopes, while in others the envelope
is extended and optically thin. The correlation between the full widths at half maximum (FWHM) and
the peak separation ($\Delta \mathrm{V}$) versus $V\,\sin\,i$ for the Br10, Br$\delta$, and Hu14
lines reveals that the broadening mechanism is rotational. The Ly$\beta$ fluorescence is a key
mechanism to explain the intensity of the emission of Mg II and O I lines.

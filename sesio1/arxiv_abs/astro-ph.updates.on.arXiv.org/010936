The generalized SU(2) Proca theory (GSU2P for short) is a variant of the well known generalized Proca
theory (GP for short) where the vector field belongs to the Lie algebra of the SU(2) group of global
transformations under which the action is made invariant. New interesting possibilities arise
in this framework because of the existence of new interactions of purely non-Abelian character
and new configurations of the vector field that result in spatial spherical symmetry and the cosmological
dynamics being driven by the propagating degrees of freedom. We study the two-dimensional phase
space of the system that results when the cosmic triad configuration is employed in the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker
background and find an attractor curve whose attraction basin covers almost all the allowed region.
Such an attractor curve corresponds to a primordial inflationary solution that has the following
characteristic properties: 1.) it is a de Sitter solution whose Hubble parameter is regulated by
a generalized version of the SU(2) group coupling constant, 2.) it is constant-roll including,
as opposite limiting cases, the slow-roll and ultra slow-roll varieties, 3.) a number of e-folds
$N > 60$ is easily reached, 4.) it has a graceful exit into a radiation dominated period powered by
the canonical kinetic term of the vector field and the Einstein-Hilbert term. The free parameters
of the action are chosen such that the tensor sector of the theory is the same as that of general relativity
at least up to second-order perturbations, thereby avoiding the presence of ghost and Laplacian
instabilities in the tensor sector as well as making the gravity waves propagate at light speed.
This is a proof of concept of the interesting properties we could find in this scenario when the coupling
constants be replaced by general coupling functions.

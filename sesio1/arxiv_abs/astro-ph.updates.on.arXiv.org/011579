The respective contributions of gas accretion, galaxy interactions, and mergers to the mass assembly
of galaxies, their morphological transformations, and the changes in their molecular gas content
and star formation activity are still not fully understood. Galaxies with two kinematic components
which are manifested as a double-peak (DP) in their emission lines, have been identified in a recent
work to play a major role in the morphological transformation towards larger bulges. Notably, star-forming
DP galaxies display a central star formation enhancement and are thought to be associated with a
sequence of recent minor mergers. In order to probe merger induced star formation, we conducted
observations of the molecular gas content of star-forming DP galaxies in the upper part of the main
sequence (MS) with the IRAM 30m telescope. In combination with existing molecular gas observations
from the literature, we gathered a sample of 41 such galaxies. We succeed in fitting the same kinematic
parameters to the optical ionised and molecular gas emission lines for 24 (59\,\%) galaxies. We
find a central star formation enhancement which is most likely the result of a galaxy merger or galaxy
interactions which is indicated by an excess of gas extinction found in the centre. This star formation
is traced by radio continuum emissions of 150 MHz, 1.4 GHz and 3 GHz, which are all three linearly correlated
with the CO luminosity described by the same slope. We find a significantly larger amount of molecular
gas in the present DP galaxies and larger depletion times. We discard a scenario of large scale instabilities
driving gas into the centre and find no direct link between the measured kinematic signatures and
inclination. This leads us to conclude that the observed DP galaxies are mostly the result of a recent
merger that funnelled molecular gas towards the centre and triggered star formation there.

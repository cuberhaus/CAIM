We present simple stellar population models based on the empirical X-shooter Spectral Library
(XSL) from NUV to NIR wavelengths. The unmatched characteristics of relatively high resolution
and extended wavelength coverage ($350-2480$ nm, $R\sim10\,000$) of the XSL population models
bring us closer to bridging optical and NIR studies of intermediate and old stellar populations.
It is now common to find good agreement between observed and predicted NUV and optical properties
of stellar clusters due to our good understanding of the main-sequence and early giant phases of
stars. However, NIR spectra of intermediate-age and old stellar populations are sensitive to cool
K and M giants. The asymptotic giant branch, especially the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant
branch, shapes the NIR spectra of $0.5-2$ Gyr old stellar populations; the tip of the red giant branch
defines the NIR spectra of populations with ages larger than that. We construct sequences of the
average spectra of static giants, variable-rich giants, and C-rich giants to include in the models
separately. The models span the metallicity range $-2.2<[Fe/H]<+0.2$ and ages above 50 Myr, a broader
range in the NIR than in other models based on empirical spectral libraries. Our models can reproduce
the integrated optical colours of the Coma cluster galaxies at the same level as other semi-empirical
models found in the literature. In the NIR, there are notable differences between the colours of
the models and Coma cluster galaxies. The XSL models expand the range of predicted values of NIR indices
compared to other models based on empirical libraries. Our models make it possible to perform in-depth
studies of colours and spectral features consistently throughout the optical and the NIR range
to clarify the role of evolved cool stars in stellar populations.

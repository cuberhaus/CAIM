The CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor ($\alpha_\rm{CO}$) is critical to studying molecular gas and
star formation in galaxies. The value of $\alpha_\rm{CO}$ has been found to vary within and between
galaxies, but the specific environmental conditions that cause these variations are not fully
understood. Previous observations on $\sim$kpc scales revealed low values of $\alpha_\rm{CO}$
in the centers of some barred spiral galaxies, including NGC 3351. We present new ALMA Band 3, 6, and
7 observations of $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O lines on 100 pc scales in the inner $\sim$2
kpc of NGC 3351. Using multi-line radiative transfer modeling and a Bayesian likelihood analysis,
we infer the H$_2$ density, kinetic temperature, CO column density per line width, and CO isotopologue
abundances on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Our modeling implies the existence of a dominant gas component
with a density of $2{-}3\times10^3$ $\rm{cm^{-3}}$ in the central ${\sim}$1 kpc and a high temperature
of 30$-$60 K near the nucleus and near the contact points that connect to the bar-driven inflows.
Assuming a CO/H$_2$ abundance of $3\times10^{-4}$, our analysis yields $\alpha_\rm{CO}{\sim}0.5{-}2.0$
$\rm{M_\odot\,(K~km~s^{-1}~pc^2)^{-1}}$ with a decreasing trend with galactocentric radius
in the central $\sim$1 kpc. The inflows show a substantially lower $\alpha_\rm{CO} < 0.1$ $\rm{M_\odot\,(K~km~s^{-1}~pc^2)^{-1}}$,
likely due to lower optical depths caused by turbulence or shear in the inflows. Over the whole region,
this gives an intensity-weighted $\alpha_\rm{CO}$ of ${\sim}1.5$ $\rm{M_\odot\,(K~km~s^{-1}~pc^2)^{-1}}$,
which is similar to previous dust modeling based results at kpc scales. This suggests that low $\alpha_\rm{CO}$
on kpc scales in the centers of some barred galaxies may be due to the contribution of low optical depth
CO emission in bar-driven inflows.

The mass profiles of massive dark matter halos are highly sensitive to the nature of dark matter and
potential modifications of the theory of gravity on large scales. The $\Lambda$CDM paradigm makes
strong predictions on the shape of dark matter halos and on the dependence of the shape parameters
on halo mass, such that any deviation from the predicted universal shape would have important implications
for the fundamental properties of dark matter. Here we use a set of 12 galaxy clusters with available
deep X-ray and Sunyaev-Zeldovich data to constrain the shape of the gravitational field with an
unprecedented level of precision over two decades in radius. On average, we find that the NFW profile
provides an excellent description of the recovered mass profiles, with deviations of less than
10% over a wide radial range. However, there appears to be more diversity in the shape of individual
profiles than can be captured by the NFW model. The average NFW concentration and its scatter agree
very well with the prediction of the $\Lambda$CDM framework. For a subset of systems, we disentangle
the gravitational field into the contribution of baryonic components (gas, brightest cluster
galaxy, and satellite galaxies) and that of dark matter. The stellar content dominates the gravitational
field inside $\sim0.02R_{500}$ but is responsible for only 1-2% of the total gravitational field
inside $R_{200}$. The total baryon fraction reaches the cosmic value at $R_{200}$ and slightly
exceeds it beyond this point, possibly indicating a mild level of nonthermal pressure support ($10-20\%$)
in cluster outskirts. Finally, the relation between observed and baryonic acceleration exhibits
a complex shape that strongly departs from the radial acceleration relation in spiral galaxies,
which shows that the aforementioned relation does not hold at the galaxy-cluster scale.

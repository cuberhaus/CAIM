Very large mass ratio binary black hole systems are of interest both as a clean limit of the two-body
problem in general relativity, as well as for their importance as sources of low-frequency gravitational
waves. At lowest order, the smaller body moves along a geodesic of the larger black hole's spacetime.
Post-geodesic effects include the gravitational self force, which incorporates the backreaction
of gravitational-wave emission, and the spin-curvature force, which arises from coupling of the
small body's spin to the black hole's spacetime curvature. In this paper, we describe a method for
precisely computing bound orbits of spinning bodies about black holes. Our analysis builds off
of pioneering work by Witzany which demonstrated how to describe the motion of a spinning body to
linear order in the small body's spin. Exploiting the fact that in the large mass-ratio limit spinning-body
orbits are close to geodesics and using closed-form results due to van de Meent describing precession
of the small body's spin along black hole orbits, we develop a frequency-domain formulation of the
motion which can be solved very precisely. We examine a range of orbits with this formulation, focusing
in this paper on orbits which are eccentric and nearly equatorial (i.e., the orbit's motion is $\mathcal{O}(S)$
out of the equatorial plane), but for which the small body's spin is arbitrarily oriented. We discuss
generic orbits with general small-body spin orientation in a companion paper. We characterize
the behavior of these orbits and show how the small body's spin shifts the frequencies $\Omega_r$
and $\Omega_\phi$ which affect orbital motion. These frequency shifts change accumulated phases
which are direct gravitational-wave observables, illustrating the importance of precisely characterizing
these quantities for gravitational-wave observations. (Abridged)

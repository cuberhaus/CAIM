We present a non-parametric Lagrangian biasing model and fit the ratio of the halo and mass densities
at field level using the mass-weighted halo field in the AbacusSummit simulations at $z=0.5$. Unlike
the bias expansion method widely used in interpreting the observed large-scale structure traced
by galaxies, we find a non-negative halo-to-mass ratio that increases monotonically with the linear
overdensity $\delta_1$ in the initial Lagrangian space. The bias expansion, however, does not
guarantee non-negativity of the halo counts and may lead to rising halo number counts at negative
overdensities. The shape of the halo-to-mass ratio is unlikely to be described by a polynomial function
of $\delta_1$ and other quantities, and shows a plateau at high $\delta_1$. Especially for massive
halos with $6\times10^{12}\ h^{-1}\ M_\odot$, the halo-to-mass ratio starts soaring up at $\delta_1>0$,
substantially different from the predictions of the bias expansion. We show that for $M>3\times10^{11}\
h^{-1}\ M_\odot$ halos, a non-parametric halo-to-mass ratio as a function of $\delta_1$ and its
local derivative $\nabla^2\delta_1$ can recover the halo power spectra to sub-percent level accuracy
for wavenumbers $k=0.01-0.1\ h\ {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ given a proper smoothing scale to filter the initial
density field, even though we do not fit the power spectrum directly. However, there is mild dependence
of the recovery of the halo power spectrum on the smoothing scale and other input parameters. At $k<0.01\
h\ {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and for $M>6\times10^{12}\ h^{-1}\ M_\odot$ halos, our non-parametric model
leads to a few percent overestimation of the halo power spectrum, indicating the need for larger
or multiple smoothing scales. The halo-to-mass ratios obtained qualitatively agree with intuitions
from extended Press-Schechter theory. We compare our framework to the bias expansion and discuss
possible extensions.

We apply Gaussian smoothing to obtain mean magnetic field, density, velocity, and magnetic and
kinetic energy densities from our numerical model of the interstellar medium, based on three-dimensional
magnetohydrodynamic equations in a shearing box $1 \times 1 \times 2 \, {\rm kpc}$ in size. The interstellar
medium is highly compressible, as the turbulence is transonic or supersonic; it is thus an excellent
context in which to explore the use of smoothing to represent physical variables in a compressible
medium in terms of their mean and fluctuating parts. Unlike alternative averaging procedures,
such as horizontal averaging, Gaussian smoothing retains the three-dimensional structure of
the mean fields. Although Gaussian smoothing does not obey the Reynolds rules of averaging, physically
meaningful and mathematically sound central statistical moments are defined as suggested by Germano
(1992). We discuss methods to identify an optimal smoothing scale $\ell$ and the effects of this
choice on the results. From spectral analysis of the magnetic, density and velocity fields, we find
a suitable smoothing length for all three fields, of $\ell \approx 75 \, {\rm pc}$. Such a smoothing
scale is likely to be sensitive to the choice of simulation parameters; this may be considered in
future work, but here we just explore the methodology. We discuss the properties of third-order
statistical moments in fluctuations of kinetic energy density in compressible flows, and suggest
their physical interpretation. The mean magnetic field, amplified by a mean-field dynamo, significantly
alters the distribution of kinetic energy in space and between scales, reducing the magnitude of
kinetic energy at intermediate scales. This intermediate-scale kinetic energy is a useful diagnostic
of the importance of SN-driven outflows.

The aim of this article is to perform a phenomenological parametrization of the standard cosmological
model, $\Lambda$CDM, to weight the different physical processes that define the pattern of the
angular power spectra of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies. We use six phenomenological
amplitudes to account for the Sachs-Wolfe, early and late Integrated Sachs-Wolfe, polarization
contribution, Doppler and lensing effects. To this end, we have adapted CLASS Boltzmann code and
used the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler from Cobaya to explore Planck 2018 likelihood to
constrain different combinations of cosmological and phenomenological parameters. Observing
deviations of the mean values of the phenomenological amplitudes from the $\Lambda$CDM model predictions
might be helpful to resolve the existing cosmological tensions. For the first time an integral analysis
of the CMB physical processes using Planck 2018 temperature, polarization and lensing power spectra
was performed. In a previous work, the phenomenological amplitudes were constrained using only
TT data, however, when including polarization and lensing data we found that the constraints on
those physical contributions are tighten. Also, some degeneracies which appear when only TT data
are considered are completely broken when taking into account all Planck 2018 data. Consequently,
models which more than three phenomenological amplitudes could be studied, which is prohibitive
when only the temperature power spectrum is used. The results presented in this work show Planck
experiment is able to constraint all the phenomenological amplitudes except the late Integrated
Sachs-Wolfe effect. No inconsistencies were found with $\Lambda$CDM model and the greatest improvements
were obtained for models including the lensing parameter, $A_L$.

Ground based observations appear to indicate that Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR) of the highest
energies (>10^{18.7} eV) consist of heavy particles -- shower depth and muon production data both
pointing towards this conclusion. On the other hand, cosmic-ray arrival directions at energies
>10^{18.9} eV exhibit a dipole anisotropy, which disfavours heavy composition, since higher-Z
nuclei are strongly deflected by the Galactic magnetic field, suppressing anisotropy. This is
the composition problem of UHECR. One solution could be the existence of yet-unknown effects in
proton interactions at CM energies 50 TeV, which would alter the interaction cross section and the
multiplicity of interaction products, mimicking heavy primaries. We aim to study the impact of
such changes on cosmic-ray observables using simulations of Extensive Air-Shower (EAS), in order
to place constrains on the phenomenology of any new effects for high energy proton interactions
that could be probed by sqrt{s}>50 TeV collisions. We simulated showers of primaries with energies
in the range 10^{17} - 10^{20} eV using the CORSIKA code, modified to implement a possible increase
in cross-section and multiplicity in hadronic collisions exceeding a center-of-mass (CM) energy
of 50 TeV threshold. We studied the composition-sensitive shower observables (shower depth, muons)
as a function of cross-section, multiplicity, and primary energy. We found that in order to match
the Auger shower depth measurements by means of new hadronic collision effects alone (if extragalactic
UHECR are all protons even at the highest energies), the cross-section of proton-air interactions
has to be 800 mb at 140 TeV CM energy, accompanied by an increase of a factor of 2-3 in secondary particles.
We also studied the muon production of the showers in the same scenario.

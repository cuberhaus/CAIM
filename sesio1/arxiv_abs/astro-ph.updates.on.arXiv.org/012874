We discuss the secondary cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy due to kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
(kSZ) effect from ionized bubbles around individual quasars prior to the reionization of the Universe.
The bubbles create local ionization modulations which move with the large scale structure linear
bulk flow and acts as source kSZ. We improve upon previous calculations of this effect, using a halo
model based description of quasar abundance, and find that the kSZ distortion power spectrum, $C_\ell$,
from the bubbles to be sub-dominant to kSZ from patchy reionization driven by galaxies. However,
the shape of the two $C_\ell$'s are very different with the quasar bubble $C_\ell$ having a peak at
$\ell \approx 500-700$ whereas the $C_\ell$ due to patchy reionization flattening out at $\ell
> 1000$ thus making it plausible to separate the two using $C_\ell$ template-fitting in a future
survey like CMB-HD. We also show that the amplitude of the quasar bubble induced power spectrum has
a strong dependence on the epoch of reionization, and can be negligible for early reionization models.
Next, we look at the imprint of a single quasar bubble on the CMB and show that it can be detected in a
high-resolution, ambitious effort like CMB-HD. The amplitude and the oscillatory features of
a single bubble power spectrum can be used to constrain the apparent asymmetric shape of the relativistically
expanding ionized bubble, and depends on intrinsic quasar physics parameters such as the quasar
photon emission rate and the quasar lifetime and cosmological probes like high redshift large scale
linear velocity and the neutral hydrogen fraction. A detection of a high redshift quasar bubble
in the CMB would carry complimentary information to its detection in HI or Lyman-$\alpha$ and a joint
analysis can be used to break parameter degeneracies.

We revisit the problem of the isothermal slab (in standard Cartesian coordinates, density distributions
and mean gravitational potential are considered to be independent of $x$ and $y$ and to be a function
of $z$, symmetric with respect to the $z = 0$ plane) in the context of the general issues related to
the role of weak collisionality in inhomogeneous self-gravitating stellar systems. We thus consider
the two-component case, that is a system of heavy and light stars with assigned mass ratio ($\mu$)
and assigned global relative abundance ($\alpha$; the ratio of the total mass of the heavy and light
stars). The system is imagined to start from an initial condition in which the two species are well
mixed and have identical spatial and velocity distributions and to evolve into a final configuration
in which collisions have generated equipartition and mass segregation. Initial and final distribution
functions are assumed to be Maxwellian. Application of mass and energy conservation allows us to
derive the properties of the final state from the assumed initial conditions. In general, the derivation
of these properties requires a simple numerical integration of the Poisson equation. Curiously,
the case in which the heavy stars are exactly twice as massive as the light stars ($\mu = 2$) turns out
to admit a relatively simple analytic solution. Although the general framework of this investigation
is relatively straightforward, some non-trivial issues related to energy conservation and the
possible use of a virial constraint are noted and clarified. The formulation and the results of this
paper prepare the way to future studies in which the evolution induced by weak collisionality will
be followed either by considering the action of standard collision operators or by means of dedicated
numerical simulations.

The hadron-quark phase transition in quantum chromodyanmics has been suggested as an alternative
explosion mechanism for core-collapse supernovae. We study the impact of three different hadron-quark
equations of state (EoS) with first-order (DD2F, STOF-B145) and second-order (CMF) phase transitions
on supernova dynamics by performing 97 simulations for solar- and zero-metallicity progenitors
in the range of $14\texttt{-}100\,\text{M}_\odot$. We find explosions only for two low-compactness
models ($14 \text{M}_\odot$ and $16\,\text{M}_\odot$) with the DD2F EoS, both with low explosion
energies of $\mathord{\sim}10^{50}\,\mathrm{erg}$. These weak explosions are characterised
by a neutrino signal with several mini-bursts in the explosion phase due to complex reverse shock
dynamics, in addition to the typical second neutrino burst for phase-transition driven explosions.
The nucleosynthesis shows significant overproduction of nuclei such as $^{90}\mathrm{Zr}$ for
the $14\,\text{M}_\odot$ zero-metallicity model and $^{94}\mathrm{Zr}$ for the $16\,\text{M}_\odot$
solar-metallicity model, but the overproduction factors are not large enough to place constraints
on the occurrence of such explosions. Several other low-compactness models using the DD2F EoS and
two high-compactness models using the STOS EoS end up as failed explosions and emit a second neutrino
burst. For the CMF EoS, the phase transition never leads to a second bounce and explosion. For all
three EoS, inverted convection occurs deep in the core of the proto-compact star due to anomalous
behaviour of thermodynamic derivatives in the mixed phase, which heats the core to entropies up
to $4k_\text{B}/\text{baryon}$ and may have a distinctive gravitational wave signature, also
for a second-order phase transition.

The Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) on board the Solar Orbiter (SO) spacecraft observed small
extreme ultraviolet (EUV) bursts, termed campfires, that have been proposed to be brightenings
near the apexes of low-lying loops in the quiet-Sun atmosphere. The underlying magnetic processes
driving these campfires are not understood. During the cruise phase of SO and at a distance of 0.523\,AU
from the Sun, the Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager on Solar Orbiter (SO/PHI) observed a quiet-Sun
region jointly with SO/EUI, offering the possibility to investigate the surface magnetic field
dynamics underlying campfires at a spatial resolution of about 380~km. In 71\% of the 38 isolated
events, campfires are confined between bipolar magnetic features, which seem to exhibit signatures
of magnetic flux cancellation. The flux cancellation occurs either between the two main footpoints,
or between one of the footpoints of the loop housing the campfire and a nearby opposite polarity patch.
In one particularly clear-cut case, we detected the emergence of a small-scale magnetic loop in
the internetwork followed soon afterwards by a campfire brightening adjacent to the location of
the linear polarisation signal in the photosphere, that is to say near where the apex of the emerging
loop lays. The rest of the events were observed over small scattered magnetic features, which could
not be identified as magnetic footpoints of the campfire hosting loops. The majority of campfires
could be driven by magnetic reconnection triggered at the footpoints, similar to the physical processes
occurring in the burst-like EUV events discussed in the literature. About a quarter of all analysed
campfires, however, are not associated to such magnetic activity in the photosphere, which implies
that other heating mechanisms are energising these small-scale EUV brightenings.

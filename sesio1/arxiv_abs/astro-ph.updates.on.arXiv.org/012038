PSR J0955$-$6150 is a member of a class of eccentric MSP+He WD systems (eMSPs), whose binary evolution
is poorly understood and believed to be different to that of traditional MSP+He WD systems. Measuring
the masses of the stars in this system is important for testing hypotheses for the formation of eMSPs.
We have carried out observations of this pulsar with the Parkes and MeerKAT radio telescopes. Our
observations reveal a strong frequency evolution of this pulsar's intensity, with a spectral index
($\alpha$) of $-3.13(2)$. The sensitivity of MeerKAT has resulted in a $>10$-fold improvement
in the timing precision compared to older Parkes observations. Combined with the 8-year timing
baseline, it has allowed precise measurements of a proper motion and three orbital "post-Keplerian"
parameters: the rate of advance of periastron, $\dot{\omega} = 0.00152(1) \, {\rm deg} \, yr^{-1}$
and the orthometric Shapiro delay parameters, $h_3 = 0.89(7) \, \mu$s and $\varsigma = 0.88(2)$.
Assuming general relativity, we obtain $M_{p} = 1.71(2) \, M_{\odot}$ for the mass of the pulsar
and $M_{c} = 0.254(2) \, M_{\odot}$ for the mass of the companion; the orbital inclination is 83.2(4)
degrees. We find that the spin axis has a misalignment relative to the orbital angular momentum of
$> 4.8$ degrees at 99% CI. While the value of $M_{\rm p}$ falls within the wide range observed in eMSPs,
$M_{\rm c}$ is significantly smaller than expected, allowing several formation hypotheses being
ruled out. $M_{\rm c}$ is also significantly different from the expected value for an ideal low mass
X-ray binary evolution scenario. The putative misalignment between the spin axis of the pulsar
and the orbital angular momentum suggests that the unknown process that created the orbital eccentricity
of the binary was also capable of changing its orbital orientation, an important evidence for understanding
the origin of eMSPs.

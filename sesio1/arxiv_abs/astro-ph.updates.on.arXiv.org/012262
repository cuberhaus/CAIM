We analyse five early science datasets from the APERture Tile in Focus (Apertif) phased array feed
system to verify the polarisation capabilities of Apertif in view of future larger data releases.
We aim to characterise the source population of the polarised sky in the L-Band using polarised source
information in combination with IR and optical data. We use automatic routines to generate full
field-of-view Q- and U-cubes and perform RM-Synthesis, source finding, and cross-matching with
published radio, optical, and IR data to generate polarised source catalogues. SED-fitting routines
were used to determine photometric redshifts, star-formation rates, and galaxy masses. IR colour
information was used to classify sources as AGN or star-forming-dominated and early- or late-type.
We surveyed an area of 56deg$^2$ and detected 1357 polarised source components in 1170 sources.
The fraction of polarised sources is 10.57% with a median fractional polarisation of 4.70$\pm$0.14%.
We confirmed the reliability of the Apertif measurements by comparing them with polarised cross-identified
NVSS sources. Average RMs of the individual fields lie within the error of the best Milky Way foreground
measurements. All of our polarised sources were found to be dominated by AGN activity in the radio
regime with most of them being radio-loud (79%) and of the FRII class (87%). The host galaxies of our
polarised source sample are dominated by intermediate disc and star-forming disc galaxies. The
contribution of star formation to the radio emission is on the order of a few percent for $\approx$10%
of the polarised sources while for $\approx$90% it is completely dominated by the AGN. We do not see
any change in fractional polarisation for different star-formation rates of the AGN host galaxies.

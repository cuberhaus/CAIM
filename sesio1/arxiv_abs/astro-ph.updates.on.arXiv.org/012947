Chemical composition is an important factor that affects stellar evolution. The element abundance
on the stellar surface evolves along the lifetime of the star because of transport processes, including
atomic diffusion. However, models of stars with masses higher than about 1.2Msun predict unrealistic
variations at the stellar surface. This indicates the need for competing transport processes that
are mostly computationally expensive for large grids of stellar models. The purpose of this study
is to implement turbulent mixing in stellar models and assess the possibility of reproducing the
effect of radiative accelerations with turbulent mixing for elements like iron in order to make
the computation of large grids possible. We computed stellar models with MESA and assessed the effects
of atomic diffusion (with radiative acceleration) in the presence of turbulent mixing. We parametrised
the effect of radiative accelerations on iron with a turbulent diffusion coefficient. Finally,
we tested this parametrisation by modelling two F-type stars of the Kepler Legacy sample. We found
that, for iron, a parametrisation of turbulent mixing that simulates the effect of radiative acceleration
is possible. This leads to an increase in the efficiency of the turbulent mixing to counteract the
effect of gravitational settling. This approximation does not affect significantly the surface
abundances of the other elements we studied, except for oxygen and calcium. We demonstrate that
this parametrisation has a negligible impact on the accuracy of the seismic properties inferred
with these models. Moreover, turbulent mixing makes the computation of realistic F-type star models
including the effect atomic diffusion possible. This leads to differences of about 10% in the inferred
ages compared to results obtained with models that neglect these processes.

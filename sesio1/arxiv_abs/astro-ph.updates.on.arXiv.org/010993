Methanol, one of the simplest complex organic molecules in the Interstellar Medium (ISM), has been
shown to be present and extended in cold environments such as starless cores. We aim at studying methanol
emission across several starless cores and investigate the physical conditions at which methanol
starts to be efficiently formed, as well as how the physical structure of the cores and their surrounding
environment affect its distribution. Methanol and C$^{18}$O emission lines at 3 mm have been observed
with the IRAM 30m telescope within the large program "Gas phase Elemental abundances in Molecular
CloudS" (GEMS) towards 66 positions across 12 starless cores in the Taurus Molecular Cloud. A non-LTE
radiative transfer code was used to compute the column densities in all positions. We then used state-of-the-art
chemical models to reproduce our observations. We have computed N(CH$_3$OH)/N(C$^{18}$O) column
density ratios for all the observed offsets, and two different behaviours can be recognised: the
cores where the ratio peaks at the dust peak, and the cores where the ratio peaks with a slight offset
with respect to the dust peak ($\sim $10000 AU). We suggest that the cause of this behaviour is the
irradiation on the cores due to protostars nearby which accelerate energetic particles along their
outflows. The chemical models, which do not take into account irradiation variations, can reproduce
fairly well the overall observed column density of methanol, but cannot reproduce the two different
radial profiles observed. We confirm the substantial effect of the environment onto the distribution
of methanol in starless cores. We suggest that the clumpy medium generated by protostellar outflows
might cause a more efficient penetration of the interstellar radiation field in the molecular cloud
and have an impact on the distribution of methanol in starless cores.

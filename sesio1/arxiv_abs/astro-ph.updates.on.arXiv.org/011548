Presence of the apparently extended hard (2-10 keV) X-ray emission along the Galactic plane has
been known since the early 1980s. With a deep X-ray exposure using the Chandra X-ray Observatory
of a slightly off-plane region in the Galactic bulge, most of the extended emission was resolved
into faint discrete X-ray sources in the Fe K band (Revnivtsev et al.,2009). The major constituents
of these sources have long been considered to be X-ray active stars and magnetic cataclysmic variables
(CVs). However, recent works including our NIR imaging and spectroscopic studies (Morihana et
al.,2013, 2016) argue that other populations should be more dominant. To investigate this further,
we conducted a much deeper NIR imaging observation at the center of the Chandra's exposure field.
We have used the MOIRCS on the Subaru telescope, reaching the limiting magnitude of ~18 mag in the
J, H, and Ks bands in this crowded region, and identified ~50 % of the X-ray sources with NIR candidate
counterparts. We classified the X-ray sources into three groups (A, B, and C) based on their positions
in the X-ray color-color diagram and characterized them based on the X-ray and NIR features. We argue
that the major populations of the Group A and C sources are, respectively, CVs (binaries containing
magnetic or non-magnetic white dwarfs with high accretion rates) and X-ray active stars. The major
population of the Group B sources is presumably WD binaries with low mass accretion rates. The Fe
K equivalent width in the composite X-ray spectrum of the Group B sources is the largest among the
three and comparable to that of the Galactic bulge X-ray emission. This leads us to speculate that
there are numerous WD binaries with low mass accretion rates, which are not recognized as CVs, but
are the major contributor of the apparently extended X-ray emission.

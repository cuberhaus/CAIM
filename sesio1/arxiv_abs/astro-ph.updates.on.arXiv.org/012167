We present CO(2-1) and adjacent continuum observations of 7 nearby radio-quiet type-2 quasars
(QSO2s) obtained with ALMA at ~0.2" resolution (370 pc at z~0.1). The CO morphologies are diverse,
including disks and interacting systems. Two of the QSO2s are red early-type galaxies with no CO(2-1)
detected. In the interacting galaxies, the central kpc contains 18-25% of the total cold molecular
gas, whereas in the spirals it is only 5-12%. J1010+0612 and J1430+1339 show double-peaked CO morphologies
which do not have optical counterparts. Based on our analysis of the ionized and molecular kinematics
and mm continuum emission, these CO morphologies are most likely produced by AGN feedback in the
form of outflows, jets, and/or shocks. The CO kinematics of the QSO2s are dominated by rotation but
also reveal noncircular motions. According to our analysis of the kinematics, these noncircular
motions correspond to molecular outflows mostly coplanar with the CO discs in four of the QSO2s,
and either to a coplanar inflow or vertical outflow in the case of J1010+0612. These outflows represent
0.2-0.7% of the QSO2s' total molecular gas mass and have maximum velocities of 200-350 km/s, radii
from 0.4 to 1.3 kpc, and outflow rates of 8-16 Msun/yr. These properties are intermediate between
those of the mild molecular outflows measured for Seyferts, and the fast and energetic outflows
of ULIRGs. This suggests that it is not only AGN luminosity that drives massive molecular outflows.
Other factors such as jet power, coupling between winds, jets, and/or ionized outflows and the CO
discs, and amount or geometry of dense gas in the nuclear regions might be also relevant. Thus, although
we do not find evidence for a significant impact of quasar feedback on the total molecular gas reservoirs
and SFRs, it appears to be modifying the distribution of cold molecular gas in the central kpc of the
galaxies.

Extragalactic globular clusters (GCs) are important tracers of galaxy formation and evolution.
Obtaining GC catalogues from photometric data involves several steps which will likely become
too time-consuming to perform on the large data volumes that are expected from upcoming wide-field
imaging projects such as Euclid. In this work, we explore the feasibility of various machine learning
(ML) methods to aid the search for GCs. We use archival Hubble Space Telescope data in the F475W and
F850LP bands of 141 early-type galaxies in the Fornax and Virgo galaxy clusters. Using existing
GC catalogues to label the data, we obtain an extensive data set of 84929 sources containing 18556
GCs and we train several ML methods both on image and tabular data containing physically relevant
features extracted from the images. We find that our evaluated ML models are capable of producing
catalogues of similar quality as the existing ones. The best performing methods, ensemble-based
models like random forests and convolutional neural networks, recover ~ 90-94 % of GCs while producing
an acceptable amount of false detections (~ 6-8 %) - with some falsely detected sources being identifiable
as GCs that have not been labelled as such in the used catalogues. In the magnitude range 22 < m4_g <
24.5 mag, 98 - 99 % of GCs are recovered. We even find such high performance levels when training on
Virgo and evaluating on Fornax data (and vice versa), illustrating that the models are transferable
to environments with different conditions such as different distances than in the used training
data. Additionally, we demonstrate how interpretable methods can be used to better understand
model predictions, recovering that magnitudes, colours, and sizes are important for identifying
GCs. These are encouraging results, indicating that similar methods can be applied for creating
GC catalogues for a large number of galaxies.

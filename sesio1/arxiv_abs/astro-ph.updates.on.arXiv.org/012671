Technosignatures refer to observational manifestations of technology that could be detected
through astronomical means. Most previous searches for technosignatures have focused on searches
for radio signals, but many current and future observing facilities could also constrain the prevalence
of some non-radio technosignatures. This search could thus benefit from broader participation
by the astronomical community, as contributions to technosignature science can also take the form
of negative results that provide statistically meaningful quantitative upper limits on the presence
of a signal. This paper provides a synthesis of the recommendations of the 2020 TechnoClimes workshop,
which was an online event intended to develop a research agenda to prioritize and guide future theoretical
and observational studies technosignatures. The paper provides a high-level overview of the use
of current and future missions to detect exoplanetary technosignatures at ultraviolet, optical,
or infrared wavelengths, which specifically focuses on the detectability of atmospheric technosignatures,
artificial surface modifications, optical beacons, space engineering and megastructures, and
interstellar flight. This overview does not derive any new quantitative detection limits but is
intended to provide additional science justification for the use of current and planned observing
facilities as well as to inspire astronomers conducting such observations to consider the relevance
of their ongoing observations to technosignature science. This synthesis also identifies possible
technology gaps with the ability of current and planned missions to search for technosignatures,
which suggests the need to consider technosignature science cases in the design of future mission
concepts.

The relation between properties of galaxies and dark matter halos they reside in can be valuable
to understand structure formation and evolution, particularly the baryonic-to-halo mass ratio
(BHMR) and its dynamic evolution. We first review some unique properties of self-gravitating collisionless
dark matter flow (SG-CFD), followed by their implications in derivation of BHMR. To maximize system
entropy, the long-range interaction requires a broad size of halos to be formed. These halos facilitate
an inverse mass and energy cascade from small to large mass scales that involves a constant rate of
energy transfer $\epsilon_u$=$-4.6\times10^{-7}m^2/s^3$. Considering galaxies and halos
with a total baryonic mass $m_b$, halo mass $m_h$, halo virial size $r_h$, and flat rotation velocity
$v_f$, the baryonic-to-halo mass relation can be analytically derived by combining the baryonic
Tully-Fisher relation and constant rate of energy cascade $\epsilon_u$. We found a maximum BHMR
ratio ~0.076 for halos with a critical mass $m_{hc}$~$10^{12}M_{sun}$ at z=0. That ratio is much
lower for both smaller and larger halos such that two regimes can be identified: i) for incompressible
small halos with mass $m_h$<$m_{hc}$, we have $\epsilon_u$$\propto$$v_f/r_h$, $v_f$$\propto$$r_h$,
and $m_b$$\propto$$m_h^{4/3}$; ii) for large halos with mass $m_h$>$m_{hc}$, we have $\epsilon_u$$\propto$$v_f^3/r_h$,
$v_f$$\propto$$r_h^{1/3}$, and $m_b$$\propto$$m_h^{4/9}$. Combined with proposed double-$\lambda$
halo mass function, the average BHMR ratio for all halos (~0.024 at z=0) can be analytically derived,
along with its redshift evolution. The fraction of baryons in galaxy is ~7.6% at z=0 and increases
with time $\propto$$t^{1/3}$. Most (~92.4%) of the baryons are not in galaxies. The SPARC (Spitzer
Photometry & Accurate Rotation Curves) data with ~175 late-type galaxies were used for the derivation
and comparison.

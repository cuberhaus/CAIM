We present the average gas properties derived from ALMA Band 6 dust continuum imaging of 126 massive
(log $M_{\star} / M_{\odot} \gtrsim 10.5$), star-forming cluster galaxies across 11 galaxy clusters
at $z=1-1.75$. Using stacking analysis on the ALMA images, combined with UV-far-infrared data,
we quantify the average infrared SEDs and gas properties (molecular gas masses, $M_{\rm mol}$;
gas depletion timescales, $\tau_{\rm depl}$; and gas fractions, f$_{\rm gas}$) as a function of
cluster-centric radius and properties including stellar mass and distance from the Main Sequence.
We find a significant dearth in the ALMA fluxes relative to that expected in the field $-$ with correspondingly
low $M_{\rm mol}$ and f$_{\rm gas}$ and short $\tau_{\rm depl}$ $-$ with weak or no dependence on
cluster-centric radius out to twice the virial radius. The Herschel+ALMA SEDs indicate warmer
dust temperatures ($\sim36-38$ K) than coeval field galaxies ($\sim30$ K). We perform a thorough
comparison of the cluster galaxy gas properties to field galaxies, finding deficits of 2-3x, 3-4x,
and 2-4x in $M_{\rm mol}$, $\tau_{\rm depl}$, and f$_{\rm gas}$ compared to coeval field stacks
and larger deficits compared to field scaling relations built primarily on detections. The cluster
gas properties derived here are comparable with stacking analyses in (proto-)clusters in the literature
and at odds with findings of field-like $\tau_{\rm depl}$ and enhanced f$_{\rm gas}$ reported using
CO and dust continuum detections. Our analysis suggests that environment has considerable impact
on gas properties out to large radii, in good agreement with cosmological simulations which project
gas depletion begins beyond the virial radius and largely completes by first passage of the cluster
core.

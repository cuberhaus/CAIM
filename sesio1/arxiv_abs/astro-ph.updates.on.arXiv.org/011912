The pre-merger (early-warning) gravitational-wave (GW) detection and localization of a compact
binary merger would enable astronomers to capture potential electromagnetic (EM) emissions around
the time of the merger, thus shedding light on the complex physics of the merger. While early detection
and sky localization are of primary importance to the multimessenger follow-up of the event, improved
estimates of luminosity distance and orbital inclination could also provide insights on the observability
of the EM emission. In this work, we demonstrate that the inclusion of higher modes of gravitational
radiation, which vibrate at higher multiples of the orbital frequency than the dominant mode, would
significantly improve the earlywarning estimates of the luminosity distance and orbital inclination
of the binary. This will help astronomers to better determine their follow-up strategy. Focusing
on future observing runs of the ground-based GW detector network [O5 run of LIGOVirgo-KAGRA, Voyager,
and third-generation (3G) detectors], we show that for a range of masses spanning the neutron-star
black-hole binaries that are potentially EM-bright, the inclusion of higher modes improve the
luminosity distance estimates by a factor of ~ 1 - 1.5 (1.1 - 2) [1.1 - 5] for the O5 (Voyager) [3G] observing
scenario, 45 (45) [300] seconds before the merger for the sources located at 100 Mpc. There are significant
improvements in orbital inclination estimates as well. We also investigate these improvements
with varying sky-location and polarization angle. Combining the luminosity distance uncertainties
with localization skyarea estimates, we find that the number of galaxies within localization volume
is reduced by a factor of ~ 1 - 2.5 (1.2 - 4) [1.2 - 10] with the inclusion of higher modes at early-warning
time of 45 (45) [300] seconds in O5 (Voyager) [3G].

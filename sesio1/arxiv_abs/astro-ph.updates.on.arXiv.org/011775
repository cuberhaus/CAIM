Cool gas (T$\sim$10$^{4}$~K) traced by hydrogen Ly$\alpha$ emission is now routinely detected
around $z\sim3$ quasars, but little is known about their molecular gas reservoirs. Here, we present
an APEX spectroscopic survey of the CO(6-5), CO(7-6) and [CI](2-1) emission lines for 9 quasars
from the QSO MUSEUM survey which have similar UV luminosities, but very diverse Ly$\alpha$ nebulae.
These observations ($\langle~\rm rms~\rangle=2.6$~mJy in 300~km~s$^{-1}$) detected three
CO(6-5) lines with 3.4$\leq I_{\rm CO(6-5)} \leq$5.1~Jy~km~s$^{-1}$, 620$\leq$FWHM$\leq$707~km~s$^{-1}$,
and three [CI](2-1) lines with 2.3$\leq I_{\rm [CI](2-1)} \leq$15.7~Jy~km~s$^{-1}$, 329$\leq$FWHM$\leq$943~km~s$^{-1}$.
For the CO and [CI] detected sources, we constrain the molecular gas reservoirs to be $\rm M_{H_{2}}
= (0.4-6.9) \times 10^{11} M_{\odot}$, while the non-detections imply $\rm M_{H_{2}} < 1.1\times
10^{11} M_{\odot}$. We compare our observations with the extended Ly$\alpha$ properties to understand
the link between the cool and the molecular gas phases. We find large velocity shifts between the
bulk of Ly$\alpha$ and the molecular gas systemic redshift in five sources (from $\sim$-400 to $\sim+$1200~km~s$^{-1}$).
The sources with the largest shifts have the largest Ly$\alpha$ line widths in the sample, suggesting
more turbulent gas conditions and/or large-scale inflows/outflows around these quasars. We also
find that the brightest ($I_{\rm[CI](2-1)}=15.7\pm3.7~\rm Jy~km~s^{-1}$) and the widest (FWHM$\sim$900~km~s$^{-1}$)
lines are detected for the smallest and dimmest Ly$\alpha$ nebulae. From this, we speculate that
host galaxy obscuration can play an important role in reducing the ionizing and Ly$\alpha$ photons
able to escape to halo scales, and/or that these systems are hosted by more massive halos.

An ensemble of chemical abundances probing different nucleosynthetic channels can be leveraged
to build a comprehensive understanding of the chemical and structural evolution of the Galaxy.
Using GALAH DR3 data, we seek to trace the enrichment by the supernovae Ia, supernovae II, asymptotic
giant branch stars, and neutron-star mergers and/or collapsars nucleosynthetic sources by studying
the [Fe/H], [$\alpha$/Fe], [Ba/Fe], and [Eu/Fe] chemical compositions of $\sim$50,000 red giant
stars, respectively. Employing small [Fe/H]-[$\alpha$/Fe] cells, which serve as an effective
reference-frame of supernovae contributions, we characterise the abundance-age profiles for
[Ba/Fe] and [Eu/Fe]. Our results disclose that these age-abundance relations vary across the [Fe/H]-[$\alpha$/Fe]
plane. Within cells, we find negative age-[Ba/Fe] relations and flat age-[Eu/Fe] relations. Across
cells, we see the slope of the age-[Ba/Fe] relations evolve smoothly and the [Eu/Fe] relations vary
in amplitude. We subsequently model our empirical findings in a theoretical setting using the flexible
Chempy Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) code, using the mean [Fe/H], [Mg/Fe], [Ba/Fe], and age
values for stellar populations binned in [Fe/H], [Mg/Fe], and age space. We find that within a one-zone
framework, an ensemble of GCE model parameters vary to explain the data. Using present day orbits
from \textit{Gaia} EDR3 measurements we infer that the GCE model parameters, which set the observed
chemical abundance distributions, vary systematically across mean orbital radii. Under our modelling
assumptions, the observed chemical abundances are consistent with a small gradient in the high
mass end of the initial mass function (IMF) across the disc, where the IMF is more top heavy towards
the inner disc and more bottom heavy in the outer disc.

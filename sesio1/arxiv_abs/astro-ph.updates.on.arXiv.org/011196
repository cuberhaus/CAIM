Context. The response of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes to incident {\gamma}-ray-initiated
showers in the atmosphere changes as the telescopes age due to exposure to light and weather. These
aging processes affect the reconstructed energies of the events and {\gamma}-ray fluxes. Aims.
This work discusses the implementation of signal calibration methods for the Very Energetic Radiation
Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS) to account for changes in the optical throughput and detector
performance over time. Methods. The total throughput of a Cherenkov telescope is the product of
camera-dependent factors, such as the photomultiplier tube gains and their quantum efficiencies,
and the mirror reflectivity and Winston cone response to incoming radiation. This document summarizes
different methods to determine how the camera gains and mirror reflectivity have evolved over time
and how we can calibrate this changing throughput in reconstruction pipelines for imaging atmospheric
Cherenkov telescopes. The implementation is validated against seven years of observations with
the VERITAS telescopes of the Crab Nebula, which is a reference object in very-high-energy astronomy.
Results. Regular optical throughput monitoring and the corresponding signal calibrations are
found to be critical for the reconstruction of extensive air shower images. The proposed implementation
is applied as a correction to the signals of the photomultiplier tubes in the telescope simulation
to produce fine-tuned instrument response functions. This method is shown to be effective for calibrating
the acquired {\gamma}-ray data and for recovering the correct energy of the events and photon fluxes.
At the same time, it keeps the computational effort of generating Monte Carlo simulations for instrument
response functions affordably low.

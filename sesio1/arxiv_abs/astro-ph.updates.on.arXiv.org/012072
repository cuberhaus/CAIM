We present Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of the nearby (z= 0.023), very massive, highly
rotating (488.4$\pm 12.5$ $\kms$) hybrid (S0-Sa) galaxy UGC~12591, along with observations taken
at other wavelengths from UV to FIR. Deep HST data of the galaxy in V, I and H bands is used to disentangle
its bulge and disk components. The surface brightness distributions show a dominance of the bulge
component over the disk with H-band bulge-to-disc luminosity ratio $\sim 69\%$. From spectral
energy distribution (SED) fitting, we find an extremely low global star formation rate (SFR) of
$\rm \sim 0.1 - 0.2 \Msun y^{-1}$, which is unusually low for this galaxy's huge stellar mass ($\rm
M_{\star} \sim 1.6 \times 10^{11} \, \Msun$), that implies a strong quenching of it's SFR. For at
least past $\rm 10^{8}$ years the galaxy has remained in the quiescent state as a sterile, `red and
dead' galaxy. The fraction of total infra-red dust luminosity contributed by the ISM dust is as high
as $\rm \sim 90\%$, with total dust luminosity $\rm L_{dust} = (0.5-3.5) \times 10^{10} \Lsun$,
dominated by cold dust at equilibrium temperature $\rm T_{C} \approx 15 K$. UGC~12591 is found host
to a super massive black hole (SMBH) of mass $\rm 6.18\times 10^{8} M_{\sun}$ which at the present
moment is quiescent, i.e., neither we see large ($\rm > 1 kpc$) radio jets nor is the black hole contributing
significantly to the mid-IR SED, ruling out the presence of strong radiative feedback from a bright
AGN.We have obtained a detailed census of all observable baryons in this galaxy. The star formation
efficiency is very low ($\sim 0.02-0.06$) and within a virial radius the galaxy has a total observed
baryonic mass of $6.87\times10^{11}~\Msun$, amounting to a baryonic deficiency of $\sim$ $80\%$
relative to the cosmological mean.

HR\,8799 is a young planetary system composed of 4 planets and a double debris belt. Being the first
multi-planetary system discovered with the direct imaging technique, it has been observed extensively
since 1998. This wide baseline of astrometric measurements, counting over 50 observations in 20
years, permits a detailed orbital and dynamical analysis of the system. To explore the orbital parameters
of the planets, their dynamical history, and the planet-to-disk interaction, we made follow-up
observations of the system during the VLT/SPHERE GTO program. We obtained 21 observations, most
of them in favorable conditions. In addition, we observed HR\,8799 with the instrument LBT/LUCI.
All the observations were reduced with state-of-the-art algorithms implemented to apply the spectral
and angular differential imaging method. We re-reduced the SPHERE data obtained during the commissioning
of the instrument and in 3 open-time programs to have homogeneous astrometry. The precise position
of the 4 planets with respect to the host star was calculated by exploiting the fake negative companions
method. To improve the orbital fitting, we also took into account all of the astrometric data available
in the literature. From the photometric measurements obtained in different wavelengths, we estimated
the planets' masses following the evolutionary models. We obtained updated parameters for the
orbits with the assumption of coplanarity, relatively small eccentricities, and periods very
close to the 2:1 resonance. We also refined the dynamical mass of each planet and the parallax of the
system (24.49 $\pm$ 0.07 mas). We also conducted detailed $N$-body simulations indicating possible
positions of a~putative fifth innermost planet with a mass below the present detection limits of
$\simeq 3$~\MJup.

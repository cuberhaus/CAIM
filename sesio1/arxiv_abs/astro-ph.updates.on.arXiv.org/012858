Mock member stars for 28 dwarf galaxies are constructed from the cosmological Auriga simulation,
which reflect the true dynamical status of realistic tracers. The axis-symmetric Jeans Anisotropic
Multi-Gaussian Expansion (JAM) modeling is applied to 6,000 star particles for each, to recover
the underlying matter distribution. The stellar or dark matter component individually is poorly
recovered, but the total profile is constrained reasonably. The mass within the half-mass radius
of tracers is recovered the tightest, and the mass between 200 and 300~pc, $M(200-300\mathrm{pc})$,
is constrained ensemble unbiasedly, with a scatter of 0.169~dex. Using a smaller sample of 2,000
particles and only line-of-sight velocities with errors, the scatter in $M(200-300\mathrm{pc})$
is increased by $\sim$40%. Quiescent Sagittarius dSph-like systems and star-forming systems
with outflows show distinct features, with $M(200-300\mathrm{pc})$ mostly under-estimated
for the former, and more likely over-estimated for the latter. The biases correlate with the dynamical
status, which is a result of contractions due to tidal effects in quiescent systems or prominent
galactic winds in star-forming systems, driving the systems out of equilibrium. After including
Gaia DR3 proper motion errors, we find proper motions are as useful as line-of-sight velocities
for nearby systems at $<\sim$60~kpc. The expected proper motion errors of the China Space Station
Telescope is useful at $<\sim$20~kpc. Extrapolating the density profiles and the dynamical constraints
down to scales below the resolution, we find the mass within 150~pc can be constrained ensemble unbiasedly,
with a scatter of $\sim$0.3~dex. In the end, we show that the contraction of member stars in nearby
systems is detectable with Gaia DR3 proper motion errors.

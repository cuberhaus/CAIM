Compact stellar systems such as Ultra-compact dwarfs (UCDs) and Globular Clusters (GCs) around
galaxies are known to be the tracers of the merger events that have been forming these galaxies. Therefore,
identifying such systems allows to study galaxies mass assembly, formation and evolution. However,
in the lack of spectroscopic information detecting UCDs/GCs using imaging data is very uncertain.
Here, we aim to train a machine learning model to separate these objects from the foreground stars
and background galaxies using the multi-wavelength imaging data of the Fornax galaxy cluster in
6 filters, namely u, g, r, i, J and Ks. The classes of objects are highly imbalanced which is problematic
for many automatic classification techniques. Hence, we employ Synthetic Minority Over-sampling
to handle the imbalance of the training data. Then, we compare two classifiers, namely Localized
Generalized Matrix Learning Vector Quantization (LGMLVQ) and Random Forest (RF). Both methods
are able to identify UCDs/GCs with a precision and a recall of >93 percent and provide relevances
that reflect the importance of each feature dimension %(colors and angular sizes) for the classification.
Both methods detect angular sizes as important markers for this classification problem. While
it is astronomical expectation that color indices of u-i and i-Ks are the most important colors,
our analysis shows that colors such as g-r are more informative, potentially because of higher signal-to-noise
ratio. Besides the excellent performance the LGMLVQ method allows further interpretability by
providing the feature importance for each individual class, class-wise representative samples
and the possibility for non-linear visualization of the data as demonstrated in this contribution.
We conclude that employing machine learning techniques to identify UCDs/GCs can lead to promising
results.

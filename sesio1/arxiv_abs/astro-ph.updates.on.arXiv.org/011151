The improvements in the precision of the published data in \textit{Gaia} EDR3 with respect to \textit{Gaia}
DR2, particularly for parallaxes and proper motions, offer the opportunity to increase the number
of known open clusters in the Milky Way by detecting farther and fainter objects that have so far go
unnoticed. Our aim is to keep completing the open cluster census in the Milky Way with the detection
of new stellar groups in the Galactic disc. We use \textit{Gaia} EDR3 up to magnitude $G = 18$ mag,
increasing in one unit the magnitude limit and therefore the search volume explored in our previous
studies. We use the \texttt{OCfinder} method to search for new open clusters in \textit{Gaia} EDR3
using a Big Data environment. As a first step, \texttt{OCfinder} identifies stellar statistical
overdensities in the five dimensional astrometric space (position, parallax and proper motions)
using the \texttt{DBSCAN} clustering algorithm. Then, these overdensities are classified into
random statistical overdensities or real physical open clusters using a deep artificial neural
network trained on well-characterised $G$, $G_{\rm BP} - G_{\rm RP}$ colour-magnitude diagrams.
We report the discovery of $664$ new open clusters within the Galactic disc, most of them located
beyond $1$ kpc from the Sun. From the estimation of ages, distances and line-of-sight extinctions
of these open clusters, we see that young clusters align following the Galactic spiral arms while
older ones are dispersed in the Galactic disc. Furthermore, we find that most open clusters are located
at low Galactic altitudes with the exception of a few groups older than $1$ Gyr. We show the success
of the \texttt{OCfinder} method leading to the discovery of a total of $1\,310$ open clusters (joining
the discoveries here with the previous ones based on \textit{Gaia} DR2)[abridged]

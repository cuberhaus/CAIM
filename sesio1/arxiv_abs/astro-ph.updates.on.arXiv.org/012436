(Abridged) Context: In the previous paper in this series, we identified that a pentagonal arrangement
of five telescopes, using a kernel-nulling beam combiner, shows notable advantages for some important
performance metrics for a space-based mid-infrared nulling interferometer over several other
considered configurations for the detection of Earth-like exoplanets around solar-type stars.
Aims: We aim to produce a practical implementation of a kernel-nulling beam combiner for such a configuration,
as well as a discussion of systematic and stochastic errors associated with the instrument. Methods:
We develop the mathematical framework around a beam-combiner based on a nulling combiner first
suggested by Guyon et al. (2013), and then use it along with the simulator developed in the previous
paper to identify the effects of systematic uncertainties. Results: We find that errors in the beam
combiner optics, systematic phase errors and the RMS fringe tracking errors result in instrument
limited performance at $\sim$4-7 $\mu$m, and zodiacal limited at $\gtrsim$10 $\mu$m. Assuming
a beam splitter reflectance error of $|\Delta R| = 5\%$ and phase shift error of $\Delta\phi = 3$ degrees,
we find that the fringe tracking RMS should be kept to less than 3 nm in order to be photon limited, and
the systematic piston error be less than 0.5 nm to be appropriately sensitive to planets with a contrast
of 1$\times 10^{-7}$ over a 4-19 $\mu$m bandpass. We also identify that the beam combiner design,
with the inclusion of a well positioned shutter, provides an ability to produce robust kernel observables
even if one or two collecting telescopes were to fail. The resulting four telescope combiner, when
put into an X-array formation, results in a transmission map with an relative SNR equivalent to 80%
of the fully functioning X-array combiner.

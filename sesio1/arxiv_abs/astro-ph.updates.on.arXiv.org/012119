In order to understand the evolution and feedback of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and star formation
it is important to use molecular lines as probes of physical conditions and chemistry. We use H$_{2}$S
to investigate the impact of starburst and AGN activity on the chemistry of the molecular interstellar
medium in luminous infrared galaxies. Using the APEX single dish telescope, we have observed the
$1_{10}$--$1_{01}$ transition of ortho-H$_{2}$S at 168 GHz towards the centres of twelve nearby
luminous infrared galaxies. We have also observed the same line towards the ultra luminous infrared
galaxy (ULIRG) Mrk~231 with the NOEMA interferometer. We have detected H$_{2}$S towards NGC~253,
NGC~1068, NGC~3256, NGC~4418, NGC~4826, NGC~4945, Circinus, M~83 and Mrk~231. Four galaxies
show elevated H$_{2}$S emission relative to HCN. We suggest that the high line ratios are caused
by elevated H$_{2}$S abundances in the dense gas. However, we do not find any clear connection between
the H$_{2}$S/HCN line intensity ratio, and the presence (or speed) of molecular outflows in the
sample galaxies. Therefore H$_{2}$S abundances do not seem to be globally affected by the large-scale
outflows. We discuss possible mechanisms behind the suggested H$_{2}$S abundance enhancements
in NGC~4418, Circinus, NGC~3256 and NGC~4826. These include radiative processes (for example
X-rays or cosmic-rays) or smaller scale shocks. We suggest that $L_{\mathrm{H_{2}S}}$ serves
as a tracer of the dense gas content, similar to $L_{\mathrm{HCN}}$, and that the correlation between
$L_{\mathrm{H_{2}S}}$ and $M_{\rm outflow}$(H$_2$) implies a relation between the dense gas
reservoir and the properties and evolution of the molecular feedback. This potential link requires
further study since it holds important keys to our understanding of how the properties of molecular
outflows relate to that of their host galaxies.

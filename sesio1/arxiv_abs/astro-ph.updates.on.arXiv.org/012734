Theory suggests that mergers play an important role in shaping galactic disks and stellar haloes,
which was observationally confirmed in the MW thanks to the Gaia data. In this work, aiming to probe
the contribution of mergers to the in-situ stellar halo formation, we analyze six M31/MW analogues
from the HESTIA suite of cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations of the Local Group. We
found that all the HESTIA galaxies experience from 1 to 4 mergers with stellar mass ratios between
0.2 and 1 relative to the host at the time of the merger. These significant mergers, with a single exception,
happened 7-11 Gyr ago. The overall impact of the most massive mergers in HESTIA is clearly seen as
a sharp increase of the orbital eccentricity (and a corresponding decrease of the Vphi) of preexisting
disc stars of the main progenitor, thus reproducing well the Splash/Plume-like feature discovered
in the MW. We do find a correlation between mergers/close pericentric passages of massive satellites
and bursts of the star formation in the in-situ component. Massive mergers sharply increase the
disc velocity dispersion of the in-situ stars, however, the latest significant merger often heats
up the disk up to the numbers when the contribution of the previous ones is less prominent in the age-velocity
dispersion relation. In the HESTIA galaxies, the in-situ halo is an important component of the inner
stellar halo where its fraction is about 30-40%, while in the outer parts it typically does not exceed
~5% beyond 15 kpc. The simulations suggest that this component of the stellar haloes continues to
grow well after mergers conclude; however, the most significant contribution comes from stars
formed recently before the merger. The orbital analysis of the HESTIA galaxies suggests that wedges
in Rmax-Zmax space are mainly populated by the stars born in between significant mergers.

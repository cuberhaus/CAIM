Context: In an accompanying paper by L\"ovdal et al, we presented a data-driven method for clustering
in Integrals of Motion space and applied it to a large sample of nearby halo stars with 6D phase-space
information. Aims: Our goal is to establish the reality of the clusters and groups through a combined
study of their stellar populations to gain insights into the accretion history of the Milky Way.
Methods: We develop a procedure that quantifies the similarity of clusters based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test using their metallicity distribution functions, and an isochrone fitting method to determine
their average age, which is also used to compare the distribution of stars in the Colour-Absolute
magnitude diagram. Considering their distributions in Integrals of Motion space as well, this
allows us to group clusters into substructures, and to compare substructures with one another.
Results: We find that the 67 clusters identified by our algorithm can be merged into 12 extended substructures,
while eight small clusters remain as such. The large substructures include the previously known
Gaia-Enceladus, Helmi streams, Sequoia, and Thamnos 1 and 2. We identify a few overdensities that
can be associated with the hot thick disc and which host a small metal-poor population. Especially
notable is the largest substructure in our sample which, although peaking at the metallicity characteristic
of the thick disk has a very well populated metal-poor component, and dynamics intermediate between
the hot thick disc and the halo. We also identify additional debris in the region occupied by Sequoia
with clearly distinct kinematics. Although only a small subset of the stars in our sample have chemical
abundance information, we are able to identify different trends of [Mg/Fe] vs [Fe/H] for the various
substructures confirming our dissection of the nearby halo. Conclusions: We find... [abridged

We aim to study the dynamics of tidally induced spiral arms in our Galaxy disc in the context of the
different encounters with Sagittarius. We build toy models of the interaction between a host and
a satellite galaxy using orbital integrations after a tidal distant encounter. We derive analytically
the shape of the structures seen in phase space as a function of time for simple power-law potentials.
We compare these models to a more realistic N-body simulation and to real data. As previously found,
an impulsive distant tidal approach of a satellite leads to 2-armed spiral structure, made of orbits
in between their apocentres and pericentres, thus, corresponding to regions with negative average
galactocentric radial velocity. The 2-arm pattern rotates at an angular speed of $\Omega-1/2\kappa$
which depends on Galactocentric radius, thus causing a wind-up with time. This winding produces
ridges in the $R$-$V_\phi$ projection with alternating signs of $V_R$ and oscillations of $V_R$
in the $L_Z$-$\phi$ space, like those in the Gaia data. The frequency of these kinematic features
increases with time, offering a powerful means to infer the potential and the perturbation's onset
time and azimuthal phase. Fourier analysis allows to date the impact times of simple models and even
to date perturbations from various pericentric passages. For the MW, the Fourier analysis indicates
a superposition of two frequencies, confirming previous studies. Assuming that both are due to
impulsive distant pericentre passages, we find perturbation times <0.4 Gyr and in the range of 0.7-1.8
Gyr. The latter is compatible with a previous pericentre of Sagittarius and would be associated
to about 4 wraps of the spiral arms in the observed radial range. Further work on the self-gravitating
response of galactic discs and possible degeneracies with secular processes induced by the bar
is necessary. (abridged)

We present one of the very first extensive classifications of a large sample of molecular clouds
based on their morphology. This is achieved using a recently published catalogue of 10663 clouds
obtained from the first data release of the SEDIGISM survey. The clouds are classified into four
different morphologies by visual inspection and using an automated algorithm -- J plots. The visual
inspection also serves as a test for the J plots algorithm, as this is the first time it has been used
on molecular gas. Generally, it has been found that the structure of molecular clouds is highly filamentary
and our observations indeed verify that most of our molecular clouds are elongated structures.
Based on our visual classification of the 10663 SEDIGISM clouds, 15% are ring-like, 57% are elongated,
15% are concentrated and 10% are clumpy clouds. The remaining clouds do not belong to any of these
morphology classes and are termed unclassified. We compare the SEDIGISM molecular clouds with
structures identified through other surveys, i.e. ATLASGAL elongated structures and the bubbles
from Milky Way Project (MWP). We find that many of the ATLASGAL and MWP structures are velocity coherent.
ATLASGAL elongated structures overlap with ~ 21% of the SEDIGISM elongated structures (elongated
and clumpy clouds) and MWP bubbles overlap with ~ 25% of the SEDIGISM ring-like clouds. We also analyse
the star-formation associated with different cloud morphologies using two different techniques.
The first technique examines star formation efficiency (SFE) and the dense gas fraction (DGF),
based on SEDIGISM clouds and ATLASGAL clumps data. The second technique uses the high-mass star
formation (HMSF) threshold for molecular clouds. The results indicate that clouds with ring-like
and clumpy morphologies show a higher degree of star formation.

We analyse the phase shifts of standing, slow magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves in solar coronal
loops using a linear MHD model taking into account the role of thermal conductivity, compressive
viscosity, radiative losses, and heating-cooling misbalance. We estimate the phase shifts in
time and space of density and temperature perturbations with respect to velocity perturbations
and also calculate the phase difference between density and temperature perturbations. The overall
significance of compressive viscosity is found to be negligible for most of the loops considered
in the study. For loops with high background density and/or low background temperature, the role
of radiative losses (with heating-cooling misbalance) is found to be more significant. Also the
effect of heating-cooling misbalance with a temperature- and density-dependent heating function
is found to be more significant in the case of longer loop lengths ($L=500$\, Mm). We derived a general
expression for the polytropic index [$\gamma_{\rm eff}$] and found that under linear MHD the effect
of compressive viscosity on polytropic index is negligible. The radiative losses with constant
heating lead to a monotonic increase of $\gamma_{\rm eff}$ with increasing density whereas the
consideration of an assumed heating function [$H(\rho,T) \propto \rho^{a}T^{b}$, where $a=-0.5$
and $b=-3$] makes the $\gamma_{\rm eff}$ peak at a certain loop density. We also explored the role
of different heating functions by varying the free parameters $a$ and $b$ for a fixed loop of $\rho_0
= 10^{-11}$\, kg $\text{m}^{-3}$, $T_0 = 6.3$\, MK and loop length $L= 180$\, Mm. We find that the
consideration of different heating functions [$H(\rho,T)$] leads to a significant variation
in the phase difference between density and temperature perturbations; however, the polytropic
index remains close to a value of 1.66.

We present a comprehensive optical and near-infrared census of the fields of 90 short gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs) discovered in 2005-2021, constituting all short GRBs for which host galaxy associations
are feasible ($\approx$ 60% of the total Swift short GRB population). We contribute 245 new multi-band
imaging observations across 49 distinct GRBs and 25 spectra of their host galaxies. Supplemented
by literature and archival survey data, the catalog contains 335 photometric and 40 spectroscopic
data sets. The photometric catalog reaches $3\sigma$ depths of $\gtrsim 24-27$ mag and $\gtrsim
23-26$ mag for the optical and near-infrared bands, respectively. We identify host galaxies for
84 bursts, in which the most robust associations make up 54% (49/90) of events, while only a small
fraction, 6.7%, have inconclusive host associations. Based on new spectroscopy, we determine
17 host spectroscopic redshifts with a range of $z\approx 0.15-1.6$ and find that $\approx$ 25-44%
of Swift short GRBs originate from $z>1$. We also present the galactocentric offset catalog for
83 short GRBs. Taking into account the large range of individual measurement uncertainties, we
find a median of projected offset of $\approx 7.9$ kpc, for which the bursts with the most robust associations
have a smaller median of $\approx 4.9$ kpc. Our catalog captures more high-redshift and low-luminosity
hosts, and more highly-offset bursts than previously found, thereby diversifying the population
of known short GRB hosts and properties. In terms of locations and host luminosities, the populations
of short GRBs with and without detectable extended emission are statistically indistinguishable.
This suggests that they arise from the same progenitors, or from multiple progenitors which form
and evolve in similar environments. All of the data products are available on the BRIGHT website.

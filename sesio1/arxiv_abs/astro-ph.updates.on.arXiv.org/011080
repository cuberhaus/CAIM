Coarse objects in chondrites such as chondrules and CAIs are mostly coated with fine-grained rims
(FGRs). FGRs can be formed on the surface of free floating chondrules in a turbulent nebula, where
dust aggregation also occurs. A former study has reported that the morphology of the dust populations
accreting onto chondrules affects the initial structures of FGRs. It was revealed that, if monomer
grains accrete onto chondrules, the smaller grains tend to accumulate near the surface of chondrules,
and FGRs exhibit grain size coarsening from the bottom to the top. However, the study did not consider
the effect of temporal growth of dust aggregates on FGRs formation. In this study, we calculate the
aggregation of polydisperse monomer grains and their accretion onto chondrules. The following
two different stages of dust aggregation can be identified: the monomer-aggregation stage and
the BCCA-like stage. In the monomer-aggregation stage, monomer grains are incorporated into aggregates
when the average aggregate size reaches the size of the monomer. In the BCCA-like stage, aggregates
evolve fractally in a fashion similar to that of single size monomer grains. Based on the results
of the previous study, we obtain the requisite conditions for chondrules to acquire monomer-accreting
FGRs with grain size coarsening observed in some chondrites. In the case of similar size distribution
as that of Inter Stellar Medium (ISM), the maximum grain size of $>$ $1$ $\mu$m is widely ($\alpha$
$<$ $10^{-3}$) required for monomer accretion, while if turbulent intensity in a nebula is extremely
weak ($\alpha$ $<$ $10^{-5}$), a maximum grain size $\sim$ $10$ $\mu$m is required. The monomer
size distributions having larger mass fraction in the large grains compared to ISM might be necessary
for the effective grain size coarsening.

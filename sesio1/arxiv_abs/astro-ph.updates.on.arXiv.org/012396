In this paper, we assess the impact of numerical resolution and of the implementation of energy input
from AGN feedback models on the inner structure of cluster sub-haloes in hydrodynamic simulations.
We compare several zoom-in re-simulations of a sub-sample of the cluster-sized haloes studied
in Meneghetti et al. (2020), obtained by varying mass resolution, softening length and AGN energy
feedback scheme. We study the impact of these different setups on the subhalo abundances, their
radial distribution, their density and mass profiles and the relation between the maximum circular
velocity, which is a proxy for subhalo compactness. Regardless of the adopted numerical resolution
and feedback model, subhaloes with masses Msub < 1e11Msun/h, the most relevant mass-range for galaxy-galaxy
strong lensing, have maximum circular velocities ~30% smaller than those measured from strong
lensing observations of Bergamini et al. (2019). We also find that simulations with less effective
AGN energy feedback produce massive subhaloes (Msub> 1e11 Msun/h ) with higher maximum circular
velocity and that their Vmax - Msub relation approaches the observed one. However the stellar-mass
number count of these objects exceeds the one found in observations and we find that the compactness
of these simulated subhaloes is the result of an extremely over-efficient star formation in their
cores, also leading to larger-than-observed subhalo stellar mass. We conclude that simulations
are unable to simultaneously reproduce the observed stellar masses and compactness (or maximum
circular velocities) of cluster galaxies. Thus, the discrepancy between theory and observations
that emerged from the analysis of Meneghetti et al. (2020) persists. It remains an open question
as to whether such a discrepancy reflects limitations of the current implementation of galaxy formation
models or the LCDM paradigm.

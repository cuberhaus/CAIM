The upcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) promises a generational shift in the study of temperate
mini-Neptune atmospheres using transit spectroscopy. High-altitude clouds however threaten
to impede their atmospheric characterisation by muting spectral features. In this study, we systematically
investigate JWST instrument configurations for characterising cloudy mini-Neptune atmospheres,
assessing the importance of instrument choice and wavelength coverage, focusing on NIRISS and
NIRSpec. We consider two temperate mini-Neptunes orbiting nearby M dwarfs, K2-18 b and TOI-732
c, with equilibrium temperatures below 400 K, as case studies and assess observations using different
instrument configurations with one transit per instrument. We find that their JWST transmission
spectra with modest observing time and adequate wavelength coverage can provide precise abundance
constraints of key molecules H2O, CH4, and NH3 even in the presence of clouds at significantly high
altitudes. The best constraints are obtained by combining all three high-resolution NIRSpec gratings
(G140H+G235H+G395H) that together span the ~1-5 $\mu$m range. Single-transit observations with
this three-instrument configuration allow precise abundance constraints for cloud-top pressures
as low as 3 mbar and 0.1 mbar for K2-18 b and TOI-732 c, respectively, assuming a nominal 10x solar metallicity.
The constraints vary with instrument combinations. We find that NIRSpec G235H+G395H is the optimal
two-instrument configuration, while NIRISS or NIRSpec G235H is optimal for single-instrument
observations. Absent high-altitude clouds, even single-instrument observations can provide
good abundance constraints for these planets. Our findings underscore the promise of JWST transmission
spectroscopy for characterising temperate mini-Neptunes orbiting nearby M dwarfs.

Gravitational microlensing is a powerful tool to probe the inner structure of strongly lensed quasars
and to constrain parameters of the stellar mass function of lens galaxies. This is done by analysing
microlensing light curves between the multiple images of strongly lensed quasars, under the influence
of three main variable components: 1- the continuum flux of the source, 2- microlensing by stars
in the lens galaxy and 3- reverberation of the continuum by the Broad Line Region (BLR). The latter,
ignored by state-of-the-art microlensing techniques, can introduce high-frequency variations
which we show carry information on the BLR size. We present a new method which includes all these components
simultaneously and fits the power spectrum of the data in the Fourier space, rather than the observed
light curve itself. In this new framework, we analyse COSMOGRAIL light curves of the two-image system
QJ0158-4325 known to display high-frequency variations. Using exclusively the low frequency
part of the power spectrum our constraint on the accretion disk radius agrees with the thin disk model
estimate and previous work that fit the microlensing light curves in real space. However, if we also
take into account the high-frequency variations, the data favour significantly smaller disk sizes
than previous microlensing measurements. In this case, our results are in agreement with the thin
disk model prediction only if we assume very low mean masses for the microlens population, i.e. <M>
= 0.01 $M_\odot$. Eventually, including the differentially microlensed continuum reverberation
by the BLR successfully explains the high frequencies without requiring such low mass microlenses.
This allows us to measure, for the first time, the size of the BLR using single-band photometric monitoring,
$R_{BLR}$ = $1.6^{+1.5}_{-0.8}\times 10^{17}$cm, in agreement with estimates using the BLR size-luminosity
relation.

We aim to shed light on the physical properties and kinematics of the molecular material in the nucleus
of one of the closest type 2 active galaxies. To this end, we obtained high angular resolution ALMA
observations of the nucleus of the Circinus galaxy. The observations map the emission at 350GHz
and 690GHz with spatial resolutions of ~3.8pc and ~2.2pc, respectively. The continuum emission
traces cold ($T\lesssim100$K) dust in a circumnuclear disk with spiral arms on scales of 25pc, plus
a marginally resolved nuclear emission peak. The latter is not extended in polar direction as claimed
based on earlier ALMA observations. A significant amount (of the order of 40%) of the 350GHz emission
is not related to dust, but most likely free-free emission instead. We detect CO(3-2) and CO(6-5)
as well as HCO$^+$(4-3), HCN(4-3), and CS(4-3). The CO emission is extended, showing a spiral pattern,
similar to the extended dust emission. Towards the nucleus, CO is excited to higher transitions
and its emission is self-absorbed, leading to an apparent hole in the CO(3-2) but not the CO(6-5)
emission. On the other hand, the high gas density tracers HCO$^+$, HCN, and CS show a strong, yet unresolved
(($\lesssim4$pc) concentration of the emission at the nucleus, pointing at a very small 'torus'.
The kinematics are dominated by rotation and point at a geometrically thin disk down to the resolution
limit of our observations. In contrast to several other AGNs, no HCN enhancement is found towards
the nucleus. The Circinus nucleus is therefore composed of at least two distinct components: (1)
an optically thin, warm outflow of ionised gas containing clouds of dust; and (2) a cold molecular
and dusty disk. These findings support the most recent radiative transfer calculations of the obscuring
structures in AGNs, which find a similar two-component structure. (Abridged)

Observations of the emission of the carbon cycle species (C, C+ CO) are commonly used to diagnose
gas properties in the interstellar medium but are significantly sensitive to the cosmic-ray ionization
rate. The carbon-cycle chemistry is known to be quite sensitive to the cosmic-ray ionization rate,
$\zeta$, controlled by the flux of low-energy cosmic rays which get attenuated through molecular
clouds. However, astrochemical models commonly assume a constant cosmic-ray ionization rate
in the clouds. We investigate the effect of cosmic-ray attenuation on the emission of carbon cycle
species from molecular clouds, in particular the [CII] 158 $\mu$m, [CI] 609 $\mu$m and CO (J = 1 - 0)
115.27 GHz lines. We use a post-processed chemical model of diffuse and dense simulated molecular
clouds and quantify the variation in both column densities and velocity integrated line emission
of the carbon cycle with different cosmic-ray ionization rate models. We find that the abundances
and column densities of carbon cycle species is significantly impacted by the chosen cosmic-ray
ionization rate model: no single constant ionization rate can reproduce the abundances modelled
with an attenuated cosmic-ray model. Further, we show that constant ionization rate models fail
to simultaneously reproduce the integrated emission of the lines we consider, and their deviations
from a physically derived cosmic-ray attenuation model is too complex to be simply corrected. We
demonstrate that the two clouds we model exhibit a similar average $A_{\rm V, eff}$ -- $n_{\rm H}$
relationship, resulting in an average relation between the cosmic-ray ionization rate and density
$\zeta(n_{\rm H})$. We conclude by providing a number of implementation recommendations for CRs
in astrochemical models, but emphasize the necessity for column-dependent cosmic-ray ionization
rate prescriptions.

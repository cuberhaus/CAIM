What determines the nuclear radio emission in local galaxies? We combine optical [O III] line emission,
robust black hole (BH) mass estimates, and high-resolution e-MERLIN 1.5-GHz data, from the LeMMINGs
survey, of a statistically-complete sample of 280 nearby, optically active (LINER and Seyfert)
and inactive HII and Absorption line galaxies [ALG]) galaxies. Using [O III] luminosity ($L_{\rm
[O~III]}$) as a proxy for the accretion power, local galaxies follow distinct sequences in the optical-radio
planes of BH activity, which suggest different origins of the nuclear radio emission for the optical
classes. The 1.5-GHz radio luminosity of their parsec-scale cores ($L_{\rm core}$) is found to
scale with BH mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) and [O~III] luminosity. Below $M_{\rm BH} \sim$10$^{6.5}$ M$_{\odot}$,
stellar processes from non-jetted HII galaxies dominate with $L_{\rm core} \propto M_{\rm BH}^{0.61\pm0.33}$
and $L_{\rm core} \propto L_{\rm [O~III]}^{0.79\pm0.30}$. Above $M_{\rm BH} \sim$10$^{6.5}$
M$_{\odot}$, accretion-driven processes dominate with $L_{\rm core} \propto M_{\rm BH}^{1.5-1.65}$
and $L_{\rm core} \propto L_{\rm [O~III]}^{0.99-1.31}$ for active galaxies: radio-quiet/loud
LINERs, Seyferts and jetted HII galaxies always display (although low) signatures of radio-emitting
BH activity, with $L_{\rm 1.5\, GHz}\gtrsim$10$^{19.8}$ W Hz$^{-1}$ and $M_{\rm BH}\gtrsim10^{7}$
M$_{\odot}$, on a broad range of Eddington-scaled accretion rates ($\dot{m}$). Radio-quiet and
radio-loud LINERs are powered by low-$\dot{m}$ discs launching sub-relativistic and relativistic
jets, respectively. Low-power slow jets and disc/corona winds from moderately high to high-$\dot{m}$
discs account for the compact and edge-brightened jets of Seyferts, respectively. Jetted HII galaxies
may host weakly active BHs. Fuel-starved BHs and recurrent activity account for ALG properties.

Line intensity mapping (LIM) is an emerging technique with a unique potential to probe a wide range
of scales and redshifts. Realizing the full potential of LIM, however, relies on accurate modeling
of the signal. We introduce an extended halo model for the power spectrum of intensity fluctuations
of CO rotational lines and [CII] fine transition line in real space, modeling nonlinearities in
matter fluctuations and biasing relation between the line intensity fluctuations and the underlying
dark matter distribution. We also compute the stochastic contributions beyond the Poisson approximation
using the halo model framework. To establish the accuracy of the model, we create the first cosmological-scale
simulations of CO and [CII] intensity maps, \textsf{MithraLIMSims}, at redshifts $0.5 \leq z\leq6$,
using halo catalogs from Hidden-Valley simulations, and painting halos according to mass-redshift-luminosity
relations for each line. We show that at $z=1$ on scales $k_{\rm max} \lesssim 0.8 \ {\rm Mpc}^{-1}h$,
the model predictions of clustering power (with only two free parameters) are in agreement with
the measured power spectrum at better than 5\%. At higher redshift of $z=4.5$, this remarkable agreement
extends to smaller scale of $ k_{\rm max} \lesssim 2 \ {\rm Mpc}^{-1}h$. Furthermore, we show that
on large scales, the stochastic contributions to CO and CII power spectra are non-Poissonian, with
amplitudes reproduced reasonably well by the halo model prescription. Lastly, we assess the performance
of the theoretical model of the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and show that hypothetical LIM
surveys probing CO lines at $z=1$, that can be deployed within this decade, will be able to make a high
significance measurement of the BAO. On a longer time scale, a space-based mission probing [CII]
line can uniquely measure the BAO on a wide range of redshifts at an unprecedented precision.

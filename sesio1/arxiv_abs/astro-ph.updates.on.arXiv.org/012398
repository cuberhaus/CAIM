Ultra-high angular resolution in astronomy has always been an important vehicle for making fundamental
discoveries. Recent results in direct imaging of the vicinity of the supermassive black hole in
the nucleus of the radio galaxy M87 by the millimeter VLBI system Event Horizon Telescope and various
pioneering results of the Space VLBI mission RadioAstron provided new momentum in high angular
resolution astrophysics. In both mentioned cases, the angular resolution reached the values of
about 10-20 microrcseconds. Further developments toward at least an order of magnitude "sharper"
values are dictated by the needs of astrophysical studies and can only be achieved by placing millimeter
and submillimeter wavelength interferometric systems in space. A concept of such the system, called
Terahertz Exploration and Zooming-in for Astrophysics (THEZA), has been proposed in the framework
of the ESA Call for White Papers for the Voayage 2050 long term plan in 2019. In the current paper we
discuss several approaches for addressing technological challenges of the THEZA concept. In particular,
we consider a novel configuration of a space-borne millimeter/sub-millimeter antenna which might
resolve several bottlenecks in creating large precise mechanical structures. The paper also presents
an overview of prospective space-qualified technologies of low-noise analogue front-end instrumentation
for millimeter/sub-millimeter telescopes, data handling and processing. The paper briefly discusses
approaches to the interferometric baseline state vector determination and synchronisation and
heterodyning system. In combination with the original ESA Voyage 2050 White Paper, the current
work sharpens the case for the next generation microarcsceond-level imaging instruments and provides
starting points for further in-depth technology trade-off studies.

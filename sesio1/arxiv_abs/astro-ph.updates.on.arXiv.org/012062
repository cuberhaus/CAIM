The study of MHD waves is important both for understanding heating in the solar atmosphere and for
solar atmospheric seismology. The analytical investigation of wave mode properties in a cylinder
is of particular interest in this domain, as many atmospheric structures can be modeled as such in
a first approximation. We use linearized ideal MHD to study quasimodes (global modes that are damped
through resonant absorption) with a frequency in the cusp continuum, in a straight cylinder with
a circular base and an inhomogeneous layer at its boundary which separates two homogeneous plasma
regions inside and outside. We are in particular interested in the damping of these modes, and shall
hence try to determine their frequency as a function of background parameters. After linearizing
the ideal MHD equations, we find solutions to the second-order differential equation for the perturbed
total pressure in the inhomogeneous layer in the form of Frobenius series around the regular singular
points that are the Alfv\'en and cusp resonant positions, as well as power series around regular
points. By connecting these solutions appropriately through the inhomogeneous layer and with
the solutions of the homogeneous regions inside and outside the cylinder, we derive a dispersion
relation for the frequency of the eigenmodes of the system. From the dispersion relation, it is also
possible to find the frequency of quasimodes even though they are not eigenmodes. As an example,
we find the frequency of the slow surface sausage quasimode as a function of the inhomogeneous layer's
width, for values of the longitudinal wavenumber relevant for photospheric conditions. The results
were found to match well the results found in another paper which studied the resistive slow surface
sausage eigenmode. We also discuss the perturbation profiles of the quasimode and the eigenfunctions
of continuum modes.

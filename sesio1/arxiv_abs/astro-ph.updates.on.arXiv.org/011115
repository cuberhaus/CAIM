Stellar activity limits the radial velocity search and characterisation of exoplanets, as it introduces
spurious jitter in the data sets and prevents the correct retrieval of a planetary signal. This is
key for M dwarfs, considering that they manifest high activity levels and are primary targets for
present and future searches of habitable Earth-like planets. Effective filtering of activity
is crucial to achieve the sensitivity required for small planet detections. Here, we analyse the
impact of selecting different line lists for least-squares deconvolution on the dispersion in
our RV data sets, to identify the line list that most effectively reduces the jitter. We employ optical
observations of the active M dwarf EV Lac collected with ESPaDOnS and NARVAL, and study two line selection
approaches: a parametric one based on line properties and a randomised algorithm that samples the
line combination space. We test the latter further to find the line list that singles out the activity
signal from other sources of noise, and on AD Leo and DS Leo to examine its consistency at mitigating
jitter for different activity levels. The analysis is complemented with planetary injection tests.
The parametric selection yields a RV RMS reduction of less than 10%, while the randomised selection
a systematic >50% improvement, regardless of the activity level of the star examined. Furthermore,
if activity is the dominant source of noise, this approach allows the construction of lists containing
mainly activity-sensitive lines, which could be used to enhance the rotational modulation of the
resulting data sets and determine the stellar rotation period more robustly. Finally, the output
line lists allow the recovery of a synthetic planet (0.3-0.6 MJup on a 10 d orbit) in the presence of
both moderate (20 m/s semi-amplitude) and high (200 m/s) activity levels, without affecting the
planet signal substantially.

How filaments form and erupt are topics about which solar researchers have wondered since more than
a century and that are still open to debate. We present observations of a filament formation, its
failed eruption, and the associated flare (SOL2019-05-09T05:51) that occurred in active region
(AR) 12740 using data from SDO, STEREO-A, IRIS, and NSO/GONG. AR 12740 was a decaying region formed
by a very disperse following polarity and a strong leading spot, surrounded by a highly dynamic zone
where moving magnetic features (MMFs) were seen constantly diverging from the spot. Our analysis
indicates that the filament was formed by the convergence of fibrils at a location where magnetic
flux cancellation was observed. Furthermore, we conclude that its destabilization was also related
to flux cancellation associated to the constant shuffling of the MMFs. A two-ribbon flare occurred
associated to the filament eruption; however, because the large-scale magnetic configuration
of the AR was quadrupolar, two additional flare ribbons developed far from the two main ones. We model
the magnetic configuration of the AR using a force-free field approach at the AR scale size. This
local model is complemented by a global potential-field source-surface one. Based on the local
model, we propose a scenario in which the filament failed eruption and flare are due to two reconnection
processes, one occurring below the erupting filament, leading to the two-ribbon flare, and another
one above it between the filament flux-rope configuration and the large-scale closed loops. Our
computation of the reconnected magnetic flux added to the erupting flux rope, compared to that of
the large-scale field overlying it, lets us conclude that the latter was large enough to prevent
the filament eruption. A similar conjecture can be drawn from the computation of the magnetic tension
derived from the global field model.

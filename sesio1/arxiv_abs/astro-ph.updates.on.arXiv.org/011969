Despite the prevalence of transient-searching facilities operating across most wavelengths,
the ultraviolet (UV) transient sky remains to be systematically studied. We have recently initiated
the Transient Ultraviolet Objects (TUVO) project, with which we search for serendipitous UV transients
in data from currently available UV instruments, with a focus on the UV/Optical (UVOT) telescope
aboard the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (an overview of the TUVO project is described in a companion
paper). Here we describe TUVOpipe, the pipeline we constructed in order to find such transients
in the UVOT data, using difference image analysis. The pipeline is run daily on all new public UVOT
data (which are available 6-8 hours after the observations are performed), so we discover transients
in near real-time. This allows for follow-up observations to be performed. From October 1, 2020,
to the time of submission, we have processed 111,330 individual UVOT images and we currently detect
an average rate of ~100 transient candidates per day. Of these daily candidates, on average ~30 are
real transients, separated by human vetting from the remaining `bogus' transients which were not
discarded automatically within the pipeline. Most of the real transients we detect are known variable
stars, though we also detect many known active galactic nuclei and accreting white dwarfs. TUVOpipe
can additionally run in archival mode, whereby all archival UVOT data of a given field is scoured
for `historical' transients; in this mode we also mostly find variable stars. However, some of the
transients we find (in particular in the real-time mode) represent previously unreported new transients,
or undiscovered outbursts of known transients, predominantly outbursts from cataclysmic variables.
In this paper we describe the operation of (both modes of) TUVOpipe and some of the initial results
we have so far obtained.

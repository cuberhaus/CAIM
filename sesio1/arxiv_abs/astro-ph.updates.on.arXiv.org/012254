The p-process nucleosynthesis can explain proton-rich isotopes that are heavier than iron, which
are observed in the Solar System, but discrepancies still persist and important questions concerning
the astrophysical site(s) of the p-process remain unanswered. We investigate how the p-process
operates in exploding rotating massive stars that have experienced an enhanced s-process nucleosynthesis
during their life through rotational mixing. We computed 25 $M_{\odot}$ stellar models at a metallicity
of $Z=10^{-3}$ with different initial rotation velocities and rates for the uncertain $^{17}$O($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^{21}$Ne
reaction. The nucleosynthesis calculation, followed with a network of 737 isotopes, was coupled
to stellar evolution, and the p-process nucleosynthesis was calculated in post-processing during
both the final evolutionary stages and spherical explosions of various energies. In our models,
the p-nuclides are mainly synthesized during the explosion, but not much during the ultimate hydrostatic
burning stages. The p-process yields mostly depend on the initial number of trans-iron seeds, which
in turn depend on the initial rotation. We found that the impact of rotation on the p-process is comparable
to the impact of rotation on the s-process. From no to fast rotation, the s-process yields of nuclides
with mass number $A<140$ increase by $3-4$ dex, and so do the p-process yields. Fast rotation with
a lower $^{17}$O($\alpha,\gamma$) rate significantly produces s- and p-nuclides with $A\geq140$.
Our results suggest that the contribution of core-collapse supernovae from massive stars to the
solar (and Galactic) p-nuclei has been underestimated in the past, and more specifically, that
the contribution from massive stars with sub-solar metallicities may even dominate. A more detailed
study including stellar models with a wide range of masses and metallicities remains to be performed.

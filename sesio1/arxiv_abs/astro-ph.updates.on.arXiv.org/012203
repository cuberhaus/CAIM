The classification of the minor bodies of the Solar System based on observables has been continuously
developed and iterated over the past 40 years. While prior iterations followed either the availability
of large observational campaigns or new instrumental capabilities opening novel observational
dimensions, we see the opportunity to improve primarily upon the established methodology. We develop
an iteration of the asteroid taxonomy which allows for classification of partial and complete observations,
i.e. visible, near-infrared, and visible-near-infrared spectrometry, and which re-introduces
the visual albedo into the classification observables. The resulting class assignments are given
probabilistically, enabling to quantify the uncertainty of a classification. We build the taxonomy
based on 2983 observations of 2125 unique asteroids, representing an almost tenfold increase of
sample size compared with the previous taxonomy. The asteroid classes are identified in a lower-dimensional
representation of the observations using a Mixture of Common Factor Analyzers model. We identify
17 classes split into the three complexes C, M, and S, including the novel Z-class for extremely-red
objects in the Main Belt. The visual albedo information resolves the spectral degeneracy of the
X-complex and establishes the P-class as part of the C-complex. We present a classification tool
which computes probabilistic class assignments within this taxonomic scheme from asteroid observations,
intrinsically accounting for degeneracies between classes based on the observed wavelength region.
The ability to classify partial observations and the re-introduction of the visual albedo into
the classification provide a taxonomy which is well suited for the current and future datasets of
asteroid observations, in particular provided by Gaia, the MITHNEOS-, and the SPHEREx surveys.

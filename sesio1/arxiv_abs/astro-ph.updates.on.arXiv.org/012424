We consider a cosmological model of non-minimal derivative coupling (NMDC) to gravity with holographic
effect from Bekenstein-Hawking entropy using Hubble horizon IR cutoff. Holographic parameter
$c$ is constant in a range, $0 \leq c < 1$. NMDC effect allows gravitational constant to be time-varying.
Definition of holographic density include time-varying part of the gravitational constant. NMDC
part reduces strength of gravitational constant for $\k > 0$ and opposite for $\k < 0$. The holographic
part enhances gravitational strength. We use spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio to test
the model against CMB constraint. Number of e-folding is chosen to be $N \geq 60$. Potentials, $V
= V_0 \phi^n $ with $n = 2, 4$, and $V = V_0 \exp{(-\beta \phi)}$ are considered. Combined parametric
plots of $\k$ and $\phi$ show that the allowed regions of the power spectrum index and of the tensor-to-scalar
ratio are not overlapping. NMDC inflation is ruled out and the holographic NMDC inflation is also
ruled out for $0 < c < 1$. NMDC significantly changes major anatomy of the dynamics, i.e. it gives new
late-time attractor trajectories in acceleration regions. The holographic part clearly affects
pattern of trajectories. However, for the holographic part to affect shape of the acceleration
region, the NMDC field must be in presence. To constrain the model at late time, variation of gravitational
constant is considered. Gravitational-wave standard sirens and supernovae data give a constraint,
$\dot{G}/G|_{t_0} \lesssim 3\times10^{-12} \, \text{year}^{-1}$ \cite{Zhao:2018gwk} which,
for this model, results in $ 10^{-12} \, \text{year}^{-1} \, \gtrsim \, {- \kappa} \dot{\phi}\ddot{\phi}/{M^2_{\p}}\,.
$ Positive $\k$ is favored and greater $c^2$ results in lifting up lower bound of $\k$.

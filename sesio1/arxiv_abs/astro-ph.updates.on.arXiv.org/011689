The stochastic order redshift technique (SORT) is a simple, efficient, and robust method to improve
cosmological redshift measurements. The method relies upon having a small ($\sim$10 per cent)
reference sample of high-quality redshifts. Within pencil-beam-like sub-volumes surrounding
each galaxy, we use the precise dN/d$z$ distribution of the reference sample to recover new redshifts
and assign them one-to-one to galaxies such that the original rank order of redshifts is preserved.
Preserving the rank order is motivated by the fact that random variables drawn from Gaussian probability
density functions with different means but equal standard deviations satisfy stochastic ordering.
The process is repeated for sub-volumes surrounding each galaxy in the survey. This results in every
galaxy with an uncertain redshift being assigned multiple "recovered" redshifts from which a new
redshift estimate can be determined. An earlier paper applied SORT to a mock Sloan Digital Sky Survey
at $z \lesssim$ 0.2 and accurately recovered the two-point correlation function on scales $\gtrsim$4
$h^{-1}$Mpc. In this paper, we test the performance of SORT in surveys spanning the redshift range
0.75$<z<$2.25. We used two mock surveys extracted from the Small MultiDark-Planck and Bolshoi-Planck
N-body simulations with dark matter haloes that were populated by the Santa Cruz semi-analytic
model. We find that SORT is able to improve redshift estimates and recover distinctive large-scale
features of the cosmic web. Further, it provides unbiased estimates of the redshift-space two-point
correlation function $\xi(s)$ on scales $\gtrsim$2.5 $h^{-1}$Mpc, as well as local densities
in regions of average or higher density. This may allow improved understanding of how galaxy properties
relate to their local environments.

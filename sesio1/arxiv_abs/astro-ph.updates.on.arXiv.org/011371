Context: Sequoia is a retrograde kinematic substructures in the nearby Galactic halo, whose properties
are a matter of debate. For example, previous studies do not necessarily agree on the chemical abundances
of Sequoia stars, which are important for understanding its nature. Aim: We characterize the chemical
properties of a sample of stars from Sequoia by determining high-precision abundances. Methods:
We measure abundances of Na, Mg, Si, Ti, Cr, Mn, Ni, Zn, Y, and Ba from a differential abundance analysis
on high signal-to-noise ratio, high-resolution spectra from new observations and from archival
data. We compare precisely-measured chemical abundances of 12 Sequoia candidates with those of
typical halo stars from literature, which include also stars from Gaia-Enceladus. This allows
us to characterize Sequoia and compare it to another Galactic building block. The comparison is
made after putting all the abundances onto the same scale using standard stars. Results: There are
significant difference in [Na/Fe], [Mg/Fe], [Ca/Fe], [Ti/Fe], [Zn/Fe], and [Y/Fe] between Sequoia
and Gaia-Enceladus stars at $-1.8\lesssim [\mathrm{Fe/H}]\lesssim -1.4$ in the sense that these
abundance ratios are lower in Sequoia. These differences are similar to those seen between Gaia-Enceladus
and in-situ stars at higher metallicity, suggesting that Sequoia is affected by type~Ia supernovae
at lower metallicity than Gaia-Enceladus. We also confirm that the low [Mg/Fe] of Sequoia is seen
in literature and in surveys, namely APOGEE DR16 and GALAH DR3, if the stars are kinematically selected
in the same way. Conclusion: Sequoia stars have a distinct chemical abundance pattern and can be
chemically separated from in-situ stars or Gaia-Enceladus stars if abundances are measured with
sufficient precision, namely $\sigma([\mathrm{X/Fe}])\lesssim 0.07\,\mathrm{dex}$.

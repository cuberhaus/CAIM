Galaxies can be characterized by many internal properties such as stellar mass, gas metallicity,
and star-formation rate. We quantify the amount of cosmological and astrophysical information
that the internal properties of individual galaxies and their host dark matter halos contain. We
train neural networks using hundreds of thousands of galaxies from 2,000 state-of-the-art hydrodynamic
simulations with different cosmologies and astrophysical models of the CAMELS project to perform
likelihood-free inference on the value of the cosmological and astrophysical parameters. We find
that knowing the internal properties of a single galaxy allow our models to infer the value of $\Omega_{\rm
m}$, at fixed $\Omega_{\rm b}$, with a $\sim10\%$ precision, while no constraint can be placed on
$\sigma_8$. Our results hold for any type of galaxy, central or satellite, massive or dwarf, at all
considered redshifts, $z\leq3$, and they incorporate uncertainties in astrophysics as modeled
in CAMELS. However, our models are not robust to changes in subgrid physics due to the large intrinsic
differences the two considered models imprint on galaxy properties. We find that the stellar mass,
stellar metallicity, and maximum circular velocity are among the most important galaxy properties
to determine the value of $\Omega_{\rm m}$. We believe that our results can be explained taking into
account that changes in the value of $\Omega_{\rm m}$, or potentially $\Omega_{\rm b}/\Omega_{\rm
m}$, affect the dark matter content of galaxies. That effect leaves a distinct signature in galaxy
properties to the one induced by galactic processes. Our results suggest that the low-dimensional
manifold hosting galaxy properties provides a tight direct link between cosmology and astrophysics.

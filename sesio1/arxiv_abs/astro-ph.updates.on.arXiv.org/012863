Studies on the correlation between different diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) are important
for exploring their origins. However, the Gaia-RVS spectral window between 846 and 870 nm has few
DIBs, the strong DIB at 862 nm being the only convincingly confirmed one. Here we attempt to confirm
the existence of a broad DIB around 864.8 nm and estimate its characteristics using the stacked Gaia-RVS
spectra of a large number of stars. We study the correlations between the two DIBs at 862 nm and 864.8
nm, as well as the interstellar extinction. We obtain spectra of the interstellar medium (ISM) absorption
by subtracting the stellar components using templates constructed from real spectra at high Galactic
latitudes with low extinctions. We then stack the ISM spectra in Galactic coordinates, pixelized
by the HEALPix scheme, to measure the DIBs. The stacked spectrum is modeled by the profiles of the
two DIBs, Gaussian for $\lambda$862 and Lorentzian for $\lambda$864.8, and a linear continuum.
We obtain 8458 stacked spectra in total, of which 1103 (13%) have reliable fitting results after
applying numerous conservative filters. This work is the first one to fit and measure $\lambda$862
and $\lambda$864.8 simultaneously in cool-star spectra. We find that the EWs and CDs of the two DIBs
are well-correlated with each other. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of $\lambda$864.8 is
estimated as $1.62 \pm 0.33$ nm which compares to $0.55 \pm 0.06$ nm for $\lambda$862. We also measure
the vacuum rest-frame wavelength of $\lambda$864.8 to be $\lambda_0 = 864.53 \pm 0.14$ nm, smaller
than previous estimates. We make a solid confirmation of the existence of the DIB around 864.8 nm
by exploring its correlation with $\lambda$862 and estimating its FWHM. $\lambda$862 correlates
better with E(BP-RP) than $\lambda$864.8.

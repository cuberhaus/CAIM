We present $\texttt{matryoshka}$, a suite of neural network based emulators and accompanying
Python package that have been developed with the goal of producing fast and accurate predictions
of the nonlinear galaxy power spectrum. The suite of emulators consists of four linear component
emulators, from which fast linear predictions of the power spectrum can be made, allowing all nonlinearities
to be included in predictions from a nonlinear boost component emulator. The linear component emulators
includes an emulator for the matter transfer function that produces predictions in $\sim 0.0004
\ \mathrm{s}$, with an error of $<0.08\%$ (at $1\sigma$ level) on scales $10^{-4} \ h \ \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}<k<10^1
\ h \ \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. In this paper we demonstrate $\texttt{matryoshka}$ by training the nonlinear
boost component emulator with analytic training data calculated with HALOFIT, that has been designed
to replicate training data that would be generated using numerical simulations. Combining all
the component emulator predictions we achieve an accuracy of $< 0.75\%$ (at $1\sigma$ level) when
predicting the real space nonlinear galaxy power spectrum on scales $0.0025 \ h \ \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}<k<1
\ h \ \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. We use $\texttt{matryoshka}$ to investigate the impact of the analysis
setup on cosmological constraints by conducting several full shape analyses of the real space galaxy
power spectrum. Specifically we investigate the impact of the minimum scale (or $k_\mathrm{max}$),
finding an improvement of $\sim 1.8\times$ in the constraint on $\sigma_8$ by pushing $k_\mathrm{max}$
from $k_\mathrm{max}=0.25 \ h \ \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ to $k_\mathrm{max}=0.85 \ h \ \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$,
highlighting the potential gains when using clustering emulators such as $\texttt{matryoshka}$
in cosmological analyses. $\texttt{matryoshka}$ is publicly available at https://github.com/JDonaldM/Matryoshka.

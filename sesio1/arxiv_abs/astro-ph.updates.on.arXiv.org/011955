XMM-Newton provides unprecedented insight into the X-ray Universe, recording variability information
for hundreds of thousands of sources. Manually searching for interesting patterns in light curves
is impractical, requiring an automated data-mining approach for the characterization of sources.
Straightforward fitting of temporal models to light curves is not a sure way to identify them, especially
with noisy data. We used unsupervised machine learning to distill a large data set of light-curve
parameters, revealing its clustering structure in preparation for anomaly detection and subsequent
searches for specific source behaviors (e.g., flares, eclipses). Self-organizing maps (SOMs)
achieve dimensionality reduction and clustering within a single framework. They are a type of artificial
neural network trained to approximate the data with a two-dimensional grid of discrete interconnected
units, which can later be visualized on the plane. We trained our SOM on temporal-only parameters
computed from more than 100,000 detections from the EXTraS catalog. The resulting map reveals that
about 2500 most variable sources are clustered based on temporal characteristics. We find distinctive
regions of the SOM map associated with flares, eclipses, dips, linear light curves, and others.
Each group contains sources that appear similar by eye. We single out a handful of interesting sources
for further study. The condensed view of our dataset provided by SOMs allowed us to identify groups
of similar sources, speeding up manual characterization by orders of magnitude. Our method also
highlights problems with fitting simple temporal models to light curves and can be used to mitigate
them to an extent. This will be crucial for fully exploiting the high data volume expected from upcoming
X-ray surveys, and may also help with interpreting supervised classification models.

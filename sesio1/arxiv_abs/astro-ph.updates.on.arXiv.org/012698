The next generation of weak lensing surveys will measure the matter distribution of the local Universe
with unprecedented precision. This encourages the use of higher-order mass-map statistics for
cosmological parameter inference. However, the increased quality of the data poses new challenges
for map-based analyses. We extend the methodology introduced in arXiv:2006.12506 to match these
requirements. Using this pipeline, we provide forecasts for the $w$CDM parameter constraints
for stage 3 and stage 4 weak lensing surveys. We consider different survey setups, summary statistics
and mass map filters including Starlets. The impact of baryons on the summary statistics is investigated
and the necessary scale cuts are applied in the forecast. We compare the traditional angular power
spectrum analysis to two extrema count statistics (peak and minima counts) as well as Minkowski
functionals and the Starlet $\ell_1$-norm of the mass maps. In terms of map filters we find a preference
for Starlet over Gaussian filters. Our results further suggest that using a survey setup with 10
instead of 5 tomographic redshift bins is beneficial. The addition of cross-tomographic information
is found to improve the constraints on cosmology and especially on galaxy intrinsic alignment for
all statistics. In terms of constraining power, we find the angular power spectrum and the peak counts
to be equally matched for stage 4 surveys, followed by minima counts, the Minkowski functionals
and then the Starlet $\ell_1$-norm. Combining different summary statistics significantly improves
the constraints and compensates for the constraining power that is lost due to the stringent scale
cuts. We identify the most `cost-effective' combination to be the angular power spectrum, peak
counts and Minkowski functionals following Starlet filtering.

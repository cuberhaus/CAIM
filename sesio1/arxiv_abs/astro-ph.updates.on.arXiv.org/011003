Modern weak-lensing observations are becoming increasingly sensitive to baryonic feedback processes
which are still poorly understood. So far, this new challenge has been faced either by imposing scale-cuts
in the data or by modelling baryonic effects with simple, one-parameter models. In this paper, we
rely on a more general, seven-parameter prescription of baryonic feedback effects, which is primarily
motivated by observations and has been shown to agree with a plethora of hydrodynamical simulations.
By combining weak-lensing data from the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-1000) with observations of gas
around galaxy groups and clusters, we are able to constrain our baryonic model parameters and learn
more about feedback and cosmology. In particular, we use galaxy cluster gas (and stellar) fractions
from a combination of X-ray data as well as stacked gas profiles measured by the Atacama Cosmology
Telescope (ACT) via the kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect to provide evidence for baryonic
feedback that is stronger than predicted by most hydrodynamical simulations. In terms of the baryonic
suppression of the matter power spectrum, we report a beyond-percent effect at wave-modes above
$k\sim 0.1-0.4$ h/Mpc and a maximum suppression of 15-35 percent at $k>5$ h/Mpc (68 percent CL).
Regarding the cosmological clustering strength, parametrised by the combined parameter $\Sigma_8=\sigma_8(\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.58}$,
we find the known tension with the Planck satellite data to be reduced from 3.8 to 3.2 $\sigma$ once
baryonic effects are fully included in the analysis pipeline. The tension is further decreased
to 2.8 $\sigma$ when the weak-lensing data is combined with observations from X-ray and the kSZ effect.
We conclude that, while baryonic feedback effects become more important in modern weak-lensing
surveys, they can be excluded as the primary culprit for the observed $\Sigma_8$-tension.

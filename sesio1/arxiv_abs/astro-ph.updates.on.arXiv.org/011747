We observe and analyse a long-lived corotating interaction region (CIR), originating from a single
coronal hole (CH), recurring in 27 consecutive Carrington rotations 2057-2083 in the time period
from June 2007 - May 2009. We studied the in situ measurements of this long-lived CIR as well as the
corresponding depression in the cosmic ray (CR) count observed by SOHO/EPHIN throughout different
rotations. We performed a statistical analysis, as well as the superposed epoch analysis, using
relative values of the key parameters: the total magnetic field strength, B, the magnetic field
fluctuations, dBrms, plasma flow speed, v, plasma density, n, plasma temperature, T , and the SOHO/EPHIN
F-detector particle count, and CR count. We find that the mirrored CR count-time profile is correlated
with that of the flow speed, ranging from moderate to strong correlation, depending on the rotation.
In addition, we find that the CR count dip amplitude is correlated to the peak in the magnetic field
and flow speed of the CIR. These results are in agreement with previous statistical studies. Finally,
using the superposed epoch analysis, we obtain a generic CIR example, which reflects the in situ
properties of a typical CIR well. Our results are better explained based on the combined convection-diffusion
approach of the CIR-related GCR modulation. Furthermore, qualitatively, our results do not differ
from those based on different CHs samples. This indicates that the change of the physical properties
of the recurring CIR from one rotation to another is not qualitatively different from the change
of the physical properties of CIRs originating from different CHs. Finally, the obtained generic
CIR example, analyzed on the basis of superposed epoch analysis, can be used as a reference for testing
future models.

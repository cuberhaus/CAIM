In the next decade, two rovers will characterize in situ the mineralogy of rocks on Mars, using for
the first time near-infrared reflectance spectrometers: SuperCam onboard the Mars 2020 rover
and MicrOmega onboard the ExoMars rover, although this technique is predominantly used in orbit
for mineralogical investigations. Until successful completion of sample-return missions from
Mars, Martian meteorites are currently the only samples of the red planet available for study in
terrestrial laboratories and comparison with in situ data. However, the current spectral database
available for these samples does not represent their diversity and consists primarily of spectra
acquired on finely crushed samples, albeit grain size is known to greatly affect spectral features.
We measured the reflected light of a broad Martian meteorite suite as a means to catalogue and characterize
their spectra between 0.4 and 3 microns. These measurements are achieved using a point spectrometer
acquiring data comparable to SuperCam, and an imaging spectrometer producing hyperspectral cubes
similarly to MicrOmega. Our results indicate that point spectrometry is sufficient to discriminate
the different Martian meteorites families, to identify their primary petrology based on band parameters,
and to detect their low content in alteration minerals. However, significant spectral mixing occurs
in the point measurements, even at spot sizes down to a few millimeters, and imaging spectroscopy
is needed to correctly identify the various mineral phases in the meteorites. Bidirectional spectral
measurements confirm their non-Lambertian behavior, with backward and suspected forward scattering
peaks. With changing observation geometry, the main absorption strengths show variations up to
10-15 percents. All the spectra presented are provided in the supplementary data for further comparison
with in situ and orbital measurements.

We present a detailed weak-lensing and X-ray study of the Frontier Fields galaxy cluster Abell 370,
one of the most massive known lenses on the sky, using wide-field BRz Subaru/Sprime-Cam and Chandra
X-ray observations. By combining 2D shear and azimuthally averaged magnification constraints
derived from Subaru data, we perform a lensing mass reconstruction in a free-form manner, which
allows us to determine both radial structure and 2D morphology of the cluster mass distribution.
In a triaxial framework assuming an NFW density profile, we constrain the intrinsic structure and
geometry of the cluster halo by forward modeling the reconstructed mass map. We obtain a halo mass
$M_{200}=(1.54 \pm 0.29)\times 10^{15}h^{-1}M_\odot$, a halo concentration $c_{200}=5.27
\pm 1.28$, and a minor-major axis ratio $q_a=0.62 \pm 0.23$ with uninformative priors. Using a prior
on the line-of-sight alignment of the halo major axis derived from binary merger simulations constrained
by multi-probe observations, we find that the data favor a more prolate geometry with lower mass
and lower concentration. From triaxial lens modeling with the line-of-sight prior, we find a spherically
enclosed gas mass fraction of $f_\mathrm{gas}=(8.4 \pm 1.0)\%$ at $0.7h^{-1}$ Mpc. When compared
to the hydrostatic mass estimate from Chandra observations, our triaxial weak-lensing analysis
yields spherically enclosed mass ratios of $1-b=0.56 \pm 0.09$ and $0.51 \pm 0.09$ at $0.7h^{-1}$
Mpc with and without using the line-of-sight prior, respectively. Since the cluster is in a highly
disturbed dynamical state, this represents the likely maximum level of hydrostatic bias in galaxy
clusters. We also obtain a model-independent constraint of $M_\mathrm{2D}(<2.3h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc})=(3.11
\pm 0.47)\times 10^{15}h^{-1}M_\odot$ for the projected mass of the whole system, including any
currently unbound material around the cluster.

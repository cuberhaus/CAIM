The high luminosity displayed by an active galactic nucleus (AGN) requires that gas be transported
to the centre of the galaxy by some mechanism. Bar-driven processes are often pointed out in this
context and a number of studies have addressed the bar-AGN connection, but with conflicting results.
Some of the inconsistencies can be explained by the different spatial- and timescales involved
in bar-driven gas inflows, accretion by the central black hole, and AGN emission. However, the discrepant
results could also be due to sample biases, because both the AGN activity determination and the bar
detection are influenced by the method employed. We revisit the bar-AGN connection in a sample of
galaxies from SDSS, looking for evidence of the influence of bars on AGN activity. We determine AGN
activity by emission line diagnostics and the properties of the bar were previously estimated with
\texttt{BUDDA}, which performs 2D bulge-bar-disk decomposition. Before comparing active and
inactive galaxies, we made a careful selection of the sample to minimise selection biases. We created
control samples by matching them with the AGN sample using propensity score matching. This technique
offers an analytical approach for creating control samples given some object parameters. We find
that AGN are preferentially found in barred galaxies and that the accretion rate is higher in barred
galaxies, but only when different M-$\sigma$ relations are used to estimate the black hole mass
M$_\bullet$ in barred and unbarred galaxies (from the central velocity dispersion $\sigma$).
On the other hand, we find no correlation between activity level and bar strength. Altogether, our
results strengthen theoretical predictions that the bar is an important mechanism in disc galaxies,
creating a gas reservoir to feed AGN, but they also indicate that other mechanisms can play a major
role, particularly at scales <~100 pc.

We measure the clustering of quasars of the final data release (DR16) of eBOSS. The sample contains
$343\,708$ quasars between redshifts $0.8\leq z\leq2.2$ over $4699\,\mathrm{deg}^2$. We calculate
the Legendre multipoles (0,2,4) of the anisotropic power spectrum and perform a BAO and a Full-Shape
(FS) analysis at the effective redshift $z{\rm eff}=1.480$. The errors include systematic errors
that amount to 1/3 of the statistical error. The systematic errors comprise a modelling part studied
using a blind N-Body mock challenge and observational effects studied with approximate mocks to
account for various types of redshift smearing and fibre collisions. For the BAO analysis, we measure
the transverse comoving distance $D_{\rm M}(z_{\rm eff})/r_{\rm drag}=30.60\pm{0.90}$ and
the Hubble distance $D_{\rm H}(z_{\rm eff})/r_{\rm drag}=13.34\pm{0.60}$. This agrees with
the configuration space analysis, and the consensus yields: $D_{\rm M}(z_{\rm eff})/r_{\rm drag}=30.69\pm{0.80}$
and $D_{\rm H}(z_{\rm eff})/r_{\rm drag}=13.26\pm{0.55}$. In the FS analysis, we fit the power
spectrum using a model based on Regularised Perturbation Theory, which includes Redshift Space
Distortions and the Alcock-Paczynski effect. The results are $D_{\rm M}(z_{\rm eff})/r_{\rm
drag}=30.68\pm{0.90}$ and $D_{\rm H}(z_{\rm eff})/r_{\rm drag}=13.52\pm{0.51}$ and we constrain
the linear growth rate of structure $f(z_{\rm eff})\sigma_8(z_{\rm eff})=0.476\pm{0.047}$.
Our results agree with the configuration space analysis. The consensus analysis of the eBOSS quasar
sample yields: $D_{\rm M}(z_{\rm eff})/r_{\rm drag}=30.21\pm{0.79}$, $D_{\rm H}(z_{\rm eff})/r_{\rm
drag}=3.23\pm{0.47}$ and $f(z_{\rm eff})\sigma_8(z_{\rm eff})=0.462\pm{0.045}$ and is consistent
with a flat $\Lambda {\rm CDM}$ cosmological model using Planck results.

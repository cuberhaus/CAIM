Observations of astrophysical transients have brought many novel discoveries and provided new
insights into physical processes at work under extreme conditions in the Universe. Multi-wavelength
and multi-messenger observations of variable objects require dedicated procedures and follow-up
systems capable of digesting and reacting to external alerts to execute coordinated follow-ups.
The main functions of such follow-up systems are the processing, filtering, and ranking of incoming
alerts, the fully automated rapid execution of the observations according to an observation strategy
tailored to the instrument, and real-time data analysis with feedback to the operators and other
instruments. H.E.S.S. has been searching for transient phenomena since its inauguration in 2003.
In this paper, we describe the transients follow-up system of H.E.S.S, which became operational
in 2016. The transients follow-up system allows H.E.S.S. to conduct a more versatile, optimised,
and largely autonomous transient follow-up program, combining all major functionalities in one
systematic approach. We describe the design, central functionalities, and interfaces of the transients
follow-up system in general and its three main components in detail: the Target of Opportunity (ToO)
alert system, the data acquisition and central control system, and the real-time analysis. We highlight
architectural decisions and detailed features that enable fully automatic ToO follow-up and indicate
key performance metrics of the sub-systems. We discuss the system's capabilities and highlight
the need for a fine-tuned interplay of the different sub-systems to react quickly and reliably.
Lessons learnt from the development, integration, and operation of the H.E.S.S. transients follow-up
system are reviewed in light of new and large science infrastructures and associated challenges
in this exciting new era of interoperable astronomy.

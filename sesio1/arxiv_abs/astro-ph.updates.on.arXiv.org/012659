We introduce a suite of cosmological volume simulations to study the evolution of galaxies at high
numerical resolution as part of the Feedback in Realistic Environments project. FIREbox, the principal
simulation of the present suite, provides a representative sample of galaxies (~1000 galaxies
with Mstar > 10^8 Msun at z=0) at a resolution (~ 20 pc, m_b ~ 6x10^4 Msun) comparable to state-of-the-art
galaxy zoom-in simulations. Furthermore, FIREbox captures the multiphase nature of the interstellar
medium in a fully cosmological setting (L=22.1 Mpc) thanks to its exceptionally high dynamic range
(~10^6) and the inclusion of multi-channel stellar feedback. Here, we focus on validating the predictions
of FIREbox by comparing to observational data. We find that, at a given stellar mass (for Mstar < 10^{10.5-11}
Msun), simulated galaxies have star formation rates, atomic and molecular gas masses, gas phase
and stellar metallicities in broad agreement with observations. In addition, FIREbox shows that
these galaxy scaling relations extend to the low mass regime (Mstar ~ 10^7 Msun) and follow a (broken)
power-law relationship. Also reproduced are the evolution of the cosmic HI density and the HI column
density distribution at z~0-5. At low z, FIREbox predicts a peak in the stellar-mass--halo-mass
relation, but also a higher abundance of massive galaxies and a higher cosmic star formation rate
density than observed, showing that stellar feedback alone is insufficient to reproduce the properties
of massive galaxies at late times. Given its high resolution and sample size, FIREbox offers a baseline
prediction of galaxy formation theory in a $\Lambda$CDM Universe while also highlighting modeling
challenges to be addressed in next generation galaxy simulations.

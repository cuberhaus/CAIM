Radio wave scattering can cause severe reductions in detection sensitivity for surveys of Galactic
and extragalactic fast ($\sim$ms duration) transients. While Galactic sources like pulsars undergo
scattering in the Milky Way interstellar medium (ISM), extragalactic fast radio bursts (FRBs)
can also experience scattering in their host galaxies and other galaxies intervening their lines-of-sight.
We assess Galactic and extragalactic scattering horizons for fast radio transients using a combination
of NE2001 to model the dispersion measure (DM) and scattering time ($\tau$) contributed by the Galactic
disk, and independently constructed electron density models for the Galactic halo and other galaxies'
ISMs and halos that account for different galaxy morphologies, masses, densities, and strengths
of turbulence. For source redshifts $0.5\leq z_{\rm s}\leq1$, an all-sky, isotropic FRB population
has simulated values of $\tau(1\rm~GHz)$ ranging from $\sim1~\mu$s to $\sim2$ ms ($90\%$ confidence,
observer frame) that are dominated by host galaxies, although $\tau$ can be $\gg2$ ms at low Galactic
latitudes. A population at $z_{\rm s}=5$ has $0.01\lesssim\tau\lesssim300$ ms at 1 GHz ($90\%$
confidence), dominated by intervening galaxies. About $20\%$ of these high-redshift FRBs are
predicted to have $\tau>5$ ms at 1 GHz (observer frame), and $\gtrsim40\%$ of FRBs between $z_{\rm
s}\sim0.5-5$ have $\tau\gtrsim1$ ms for $\nu\leq 800$ MHz. Our scattering predictions may be conservative
if scattering from circumsource environments is significant, which is possible under specific
conditions. The percentage of FRBs selected against from scattering could also be substantially
larger than we predict if circumgalactic turbulence causes more small-scale ($\ll1$ au) density
fluctuations than observed from nearby halos.

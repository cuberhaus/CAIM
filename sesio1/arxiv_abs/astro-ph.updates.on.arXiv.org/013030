Future actively cooled space-borne observatories for the far-infrared, loosely defined as a 1--10
THz band, can potentially reach a sensitivity limited only by background radiation from the Universe.
This will result in an increase in observing speed of many orders of magnitude. A spectroscopic instrument
on such an observatory requires large arrays of detectors with a sensitivity expressed as a noise
equivalent power NEP = 3 $\times 10^{-20}$ $W\surd{Hz}$. We present the design, fabrication, and
characterisation of microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs) for this frequency range
reaching the required sensitivity. The devices are based on thin-film NbTiN resonators which use
lens-antenna coupling to a submicron-width aluminium transmission line at the shorted end of the
resonator where the radiation is absorbed. We optimised the MKID geometry for a low NEP by using a
small aluminium volume of $\approx$ 1$\mu m^3$ and fabricating the aluminium section on a very thin
(100 nm) SiN membrane. Both methods of optimisation also reduce the effect of excess noise by increasing
the responsivity of the device, which is further increased by reducing the parasitic geometrical
inductance of the resonator. We measure the sensitivity of eight MKIDs with respect to the power
absorbed in the detector using a thermal calibration source filtered in a narrow band around 1.55
THz. We obtain a NEP$_{exp}(P_{abs})\:=\:3.1\pm0.9\times10^{-20}\:W\surd{Hz}$ at a modulation
frequency of 200 Hz averaged over all measured MKIDs. The NEP is limited by quasiparticle trapping.
The measured sensitivity is sufficient for spectroscopic observations from future, actively
cooled space-based observatories. Moreover, the presented device design and assembly can be adapted
for frequencies up to $\approx$ 10 THz and can be readily implemented in kilopixel arrays.

Disc-halo decomposition on rotationally supported star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at $z>1$ are
often limited to massive galaxies ($M_\star>10^{10}~M_\odot$) and rely on either deep Integral
Field Spectroscopy data or stacking analyses. We present a study of the dark matter (DM) content
of 9 $z\approx1$ SFGs selected Using the brightest [OII] emitters in the deepest Multi-Unit Spectrograph
Explorer (MUSE) field to date, namely the 140hr MUSE Extremely Deep Field, we perform disk-halo
decompositions on 9 low-mass SFGs (with $10^{8.5}<M_\star<10^{10.5}~M_\odot$) using a novel
3D modeling approach, which together with the exquisite S/N allows us to measure individual rotation
curves to $3\times R_e$. The DM component primarily uses the generalized $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$
profile from Di Cintio et al., or a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile. The disk stellar masses $M_\star$
obtained from the [OII] disk-halo decomposition agree with the values inferred from the spectral
energy distributions. While the rotation curves show diverse shapes, ranging from rising to declining
at large radii, the DM fractions within the half-light radius $f_{\rm DM}(<R_e)$ are found to be
60\% to 95\%, extending to lower masses (densities) the results of Genzel et al., who found low DM
fractions in SFGs with $M_\star>10^{10}~M_\odot$. The DM halos show constant surface densities
of $\sim100~M_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$. Half of the sample shows a strong preference for cored over cuspy
DM profiles. The presence of DM cores appears to be related to galaxies with stellar-to-halo mass
$\log M_\star/M_{\rm vir}\approx-2.5$. In addition, the cuspiness of the DM profiles is found
to be a strong function of the recent star-formation activity. Both of these results are interpreted
as evidence for feedback-induced core formation in the Cold Dark Matter context.

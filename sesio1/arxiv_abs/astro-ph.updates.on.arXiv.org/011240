As part of the VESTIGE survey, a blind narrow-band Ha+[NII] imaging survey of the Virgo cluster carried
out with MegaCam at the CFHT, we discovered 8 massive lenticular galaxies with prominent ionised
gas emission features in their inner (few kpc) regions. These features are either ionised gas filaments
similar to those observed in cooling flows (2 gal), or thin discs with sizes 0.7<R(Ha)<2.0 kpc (6
gal), thus significantly smaller than those of the stellar disc. These discs have morphological
properties similar to those of the dust seen in absorption in high-resolution HST images. Using
a unique set of multifrequency data we show that while the gas located within these inner discs is
photoionised by young stars, signaling ongoing star formation, the gas in the filamentary structures
is shock-ionised. These discs have a star formation surface brightness similar to those observed
in late-type galaxies. Because of their reduced size, however, these lenticular galaxies are located
below the main sequence of unperturbed or cluster star-forming systems. By comparing the dust masses
measured from absorption maps in optical images, from the Balmer decrement, or estimated by fitting
the UV-to-far-IR spectral energy distribution of the target galaxies, we confirm that those derived
from optical attenuation maps are heavily underestimated because of geometrical effects due to
the relative distribution of the absorbing dust and the emitting stars. We have also shown that these
galaxies have gas-to-dust ratios of G/D~80, and that the star formation within these discs follows
the Schmidt relation, albeit with an efficiency reduced by a factor of ~ 2.5. Using our unique set
of multifrequency data, we discuss the possible origin of the ionised gas in these objects, which
suggests multiple and complex formation scenarios for massive lenticular galaxies in clusters.

Super-soft X-ray sources were established as a heterogeneous class of objects from observations
of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We have searched for new sources of this class in the X-ray images
obtained from the XMM-Newton survey of the LMC and additional archival observations. We first selected
candidates by visual inspection of the image, and screened out artefacts which can mimic super-soft
X-ray sources as well as bright foreground stars which create optical loading on the CCD image. We
finally obtained 4 new super-soft X-ray sources for which we performed detailed X-ray timing and
spectral analysis and searched for possible optical counterparts to identify their nature. XMMU
J050452.0-683909 is identified as the central star of the planetary nebula SMP LMC21 in the LMC.
We suggest XMMU J051854.8-695601 and XMMU J050815.1-691832 as new soft intermediate polars from
the nature of their X-ray spectrum. Their estimated absorption-corrected luminosities and the
blackbody radii indicate that they are located in our Galaxy, rather than the LMC. We discovered
coherent pulsations of 497 s from XMMU J044626.6-692011 which indicates a magnetic cataclysmic
variable nature of the source. The location of XMMU J044626.6-692011 in the LMC or our Galaxy is less
clear. It could either be a white dwarf in the LMC with nuclear burning on its surface near the Eddington
limit, or another soft intermediate polar in our Galaxy. The discovery of new super-soft X-ray sources
makes a significant contribution to the known population in our own Galaxy. An observed higher density
of sources in the direction of the Magellanic Clouds can likely be explained by the relatively low
Galactic column density in their direction as well as a large number of existing observations sensitive
at low X-ray energies.

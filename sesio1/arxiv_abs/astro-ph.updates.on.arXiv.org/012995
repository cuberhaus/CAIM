The miniJPAS survey has observed $\sim 1$ deg$^2$ on the AEGIS field with 60 bands (spectral resolution
of $R \sim 60$) in order to demonstrate the capabilities of the Javalambre-Physics of the Accelerating
Universe Astrophysical Survey (J-PAS) that will map $\sim 8000$ deg$^2$ of the northern sky in the
next years. This paper shows the power of J-PAS to detect low mass groups and characterise their galaxy
populations up to $z \sim 1$. We use the spectral energy distribution fitting code BaySeAGal to derive
the stellar population properties of the galaxy members in 80 groups at $z \leq 0.8$ previously detected
by the AMICO code, as well as for a galaxy field sample retrieved from the whole miniJPAS sample. We
identify blue, red, quiescent, and transition galaxy populations through their rest-frame (extinction
corrected) colour, stellar mass ($M_\star$) and specific star formation rate. We measure their
abundance as a function of $M_\star$ and environment. We find: (i) The fraction of red and quiescent
galaxies in groups increases with $M_\star$ and it is always higher in groups than in the field. (ii)
The quenched fraction excess (QFE) in groups strongly increases with $M_\star$, (from a few percent
to higher than 60% in the mass range $10^{10} - 3 \times 10 ^{11}$ $M_\odot$. (iii) The abundance excess
of transition galaxies in groups shows a modest dependence with $M_\star$ (iv) The fading time scale
is very short ($<1.5$ Gyr), indicating that the star formation declines very rapidly in groups.
(v) The evolution of the galaxy quenching rate in groups shows a modest but significant evolution
since $z\sim0.8$, compatible with an evolution with constant $QFE=0.4$, previously measured
for satellites in the nearby Universe, and consistent with a scenario where the low-mass star-forming
galaxies in clusters at $z= 1-1.4$ are environmentally quenched.

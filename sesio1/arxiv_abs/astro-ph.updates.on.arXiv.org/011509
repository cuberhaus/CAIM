The ALMA-IMF Large Program imaged a total noncontiguous area of 53pc2, covering 15 extreme, nearby
protoclusters of the Milky Way. They were selected to span relevant early protocluster evolutionary
stages. Our 1.3mm and 3mm observations provide continuum images that are homogeneously sensitive
to point-like cores with masses of 0.2 and 0.6Msun, respectively, with a matched spatial resolution
of 2000au. We also detect lines that probe the protocluster structure, kinematics, chemistry,
and feedback over scales from clouds to filaments to cores. We classify ALMA-IMF protoclusters
as Young, Intermediate, or Evolved based on the amount of dense gas in the cloud that has potentially
been impacted by HII regions. The ALMA-IMF catalog contains 700 cores that span a mass range of 0.15-250Msun
at a typical size of 2100au. We show that this core sample has no significant distance bias and can
be used to build core mass functions at similar physical scales. Significant gas motions, which
we highlight here in the G353.41 region, are traced down to core scales and can be used to look for inflowing
gas streamers and to quantify the impact of the possible associated core mass growth on the shape
of the CMF with time. Our first analysis does not reveal any significant evolution of the matter concentration
from clouds to cores or from the youngest to more evolved protoclusters, indicating that cloud dynamical
evolution and stellar feedback have for the moment only had a slight effect on the structure of high-density
gas in our sample. Furthermore, the first-look analysis of the line richness toward bright cores
indicates that the survey encompasses several tens of hot cores, of which we highlight the most massive
in the G351.77 cloud. Their homogeneous characterization can be used to constrain the emerging
molecular complexity in protostars of high to intermediate masses.

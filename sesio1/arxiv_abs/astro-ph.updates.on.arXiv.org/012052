We present the second part (days 19 to 102) of our high-resolution Echelle atlas of the spectral evolution
of RS Oph during the 2021 nova outburst. Some quick conclusions that can be drawn are: (1) the spectra
evolution has progressed smoothly, suggesting that both the expansion of the ejecta through the
pre-existing RG wind and the photo-ionization from the central source did not encountered sudden
discontinuities prior to switch-off of the nuclear burning; (2) the 2021 spectral evolution is
similar to that of the 2006 eruption, with a mirror-appearance of the triple-peaked line profiles
(blue peak brighter than red in 2006, the opposite in 2021); (3) the evolution of the triple-peaked
profiles progressed similarly through different excitation and ionization degrees, suggesting
an origin in a bipolar outflow nested to an equatorial torus; (4) the time-behavior of coronal emission
lines appears quite smooth, both in terms of radiated flux as well as evolution of the triple-peaked
profiles, with a plateau at maximum lasting up to about day 87; (5) there seems to exist within RS Oph
two distinct types of ejecta: one fast moving and producing Gaussian-like line profiles (primarely
[NII] and [OIII]), that keep expanding at FWHM=1000 km/s with no sign of ongoing deceleration during
the two months leading up to Solar conjunction, and slower moving ejecta giving rise to the triple-peaked
line profiles (HeI, HeII, coronal lines, and also Balmer lines at later times), for which the separation
in velocity of blue and red peaks is still shrinking at the time of Solar conjunction when it reaches
an average of 330 km/s; (6) the "symbiotic band" at 6825 Ang, due to Raman scattering of OVI 1032 by
neutral hydrogen, appears simultaneously with the coronal lines: its very presence indicates
that a sizeable part of the wind of the red giant has remained neutral during the development of coronal
lines.

About a quarter of massive binary stars undergo mass transfer while both stars burn hydrogen at their
cores, first on the thermal and then on the nuclear timescale. The nuclear timescale mass transfer
leads to observable counterparts: the semi-detached so-called massive Algol binaries. However,
comprehensive model predictions for these systems are sparse. We study them using a large grid of
~10,000 detailed binary evolution models calculated with the stellar evolution code MESA, covering
initial donor masses between 10-40 M$_{\odot}$ and initial orbital periods above 1.4 d, at a metallicity
suitable for the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Our models imply ~30, or ~3% of the ~1,000 core hydrogen
burning O-star binaries in the LMC to be currently in the semi-detached phase. Our donor models are
up to 25-times more luminous than single stars of identical mass and effective temperature, which
agrees with the observed Algols. A comparison of our models with the observed orbital periods and
mass ratios implies rather conservative mass transfer in some systems, while very inefficient
one in others. This is generally well reproduced by our spin-dependent mass transfer algorithm,
except for the lowest considered masses. The observations reflect the slow increase of the surface
nitrogen enrichment of the donors during the semi-detached phase all the way to CNO equilibrium.
We also investigate the properties of our models after core hydrogen depletion of the donor star,
when these models correspond to Wolf-Rayet/helium+OB star binaries. A dedicated spectroscopic
survey of massive Algol systems may allow to derive the dependence of the efficiency of thermal timescale
mass transfer on the binary parameters, as well as the efficiency of semiconvective mixing in the
stellar interior. This would be a crucial step towards reliable binary models up to the formation
of supernovae and compact objects.

We attempt to present a multiwavelength variability and correlation study as well as detailed multi-waveband
spectral characteristics of the May 2021 $\gamma$-ray flare of the blazar source TXS 1700+685.
The multi-wavelength observation from \textit{Fermi}-LAT, \textit{Swift}-XRT/UVOT as well
as radio archival data are used for our spectro-temporal investigation. We estimate the variability
time-scale of the source from the flux doubling time in different flaring regions detected in \textit{Fermi}-LAT
observation and the shortest variability time is used to put a constraint on the minimum Doppler
factor and on the size of the emission region. We have detected a statistically significant quasi-periodic
oscillation feature (QPO) at $\sim$ 17 days. The broad-band emission is satisfactorily represented
during its flaring state with a leptonic synchrotron and inverse Compton component. From the broadband
spectral modeling, we observe the external Comptonization of the seed photons originating in the
broad line region to be dominant compared to the dusty torus. This is further supported by the fact
that the emission region is also found to be residing within the BLR. The equipartition value implies
the energy density of the magnetic field in the jet comoving frame is weak, and that is also reflected
in the magnetic field and low power corresponding to the magnetic field component of the jet. In order
to produce the high energy hump, we need the injection of a large population of high energy electrons
and/or the presence of strong magnetic field; and we observe the later component to be sub-dominant
in our case. The flat rising and steep falling profile in the $\gamma$-ray SED as well as the break
or spectral curvature at $\sim$ 1 GeV are in commensuration with the flat-spectrum radio quasar
(FSRQ) nature of the source.

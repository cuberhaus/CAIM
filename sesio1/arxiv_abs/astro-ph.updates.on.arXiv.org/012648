Turbulence in the interstellar medium (ISM) is crucial in the process of star formation. Shocks
produced by supernova explosions, jets, radiation from massive stars, or galactic spiral-arm
dynamics are amongst the most common drivers of turbulence in the ISM. However, it is not fully understood
how shocks drive turbulence, in particular whether shock driving is a more solenoidal(rotational,
divergence-free) or a more compressive (potential, curl-free) mode of driving turbulence. The
mode of turbulence driving has profound consequences for star formation, with compressive driving
producing three times larger density dispersion, and an order of magnitude higher star formation
rate than solenoidal driving. Here, we use hydrodynamical simulations of a shock inducing turbulent
motions in a structured, multi-phase medium. This is done in the context of a laser-induced shock,
propagating into a foam material, in preparation for an experiment to be performed at the National
Ignition Facility (NIF). Specifically, we analyse the density and velocity distributions in the
shocked turbulent medium, and measure the turbulence driving parameter $b=(\sigma^{2 \Gamma}_{\rho
/\langle \rho \rangle}-1)^{1/2} (1-\sigma_{\rho \langle \rho \rangle}^{-2})^{-1/2}\mathcal{M}^{-1}\Gamma^{-1/2}$
with the density dispersion $\sigma_{\rho / \langle \rho \rangle}$, the turbulent Mach number
$\mathcal{M}$, and the polytropic exponent $\Gamma$. Purely solenoidal and purely compressive
driving correspond to $b \sim 1/3$ and $b \sim 1$, respectively. Using simulations in which a shock
is driven into a multi-phase medium with structures of different sizes and $\Gamma < 1$, we find $b
\sim 1$ for all cases, showing that shock-driven turbulence is consistent with strongly compressive
driving.

The recent discovery of the binary black hole (BBH) merger event GW190521, between two black holes
(BHs) of $\sim100M_\odot$, and as well as other massive BBH merger events involving BHs within the
pair-instability supernova (PSN) mass gap have sparked widespread debate on the origin of such
extreme gravitational-wave (GW) events. In this study, I investigate whether dynamical interactions
in young massive clusters (YMCs) serves as a viable scenario for assembling PSN-gap BBH mergers.
To that end, I explore a grid of 40 new evolutionary models of a representative YMC of initial mass
$M_{\rm cl}=7.5\times10^4M_\odot$ ($N\approx1.28\times10^5$) and size $r_h=2$ pc, with all
BH progenitor stars being initially in primordial binaries. All cluster models are evolved with
the direct, relativistic N-body code NBODY7 incorporating up to date remnant formation, BH natal
spin, and general-relativistic (GR) merger recoil schemes. The BBH mergers from these model cluster
computations agree well with the masses and effective spin parameters of the GW events in the latest
GW transient catalogue (GWTC). In particular, GW190521-like, i.e., $\sim200M_\odot$, low aligned
spin events are produced via dynamical merger among BHs derived from star-star merger products.
GW190403-like, i.e., PSN-gap, highly asymmetric and aligned events result from mergers involving
BHs that are spun up via matter accretion or binary interaction. The resulting differential merger
rate density within the PSN gap well accommodates that from GWTC. Particularly, the models well
reproduce the LVK-estimated merger rate density of GW190521-like events. This study demonstrates
that, subject to model uncertainties, the tandem of massive binary evolution and dynamical interactions
in low metallicity YMCs in the Universe can plausibly produce GR mergers involving PSN-gap BHs and
in rates consistent with that from to-date GW observations.

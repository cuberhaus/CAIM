The formation of hydrides by gas-phase reactions between H2 and a heavy element atom is a very selective
process. Reactions with ground-state neutral carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur atoms are very
endoergic and have high energy barriers because the H2 molecule has to be fragmented before a hydride
bond is formed. In cold interstellar clouds, these barriers exclude the formation of CH, OH, NH,
and SH radicals through hydrogen abstraction reactions. Here we study a very energetically unfavorable
process, the reaction of N(4S) atoms with H2 molecules. We calculated the reaction rate coefficient
for H2 in different vibrational levels, using quantum methods for v=0-7 and quasi-classical methods
up to v=12. Owing to the high energy barrier, these rate coefficients increase with v and also with
the gas temperature. We implemented the new rates in the Meudon PDR code and studied their effect
on models with different ultraviolet (UV) illumination conditions. In strongly UV-irradiated
dense gas (Orion Bar conditions), the presence of H2 in highly vibrationally excited levels (v>7)
enhances the NH abundance by two orders of magnitude (at the PDR surface) compared to models that
use the thermal rate coefficient for reaction N(4S) + H2 -> NH + H. The increase in NH column density
across the PDR is a factor of ~25. We explore existing Herschel/HIFI observations of the Orion Bar
and Horsehead PDRs. We report a 3-sigma emission feature at the ~974 GHz frequency of the NH N_J=1_2-0_1
line toward the Bar. The emission level implies N(NH)~10^13 cm^-2, which is consistent with PDR
models using the new rate coefficients for reactions between N and UV-pumped H2. This formation
route dominates over hydrogenation reactions involving the less abundant N+ ion. JWST observations
will soon quantify the amount and reactivity of UV-pumped H2 in many interstellar and circumstellar
environments.

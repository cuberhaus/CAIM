Linear cosmological observables can be used to probe elastic scattering of dark matter (DM) with
baryons. Availability of high-precision data requires a critical reassessment of any assumptions
that may impact the accuracy of constraints. All existing cosmological constraints of DM-baryon
scattering assume that DM has a Maxwell-Boltzmann (MB) velocity distribution in order to compute
heat- and momentum-exchange rates. This assumption is not always justified and does not allow for
probing DM self-interactions in addition to its interactions with baryons. Lifting the MB assumption
requires solving the full collisional Boltzmann equation (CBE), which is highly non-trivial.
Earlier work proposed a more tractable Fokker-Planck (FP) approximation to the CBE, but its accuracy
remained unknown. In this work, we numerically solve the exact CBE for the first time, in a homogeneous
expanding background. We consider DM-baryon scattering cross-sections that are positive power-laws
of relative velocity. We derive analytical expressions for the collision operator in the case of
isotropic differential scattering cross-sections. We then solve the background CBE numerically
and use our solution for the DM velocity distribution to compute the DM-baryon heat-exchange rate,
which we compare against those obtained with the MB assumption and FP approximation. Over a broad
range of DM-to-baryon mass ratios, we find that the FP approximation leads to a maximum error of 17%,
significantly better than the up to 160% error introduced by the MB assumption. While our results
strictly apply only to the background evolution, the accuracy of the FP approximation is likely
to carry over to perturbations. This motivates its implementation into cosmological Boltzmann
codes, where it can supersede the much less accurate MB assumption, and allow for a more general exploration
of DM interactions with baryons and with itself.

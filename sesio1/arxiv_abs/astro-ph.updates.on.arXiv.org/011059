Inspired by the recent conjecture that the universe has transitioned from AdS vacua to dS vacua in
the late universe made via graduated dark energy, we extend the $\Lambda$CDM model by a cosmological
constant ($\Lambda_{\rm s}$) that switches sign at certain redshift, $z_\dagger$, and name it
as $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM. We discuss the construction and theoretical features of this model, and
find out that, when the consistency of $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM with the CMB data is ensured, (i) $z_\dagger\gtrsim1.1$
is implied by the condition that the universe monotonically expands, (ii) $H_0$ and $M_B$ values
are inversely correlated with $z_\dagger$ and reach $H_0\approx74.5~{\rm km\, s^{-1}\, Mpc^{-1}}$
and $M_B\approx-19.2\,{\rm mag}$ for $z_\dagger=1.5$, in agreement with the SH0ES measurements,
(iii) $H(z)$ presents an excellent fit to the Ly-$\alpha$ measurements provided that $z_\dagger\lesssim
2.34$. We further investigate the model constraints by using the full Planck CMB data, with and without
BAO data. The CMB data alone does not constrain $z_\dagger$, but CMB+BAO dataset favors the sign
switch of $\Lambda_{\rm s}$ providing the constraint: $z_\dagger=2.44\pm0.29$ (68\% CL). The
lower and upper limits of $z_\dagger$ are controlled by the Galaxy and Ly-$\alpha$ BAO measurements,
respectively, and the larger $z_{\dagger}$ values imposed by the Galaxy BAO data prevent the model
from achieving the highest local $H_0$ measurements. In general, $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM (i) relaxes
the $H_0$ tension while being fully consistent with the TRGB measurement, (ii) relaxes the $M_B$
tension, (iii) removes the discrepancy with the Ly-$\alpha$ measurements, (iv) relaxes the $S_8$
tension, and (v) finds a better agreement with the BBN constraints of physical baryon density. We
find no strong statistical evidence to discriminate between the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM and $\Lambda$CDM
models.

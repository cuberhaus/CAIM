Context. Massive star-formation leads to enrichment with heavy elements of the interstellar medium.
On the other hand, the abundance of heavy elements is a key parameter to study the star-formation
history of galaxies. Furthermore, the total molecular hydrogen mass, usually determined by converting
CO or [C ii] 158 $\mu$m luminosities, depends on the metallicity as well. The excitation of metallicity-sensitive
emission lines, however, depends on the gas density of H ii regions, where they arise. Aims. We used
spectroscopic observations from SOFIA, Herschel, and Spitzer of the nuclear region of the starburst
galaxy NGC 253, as well as photometric observations from GALEX, 2MASS, Spitzer, and Herschel in
order to derive physical properties such as the optical depth to correct for extinction, as well
as the gas density and metallicity of the central region. Methods. Ratios of the integrated line
fluxes of several species were utilised to derive the gas density and metallicity. The [O iii] along
with the [S iii] and [N ii] line flux ratios for example, are sensitive to the gas density but nearly
independent of the local temperature. As these line ratios trace different gas densities and ionisation
states, we examined if these lines may originate from different regions within the observing beam.
The ([Ne ii] 13 $\mu$m + [Ne iii] 16 $\mu$m)/Hu $\alpha$ line flux ratio on the other hand, is independent
of the depletion onto dust grains but sensitive to the Ne/H abundance ratio and will be used as a tracer
for metallicity of the gas. Results. We derived values for gas phase abundances of the most important
species, as well as estimates for the optical depth and the gas density of the ionised gas in the nuclear
region of NGC 253. We obtained densities of at least two different ionised components $(< 84$ cm$^{-3}$
and $\sim 170 - 212$ cm$^{-3})$ and a metallicity of solar value.

Extragalactic black hole X-ray binaries LMC X-1 and LMC X-3 are the persistent sources, usually
found in soft spectral state. We present the results from spectral and timing study of these sources
using MAXI, NICER, NuSTAR and AstroSat observations carried out during 2014-2020. Study of long-term
MAXI lightcurve shows that the fractional variability of flux in 2-10keV is moderate ($\sim$20%)
in LMCX-1 and high ($\sim$50%) in LMCX-3. The energy spectra of both sources are characterized by
a disc blackbody and a Comptonization component with LMCX-1 having an additional Fe-line emission
feature. NICER (0.3-10keV), NuSTAR (3.0-40keV) and AstroSat (0.5-20keV) spectral analysis collectively
show that LMC X-1 remained in the soft state (disc flux contribution $f_{disc}>80$%, photon index$\Gamma\sim2.06-4.08$)
throughout 2014-2020. Mass accretion rate, $\dot{M}$ of LMC X-1 calculated from bolometric luminosity
(0.1-50keV) is found to be within $0.07-0.24\dot{M}_{Edd}$ (Eddington mass accretion rate).
Although LMC X-3 remained in the soft state ($f_{disc}>95\%,\Gamma\sim2.3$) during most of the
time, it exhibits transition into intermediate ($f_{disc}=47-73\%,\Gamma\sim2.02-2.36$)
and hard state ($f_{disc}\sim26\%,\Gamma\sim1.6$). $\dot{M}$ of LMC X-3 through different spectral
states varies within $0.01-0.42\dot{M}_{Edd}$. Temporal study show that the Power Density Spectra
(PDS) in 0.3-10keV follow a red-noise with rms of 2% for LMC X-1 and in case of LMC X-3, it is 0.08-2.35%
during the soft state, but relatively high in the intermediate(3.05-4.91%) and hard state($\sim$17.06%).
From continuum-fitting method we constrain spin of LMC X-1 and LMC X-3 to be within 0.85-0.94 and
0.16-0.33 respectively and from Fe-line fitting method, spin of LMC X-1 is found to be 0.93-0.94.
Finally, we discuss the implication of our findings in the context of accretion disc dynamics around
the vicinity of the BHs.

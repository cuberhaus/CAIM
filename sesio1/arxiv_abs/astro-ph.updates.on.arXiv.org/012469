We investigate the role of secondary electron emission from impact of gas molecules on the Cassini
Langmuir Probe (RPWS-LP) measurements in the ionosphere of Saturn. We add a model of the secondary
electron emission current, based on laboratory measurements and data from flybys of comet 1P/Halley,
and reanalyse the several hundred voltage bias sweeps obtained by the LP during the Cassini Grand
Finale orbits, we find reasonable explanations for three open conundrums from previous RPWS-LP
studies of the Saturn ionosphere. We find an explanation for the observed positive charging of the
Cassini spacecraft, the possibly overestimated ionospheric electron temperatures, and the excess
ion current reported previously that were used to estimate dust densities. We also produce an estimate
of the water vapour density from the last six revolutions of Cassini through Saturn's ionosphere,
in tentative agreement with and in higher detail than reported by the neutral gas monitor Ion and
Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS). For the sweeps analysed in detail, we find little evidence that
supports ionospheric (positive) ion densities that are significantly above the electron density
in Saturn's ionosphere, and therefore do not find (indirect or direct) evidence of dust having a
significant charge-carrying role in Saturn's ionosphere. The mixing ratio estimate from RPWS-LP
reveals a highly structured ionosphere in latitude across all six final revolutions (Rev 288-293),
varying with two orders of magnitude in latitude, as well as one order of magnitude between revolutions
and altitude. The result is generally consistent with an empirical photochemistry model balancing
the production of H+ ions with the H+ loss through charge transfer with e.g., H2O, CH4 and CO2), for
which water vapour appears as the likeliest and most dominant source of the signal in terms of yield
and concentration.

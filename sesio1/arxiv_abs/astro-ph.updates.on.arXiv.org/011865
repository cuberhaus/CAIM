Luminosity evolution of some stripped-envelope supernovae such as superluminous supernovae
is difficult to be explained by the canonical 56Ni nuclear decay heating. A popular alternative
heating source is rapid spin down of strongly-magnetized rapidly-rotating neutron stars (magnetars)
and it has been shown that magnetar spin down can explain luminosity evolution of superluminous
supernovae. Recent observations have indicated that superluminous supernovae often have bumpy
light curves with multiple luminosity peaks. The cause of bumpy light curves is still unknown. In
this study, we investigate the possibility that the light-curve bumps are caused by variabilities
in the thermal energy injection from magnetar spin down. We find that a temporal increase in the thermal
energy injection can lead to multiple luminosity peaks. The multiple luminosity peaks caused by
the variable thermal energy injection is found to be accompanied by significant photospheric temperature
increase, and photospheric radii are not significantly changed. We show that the bumpy light curves
of SN 2015bn and SN 2019stc can be reproduced by temporarily increasing magnetar spin-down energy
input by a factor of 2-3 for 5-20 days. However, not all the light-curve bumps are accompanied by the
clear photospheric temperature increase as predicted by our synthetic models. In particular,
the secondary light-curve bump of SN 2019stc is accompanied by a temporal increase in photospheric
radii rather than temperature, which is not seen in our synthetic models. We, therefore, conclude
that not all the light-curve bumps observed in luminous supernovae are caused by the variable thermal
energy injection from magnetar spin down and some bumps are likely caused by a different mechanism.
Our study demonstrates the importance of photosphere information to identify the cause of the bumpy
light curves.

Abridged Context: Snowlines during star and disk formation are responsible for a range of effects
during the evolution of protostars, such as setting the chemical composition of the envelope and
disk. This in turn influences the formation of planets by changing the elemental compositions of
solids and affecting the collisional properties and outcomes of dust grains. Snowlines can also
reveal accretion bursts, providing insight into the formation process of stars. Methods: A numerical
chemical network coupled with a grid of cylindrical-symmetric physical models was used to identify
what physical parameters alter the CO and H$_2$O snowline locations. The investigated parameters
are the initial molecular abundances, binding energies of CO and H$_2$O, heating source, cloud
core density, outflow cavity opening angle, and disk geometry. Simulated molecular line emission
maps were used to quantify the change in the snowline location with each parameter. Conclusions:
The models presented in this work show that the CO and H$_2$O snowline locations do not occur at a single,
well-defined temperature as is commonly assumed. Instead, the snowline position depends on luminosity,
cloud core density, and whether a disk is present or not. Inclination and spatial resolution affect
the observability and successful measurement of snowline locations. We note that N$_2$H$^+$ and
HCO$^+$ emission serve as good observational tracers of CO and H$_2$O snowline locations. However,
constraints on whether or not a disk is present, the observation of additional molecular tracers,
and estimating envelope density will help in accurately determining the cause of the observed snowline
position. Plots of the N$_2$H$^+$ and HCO$^+$ peak emission radius versus luminosity are provided
to compare the models with observations of deeply embedded protostars aiming to measure the CO and
H$_2$O snowline locations.

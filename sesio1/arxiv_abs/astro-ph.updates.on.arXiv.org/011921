We investigate the possibility of determining the mass distribution of a gravitational lens via
gravitational lensing observations. Considering an extended, compact gravitational lens, we
represent its static external gravitational potential via an infinite set of symmetric trace free
multipole moments. Within the wave-optical treatment, we evaluate the gravitational phase shift
that results in the caustics formed in the lens' point spread function (PSF). We model the only quantity
that is available in astronomical lensing observations, the image of that PSF formed at the focal
plane of an imaging telescope. This observable may be used to recover physical characteristics
of the lens, including its shape, orientation and composition. Illustrating this, we study exotic
gravitational lenses formed by several well-known solids with uniform density. It is understood
that the limitations associated with how a lens projects light, especially when it is viewed from
a single vantage point such as the solar system, inevitably leads to a loss of information. Nonetheless,
we show that when moments beyond the quadrupole can be observed, some of the symmetry properties
of the lens can be recovered. The presence of an octupole moment implies breaking the "north-south''
symmetry of the mass distribution. The presence of a rotated hexadecapole moment implies breaking
axial symmetry. As such, if observations of lensed images allow the reconstruction of these moments,
important information about the mass distribution and dynamics of the lens can be obtained. This
may help with choosing the most appropriate mass profile to characterize the mass distribution
of astrophysical lenses, such as the dark matter halos that are presumed to contain most of the mass
of galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Our results are novel and offer new insight into gravitational
lensing by realistic astrophysical systems.

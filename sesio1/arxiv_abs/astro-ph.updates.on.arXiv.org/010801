Palomar 6 is a moderately metal-poor globular cluster projected towards the Galactic bulge. A full
analysis of the cluster can give hints on the early chemical enrichment of the Galaxy and a plausible
origin of the cluster. The aim of this study is threefold: a detailed analysis of high-resolution
spectroscopic data obtained with the UVES spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) at the
ESO, the derivation of the age and distance of Palomar 6 from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometric
data, and an orbital analysis to determine the probable origin of the cluster. High-resolution
spectra of six red giant stars in the direction of Palomar 6 were obtained at the $8$m VLT UT2-Kueyen
telescope equipped with the UVES spectrograph in FLAMES$+$UVES configuration. Spectroscopic
parameters were derived through excitation and ionisation equilibrium of \ion{Fe}{I} and \ion{Fe}{II}
lines, and the abundances were obtained from spectrum synthesis. From HST photometric data, the
age and distance were derived through a statistical isochrone fitting. Finally, a dynamical analysis
was carried out for the cluster assuming two different Galactic potentials. Four stars that are
members of Pal~6 were identified in the sample, which gives a mean radial velocity of $174.3\pm1.6$
km\,s$^{-1}$ and a mean metallicity of [Fe/H]$\,=-1.10\pm0.09$ for the cluster. We found an enhancement
of $\alpha$-elements $0.29<\,$[O,Mg,Si,Ca/Fe]$\,<0.38$ and the iron-peak element Ti of [Ti/Fe]$\,\sim+0.3$.
The odd-Z elements show a mild enhancement of [Na,Al/Fe]$\,\sim( +0.3, +0.2)$. The abundances
of both first- and second-peak heavy elements are relatively high, with $+0.4<\,$[Y,Zr/Fe]$\,<+0.60$
and $+0.4<\,$[Ba,La/Fe]$\,<+0.5$, respectively. The r-element Eu is also relatively high with
[Eu/Fe]$\,\sim +0.6$. One member star presents enhancements in N and Al, with [Al/Fe]$\,>+0.30$,

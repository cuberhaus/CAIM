WASP-103b is the exoplanet with the highest expected deformation signature in its transit light
curve and one of the shortest expected spiral-in times. Measuring the tidal deformation of the planet
would allow us to estimate the second degree fluid Love number and gain insight into the planet's
internal structure. Moreover, measuring the tidal decay timescale would allow us to estimate the
stellar tidal quality factor, which is key to constraining stellar physics. We obtained 12 transit
light curves of WASP-103b with the CHEOPS to estimate the tidal deformation and tidal decay of this
extreme system. We modelled the high-precision CHEOPS transit light curves together with systematic
instrumental noise using multi-dimensional Gaussian process regression informed by a set of instrumental
parameters. To model the tidal deformation, we used a parametrisation model which allowed us to
determine the second degree fluid Love number of the planet. We combined our light curves with previously
observed transits of WASP-103b with HST and Spitzer. We estimate the radial Love number of WASP-103b
to be $h_f = 1.59^{+0.45}_{-0.53}$. This is the first time that the tidal deformation is directly
detected (at $3\, \sigma$) from the transit light curve of an exoplanet. Combining the transit times
derived from CHEOPS, with the other transit times available in the literature, we find no significant
orbital period variation for WASP-103b. However, the data show a hint of an orbital period increase
instead of a decrease, as is expected for tidal decay. This could be either due to a visual companion
star if this star is bound, the Applegate effect, or a statistical artefact. The estimated Love number
of WASP-103b is similar to Jupiter's. This will allow us to constrain the internal structure and
composition of WASP-103b, which could provide clues on the inflation of hot Jupiters. (Abridged)

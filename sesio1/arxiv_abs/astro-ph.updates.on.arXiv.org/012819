In this paper we develop a differential astrometric framework that is appropriate for a scanning
space satellite such as Gaia. We apply it to the first of the GAREQ fields, which is the fruit of dedicated
efforts within the Gaia project focused on measuring the relativistic deflection of light close
to Jupiter's limb. This provides a preliminary assessment of: a) the observability of the relativistic
deflection of light close to Jupiter, and, b) Gaia's astrometric capabilities under extremely
difficult conditions such as those around a bright extended object. Inputs to our differential
astrometric model are the CCD transit times as measured by the IDU system, transformed to field angles
via AGIS geometric calibrations, and the commanded/nominal spacecraft attitude. [abridged]
To illustrate the model we analyze Gaia astrometric measurements after their calibration through
the latest cyclic EDR3/DR3 processing of the GAREQ event of Feb 2017. We use observations of the closest
bright target star successfully observed several times by Gaia in close proximity to Jupiter and
surrounding reference stars brighter than G<13 mag in transits leading up to the time of closest
approach and on subsequent transits. The relativistic deflection signal is detected with a S/N
of 50 at closest approach by the target star. This signal is the combined effect due to Jupiter and
the Sun, mainly dominated by Jupiter's monopole, demonstrating Gaia's scientific performance
under extreme observational conditions. It is an unprecedented detection for the following reasons:
a) closest ever to Jupiter's limb (~7") in the optical, and, b) highest S/N at any wavelength. Finally,
this work sets the stage for investigations into disentangling the relativistic quadrupole deflection
due to Jupiter with future Gaia astrometric measurements.

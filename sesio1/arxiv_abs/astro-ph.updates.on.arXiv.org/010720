We study the Einstein equations of the static spherically symmetric anisotropic fluid system in
curvature coordinates to find algorithms that generate all solutions and all solutions that are
regular at the center. All possible combinations of input functions from the set of four functions
that characterize the anisotropic system are considered and all equivalent conditions for central
regularity are determined (for both isotropic and anisotropic systems). We provide the first regularity
analysis of the known algorithm that uses the potential function and anisotropy as inputs. For three
other choices of input function pairs (any two of the potential function, density, or radial pressure),
a remarkably straightforward algorithm follows, which is very efficient in generating regular
anisotropic solutions. This is because the equivalency of the three pairs in this algorithm arises
precisely from the same algebraic relation that made the different equivalent sets of regularity
conditions possible. In addition, the choice of functions makes this algorithm very suitable for
finding particular solutions that admit other desirable physical properties; we construct three
examples. This algorithm does not admit an isotropic limit although all isotropic solutions are
produced as part of the anisotropic system. The remaining two choices of input function pairs (anisotropy
with the radial pressure or density) lead to the old barriers one encounters in the isotropic system:
Riccati and Abel equations. However, with any solution generated by the new and existing algorithms,
one can now construct the general solution of the corresponding Riccati equation to obtain a one-parameter
family of geometries for each input solution. We discuss the regularity of the resulting solutions.

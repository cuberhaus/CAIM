High quality low-frequency radio surveys have the promise of advancing our understanding of many
important topics in astrophysics, including the life cycle of active galactic nuclei (AGN), particle
acceleration processes in jets, the history of star formation, and exoplanet magnetospheres.
Currently leading low-frequency surveys reach an angular resolution of a few arcseconds. However,
this resolution is not yet sufficient to study the more compact and distant sources in detail. Sub-arcsecond
resolution is therefore the next milestone in advancing these fields. The biggest challenge at
low radio frequencies is the ionosphere. If not adequately corrected for, ionospheric seeing blurs
the images to arcsecond or even arcminute scales. Additionally, the required image size to map the
degree-scale field of view of low-frequency radio telescopes at this resolution is far greater
than what typical soft- and hardware is currently capable of handling. Here we present for the first
time (to the best of our knowledge) widefield sub-arcsecond imaging at low radio frequencies. We
derive ionospheric corrections in a few dozen individual directions and apply those during imaging
efficiently using a recently developed imaging algorithm (arXiv:1407.1943, arXiv:1909.07226).
We demonstrate our method by applying it to an eight hour observation of the International LOw Frequency
ARray (LOFAR) Telescope (ILT) (arXiv:1305.3550). Doing so we have made a sensitive $7.4\ \mathrm{deg}^2$
$144\ \mathrm{MHz}$ map at a resolution of $0.3''$ reaching $25\ \mu\mathrm{Jy\ beam}^{-1}$ near
the phase centre. The estimated $250,000$ core hours used to produce this image, fit comfortably
in the budget of available computing facilities. This result will enable future mapping of the entire
northern low-frequency sky at sub-arcsecond resolution.

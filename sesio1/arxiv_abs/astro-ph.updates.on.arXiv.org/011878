N-body equations of motion in comoving system and expanding background is recast in a transformed
system with static background. The energy and momentum evolution in dark matter flow is formulated
for both systems. In transformed system, 1) energy equation is identical to that of a damped harmonic
oscillator and consistent with cosmic energy equation; 2) two-body collapse model (TBCM) predicts
an exponential evolution of energy. Combining both leads to a power-law energy evolution in comoving
system and suggests an effective potential exponent $n_e$=-10/7 for virial theorem (-1.38 from
simulation) that deviates from -1. With $n_e$=-10/7, kinetic/potential energy (K$_p$ and P$_y$)
increase linearly with time t such that K$_p$=$\epsilon_u$t and P$_y$=-7$\epsilon_u$t/5, where
$\epsilon_u$ is a constant rate of energy production. On halo scale, halo size, energy and mass are
related by two constants $\alpha_s^*$ and $\beta_s^*$, whose mean values are independent of time
and mass. Their dispersion decreases with halo mass due to short lifespan of large halos, whose effective
potential exponent $n_s^*$=-1.3. Simulation suggests scaling $\propto a^{3/2}$ and $\propto
a^{5/2}$ for radial and angular momentum of entire system, and $\propto a^{3/2}$ for momentum of
halos. Halo momentum can be modeled by two mass-dependent coefficients $\tau_s^*$ and $\eta_s^*$.
Halo spin $\lambda_p$ is determined by $\alpha_s^*$, $\eta_s^*$, and $n_s^*$ and decreases with
halo mass with $\lambda_p$=0.09 and 0.031 for small and large halos. The radial/angular momentum
(G and H) are closely related to constant $I_m$ that is defined as integral of velocity correlation
or $m$th derivative of energy spectrum at small k. On large scale, H is negligible, $I_2$=0 reflects
conservation of linear momentum, while $I_4$ reflects fluctuation of G. On halo scale, $I_4$ is
determined by both G and H that are comparable.

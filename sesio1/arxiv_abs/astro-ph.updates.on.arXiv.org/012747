Since the chemical abundances of stars are the fossil records of the physical conditions in galaxies,
they provide the key information for recovering the assembly history of galaxies. In this work,
we explore the chemo-chrono-kinematics of accreted and in-situ stars, by analyzing six M31/MW
analogues from the HESTIA suite of cosmological hydrodynamics zoom-in simulations of the Local
Group. We found that the merger debris are chemically distinct from the survived dwarf galaxies.
The mergers debris have abundances expected for stars originating from dwarfs that had their star
formation activity quenched at early times. Accreted stellar haloes, including individual debris,
reveal abundance gradients in the ELz, where the most metal-rich stars have formed in the inner parts
of the disrupted systems before the merger and mainly contribute to the central regions of the hosts.
Therefore, we suggest that abundance measurements in the inner MW will allow constraining better
the parameters of building blocks of the MW stellar halo. The MDFs of the individual debris show several
peaks and the majority of debris have lower metallicity than the in-situ stars for Lz>0, while non-rotating
and retrograde accreted stars are similar to the in-situ. Prograde accreted stars show a prominent
knee in the [Fe/H]-[Mg/Fe] plane while the retrograde stars typically deposit to a high-[Mg/Fe]
sequence. We found that the metal-poor stars ([Fe/H]<-1) of the HESTIA galaxies exhibit between
zero to 80 km/s net rotation which is consistent with the Aurora population. At higher metallicities,
we detect a sharp transition (spin-up) from the turbulent phase to a disk-like rotation. Mergers
debris are similar in the [Fe/H]-[Mg/Fe] plane. However, combining a set of abundances allows to
capture chemical patterns corresponding to different debris, which are the most prominent as a
function of stellar age.

Because mass loss is a fundamental phenomenon in massive stars, interaction with circumstellar
material (CSM) should be universal in core-collapse supernovae (SNe). Leaving aside the extreme
CSM density, extent, or mass typically encountered in Type IIn SNe, we investigate the diverse long-term
radiative signatures of interaction between a Type II SN ejecta and CSM corresponding to mass loss
rates up to 10$^{-3}$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. Because these CSM are relatively tenuous and optically-thin
to electron-scattering beyond a few stellar radii, radiation hydrodynamics is not essential and
one may treat the interaction directly as an additional power source in the non-local thermodynamic
equilibrium radiative transfer problem. The CSM accumulated since shock breakout forms a dense
shell in the outer ejecta and leads to high-velocity absorption features in spectral lines, even
for negligible shock power. Besides Balmer lines, such features may appear in NaID, HeI lines etc.
A stronger interaction strengthens the continuum flux (preferentially in the UV), quenches the
absorption of P-Cygni profiles, boosts the MgII $\lambda\lambda$ $2795,2802$ doublet, and fosters
the production of a broad boxy H$\alpha$ emission component. The rise in ionization in the outer
ejecta may quench some lines (e.g., the CaII near-infrared triplet). The interaction power emerges
preferentially in the UV, in particular at later times, shifting the optical color to the blue, but
increasing modestly the optical luminosity. Strong thermalization and clumping seem to be required
to make an interaction superluminous in the optical. The UV range contains essential signatures
that provide critical constraints to infer the mass loss history and inner workings of core-collapse
SN progenitors at death.

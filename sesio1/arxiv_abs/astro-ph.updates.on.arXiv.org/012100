We present the median-stacked Lyman-$\alpha$ surface brightness profile of 968 spectroscopically
selected Lyman-$\alpha$ emitting galaxies (LAEs) at redshifts $1.9<z<3.5$ in the early data of
the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX). The selected LAEs are high-confidence
Lyman-$\alpha$ detections with large signal-to-noise ratios observed with good seeing conditions
(point-spread-function full-width-at-half-maximum $<1.4"$), excluding active galactic nuclei
(AGN). The Lyman-$\alpha$ luminosities of the LAEs are $10^{42.4}-10^{43}\, \mathrm{erg}\,
\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. We detect faint emission in the median-stacked radial profiles at the level
of $(3.6\pm 1.3)\times 10^{-20}\,\mathrm{erg}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\,\mathrm{arcsec}^{-2}$
from the surrounding Lyman-$\alpha$ halos out to $r\simeq 160$ kpc (physical). The shape of the
median-stacked radial profile is consistent at $r<80\,\mathrm{kpc}$ with that of much fainter
LAEs at $3<z<4$ observed with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE), indicating that the
median-stacked Lyman-$\alpha$ profiles have similar shapes at redshifts $2<z<4$ and across a
factor of $10$ in Lyman-$\alpha$ luminosity. While we agree with the results from the MUSE sample
at $r<80\,\mathrm{kpc}$, we extend the profile over a factor of two in radius. At $r>80\,\mathrm{kpc}$,
our profile is flatter than the MUSE model. The measured profile agrees at most radii with that of
galaxies in the Byrohl et al. (2021) cosmological radiative transfer simulation at $z=3$. This
suggests that the surface brightness of a Lyman-$\alpha$ halo at $r\lesssim 100$ kpc is dominated
by resonant scattering of Lyman-$\alpha$ photons from star-forming regions in the central galaxy,
whereas at $r > 100$ kpc it is dominated by photons from galaxies in surrounding dark matter halos.

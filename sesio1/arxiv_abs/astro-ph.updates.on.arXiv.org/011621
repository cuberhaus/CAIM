Magnetically and thermally driven disk winds have gained popularity in the light of the current
paradigm of low viscosities in protoplanetary disks that nevertheless present large accretion
rates even in the presence of inner cavities. The possibility of dust entrainment in these winds
may explain recent scattered light observations and constitutes a way of dust transport towards
outer regions of the disk. We aim to study the dust dynamics in these winds and explore the differences
between photoevaporation and magnetically driven disk winds in this regard. We quantify maximum
entrainable grain sizes, the flow angle, and the general detectability. We used the FARGO3D code
to perform global, 2.5D axisymmetric, nonideal MHD simulations including ohmic and ambipolar
diffusion. Dust was treated as a pressureless fluid. Synthetic observations were created with
the radiative transfer code RADMC-3D. We find a significant difference in the dust entrainment
efficiency of warm, ionized winds such as photoevaporation and magnetic winds including X-ray
and extreme ultraviolet (XEUV) heating compared to cold magnetic winds. The maximum entrainable
grain size varies from $3\,\mu\mathrm{m}$ to $6\,\mu\mathrm{m}$ for ionized winds to $1\,\mu\mathrm{m}$
for cold magnetic winds. Dust grains in cold magnetic winds tend to flow along a shallower angle compared
to the warm winds. With increasing distance to the central star, the dust entrainment efficiency
decreases. Larger values of the turbulent viscosity increase the maximum grain size radius of possible
dust entrainment. Our simulations indicate that diminishing dust content in the outer regions
of the wind can be mainly attributed to the dust settling in the disk. In the synthetic images, the
dusty wind appears as a faint, conical emission region which is brighter for a cold magnetic wind.

Observations of solar flare reconnection at very high spatial and temporal resolution can be made
indirectly at the footpoints of reconnected loops into which flare energy is deposited. The response
of the lower atmosphere to this energy input includes a downward-propagating shock called chromospheric
condensation, which can be observed in the UV and visible. In order to characterize reconnection
using high-resolution observations of this response, one must develop a quantitative relationship
between the two. Such a relation was recently developed and here we test it on observations of chromospheric
condensation in a single footpoint from a flare ribbon of the X1.0 flare on 25 Oct. 2014 (SOL2014-10-25T16:56:36).
Measurements taken of Si iv 1402.77 {\AA} emission spectra using the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph
(IRIS) in a single pixel show red-shifted component undergoing characteristic condensation evolution.
We apply the technique called the Ultraviolet Footpoint Calorimeter (UFC) to infer energy deposition
into the one footpoint. This energy profile, persisting much longer than the observed condensation,
is input into a one-dimensional, hydrodynamic simulation to compute the chromospheric response,
which contains a very brief condensation episode. From this simulation we synthesize Si iv spectra
and compute the time-evolving Doppler velocity. The synthetic velocity evolution is found to compare
reasonably well with the IRIS observation, thus corroborating our reconnection-condensation
relationship. The exercise reveals that the chromospheric condensation characterizes a particular
portion of the reconnection energy release rather than its entirety, and that the time scale of condensation
does not necessarily reflect the time scale of energy input.

Multi-band images of galaxies reveal a huge amount of information about their morphology and structure.
However, inferring properties of the underlying stellar populations such as age, metallicity
or kinematics from those images is notoriously difficult. Traditionally such information is best
extracted from expensive spectroscopic observations. Here we present the $Painting\, IntrinsiC\,
Attributes\, onto\, SDSS\, Objects$ (PICASSSO) project and test the information content of photometric
multi-band images of galaxies. We train a convolutional neural network on 27,558 galaxy image pairs
to establish a connection between broad-band images and the underlying physical stellar and gaseous
galaxy property maps. We test our machine learning (ML) algorithm with SDSS $ugriz$ mock images
for which uncertainties and systematics are exactly known. We show that multi-band galaxy images
contain enough information to reconstruct 2d maps of stellar mass, metallicity, age and gas mass,
metallicity as well as star formation rate. We recover the true stellar properties on a pixel by pixel
basis with only little scatter, $\lesssim20\%$ compared to $\sim50\%$ statistical uncertainty
from traditional mass-to-light-ratio based methods. We further test for any systematics of our
algorithm with image resolution, training sample size or wavelength coverage. We find that galaxy
morphology alone constrains stellar properties to better than $\sim20\%$ thus highlighting the
benefits of including morphology into the parameter estimation. The machine learning approach
can predict maps of high resolution, only limited by the resolution of the input bands, thus achieving
higher resolution than IFU observations. The network architecture and all code is publicly available
on GitHub.

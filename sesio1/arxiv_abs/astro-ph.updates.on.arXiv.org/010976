We introduce the THESAN project, a suite of large volume (L = 95.5 cMpc) radiation-magneto-hydrodynamic
simulations that simultaneously model the large-scale statistical properties of the IGM during
reionization and the resolved characteristics of the galaxies responsible for it. The flagship
simulation has dark matter (DM) and baryonic mass resolutions of $3.1 \times 10^6$ $M_\odot$ and
$5.8 \times 10^5 $ $M_\odot$, respectively. The gravitational forces are softened on scales of
2.2 ckpc with the smallest cell sizes reaching 10 pc at z=5.5, enabling predictions down to the atomic
cooling limit. The simulations use an efficient radiation hydrodynamics solver (AREPO-RT) that
precisely captures the interaction between ionizing photons and gas, coupled to well-tested galaxy
formation (IllustrisTNG) and dust models to accurately predict the properties of galaxies. Through
a complementary set of medium resolution simulations we investigate the changes to reionization
introduced by different assumptions for ionizing escape fractions, varying DM models, and numerical
convergence. The simulations produce realistic reionization histories that match the observed
evolution of the global neutral hydrogen fraction and electron scattering optical depth to reionization.
They also match a wealth of high-redshift observationally inferred data, including the stellar-to-halo-mass
relation, stellar mass function, star formation rate density, and the mass-metallicity relation,
despite the galaxy formation model being mainly calibrated at z=0. We demonstrate that different
reionization models give rise to varied bubble size distributions that imprint unique signatures
on the 21cm emission, especially on the slope of the power spectrum at large spatial scales, enabling
current and upcoming 21cm experiments to accurately characterise the sources that dominate the
ionizing photon budget. [abridged]

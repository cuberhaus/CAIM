Narrow Line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1) galaxies have been shown to have high Eddington ratios and relatively
small black hole masses. The measurement of the black hole masses is based on the virial relation
which is dependent on the distribution of the line-emitting gas and the viewing angle to the source.
Spectropolarimetry enables us to probe the geometry of this line-emitting gas and allows us to estimate
independently the viewing angle of the source by comparing the spectrum viewed under natural light
and in the polarized light. We performed spectropolarimetric observations of three NLSy1 - Mrk
1044, SDSS J080101.41+184840.7, and IRAS 04416+1215 using the European Southern Observatory's
Very Large Telescope. We use ESO Reflex workflow to perform standard data reduction and extract
the natural and polarized spectra. We estimate the Stokes parameters and the viewing angles of the
three sources. We model the Stokes parameters and infer the properties of the scattering media -
located in the equatorial and polar regions, and simulate the spectra observed both in natural light
and in polarized light using the polarization radiative transfer code STOKES. We confirm that all
three sources are high Eddington ratio objects. We are successful in recovering the observed H$\alpha$
line profile both in the natural and polarized light using the STOKES modelling. We recover the polarization
fractions of the order of 0.2-0.5% for the three sources. Our principal component analysis shows
that the sample of the 25 sources including our sources, Fairall 9 from Jiang et al. (2021), and sources
from Capetti et al. (2021) are mainly driven by the black hole mass and Eddington ratio. We re-affirm
the connection of the strength of the optical FeII emission with the Eddington ratio. But, the dependence
on the viewing angle is moderate, more like a secondary effect.

Nearby Photo-Dissociation Regions (PDRs), where the gas and dust are heated by the far UV-irradiation
emitted from stars, are ideal templates to study the main stellar feedback processes. With this
study we aim to probe the detailed structures at the interfaces between ionized, atomic, and molecular
gas in the Orion Bar. This nearby prototypical strongly irradiated PDR will be among the first targets
of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) within the framework of the PDRs4All Early Release Science
program. We employed the sub-arcsec resolution accessible with Keck-II NIRC2 and its adaptive
optics system to obtain the most detailed and complete images, ever performed, of the vibrationally
excited line H$_2$ 1-0 S(1) at 2.12~$\mu$m, tracing the dissociation front, and the [FeII] and Br$\gamma$
lines, at 1.64 and 2.16~$\mu$m respectively, tracing the ionization front. We obtained narrow-band
filter images in these key gas line diagnostic over $\sim 40''$ at spatial scales of $\sim$0.1$''$
($\sim$0.0002~pc or $\sim$40~AU at 414~pc). The Keck/NIRC2 observations spatially resolve a
plethora of irradiated sub-structures such as ridges, filaments, globules and proplyds. A remarkable
spatial coincidence between the H$_2$ 1-0 S(1) vibrational and HCO$^+$ J=4-3 rotational emission
previously obtained with ALMA is observed. This likely indicates the intimate link between these
two molecular species and highlights that in high pressure PDR the H/H$_2$ and C$^+$/C/CO transitions
zones come closer as compared to a typical layered structure of a constant density PDR. This is in
agreement with several previous studies that claimed that the Orion Bar edge is composed of very
small, dense, highly irradiated PDRs at high thermal pressure immersed in a more diffuse environment.

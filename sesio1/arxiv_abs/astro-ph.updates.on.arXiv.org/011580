Exozodiacal dust, warm debris from comets and asteroids in and near the habitable zone of stellar
systems, reveals the physical processes that shape planetary systems. Scattered light from this
dust is also a source of background flux which must be overcome by future missions to image Earthlike
planets. This study quantifies the sensitivity of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope Coronagraph
to light scattered by exozodi, the zodiacal dust around other stars. Using a sample of 149 nearby
stars, previously selected for optimum detection of habitable exoplanets by space observatories,
we find the maximum number of exozodiacal disks with observable \textit{inner} habitable zone
boundaries is six and the number of observable outer habitable boundaries is 74. One zodi was defined
as the visible-light surface brightness of 22 $m_{\rm V}\ $arcsec$^{-2}$ around a solar-mass star,
approximating the scattered light brightness in visible light at the Earth-equivalent insolation.
In the speckle limited case, where the signal-to-noise ratio is limited by speckle temporal stability
rather than shot noise, the median $5\sigma$ sensitivity to habitable zone exozodi is 12 zodi per
resolution element. This estimate is calculated at the inner-working angle of the coronagraph,
for the current best estimate performance, neglecting margins on the uncertainty in instrument
performance and including a post-processing speckle suppression factor. For an log-norm distribution
of exozodi levels with a median exozodi of 3$\times$ the solar zodi, we find that the Roman Coronagraph
would be able to make 5$\sigma$ detections of exozodiacal disks in scattered light from 13 systems
with a 95\% confidence interval spanning 7-20 systems. This sensitivity allows Roman Coronagraph
to complement ground-based measurements of exozodiacal thermal emission and constrain dust albedos.

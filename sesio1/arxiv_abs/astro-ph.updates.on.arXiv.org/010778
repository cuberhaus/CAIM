(Abridged) Complex organic molecules (COMs) are commonly detected in and near star-forming regions.
However, the dominant process in the release of these COMs from the icy grains - where they predominately
form - to the gas phase is still an open question. We investigate the origin of COM emission in a protostellar
source, CygX-N30, through high-angular-resolution interferometric observations over a continuous
broad frequency range. We used 32 GHz Submillimeter Array observations with continuous frequency
coverage from 329 to 361 GHz at an angular resolution of ~1" to do a line survey and obtain a chemical
inventory of the source. The line emission was used to determine column densities and excitation
temperatures for the COMs. We mapped out the intensity distribution of the different species and
identified approximately 400 lines that can be attributed to 29 different molecular species and
their isotopologues. We find that the molecular peak emission is along a linear gradient, coinciding
with the axis of red- and blueshifted H2CO and CS emission. Chemical differentiation is detected
along this gradient, with the O-bearing molecular species peaking towards one component of the
system and the N- and S-bearing species peaking towards the other. The inferred column densities
and excitation temperatures are compared to other sources where COMs are abundant. The origin of
the observed COM emission is probably a combination of the young stellar sources along with accretion
of infalling material onto a disc-like structure surrounding a young protostar. The low D/H ratio
observed (<0.1%) likely reflects a pre-stellar phase where COMs formed on the ices at warm temperatures
(~ 30 K), with inefficient deuterium fractionation. The observations and results presented here
demonstrate the importance of good frequency coverage and high angular resolution when disentangling
the origin of COM emission.

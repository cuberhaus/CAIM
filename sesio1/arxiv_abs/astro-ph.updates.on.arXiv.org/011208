Our knowledge about the photometric properties of bulges in late-type galaxies (LTGs) is founded
upon image decomposition into a S\'ersic model for the central luminosity excess of the bulge and
an exponential model for the underlying disk. We argue that the standard practice of adopting an
exponential model for the disk all the way to its center is inadequate because it implicitly neglects
the fact of star formation (SF) quenching (SFQ) in the centers of LTGs. Extrapolating the fit for
the observable star-forming zone of the disk (outside the bulge) inwardly overestimates the true
surface brightness of the disk in its SF-quenched central zone. We refer to this effect as Dio. The
primary consequence of the neglect of Dio in bulge-disk decomposition studies is the oversubtraction
of the disk underneath the bulge, leading to a systematic underestimation of the luminosity of the
latter. Framed in the picture of galaxy downsizing and inside-out SFQ, Dio is expected to differentially
impact galaxies across redshift and stellar mass M*, thus leading to systematic and complex biases
in the scatter and slope of various galaxy scaling relations. We conjecture that correction for
Dio will lead to a downbending of the bulge vs. super-massive black hole (SMBH) relation for galaxies
below log(M*/Msolar)~10.7. A decreasing M(SMBH)/M* ratio with decreasing M* would help consistently
explain the scarcity and weakness of accretion-powered nuclear activity in low-mass spiral galaxies.
A well detectable Dio (~2 r mag) can emerge early on through inward migration of SF clumps from the
disk in combination with a strong contrast of emission-line equivalent widths between the quenched
proto-bulge and its SF periphery. Spatially resolved studies with the JWST, ELT, and Euclid could
therefore offer key insights into the chronology and physical drivers of SFQ in the early phase of
galaxy assembly. (abridged)

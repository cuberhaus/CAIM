Solar-type protostars harbor highly deuterated complex organics. While this degree of deuteration
may provide important clues in studying the formation of these species, spectroscopic information
on multiply deuterated isotopologs is often insufficient. In particular, searches for triply
deuterated methanol, CD$_3$OH, are hampered by the lack of intensity information from a spectroscopic
model. The aim of the present study is to develop such a model of CD$_3$OH in low-lying torsional states
that is sufficiently accurate to facilitate further searches for CD$_3$OH in space. We performed
a new measurement campaign for CD$_3$OH involving three spectroscopic laboratories that covers
the 34 GHz-1.1 THz and the 20-900 cm$^{-1}$ ranges. The analysis was performed using the torsion-rotation
Hamiltonian model based on the rho-axis method. We determined a model that describes the ground
and first excited torsional states of CD$_3$OH, up to quantum numbers $J \leqslant 55$ and $K_a \leqslant
23$, and we derived a line list for radio-astronomical observations. This list is accurate up to
at least 1.1 THz and should be sufficient for all types of radio-astronomical searches for this methanol
isotopolog. It was used to search for CD$_3$OH in data from the Protostellar Interferometric Line
Survey of IRAS 16293-2422 using ALMA. CD$_3$OH is securely detected in the data, with a large number
of clearly separated and well-reproduced lines. We detected lines belonging to the ground and the
first excited torsional states. The derived abundance of CD$_3$OH relative to non-deuterated
isotopolog confirm the significant enhancement of this multiply deuterated variant. This finding
is in line with other observations of multiply deuterated complex organic molecules and may serve
as an important constraint on their formation models.

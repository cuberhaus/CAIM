Gamma-ray bursts are produced as a result of cataclysmic events such as the collapse of a massive
star or the merger of two neutron stars. We monitored the position of the close-by gamma-ray burst
GRB~190829A, which originated from a massive star collapse, through very long baseline interferometry
(VLBI) observations with the EVN and the VLBA, involving a total of 30 telescopes across 4 continents.
We carried out a total of 9 observations between 9 and 117 days after the gamma-ray burst at 5 and 15
GHz, with a typical resolution of few milliarcseconds (mas). We obtained limits on the source size
and expansion rate. The limits are in agreement with the size evolution entailed by a detailed modelling
of the multi-wavelength light curves with a forward plus reverse shock model, which agrees with
the observations across almost 18 orders of magnitude in frequency (including the High Energy Stereoscopic
System data at TeV photon energies) and more than 4 orders of magnitude in time. Thanks to the broad,
high-cadence coverage of the afterglow, afterglow degeneracies are broken to a large extent, allowing
us to capture some unique physical insights: we find a low prompt emission efficiency $\lesssim
10^{-3}$; we constrain the fraction of electrons that are accelerated to relativistic speeds in
the forward shock to be $\chi_e<13\%$ at the 90\% credible level; we find that the magnetic field
energy density in the reverse shock downstream must decay rapidly after the shock crossing. While
our model assumes an on-axis jet, our VLBI astrometric measurements alone are not sufficiently
tight as to exclude any off-axis viewing angle. On the other hand, we can firmly exclude the line of
sight to have been more than $2\,\mathrm{deg}$ away from the border of the region that produced the
prompt gamma-ray emission based on compactness arguments.

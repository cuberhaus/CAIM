The Atacama Desert has long been established as an excellent site for submillimeter observations.
Yet identifying potentially optimal locations for a new facility within this region can require
long field campaigns that rely on the construction of weather stations and radiometer facilities
to take data over sufficiently long timescales. Meanwhile, high-level remote sensing data products
from satellites have generally only been available at >25 km resolution, limiting their utility
for astronomical site selection. We aim to improve and expedite the process of site selection through
the use of km-resolution satellite data. We analyze the daytime precipitable water vapor (PWV)
values inferred using near-IR measurements from the MODIS Aqua and Terra satellites, comparing
the level-2 satellite products to those from existing ground-based measurements from the radiometer
at the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) site. Since the APEX radiometer data has been extensively
tested and compared to atmospheric transmission models, particularly in low-PWV conditions of
interest for astronomy, we use these data to provide a re-calibration of the MODIS data for the entire
region. After re-calibration, the satellite data allow mapping of the PWV across the region, and
we identify several promising sites. We demonstrate a potentially powerful method for siting new
facilities such as AtLAST and extensions to global very long baseline interferometry networks
like the EHT. Further, our findings identify a trend in both the APEX and MODIS data, and indicate
that the PWV has increased moderately over the past two decades. We verify this trend exists in the
Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) climate models, and show that it is worse
in the case of greater increase in the average global temperature.

Relativistic electrons and magnetic fields permeate the intra-cluster medium (ICM) and manifest
themselves as diffuse sources of synchrotron emission observable at radio wavelengths, namely
radio halos and radio relics. Although there is broad consensus that the formation of these sources
is connected to turbulence and shocks in the ICM, the details of the required particle acceleration,
the strength and morphology of the magnetic field in the cluster volume, and the influence of other
sources of high-energy particles are poorly known. Sufficiently large samples of radio halos and
relics, which would allow us to examine the variation among the source population and pinpoint their
commonalities and differences, are still missing. At present, large numbers of these sources are
easiest to detect at low radio frequencies, where they shine brightly. We examined the low-frequency
radio emission from all 309 clusters in the second catalog of Planck Sunyaev Zel'dovich detected
sources that lie within the 5634 deg$^2$ covered by the Second Data Release of the LOFAR Two-meter
Sky Survey (LoTSS-DR2). We produced LOFAR images at different resolutions, with and without discrete
sources subtracted, and created overlays with optical and X-ray images before classifying the
diffuse sources in the ICM, guided by a decision tree. Overall, we found 83 clusters that host a radio
halo and 26 that host one or more radio relics (including candidates). About half of them are new discoveries.
The detection rate of clusters hosting a radio halo and one or more relics in our sample is $30\pm11$%
and $10\pm6$%, respectively. Extrapolating these numbers, we anticipate that once LoTSS covers
the entire northern sky it will provide the detection of $251\pm92$ clusters hosting a halo and $83\pm50$
clusters hosting at least one relic from Planck clusters alone.

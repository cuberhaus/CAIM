The finding of multiple stellar populations (MP), defined by patterns in the stellar element abundances,
is nowadays considered a distinctive feature of globular clusters. However, while data availability
and quality improved in last decades, this is not always true for the techniques adopted to their
analysis, rising problems of objectivity of the claims and reproducibility. Using NGC 2808 as test
case we show the use of well established statistical clustering methods. We focus the analysis to
the RGB phase, where two data sets are available from recent literature for low- and high-resolution
spectroscopy. We adopt both hierarchical clustering and partition methods. We explicitly address
the usually neglected problem of measurement errors. The results of the clustering algorithms
were subjected to silhouette width analysis to compare the performance of the split into different
number of MP. For both data sets the results are at odd with those reported in the literature. Two MP
are detected for both data sets, while the literature reports five and four MP from high- and low-resolution
spectroscopy respectively. The silhouette analysis suggests that the population sub-structure
is reliable for high-resolution spectroscopy data, while the actual existence of MP is questionable
for the low-resolution spectroscopy data. The discrepancy with literature claims is explainable
due to the difference of methods adopted to MP characterisation. By means of Monte Carlo simulations
and multimodality statistical tests we show that the often adopted study of the histogram of the
differences in some key elements is prone to multiple false positive findings. The adoption of statistically
grounded methods, which adopt all the available information to subset the data and explicitly address
the problem of data uncertainty, is of paramount importance to present more robust and reproducible
researches.

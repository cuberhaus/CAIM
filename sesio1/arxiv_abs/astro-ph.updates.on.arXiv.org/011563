Recent surveys show that wide (>10^4 AU) binaries and triples are abundant in the field. We study
the long-term evolution of wide hierarchical triple systems and the role played by the Galactic
tidal field. We find that when the timescales of the secular von-Ziepel-Lidov-Kozai and the galactic
tide oscillations are comparable, the triple evolution becomes chaotic and extreme eccentricities
can be attained. Consequently, the close pericentre approaches of the inner-binary components
lead to strong interactions, and even mergers or collisions. We use a novel secular evolution code
to quantify the key parameters of triple evolution coupled to the galactic tide, and carry out a population
synthesis study of low and intermediate-mass wide-orbit triples. We find that in ~9% of low-mass
wide-triples the inner main-sequence binaries collide or tidally-inspiral within 10 Gyr, with
direct collisions six times more likely to occur than inspirals. For the intermediate-mass sample,
~7.6 of the systems merge or inspiral with roughly equal probabilities. We find the relative fractions
of different outcomes as a function of their evolutionary stage (Main Sequence, MS; Red Giant, RG;
or White Dwarf, WD), and discuss their transient electromagnetic signatures and the products of
the merger/inspiral. In particular, we find the rate of WD-WD direct-collisions that lead to thermonuclear
type-Ia Supernovae is comparable to other dynamical channels, and accounts for at most 0.1% of the
total rate. RG inspirals provide a novel channel for the formation of eccentric common-envelope-evolution
binaries. We also find that the catalysis of mergers/collisions in triples due to the galactic tide
could explain a significant fraction or even the vast majority of blue-stragglers in the field,
producing progenitors for cataclysmic-variables, and give-rise to mergers and collisions of
double-RG binaries.

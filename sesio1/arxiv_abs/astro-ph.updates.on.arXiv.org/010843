We present an analysis of historical multi-wavelength emission of the Changing Look (CL) Active
Galactic Nucleus (AGN) in NGC 2992, covering epochs ranging from 1978 to 2021, as well as new X-ray
and optical spectra. The galaxy presents multiple Seyfert type transitions from type 2 to intermediate-type,
losing and regaining its H$\alpha$ BEL recurrently. In X-rays, the source shows intrinsic variability
with the absorption corrected luminosity varying by a factor of $\sim$ 40. We rule out tidal disruption
events or variable obscuration as causes of the type transitions and show that the presence and the
flux of the broad H$\alpha$ emission line are directly correlated with the 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity
(L$_{2-10}$): the component disappears at L$_{2-10} \leq 2.6\times10^{42}$\ergcms, this value
translates into an Eddington ratio ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}$) of $\sim$ 1\%. The $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$
in which the BEL transitions occur is the same as the critical value at which there should be a state
transition between a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) and a thin accretion disk,
such similarity suggests that the AGN is operating at the threshold mass accretion rate between
the two accretion modes. We find a correlation between the narrow Fe K$\alpha$ flux and $\lambda_{\rm
Edd}$, and an anti-correlation between full-width at half maximum of H$\alpha$ BEL and $\lambda_{\rm
Edd}$, in agreement with theoretical predictions. Two possible scenarios for type transitions
are compatible with our results: either the dimming of the AGN continuum, which reduces the supply
of ionising photons available to excite the gas in the Broad Line Region (BLR), or the fading of the
BLR structure itself occurs as the low accretion rate is not able to sustain the required cloud flow
rate in a disk-wind BLR model.

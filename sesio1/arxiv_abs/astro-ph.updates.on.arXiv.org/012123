We report on the presence of numerous tiny bright dots in and around an emerging flux region (an X-ray/coronal
bright point) observed with SolO's EUI/\hri\ in 174 \AA. These dots are roundish, have a diameter
of 675$\pm$300 km, a lifetime of 50$\pm$35 seconds, and an intensity enhancement of 30\% $\pm$10\%
above their immediate surroundings. About half of the dots remain isolated during their evolution
and move randomly and slowly ($<$10 \kms). The other half show extensions, appearing as a small loop
or surge/jet, with intensity propagations below 30\,\kms. Many of the bigger and brighter \hri\
dots are discernible in SDO/AIA 171 \AA\ channel, have significant emissivity in the temperature
range of 1--2 MK, and are often located at polarity inversion lines observed in HMI LOS magnetograms.
Although not as pervasive as in observations, Bifrost MHD simulation of an emerging flux region
do show dots in synthetic \fe\ images. These dots in simulation show distinct Doppler signatures
-- blueshifts and redshifts coexist, or a redshift of the order of 10 \kms\ is followed by a blueshift
of similar or higher magnitude. The synthetic images of \oxy\ and \siiv\ lines, which represent
transition region radiation, also show the dots that are observed in \fe\ images, often expanded
in size, or extended as a loop, and always with stronger Doppler velocities (up to 100 \kms) than that
in \fe\ lines. Our observation and simulation results, together with the field geometry of dots
in the simulation, suggest that most dots in emerging flux regions form in the lower solar atmosphere
(at $\approx$1 Mm) by magnetic reconnection between emerging and pre-existing/emerged magnetic
field. Some dots might be manifestations of magneto-acoustic shocks through the line formation
region of \fe\ emission.

The observation of gravitational waves from compact objects has now become an active part of observational
astronomy. For a sound interpretation, one needs to compare such observations against detailed
Numerical Relativity simulations, which are essential tools to explore the dynamics and physics
of compact binary mergers. To date, essentially all simulation codes that solve the full set of Einstein's
equations are performed in the framework of Eulerian hydrodynamics. The exception is our recently
developed Numerical Relativity code \SpB which solves the commonly used BSSN formulation of Einstein
equations on a structured mesh and the matter equations via Lagrangian particles. We show here,
for the first time, \SpB neutron star merger simulations with piecewise polytropic approximations
to four nuclear matter equations of state. We introduce some further methodological refinements
(a new way of steering dissipation, an improved particle-mesh mapping) and we explore the impact
of the exponent that enters in the calculation of the thermal pressure contribution. We find that
it leaves a noticeable imprint on the gravitational wave amplitude (calculated via both quadrupole
approximation and the $\Psi_4$-formalism) and has a noticeable impact on the amount of dynamic
ejecta. Consistent with earlier findings, we only find a few times $10^{-3}$ \Msun as dynamic ejecta
in the studied equal mass binary systems, with softer equations of state (which are more prone to
shock formation) ejecting larger amounts of matter. We also see a credible high-velocity ($\sim0.5
.. 0.7c$) ejecta component of $\sim 10^{-4}$ \Msun in all our cases. Such a high-velocity component
has been suggested to produce an early, blue precursor to the main kilonova emission and it could
also potentially cause a kilonova afterglow.

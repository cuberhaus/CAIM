The presence of light thermally coupled dark matter affects early expansion history and production
of light elements during the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. Specifically, dark matter that annihilates
into Standard Model particles can modify the effective number of light species in the universe $N_\mathrm{eff}$,
as well as the abundance of light elements created buring BBN. These quantities in turn affect the
cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy. We present the first joint analysis of small-scale
temperature and polarization CMB anisotropy from Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and South
Pole Telescope (SPT), together with Planck data and the recent primordial abundance measurements
of helium and deuterium to place comprehensive bounds on the mass of light thermal-relic dark matter.
We consider a range of models, including dark matter that couples to photons and Standard-Model
neutrinos. We find that the combination of ACT, SPT, and Planck generally leads to the most stringent
mass constraint for dark matter that couples to neutrinos, improving the lower limit by 40%-80%,
with respect to previous Planck analyses. On the other hand, the addition of ACT and SPT leads to a
slightly weaker bound on electromagnetically coupled particles, due to a shift in the preferred
values of $Y_\mathrm{p}$ and $N_\mathrm{eff}$ driven by the ground based experiments. Combining
all CMB measurements with primordial abundance measurements, we rule out masses below $\sim$4
MeV at 95% confidence, for all models. We show that allowing for new relativistic species can weaken
the mass bounds for dark matter that couples to photons by up to an order of magnitude or more. Finally,
we discuss the reach of the next generation of the CMB experiments in terms of probing the mass of the
thermal relic dark matter.

With the increase in the number of observed gravitational wave (GW) signals, detecting strongly
lensed GWs by galaxies has become a real possibility. Lens galaxies also contain microlenses (e.g.,
stars and black holes), introducing further frequency-dependent modulations in the strongly
lensed GW signal within the LIGO frequency range. The multiple lensed signals in a given lens system
have different underlying macro-magnifications ($|\mu|$) and are located in varied microlens
densities ($\Sigma_\bullet$), leading to different levels of microlensing distortions. This
work quantifies the fraction of strong lens systems affected by microlensing using realistic mock
observations. We study 50 quadruply imaged systems (quads) by generating 50 realizations for each
lensed signal. However, our conclusions are equally valid for lensed signals in doubly imaged systems
(doubles). The lensed signals studied here have $|\mu|\sim[0.5, 10]$ and $\Sigma_\bullet\sim[10,
10^3]~{\rm M}_\odot/{\rm pc^2}$. We find that the microlensing effects are more sensitive to the
macro-magnification than the underlying microlens density, even if the latter exceeds $10^3~{\rm
M}_\odot/{\rm pc^2}$. The mismatch between lensed and unlensed GW signals rarely exceeds $1\%$
for nearly all binary black hole sources in the total mass range [10 M$_\odot$, 200 M$_\odot$]. This
implies that microlensing is not expected to affect the detection or the parameter estimation of
such signals and does not pose any further challenges in identifying the different lensed counterparts
when macro-magnification is ${\leq}10$. Such a magnification cut is expected to be satisfied by
${\sim}50\%$ of the detectable pairs in quads and ${\sim}90\%$ of the doubles in the fourth observing
run of the LIGO-Virgo detector network.

Galaxy formation depends critically on the physical state of gas in the circumgalactic medium (CGM)
and its interface with the intergalactic medium (IGM), determined by the complex interplay between
inflows from the IGM and outflows from supernovae or AGN feedback. The average Lyman-alpha (Ly-a)
absorption profile around galactic halos represents a powerful tool to probe their gaseous environments.
We compare predictions from Illustris and Nyx hydrodynamical simulations with the observed absorption
around foreground quasars, damped Ly-a systems, and Lyman-break galaxies. We show how large-scale
BOSS and small-scale quasar pair measurements can be combined to precisely constrain the absorption
profile over three decades in transverse distance 20kpc$\lesssim b\lesssim$20Mpc. Far from galaxies
$\gtrsim2$Mpc, the simulations converge to the same profile and provide a reasonable match to the
observations. This asymptotic agreement arises because the $\Lambda$CDM model successfully
describes the ambient IGM, and represents a critical advantage of studying the mean absorption
profile. However, significant differences between the simulations, and between simulations
and observations are present on scales 20kpc$\lesssim b\lesssim$2Mpc, illustrating the challenges
of accurately modeling and resolving galaxy formation physics. It is noteworthy that these differences
are observed as far out as $\sim2$Mpc, indicating that the `sphere-of-influence' of galaxies could
extend to approximately $\sim7$ times the halo virial radius ($\sim100$kpc). Current observations
are very precise on these scales and can thus strongly discriminate between different galaxy formation
models. We demonstrate that the Ly-a absorption profile is primarily sensitive to the underlying
temperature-density relationship of diffuse gas around galaxies, and argue that it thus provides
a fundamental test of galaxy formation models.

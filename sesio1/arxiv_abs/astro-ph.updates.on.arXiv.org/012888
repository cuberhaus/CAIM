Many galaxy properties are known to correlate with the environment in which the galaxies are embedded.
Their cold, neutral gas content, usually assessed through 21cm HI observations, is related to many
other galaxy properties as it is the underlying fuel for star formation. With its high sensitivity
and broad sky coverage the blind Arecibo Galaxy Environment Survey (AGES) survey brings significant
improvement to the census of HI properties of galaxies in a wide range of environments, from voids
to the core of a massive cluster. Here we present an HI census over a volume of ~44000 Mpc$^{3}$ towards
the merging cluster Abell 1367 and the large-scale structure (LSS) surrounding the cluster out
to cz = 20000 km/s. The survey is sensitive down to a column density of N$_{HI}$ = 1.5 x 10$^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$
for emission filling the beam and a line width of 10 km/s. As an approximate mass sensitivity limit,
a member of A1367 (at a distance of 92 Mpc), containing M$_{HI}$ = 2.7x10$^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$ distributed
over a top-hat profile of 50 km/s width would be detected at 4$\sigma$. The results are analysed in
combination with optical spectroscopy data from SDSS which we use to estimate the local galaxy density
based on the Voronoi-Delaunay method. In total we detect 457 HI sources, 213 of which are detected
for the first time by the AGES survey, 134 of which are presented in this article for the first time.
225 of the detections are in the cluster and 232 in the remaining volume surveyed. Here we present
the full catalogue of HI detections and their basic properties, including optical ones. We concentrate
on the difference between the cluster and the foreground and background LSS, revealing a continuous
correlation of HI detected fraction (and HI deficiency) with local galaxy density, independent
of global environment.

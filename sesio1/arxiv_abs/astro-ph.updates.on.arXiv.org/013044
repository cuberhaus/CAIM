Here we collect three unique bursts, GRBs\,060614, 211211A and 211227A, all characterized by a
long-duration main emission (ME) phase and a rebrightening extended emission (EE) phase, to study
their observed properties and the potential origin as neutron star-black hole (NSBH) mergers.
NS-first-born (BH-first-born) NSBH mergers tend to contain fast-spinning (non-spinning) BHs
that more easily (hardly) allow tidal disruption to happen with (without) forming electromagnetic
signals. We find that NS-first-born NSBH mergers can well interpret the origins of these three GRBs,
supported by that: (1) Their X-ray MEs and EEs show unambiguous fall-back accretion signatures,
decreasing as $\propto{t}^{-5/3}$, which might account for their long duration. The EEs can result
from the fall-back accretion of $r$-process heating materials, predicted to occur after NSBH mergers.
(2) The beaming-corrected local event rate density for this type of merger-origin long-duration
GRBs is $\mathcal{R}_0\sim2.4^{+2.3}_{-1.3}\,{\rm{Gpc}}^{-3}\,{\rm{yr}}^{-1}$, consistent
with that of NS-first-born NSBH mergers. (3) Our detailed analysis on the EE, afterglow and kilonova
of the recently high-impact event GRB\,211211A reveals it could be a merger between a $\sim1.17^{+0.13}_{-0.04}\,M_\odot$
NS and a $\sim9.3^{+1.6}_{-1.6}\,M_\odot$ BH with an aligned-spin of $\chi_{\rm{BH}}\sim0.67^{+0.08}_{-0.10}$,
supporting an NS-first-born NSBH formation channel. Long-duration burst with rebrightening
fall-back accretion signature after ME, and bright kilonova might be commonly observed features
for on-axis NSBHs. We estimate the multimessenger detection rate between gravitational waves,
GRBs and kilonovae from NSBH mergers in O4 (O5) is $\sim0.1\,{\rm{yr}}^{-1}$ ($\sim1\,{\rm{yr}}^{-1}$).

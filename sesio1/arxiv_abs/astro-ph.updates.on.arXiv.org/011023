Context. Saturn has an excess of irregular moons. This is thought to be the result of past collisional
events. Debris produced during such episodes in the neighborhood of a host planet may evolve into
co-orbitals trapped into quasi-satellite and/or horseshoe resonant states. A recently announced
centaur, 2013 VZ70, follows an orbit that could be compatible with those of prograde Saturn's co-orbitals.
Aims. We perform an exploration of the short-term dynamical evolution of 2013 VZ70 to confirm or
reject a co-orbital relationship with Saturn. A possible connection with Saturn's irregular moon
population is also investigated. Methods. We studied the evolution of 2013 VZ70 backward and forward
in time using N-body simulations, factoring the uncertainties into the calculations. We computed
the distribution of mutual nodal distances between this centaur and a sample of moons. Results.
We confirm that 2013 VZ70 is currently trapped in a horseshoe resonant state with respect to Saturn,
but it is a transient co-orbital. We also find that 2013 VZ70 may become a quasi-satellite of Saturn
in the future and that it may experience brief periods of capture as a temporary irregular moon. This
centaur might also pass relatively close to known irregular moons of Saturn. Conclusions. Although
an origin in trans-Neptunian space is possible, the hostile resonant environment characteristic
of Saturn's neighborhood favors a scenario of in situ formation via impact, fragmentation, or tidal
disruption as 2013 VZ70 can experience encounters with Saturn at very low relative velocity. An
analysis of its orbit within the context of those of the moons of Saturn suggests that 2013 VZ70 could
be related to the Inuit group. Also, the mutual nodal distances of 2013 VZ70 and the moons Fornjot
and Thrymr are below the 1st percentile of the distribution.

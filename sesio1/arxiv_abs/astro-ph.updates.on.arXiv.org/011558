Revealing the 3D dynamics of HII regions and their associated molecular clouds is important for
understanding the longstanding problem as to how stellar feedback affects the density structure
and kinematics of the interstellar medium. We employed observations of the HII region RCW 120 in
[CII], observed within the SOFIA legacy program FEEDBACK, and the $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO (3$\to$2)
lines, obtained with APEX. In addition we used HI data from the Southern Galactic Plane Survey. Two
radiative transfer models were used to fit the observed data. A line profile analysis with the 1D
non-LTE radiative transfer code SimLine proves that the CO emission cannot stem from a spherically
symmetric molecular cloud configuration. With a two-layer multicomponent model, we then quantified
the amount of warm background and cold foreground gas. There is a deficit of CO emission along the
line-of-sight toward the center of the HII region which indicates that the HII region is associated
with a flattened molecular cloud. Self-absorption in the CO line may hide signatures of infalling
and expanding molecular gas. The [CII] emission arises from an expanding [CII] bubble and from the
PDRs. A significant part of [CII] emission is absorbed in a cool (~60-100 K), low-density (<500 cm$^{-3}$)
atomic foreground layer with a thickness of a few parsec. We propose that the RCW 120 HII region formed
in a flattened molecular cloud and is now bursting out of its parental cloud. The compressed surrounding
molecular layer formed a torus around the spherically expanding HII bubble. This scenario can possibly
be generalized for other HII bubbles and would explain the observed "flat" structure of molecular
clouds associated with HII bubbles. We suggest that the [CII] absorption observed in many star-forming
regions is at least partly caused by low-density, cool, HI-envelopes surrounding the molecular
clouds.

Nonlinear force-free (NLFF) modeling is regularly used in order to indirectly infer the 3D geometry
of the coronal magnetic field, not accessible on a regular basis by means of direct measurements
otherwise. We study the effect of binning in time series NLFF modeling of individual active regions
(ARs) in order to quantify the effect of a different underlying spatial sampling on the quality of
modeling as well as on the derived physical parameters. We apply an optimization method to sequences
of SDO/HMI vector magnetogram data at three different plate scales for three solar ARs to obtain
nine NLFF model time series. From the NLFF models, we deduce active-region magnetic fluxes, electric
currents, magnetic energies and relative helicities, and analyze those with respect to the underlying
spatial sampling. We calculate various metrics to quantify the quality of the derived NLFF models
and apply a Helmholtz decomposition to characterize solenoidal errors. At a given spatial sampling,
the quality of NLFF modeling is different for different ARs, as well as varies along of the individual
model time series. For a given AR, modeling at a given spatial sampling is not necessarily of superior
quality compared to that performed with a different plate scale. Generally, the NLFF model quality
tends to be higher for larger pixel sizes with the solenoidal quality being the ultimate cause for
systematic variations in model-deduced physical quantities. Optimization-based modeling based
on binned SDO/HMI vector data delivers magnetic energies and helicity estimates different by $\lesssim$30\%,
given that concise checks ensure the physical plausibility and high solenoidal quality of the tested
model. Thus, spatial-sampling-induced differences are relatively small compared to that arising
from other sources of uncertainty.

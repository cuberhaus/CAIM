Future and on-going infrared and radio observatories such as JWST, METIS or ALMA will increase the
amount of rest-frame IR spectroscopic data for galaxies by several orders of magnitude. While studies
of the chemical composition of the ISM based on optical observations have been widely spread over
decades for SFG and, more recently, for AGN, similar studies need to be performed using IR data. This
regime can be especially useful in the case of AGN given that it is less affected by temperature and
dust extinction, traces higher ionic species and can also provide robust estimations of the chemical
abundance ratio N/O. We present a new tool based on a bayesian-like methodology to estimate chemical
abundances from IR emission lines in AGN. We use a sample of 58 AGN with IR spectroscopic data retrieved
from the literature to probe the validity of our method. The estimations of the chemical abundances
based on IR lines in our sample are later compared with the corresponding abundances derived from
the optical emission lines in the same objects. HII-CHI-Mistry-IR takes advantage of photoionization
models, characterized by the chemical abundance ratios O/H and N/O and the ionization parameter
$U$, to compare their predicted emission-line fluxes with a set of observed values. Instead of matching
single emission lines, the code uses some specific emission-line ratios sensitive to the above
free parameters. We report mainly solar and also subsolar abundances for O/H in the nuclear region
for our sample of AGN, whereas N/O clusters around solar values. We find a discrepancy between the
chemical abundances derived from IR and optical emission lines, being the latter higher than the
former. This discrepancy, also reported by previous studies of the composition of the ISM in AGN
from IR observations, is independent from the gas density or the incident radiation field to the
gas.

Mergers of black hole-neutron star (BHNS) binaries have now been observed by GW detectors with the
recent announcement of GW200105 and GW200115. Such observations not only provide confirmation
that these systems exist, but will also give unique insights into the death of massive stars, the
evolution of binary systems and their possible association with gamma-ray bursts, $r$-process
enrichment and kilonovae. Here we perform binary population synthesis of isolated BHNS systems
in order to present their merger rate and characteristics for ground-based GW observatories. We
present the results for 420 different model permutations that explore key uncertainties in our
assumptions about massive binary star evolution (e.g. mass transfer, common-envelope evolution,
supernovae), and the metallicity-specific star formation rate density, and characterize their
relative impacts on our predictions. We find intrinsic local BHNS merger rates spanning $\mathcal{R}_{\rm{m}}^0
\approx 4$-$830\,\rm{Gpc}^{-3}\,\rm{yr}^{-1}$ for our full range of assumptions. This encompasses
the rate inferred from recent BHNS GW detections, and would yield detection rates of $\mathcal{R}_{\rm{det}}
\approx 1$-$180\, \rm{yr}^{-1}$ for a GW network consisting of LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA at design sensitivity.
We find that the binary evolution and metallicity-specific star formation rate density each impact
the predicted merger rates by order $\mathcal{O}(10)$. We also present predictions for the GW detected
BHNS merger properties and find that all 420 model variations predict that $\lesssim 5\%$ of the
BHNS mergers have BH masses $\gtrsim 18\,M_{\odot}$, total masses $ \gtrsim 20\,M_{\odot}$, chirp
masses $\gtrsim 5.5\,M_{\odot}$, mass ratios $ \gtrsim 12$ or $\lesssim 2$. Moreover, we find that
massive NSs $\gtrsim 2\,M_{\odot}$ are expected to be commonly detected in BHNS mergers in almost
all our model variations.

Nonlinear force-free (NLFF) modeling is regularly used in order to indirectly infer the 3D geometry
of the coronal magnetic field, not accessible on a regular basis by means of direct measurements
otherwise. We study the effect of binning in time series NLFF modeling of individual active regions
(ARs) in order to quantify the effect of a different underlying spatial resolution on the quality
of modeling as well as on the derived physical parameters. We apply an optimization method to sequences
of SDO/HMI vector magnetogram data at three different spatial resolutions for three solar ARs to
obtain nine NLFF model time series. From the NLFF models, we deduce active-region magnetic fluxes,
electric currents, magnetic energies and relative helicities, and analyze those with respect
to the underlying spatial resolution. We calculate various metrics to quantify the quality of the
derived NLFF models and apply a Helmholtz decomposition to characterize solenoidal errors. At
a given spatial resolution, the quality of NLFF modeling is different for different ARs, as well
as varies along of the individual model time series. For a given AR, modeling at a given spatial resolution
is not necessarily of superior quality compared to that performed at different spatial resolutions
at all time instances of a NLFF model time series. Generally, the NLFF model quality tends to be higher
at reduced spatial resolution with the solenoidal quality being the ultimate cause for systematic
variations in model-deduced physical quantities. Optimization-based modeling based on binned
SDO/HMI vector data delivers magnetic energies and helicity estimates different by $\lesssim$30\%,
given that concise checks ensure the physical plausibility and high solenoidal quality of the tested
model. Spatial-resolution induced differences are relatively small compared to that arising
from other sources of uncertainty.

We perform cosmological zoom-in simulations of $19$ relaxed cluster-mass haloes with the inclusion
of adiabatic gas within the cold dark matter (CDM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models.
These clusters are selected as dynamically relaxed clusters from a parent simulation and have typical
masses of $M_{\rm 200} \simeq 1\operatorname{-}3\times 10^{15}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$. We find that
both the dark matter and the intracluster gas distributions in SIDM are more spherical than their
CDM counterparts, although the difference is smaller for the gas. Mock X-ray images are generated
based on the simulations and are compared to the real X-ray images of $84$ relaxed clusters selected
from the Chandra and ROSAT archives. We perform ellipse fitting for the isophotes of mock and real
X-ray images and obtain the ellipticities at cluster-centric radii of $r\simeq 0.1\operatorname{-}0.2\,R_{\rm
200}$. The X-ray isophotes in SIDM models with increasing cross-sections are rounder than their
CDM counterparts, which manifests as a systematic shift in the distribution function of ellipticities.
Unexpectedly, the X-ray morphology of the observed "non-peaky" (non-cool-core) clusters agrees
better with SIDM models with cross-section per unit mass $(\sigma/m)= 0.5\operatorname{-}1~{\rm
cm}^2/{\rm g}$ than CDM and SIDM with $(\sigma/m)=0.1\,{\rm cm}^2/{\rm g}$. Our statistical analysis
indicates that the latter two models are disfavored at least at the $68\%$ confidence level. This
conclusion is not altered by shifting the radial range of measurements or applying temperature
selection criterion. However, the primary uncertainty originates from the lack of baryonic physics
in the adiabatic model, such as gas cooling, star formation and feedback effects, which have the
potential to reconcile CDM simulations with observations.

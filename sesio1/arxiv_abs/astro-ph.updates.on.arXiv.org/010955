During the survey phase of the Kepler mission, several thousands of stars were observed in short
cadence, allowing the detection of solar-like oscillations in more than 500 main-sequence and
sub-giant stars. Later, the Kepler Science Office discovered an issue in the calibration that affected
half of the short-cadence data, leading to a new data release (DR25) with improved corrections.
We re-analyze the one-month time series of the Kepler survey phase to search for new solar-like oscillations.
We study the seismic parameters of 99 stars (46 targets with new reported solar-like oscillations)
increasing by around 8% the known sample of solar-like stars with asteroseismic analysis of the
short-cadence data from Kepler. We compute the masses and radii using seismic scaling relations
and find that this new sample populates the massive stars (above 1.2Ms and up to 2Ms) and subgiant
phase. We determine the granulation parameters and amplitude of the modes, which agree with previously
derived scaling relations. The stars studied here are slightly fainter than the previously known
sample of main-sequence and subgiants with asteroseismic detections. We also study the surface
rotation and magnetic activity levels of those stars. Our sample of has similar levels of activity
compared to the previously known sample and in the same range as the Sun between the minimum and maximum
of its activity cycle. We find that for 7 stars, a possible blend could be the reason for the previous
non detection. We compare the radii obtained from the scaling relations with the Gaia ones and find
that the Gaia radii are overestimated by 4.4% on average compared to the seismic radii and a decreasing
trend with evolutionary stage. We re-analyze the DR25 of the main-sequence and sub-giant stars
with solar-like oscillations previously detected and provide their global seismic parameters
for a total of 526 stars.

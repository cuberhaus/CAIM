Faraday tomography of radio polarimetric data below 200 MHz from LOFAR are providing us with a new
perspective on the diffuse and magnetized interstellar medium (ISM). Of particular interest is
the discovery of Faraday-rotated synchrotron polarization associated with neutral gas, as traced
by atomic hydrogen (HI) and dust. Here we present the first in-depth numerical study of these LOFAR
results. We produce and analyze comprehensive synthetic observations of low-frequency synchrotron
polarization from MHD simulations of colliding super shells in the multiphase ISM. We define five
distinct gas phases over more than four orders of magnitude in gas temperature and density, ranging
from hot, and warm, fully ionized gas to cold neutral medium. We focus on the contribution of each
gas phase to synthetic observations of both rotation measure and synchrotron polarized intensity
below 200 MHz. We also investigate the link between the latter and synthetic observations of optically
thin HI gas. We find that, not only the fully ionized gas but also the warm partially ionized and neutral
phases strongly contribute to the total rotation measure and polarized intensity. However, the
contribution of each phase to the observables strongly depends on the choice of integration axis
and the orientation of the mean magnetic field with respect to the shell-collision axis. Strong
correlation between HI synthetic data and synchrotron polarized intensity, reminiscent of LOFAR
results, is obtained with lines of sight perpendicular to the mean magnetic field direction. Our
study suggests that multiphase modelling of MHD processes is needed in order to interpret observations
of the radio sky at low frequency. This work is a first step toward understanding the complexity of
low-frequency synchrotron emission that will be soon revolutionized by large-scale surveys with
LOFAR and the SKA.

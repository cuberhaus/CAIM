During solar flares plasma is typically heated to very high temperatures, and the resulting redistribution
of energy via thermal conduction is a primary mechanism transporting energy throughout the flaring
solar atmosphere. The thermal flux is usually modeled using Spitzer's theory, which is based on
local Coulomb collisions between the electrons carrying the thermal flux and those in the background.
However, often during flares, temperature gradients become sufficiently steep that the collisional
mean free path exceeds the temperature gradient scale size, so that thermal conduction becomes
inherently non-local. Further, turbulent angular scattering, which is detectable in nonthermal
widths of atomic emission lines, can also act to increase the collision frequency and so suppress
the heat flux. Recent work by Emslie & Bian (2018) extended Spitzer's theory of thermal conduction
to account for both non-locality and turbulent suppression. We have implemented their theoretical
expression for the heat flux (which is a convolution of the Spitzer flux with a kernel function) into
the RADYN flare-modeling code and performed a parameter study to understand how the resulting changes
in thermal conduction affect flare dynamics and hence the radiation produced. We find that models
with reduced heat fluxes predict slower bulk flows, less intense line emission, and longer cooling
times. By comparing features of atomic emission lines predicted by the models with Doppler velocities
and nonthermal line widths deduced from a particular flare observation, we find that models with
suppression factors between 0.3 to 0.5 relative to the Spitzer value best reproduce observed Doppler
velocities across emission lines forming over a wide range of temperatures. Interestingly, the
model that best matches observed nonthermal line widths has a kappa-type velocity distribution
function.

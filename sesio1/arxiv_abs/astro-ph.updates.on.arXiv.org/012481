In this work we study the stellar mass -- metallicity relation (MZR) of an extended sample of star-forming
galaxies in the local Universe and its possible dependence with the star formation rate (SFR). A
sample of $\sim$195000 Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) star-forming galaxies has been selected
up to z=0.22 with the aim of analysing the behaviour of the relation of MZR with respect to SFR and taking
into account the age of their stellar populations. For this sample we have obtained, for the first
time, aperture corrected oxygen and nitrogen-to-oxygen abundances (O/H and N/O, respectively)
and SFR using the empirical prescriptions from the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area (CALIFA)
survey. To perform this study we make use also of the stellar mass of the galaxies and the parameter
Dn(4000) as a proxy of the age of the stellar population. We derive a robust MZR locus, which is found
to be fully consistent with the "anchoring" points of a selected set of well studied nearby galaxies
with a direct derivation of the chemical abundance. A complex relation between MZR and SFR across
the whole range of galaxy mass and metallicity has been observed, where the slope changes seen in
the O/H -- SFR plane present a pattern which seems to be tuned to the galaxies' stellar age, and therefore,
stellar age has to be taken into account in the stellar mass -- metallicity -- SFR relation. In order
to provide an answer to the question of whether or not the MZR depends on the SFR it is essential to take
into account the age of the stellar populations of galaxies. A strong dependence between the MZR
and SFR is observed mainly for star-forming galaxies with strong SFR values and low Dn(4000). The
youngest galaxies of our SDSS sample show the highest SFR measured for their stellar mass.

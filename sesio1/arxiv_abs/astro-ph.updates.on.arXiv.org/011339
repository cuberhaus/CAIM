We explore a new approach for extracting reionization-era contributions to the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
(kSZ) effect. Our method utilizes the cross-power spectrum between filtered and squared maps of
the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and photometric galaxy surveys during the Epoch of Reionization
(EoR). This kSZ$^2$-galaxy cross-power spectrum statistic has been successfully detected at
lower redshifts ($z \lesssim 1.5$). Here we extend this method to $z \gtrsim 6$ as a potential means
to extract signatures of patchy reionization. We model the expected signal across multiple photometric
redshift bins using semi-numeric simulations of the reionization process. In principle, the cross-correlation
statistic robustly extracts reionization-era contributions to the kSZ signal, while its redshift
evolution yields valuable information regarding the timing of reionization. Specifically, the
model cross-correlation signal near $\ell \sim 1,000$ peaks during the early stages of the EoR,
when about 20% of the volume of the universe is ionized. Detectible $\ell$-modes mainly reflect
squeezed triangle configurations of the related bispectrum, quantifying correlations between
the galaxy overdensity field on large scales and the smaller-scale kSZ power. We forecast the prospects
for detecting this signal using future wide-field samples of Lyman-break galaxies from the Roman
Space Telescope and next-generation CMB surveys including the Simons Observatory, CMB-S4, and
CMB-HD. We find that a roughly 13$\sigma$ detection is possible for CMB-HD and Roman after summing
over all $\ell$-modes. We discuss the possibilities for improving this approach and related statistics,
with the aim of moving beyond simple detections to measure the scale and redshift dependence of the
cross-correlation signals.

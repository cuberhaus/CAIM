The atomic-to-molecular hydrogen (H/H2) transition has been extensively studied as it controls
the fraction of gas in molecular state in an interstellar cloud. This fraction is linked to star-formation
by the Schmidt-Kennicutt law. While theoretical estimates (Sternberg et al. 2014) of the column
density of the H I layer have been proposed for static photodissociation regions (PDRs), Herschel
and well-resolved ALMA observations have revealed dynamical effects in star forming regions,
caused by the process of photo-evaporation. We extend the analytic study of the H/H2 transition
to include the effects of the propagation of the ionization front, in particular in presence of photo-evaporation
at the walls of blister H II regions, and find its consequences on the total atomic hydrogen column
density at the surface of clouds in presence of a UV field, and on the properties of the H/H2 transition.
We solve semi-analytically the differential equation giving the H2 column density profile taking
into account H2 formation on grains, H2 photodissociation and the ionization front propagation
dynamics modeled as an advection of the gas through the ionization front. Taking into account this
advection reduces the width of the atomic region compared to static models. The atomic region may
disappear if the ionization front velocity exceeds a certain value, leading the H/H2 transition
and the ionization front to merge. For both dissociated and merged configurations, we provide analytical
expressions to determine the total H I column density. Our results take into account the metallicity.
Finally, we compared our results to observations of PDRs illuminated by O-stars, for which we concluded
that the dynamical effects are strong, especially for low-excitation PDRs.

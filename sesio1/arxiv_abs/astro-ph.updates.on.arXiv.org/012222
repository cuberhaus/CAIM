We report on IRAM-30m/EMIR observations of 38 red Herschel sources in 18 Planck-selected protocluster
candidates (PHz). We detect 40 CO lines on a total of 24 bright Herschel sources in 14 of the 18 PHz fields.
The measured average redshift is <z>=2.25. We measure redshifts for multiple Herschel sources
in eight PHz fields. In half of those fields we detect from two to three objects at similar redshifts,
supporting the idea that they contain high-z protoclusters. The detection of sources at different
redshifts demonstrates that foreground and background sources also contribute to the total sub-mm
emission. We compare the properties of the molecular gas, and of the star formation activity of our
sources with samples of normal star-forming galaxies (SFGs), sub-mm galaxies, and CO-detected
cluster and protocluster galaxies at similar redshifts. We find that the PHz-IRAM sources are mainly
normal SFGs, with only ~20% undergoing a starburst phase. The PHz-IRAM sources are characterized
by star formation rates and gas masses that are, on average, eight and five times higher than those
typical of normal SFGs at similar redshifts. Their dust temperatures, and depletion timescales
are instead consistent with those of normal SFGs. The analysis of the CO spectral line energy distribution,
available for ten sources, peaks at Jup=3 in most of the cases, implying low gas excitation. These
properties imply that a significant fraction of the PHz-IRAM sources contains extended, and cold
molecular gas reservoirs at low excitation, and that their star-formation is driven by secular
processes. Multiplicity and moderate gravitational lensing might also play a role in producing
the observed properties. We find that the highest star-forming protoclusters drawn from the large
volume simulations, have similar SFRs as the PHz protoclusters, but separate out into a larger number
of SFGs. (Abridged)

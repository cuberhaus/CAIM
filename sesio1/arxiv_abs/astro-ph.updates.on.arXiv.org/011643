Compact star formation appears to be generally common in dusty star-forming galaxies (SFGs). However,
its role in the framework set by the scaling relations in galaxy evolution remains to be understood.
In this work we follow up on the galaxy sample from the GOODS-ALMA 2.0 survey, an ALMA blind survey
at 1.1mm covering a continuous area of 72.42arcmin$^2$ using two array configurations. We derived
physical properties, such as star formation rates, gas fractions, depletion timescales, and dust
temperatures for the galaxy sample built from the survey. There exists a subset of galaxies that
exhibit starburst-like short depletion timescales, but they are located within the scatter of
the so-called main sequence of SFGs. These are dubbed starbursts in the main sequence and display
the most compact star formation and they are characterized by the shortest depletion timescales,
lowest gas fractions, and highest dust temperatures of the galaxy sample, compared to typical SFGs
at the same stellar mass and redshift. They are also very massive, accounting for $\sim 60\%$ of the
most massive galaxies in the sample ($\log (M_{\rm{*}}/M_{\odot}) > 11.0$). We find trends between
the areas of the ongoing star formation regions and the derived physical properties for the sample,
unveiling the role of compact star formation as a physical driver of these properties. Starbursts
in the main sequence appear to be the extreme cases of these trends. We discuss possible scenarios
of galaxy evolution to explain the results drawn from our galaxy sample. Our findings suggest that
the star formation rate is sustained in SFGs by gas and star formation compression, keeping them
within the main sequence even when their gas fractions are low and they are presumably on the way to
quiescence.

Stock 2 is a little-studied open cluster that shows an extended main-sequence turnoff (eMSTO).
In order to investigate this phenomenon and characterise the cluster itself we performed high-resolution
spectroscopy in the framework of the Stellar Population Astrophysics (SPA) project. We employed
the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher in North hemisphere spectrograph (HARPS-N)
at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG). We completed our observations with additional spectra
taken with the Catania Astrophysical Observatory Spectrograph (CAOS). In total we observed 46
stars (dwarfs and giants), which represent, by far, the largest sample collected for this cluster
to date. We provide the stellar parameters, extinction, radial and projected rotational velocities
for most of the stars. Chemical abundances for 21 species with atomic numbers up to 56 have also been
derived. We notice a differential reddening in the cluster field whose average value is 0.27 mag.
It seems to be the main responsible for the observed eMSTO, since it cannot be explained as the result
of different rotational velocities, as found in other clusters. We estimate an age for Stock 2 of
450$\pm$150 Ma which corresponds to a MSTO stellar mass of $\approx$2.8 M$_{\odot}$. The cluster
mean radial velocity is around 8.0 km s$^{-1}$. We find a solar-like metallicity for the cluster,
[Fe/H]=$-$0.07$\pm$0.06, compatible with its Galactocentric distance. MS stars and giants show
chemical abundances compatible within the errors, with the exceptions of Barium and Strontium,
which are clearly overabundant in giants, and Cobalt, which is only marginally overabundant. Finally,
Stock 2 presents a chemical composition fully compatible with that observed in other open clusters
of the Galactic thin disc.

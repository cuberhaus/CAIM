Most galaxies host supermassive black holes in their nuclei and are subject to mergers, which can
produce a supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB), and hence periodic signatures due to orbital
motion. We report unique periodic flux density variations in the blazar PKS 2131-021, which strongly
suggest a SMBHB with an orbital separation of $\sim 0.001-0.01$ pc. Our well-sampled, 45.1-year,
14.5-15.5 GHz, light curve shows two epochs of strong sinusoidal variation with the same period
to within <2%, and the same phase to within $\sim 10\%$, straddling a 22-year period when this periodic
variation was absent. We generated simulated light curves that accurately reproduce the "red noise"
character of the radio light curve of this object, and carried out Lomb-Scargle, weighted wavelet
Z transform, and least-squares sine wave analyses that demonstrate conclusively, at the $4.6\sigma$
significance level, that the periodicity in this object is not due to random fluctuations, but to
a physical periodicity in the source. The observed period measured across the whole 45.1-year span
of our observations is $4.758\pm 0.007$ years (i.e., $\delta P/P \sim 1.5 \times 10^{-3}$), translating
to $2.082\pm 0.003$ years in the rest frame of PKS 2131-021. While periodic variations are expected
from a SMBHB, the periodic variation in PKS 2131-021 is remarkably sinusoidal, which should provide
important insights into this system. We present a model for the putative SMBHB, in which the orbital
motion, when combined with the strong Doppler boosting of the approaching relativistic jet, produces
a sine-wave modulation in the flux density which easily accounts for the amplitude of the observed
modulation. Given the rapidly-developing field of gravitational wave experiments with pulsar
timing arrays, closer counterparts to PKS 2131-021 and searches using the techniques we have developed
are strongly motivated.

SN\,2020qlb (ZTF20abobpcb) is a hydrogen-poor superluminous supernova (SLSN-I) that is among
the most luminous (maximum M$_{g} = -22.25$ mag) and that has one of the longest rise times (77 days
from explosion to maximum). We estimate the total radiated energy to be $>2.1\times10^{51}$ ergs.
SN\,2020qlb has a well-sampled light curve that exhibits clear undulations, a phenomenon seen
in other SLSNe, whose physical origin is still unknown. We discuss the potential power source of
this immense explosion as well as the mechanisms behind its observed light curve undulations. We
analyze photospheric spectra and compare them to other SLSNe-I. We construct the bolometric light
curve using photometry from a large data set of observations from the Zwicky Transient Facility
(ZTF), Liverpool Telescope (LT) and Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and compare it with radioactive,
circumstellar interaction and magnetar models. Model residuals and light curve polynomial fit
residuals are analyzed to estimate the undulation timescale and amplitude. We also determine host
galaxy properties based on imaging and spectroscopy data, including a detection of the [O III]$\lambda$4363\AA\,
auroral line, allowing for a direct metallicity estimate. We rule out the Arnett $^{56}$Ni decay
model for SN\,2020qlb's light curve due to unphysical parameter results. Our most favored power
source is the magnetic dipole spin-down energy deposition of a magnetar. Two to three near peak oscillations,
intriguingly similar to those of SN\,2015bn, were found in the magnetar model residuals with a timescale
of $32\pm6$ days and an amplitude of 6$\%$ of peak luminosity. We rule out centrally located undulation
sources due to timescale considerations; and we favor the result of ejecta interactions with circumstellar
material (CSM) density fluctuations as the source of the undulations.

High-density cores (HDCs) of galaxy superclusters that embed rich clusters and groups of galaxies
are the earliest large objects to form in the cosmic web, and the largest objects that may collapse
in the present or future. We study the dynamical state and possible evolution of the HDCs in the BOSS
Great Wall (BGW) superclusters at redshift $z \approx 0.5$ in order to understand the growth and
evolution of structures in the Universe. We derived the density contrast values for the spherical
collapse model in a wide range of redshifts and used these values to study the dynamical state and
possible evolution of the HDCs of the BGW superclusters. The masses of the HDCs were calculated using
stellar masses of galaxies in them. We found the masses and radii of the turnaround and future collapse
regions in the HDCs and compared them with those of local superclusters. We determined eight HDCs
in the BGW superclusters. The masses of their turnaround regions are in the range of $M_{\mathrm{T}}
\approx 0.4 - 3.3\times~10^{15}h^{-1}M_\odot,$ and radii are in the range of $R_{\mathrm{T}}
\approx 3.5 - 7 h^{-1}$Mpc. The radii of their future collapse regions are in the range of $R_{\mathrm{FC}}
\approx 4 - 8h^{-1}$Mpc. Distances between individual cores in superclusters are much larger:
of the order of $25 - 35h^{-1}$Mpc. The richness and sizes of the HDCs are comparable with those of
the HDCs of the richest superclusters in the local Universe. The BGW superclusters will probably
evolve to several poorer superclusters with masses similar to those of the local superclusters.
This may weaken the tension with the $\Lambda$CDM model, which does not predict a large number of
very rich and large superclusters in our local cosmic neighbourhood, and explains why there are
no superclusters as elongated as those in the BGW in the local Universe.

Optically luminous quasars at $z > 5$ are important probes of super-massive black hole (SMBH) formation.
With new and future radio facilities, the discovery of the brightest low-frequency radio sources
in this epoch would be an important new probe of cosmic reionization through 21-cm absorption experiments.
In this work, we systematically study the low-frequency radio properties of a sample of 115 known
spectroscopically confirmed $z>5$ quasars using the second data release of the Low Frequency Array
(LOFAR) Two Metre Sky survey (LoTSS-DR2), reaching noise levels of $\sim$80 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$
(at 144 MHz) over an area of $\sim5720$ deg$^2$. We find that 41 sources (36%) are detected in LoTSS-DR2
at $>2 \sigma$ significance and we explore the evolution of their radio properties (power, spectral
index, and radio loudness) as a function of redshift and rest-frame ultra-violet properties. We
obtain a median spectral index of $-0.29^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$ by stacking 93 quasars using LoTSS-DR2
and Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty Centimetres (FIRST) data at 1.4 GHz, in line with observations
of quasars at $z<3$. We compare the radio loudness of the high-$z$ quasar sample to a lower-$z$ quasar
sample at $z\sim2$ and find that the two radio loudness distributions are consistent with no evolution,
although the low number of high-z quasars means that we cannot rule out weak evolution. Furthermore,
we make a first order empirical estimate of the $z=6$ quasar radio luminosity function, which is
used to derive the expected number of high-$z$ sources that will be detected in the completed LoTSS
survey. This work highlights the fact that new deep radio observations can be a valuable tool in selecting
high-$z$ quasar candidates for follow-up spectroscopic observations by decreasing contamination
of stellar dwarfs and reducing possible selection biases introduced by strict colour cuts.

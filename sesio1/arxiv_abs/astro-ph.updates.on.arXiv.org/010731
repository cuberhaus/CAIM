Context: Observations of auroral emissions are powerful means to remotely sense the space plasma
environment around planetary bodies and ultracool dwarfs. Therefore successful searches and
characterization of aurorae outside the Solar System will open new avenues in the area of extrasolar
space physics. Aims: We aim to demonstrate that brown dwarfs are ideal objects to search for UV aurora
outside the Solar System. We specifically search for UV aurora on the late-type T6.5 brown dwarf
2MASS J12373919+6526148 (in the following 2MASS J1237+6526). Methods: Introducing a parameter
referred to as auroral power potential, we derive scaling models for auroral powers for rotationally
driven aurora applicable to a broad range of wavelengths. We also analyze Hubble Space Telescope
observations obtained with the STIS camera at near-UV, far-UV, and Ly-$\alpha$ wavelengths of
2MASS J1237+6526. Results: We show that brown dwarfs, due to their typically strong surface magnetic
fields and fast rotation, can produce auroral UV powers on the order of 10$^{19}$ watt or more. Considering
their negligible thermal UV emission, their potentially powerful auroral emissions make brown
dwarfs ideal candidates for detecting extrasolar aurorae. We find possible emission from 2MASS
J1237+6526, but cannot conclusively attribute it to the brown dwarf due to low signal-to-noise
values in combination with nonsystematic trends in the background fluxes. The observations provide
upper limits for the emission at various UV wavelength bands. The upper limits for the emission correspond
to a UV luminosity of $\sim$1 $\times$ 10$^{19}$ watt, which lies in the range of the theoretically
expected values. Conclusions: The possible auroral emission from the dwarf could be produced by
a close-in companion and/or magnetospheric transport processes.

Context: Grids of stellar models, computed with the same physical ingredients, allow one to study
the impact of a given physics on a broad range of initial conditions and are a key ingredient for modeling
the evolution of galaxies. Aims: We present a grid of single star models for masses between 0.8 and
120 $M_\odot$, with and without rotation for a mass fraction of heavy element Z=0.006, representative
of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Methods: We used the Geneva stellar evolution code. The evolution
was computed until the end of the central carbon-burning phase, the early asymptotic giant branch
phase, or the core helium-flash for massive, intermediate, and low mass stars, respectively. Results:
The outputs of the present stellar models are well framed by the outputs of the two grids obtained
by our group for metallicities above and below the one considered here. The models of the present
work provide a good fit to the nitrogen surface enrichments observed during the main sequence for
stars in the LMC with initial masses around 15 $M_\odot$. They also reproduce the slope of the luminosity
function of red supergiants of the LMC well, which is a feature that is sensitive to the time-averaged
mass loss rate over the red supergiant phase. The most massive black hole that can be formed from the
present models at Z=0.006 is around 55 $M_\odot$. No model in the range of mass considered will enter
into the pair-instability supernova regime, while the minimal mass to enter the region of pair pulsation
instability is around 60 $M_\odot$ for the rotating models and 85 $M_\odot$ for the nonrotating
ones. Conclusions: The present models are of particular interest for comparisons with observations
in the LMC and also in the outer regions of the Milky Way. We provide public access to numerical tables
that can be used for computing interpolated tracks and for population synthesis studies.

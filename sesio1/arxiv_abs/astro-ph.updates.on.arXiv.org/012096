On the one hand, several types of global-scale inertial modes of oscillation have been observed
on the Sun. They include the equatorial Rossby modes, critical-latitude modes, and high-latitude
modes. On the other hand, the columnar convective modes (predicted by simulations; also known as
banana cells or thermal Rossby waves) remain elusive. We aim to investigate the influence of turbulent
diffusivities, non-adiabatic stratification, differential rotation, and a latitudinal entropy
gradient on the linear global modes of the rotating solar convection zone. We solve numerically
for the eigenmodes of a rotating compressible fluid inside a spherical shell. We identify modes
in the inertial frequency range including the columnar convective modes, as well as modes of mixed
character. The corresponding mode dispersion relations and eigenfunctions are computed for azimuthal
orders $m \leq 16$. The three main results are as follows. Firstly, we find that, for $m \gtrsim 5$,
the radial dependence of the equatorial Rossby modes with no radial node ($n=0$) is radically changed
from the traditional expectation ($r^m$) for turbulent diffusivities $\gtrsim 10^{12}$ cm$^2$
s$^{-1}$. Secondly, we find mixed modes, i.e. modes that share properties of the equatorial Rossby
modes with one radial node ($n=1$) and the columnar convective modes. Thirdly, we show that the $m=1$
high-latitude mode in the model is consistent with the solar observations when the latitudinal
entropy gradient corresponding to a thermal wind balance is included (baroclinally unstable mode).
To our knowledge, this work is the first realistic eigenvalue calculation of the global modes of
the rotating solar convection zone. This calculation reveals a rich spectrum of modes in the inertial
frequency range, which can be directly compared to the observations. In turn, the observed modes
can inform us about the solar convection zone.

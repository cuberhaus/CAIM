Observed Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) maps are contaminated by foregrounds, some of which
are usually masked to perform cosmological analyses. If masks are correlated to the lensing signal,
such as those removing extragalactic emissions located in matter overdensities, measurements
over the unmasked sky may give biased estimates. We quantify the impact of these mask-induced biases
for the reconstructed CMB lensing auto- and cross-correlation power spectra with external matter
tracers. We show that they arise both from changes in the lensing power, and via modifications to
the reconstruction power spectrum corrections, $N_L^{(0)}$, $N_L^{(1)}$ and $N_L^{(3/2)}$).
For direct masking of the CMB lensing field, we derive simple analytic models of the masking effect
and show that it is potentially large. We show that mask-induced biases are significantly reduced
by optimal filtering of the CMB maps in the lensing reconstruction. We test the resulting lensing
power spectrum biases on numerical simulations, masking radio sources, and peaks of thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich
(tSZ) and cosmic infrared background (CIB) emission. For the lensing auto spectrum, masking biases
can only be measured with a statistical significance $\lesssim 3\sigma$ for future data sets. The
same applies to the cross-correlation power spectra between CMB lensing and tSZ and CIB even though
biases are larger (up to ~30%). We find that masking tSZ-selected galaxy clusters leads to the largest
mask biases, potentially detectable with high significance. We find that the calibration of cluster
masses using CMB lensing, in particular for objects at $z\lesssim 0.6$, might be significantly
affected by mask biases for near-future observations if the lensing signal recovered inside the
mask holes is used without further corrections. Conversely, mass calibration of high redshift
objects will still deliver unbiased results.

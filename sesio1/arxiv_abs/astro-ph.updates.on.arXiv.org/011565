We have used the sample of 577 active galactic nuclei Type 1.8-2 spectra (z < 0.25), taken from Sloan
Digital Sky Survey, to trace the influence of the outflow kinematics to the profiles of different
emission lines (Hbeta, [O III], Halpha, [N II], [S II]). All considered lines were fitted with two
Gaussian components: one which fits the core of the line, and another which fits the wings. We gave
the procedure for decomposition of Halpha+[N II] wavelength band, for the spectra where these lines
overlap. The influence of the gravitational/non-gravitational kinematics to the line components
is investigated by comparing the dispersions of the line components with stellar velocity dispersion.
We found that wing components of all considered emission lines have pure non-gravitational kinematics,
the core components are consistent with gravitational kinematics for the Halpha, [N II] and [S II]
lines, while in the [O III] there is evidence for contribution from non-gravitational kinematics.
We adopted the wing components as proxy of the outflow contribution and we investigated the outflow
kinematics by analysing the correlations between widths and between shifts of the wing components
of different lines. We found the strong correlations between shifts and between wing component
widths of all considered lines, with exception of the Hbeta wing component width. These correlations
indicate that outflow dynamics systemically affects all emission lines in spectrum. However,
it reflects with different strength in their profiles, which is observed as different widths of
the wing components. The strongest outflow signature is observed in the [O III] lines, which have
the broadest wing components, weaker in Halpha and [N II], and the weakest in [S II]. These results
imply that considered lines arise in different parts of an outflowing region.

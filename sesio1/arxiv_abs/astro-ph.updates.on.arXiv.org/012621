Speed matters. How the masses and spins of new particles active during inflation can be read off from
the statistical properties of primordial density fluctuations is well understood. However, not
when the propagation speeds of the new degrees of freedom and of the curvature perturbation differ,
which is the generic situation in the effective field theory of inflationary fluctuations. Here
we use bootstrap techniques to find exact analytical solutions for primordial 2-,3- and 4-point
correlators in this context. We focus on the imprints of a heavy relativistic scalar coupled to the
curvature perturbation that propagates with a reduced speed of sound $c_s$, hence strongly breaking
de Sitter boosts. We show that akin to the de Sitter invariant setup, primordial correlation functions
can be deduced by acting with suitable weight-shifting operators on the four-point function of
a conformally coupled field induced by the exchange of the massive scalar. However, this procedure
requires the analytical continuation of this seed correlator beyond the physical domain implied
by momentum conservation. We bootstrap this seed correlator in the extended domain from first principles,
starting from the boundary equation that it satisfies due to locality. We further impose unitarity,
reflected in cosmological cutting rules, and analyticity, by demanding regularity in the collinear
limit of the four-point configuration, in order to find the unique solution. Equipped with this,
we unveil that heavy particles that are lighter than $H/c_s$ leave smoking gun imprints in the bispectrum
in the form of resonances in the squeezed limit, a phenomenon that we call the low speed collider.
We characterise the overall shape of the signal as well as its unusual logarithmic mass dependence,
both vividly distinct from previously identified signatures of heavy fields. (abridged)

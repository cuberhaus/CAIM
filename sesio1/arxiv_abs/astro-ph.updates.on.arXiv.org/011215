Due to their wide wavelength coverage across the millimetre to centimetre (mm - cm) range and their
increased sensitivity, modern interferometric arrays facilitate observations of the thermal
and non-thermal emission from different stellar atmospheric layers. We study the spectral energy
distribution ($S_{obs}(\nu)$) of main sequence stars using archival mm - cm data with the aim to
study their atmospheric stratification as a function of stellar type. The main-sequence stars
with significant detection in mm bands were identified in the ALMA Science Archive. These data were
complemented with spectral flux data in the Ultra violet to centimetre range as compiled from various
catalogues and observatory archives. We compare the resultant $S_{obs}(\nu)$ of each star with
a photospheric emission model ($S_{mod}(\nu)$) calculated with the PHOENIX code. The departures
of $S_{obs}(\nu)$ from the model are quantified in terms of a "spectral flux excess" parameter ($\Delta
S/S_{mod} (\nu)$) for every star in the sample. The initial sample consists of 12 stars across a range
of spectral type from A1 to M3.5 and the Sun-as-a-star as reference. The stars with $T_{eff} = 4000
- 7000\,K$ (F - M type) showed a systematically higher $\Delta S/S_{mod}$ in the mm - cm range, with
the values rising with decreasing $\nu$. The steepness of this rise is higher for cooler stars, though
the fully convective 3000 K star in the sample deviated from this trend. For the A-type stars, $\Delta
S/S_{mod} \sim 0$ within errors. The high $\Delta S/S_{mod}$ in cool stars points to the presence
of hotter upper atmospheric layers, i.e. a chromosphere and corona, like for the Sun. The mm - cm $\Delta
S/S_{mod}$ spectrum offers a way to estimate the efficiency of the heating mechanisms across various
atmospheric layers and thereby to understand their structure and activity. We emphasise the need
for more mm - cm data.

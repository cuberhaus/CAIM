Context. VX Sgr is a cool, evolved, and luminous red star whose stellar parameters are difficult
to determine, which affects its classification. Aims. We aim to spatially resolve the photospheric
extent as well as the circumstellar environment. Methods. We used interferometric observations
obtained with the MATISSE instrument in the L (3 to 4 {\mu}m), M (4.5 to 5 {\mu}m), and N (8 to 13 {\mu}m)
bands. We reconstructed monochromatic images using the MIRA software. We used 3D radiation-hydrodynamics
(RHD) simulations carried out with CO5BOLD and a uniform disc model to estimate the apparent diameter
and interpret the stellar surface structures. Moreover, we employed the radiative transfer codes
Optim3D and Radmc3D to compute the spectral energy distribution for the L, M, and N bands, respectively.
Results. MATISSE observations unveil, for the first time, the morphology of VX Sgr across the L,
M, and N bands. The reconstructed images show a complex morphology with brighter areas whose characteristics
depend on the wavelength probed. We measured the angular diameter as a function of the wavelength
and showed that the photospheric extent in the L and M bands depends on the opacity through the atmosphere.
In addition to this, we also concluded that the observed photospheric inhomogeneities can be interpreted
as convection-related surface structures. The comparison in the N band yielded a qualitative agreement
between the N band spectrum and simple dust radiative transfer simulations. However, it is not possible
to firmly conclude on the interpretation of the current data because of the difficulty in constraing
the model parameters using the limited accuracy of our absolute flux calibration. Conclusions.
MATISSE observations and the derived reconstructed images unveil the appearance of the stellar
surface and circumstellar environment across a very large spectral domain for the first time.

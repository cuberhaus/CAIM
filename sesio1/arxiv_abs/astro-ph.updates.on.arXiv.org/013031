In this work, we carry out a suite of specially-designed numerical simulations to shed further light
on dark matter (DM) subhalo survival at mass scales relevant for gamma-ray DM searches, a topic subject
to intense debate nowadays. Specifically, we have developed and employed an improved version of
DASH, a GPU $N$-body code, to study the evolution of low-mass subhaloes inside a Milky Way-like halo
with unprecedented accuracy, reaching solar-mass and sub-parsec resolution in our simulations.
We simulate subhaloes with varying mass, concentration, and orbital properties, and consider
the effect of the gravitational potential of the Milky Way galaxy itself. More specifically, we
analyze the evolution of both the bound mass fraction and annihilation luminosity of subhaloes,
finding that most subhaloes survive until present time, even though in some cases they lose more
than 99% of their mass at accretion. Baryons in the host induce a much more severe mass loss, especially
when the subhalo orbit is more parallel to the galactic disk. Many of these subhaloes cross the solar
galactocentric radius, thus making it easier to detect their annihilation fluxes from Earth. We
find subhaloes orbiting a DM-only halo with a pericentre in the solar vicinity to lose 70-90% of their
initial annihilation luminosity at redshift zero, which increases up to 99% when baryons are also
included in the host. We find a strong relation between subhalo's mass loss and the effective tidal
field at pericentre. Indeed, much of the dependence on concentration, orbital parameters, host
potential and baryonic components can be explained through this single parameter. In addition
to shedding light on the survival of low-mass galactic subhaloes, our results can provide detailed
predictions that will aid current and future quests for the nature of DM.

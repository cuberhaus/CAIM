Observations have shown that the star-formation activity and the morphology of galaxies are closely
related, but the underlying physical connection is not well understood. Using the TNG50 simulation,
we explore the quenching and the morphological evolution of the 102 massive quiescent galaxies
in the mass range of $10.5<\log(M_{\rm stellar}/M_{\odot})<11.5$ selected at $z=0$. The morphology
of galaxies is quantified based on their kinematics, and we measure the quenching timescale of individual
galaxies directly from star formation history. We show that galaxies tend to be quenched more rapidly
if they: (i) are satellites in massive halos, (ii) have lower star-forming gas fractions, or (iii)
inject a larger amount of black hole kinetic feedback energy. By following the global evolutionary
pathways, we conclude that quiescent discs are mainly disc galaxies that are recently and slowly
quenched. Approximately half of the quiescent ellipticals at $z=0$ are rapidly quenched at higher
redshifts while still disc-like. While being quiescent, they gradually become more elliptical
mostly by disc heating, yet these ellipticals still retain some degree of rotation. The other half
of quiescent ellipticals with the most random motion-dominated kinematics build up large spheroidal
components before quenching primarily by mergers, or in some cases, misaligned gas accretion.
However, the mergers that contribute to morphological transformation do not immediately quench
galaxies in many cases. In summary, we find that quenching and morphological transformation are
decoupled. We conclude that the TNG black hole feedback -- in combination with the stochastic merger
history of galaxies -- leads to a large diversity of quenching timescales and a rich morphological
landscape.

The diversity of the structures recently observed in protoplanetary discs (PPDs) with the new generation
of high-resolution instruments have made more acute the challenging questions that planet-formation
models must answer. The challenge is in the theoretical side but also in the numerical one with the
need to significantly improve the performances of the codes and to stretch the limit of PPD simulations.
Multi-physics, fast, accurate, high-resolution, modular, and reliable 3D codes are needed to
explore the mechanisms at work in PPDs and to try explaining the observed features. We present RoSSBi3D
the 3D extension of the 2D code Rotating-System Simulations for Bi-fluids (RoSSBi) which was specifically
developed to study the evolution of PPDs. This is a new code, even if based on the 2D version, that we
describe in detail explaining its architecture and specificity but also its performances against
test cases and a PPD benchmark. We also explain the way to use it and to manage the produced data. This
FORTRAN code solves the fully compressible inviscid continuity, Euler, and energy conservation
equations for an ideal gas in non-homentropic conditions and for pressureless particles in a fluid
approximation. It is a finite volume code which is second order in time and accounts for discontinuities
thanks to an exact Riemann solver. The spatial scheme accounts for the equilibrium solution and
is improved thanks to parabolic interpolation which permits to reach third order in space. The code
is developed in 3D and structured for high-performance parallelism. The optimised version of the
code work on high performance computers with a very good scalability. Its reliability has been checked
against classical tests and a benchmark specific to PPDs that includes Rossby wave instability
(RWI), streaming instability (SI), dust capture by a vortex and dust settling.

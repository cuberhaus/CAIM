We present the first detailed 3D kinematic analysis of a sample of 3133 white dwarfs that use Gaia
astrometry plus radial velocities, which were measured either by Gaia or by ground based spectroscopic
observations. The sample includes either isolated white dwarfs that have direct radial velocity
measurements, or white dwarfs that belong to common proper motion pairs that contain nondegenerate
companions with available radial velocities. A subset of common proper motion pairs also have metal
abundances that have been measured by large scale spectroscopic surveys or by our own follow-up
observations. We used the white dwarfs as astrophysical clocks, by determining their masses and
total ages via interpolation with dedicated evolutionary models. We also used the nondegenerate
companions in common proper motions to chemically tag of the population. Combining accurate radial
velocities with Gaia astrometry and proper motions, we derived the velocity components of our sample
in the Galactic rest frame and their Galactic orbital parameters. The sample is mostly located within
~300 pc from the Sun. It contains predominantly (90-95%) thin-disk stars with close-to-circular
Galactic orbits, while the remaining 5-10% of stars have more eccentric trajectories and belong
to the thick disk. We identified seven isolated white dwarfs and two common proper motion pairs as
halo members. We determined the age - velocity dispersion relation for the thin-disk members, which
shows signatures of dynamical heating and saturation after 4-6 Gyr. We observed a mild anti-correlation
between [Fe/H] and the radial component of the average - velocity dispersion, showing that dynamical
mixing of populations takes place in the Galactic disk, as was detected via the analysis of other
samples of FGK stars. [Abridged]

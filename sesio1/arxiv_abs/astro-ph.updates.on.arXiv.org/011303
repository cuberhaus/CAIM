The formation of the red spirals is a puzzling issue in the standard picture of galaxy formation and
evolution. Most studies attribute the colour of the red spirals to different environmental effects.
We analyze a volume limited sample from the SDSS to study the roles of small-scale and large-scale
environments on the colour of spiral galaxies. We compare the star formation rate, stellar age and
stellar mass distributions of the red and blue spirals and find statistically significant differences
between them at $99.9\%$ confidence level. The red spirals inhabit significantly denser regions
than the blue spirals, explaining some of the observed differences in their physical properties.
However, the differences persist in all types of environments, indicating that the local density
alone is not sufficient to explain the origin of the red spirals. Using an information theoretic
framework, we find a small but non-zero mutual information between the colour of spiral galaxies
and their large-scale environment that are statistically significant ($99.9\%$ confidence level)
throughout the entire length scale probed. Such correlations between the colour and the large-scale
environment of spiral galaxies may result from the assembly bias. Thus both the local environment
and the assembly bias may play essential roles in forming the red spirals. The spiral galaxies may
have different assembly histories across all types of environments. We propose a picture where
the differences in the assembly histories may produce spiral galaxies with different cold gas content.
Such a difference would make some spirals more susceptible to quenching. In all environments, the
spirals with higher cold gas content could delay the quenching and maintain a bluer colour, whereas
the spirals with lower cold gas fractions would be easily quenched and become red.

We conduct a pseudo-$C_\ell$ analysis of the tomographic cross-correlation between 1000 deg$^2$
of weak lensing data from the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-1000) and the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich
(tSZ) effect measured by Planck and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). Using HMx, a halo-model-based
approach that consistently models the gas, star, and dark matter components, we are able to derive
constraints on both cosmology and baryon feedback for the first time from this data, marginalising
over redshift uncertainties, intrinsic alignment of galaxies, and contamination by the cosmic
infrared background (CIB). We find our results to be insensitive to the CIB, while intrinsic alignment
provides a small but significant contribution to the lensing--tSZ cross-correlation. The cosmological
constraints are consistent with those of other low-redshift probes and prefer strong baryon feedback.
The inferred amplitude of the lensing--tSZ cross-correlation signal, which scales as $\sigma_8(\Omega_\mathrm{m}/0.3)^{0.2}$,
is low by $\sim 2\,\sigma$ compared to the primary cosmic microwave background constraints by Planck.
The lensing--tSZ measurements are then combined with pseudo-$C_\ell$ measurements of KiDS-1000
cosmic shear into a novel joint analysis, accounting for the full cross-covariance between the
probes, providing tight cosmological constraints by breaking parameter degeneracies inherent
to both probes. The joint analysis gives an improvement of 40% on the constraint of $S_8=\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_\mathrm{m}/0.3}$
over cosmic shear alone, while providing constraints on baryon feedback consistent with hydrodynamical
simulations, demonstrating the potential of such joint analyses with baryonic tracers like the
tSZ effect. We discuss remaining modelling challenges that need to be addressed if these baryonic
probes are to be included in future precision-cosmology analyses.

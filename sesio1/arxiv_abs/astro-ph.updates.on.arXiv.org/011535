Sheaths ahead of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are large heliospheric structures that form with
CME expansion and propagation. Turbulent and compressed sheaths contribute to the acceleration
of particles in the corona and in interplanetary space, but the relation of their internal structures
to particle energization is still relatively little studied. In particular, the role of sheaths
in accelerating particles when the shock Mach number is low is a significant open problem. This work
seeks to provide new insights on the internal structure of CME sheaths with regard to energetic particle
enhancements. A good opportunity to achieve this aim was provided by observations of a sheath made
by radially aligned spacecraft at 0.8 and $\sim$ 1 AU (Solar Orbiter, Wind, ACE and BepiColombo)
on 19-21 April 2020. The sheath was preceded by a weak shock. Energetic ion enhancements occurred
at different locations within the sheath structure at Solar Orbiter and L1. Magnetic fluctuation
amplitudes at inertial-range scales increased in the sheath relative to the upstream wind. However,
when normalised to the local mean field, fluctuation amplitudes did not increase significantly;
magnetic compressibility of fluctuation also did not increase. Various substructures were embedded
within the sheath at the different spacecraft, including multiple heliospheric current sheet
(HCS) crossings and a small-scale flux rope. At L1, the ion flux enhancement was associated with
the HCS crossings, while at Solar Orbiter, the enhancement occurred within the rope. Substructures
that are swept from the upstream solar wind and compressed in the sheath can act as particularly effective
acceleration sites. A possible acceleration mechanism is betatron acceleration associated with
the small-scale flux rope and the warped HCS in the sheath.

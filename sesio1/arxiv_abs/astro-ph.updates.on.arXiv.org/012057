We present a study of the cold atomic hydrogen (HI) content of molecular clouds simulated within
the SILCC-Zoom project. We produce synthetic observations of HI at 21 cm including HI self-absorption
(HISA) and observational effects. We find that HI column densities, $N_\textrm{HI}$, of $\gtrsim$10$^{22}$
cm$^{-2}$ are frequently reached in molecular clouds with HI temperatures as low as $\sim$10 K.
Hence, HISA observations assuming a fixed HI temperature tend to underestimate the amount of cold
HI in molecular clouds by a factor of 3 - 10 and produce an artificial upper limit of $N_\textrm{HI}$
around 10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$. We thus argue that the cold HI mass in clouds could be a factor of a few
higher than previously estimated. Also $N_\textrm{HI}$-PDFs obtained from HISA observations
might be subject to observational biases and should be considered with caution. The underestimation
of cold HI in HISA observations is due to both the large HI temperature variations and the effect of
noise in regions of high optical depth. We find optical depths of cold HI around 1 - 10 making optical
depth corrections essential. We show that the high HI column densities ($\gtrsim$10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$)
can in parts be attributed to the occurrence of up to 10 individual HI-H$_2$ transitions along the
line of sight. This is also reflected in the spectra, necessitating Gaussian decomposition algorithms
for their analysis. However, also for a single HI-H$_2$ transition, $N_\textrm{HI}$ frequently
exceeds 10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, challenging 1D, semi-analytical models. This is due to non-equilibrium
chemistry effects and the fact that HI-H$_2$ transition regions usually do not possess a 1-dimensional
geometry. Finally, we show that the HI gas is moderately supersonic with Mach numbers of a few. The
corresponding non-thermal velocity dispersion can be determined via HISA observations within
a factor of $\sim$2.

We propose a covariant formulation of refracted gravity (RG), a classical theory of gravity based
on the introduction of the gravitational permittivity -- a monotonic function of the local mass
density -- in the standard Poisson equation. The gravitational permittivity mimics the dark matter
phenomenology. Our covariant formulation of RG (CRG) belongs to the class of scalar-tensor theories,
where the scalar field $\varphi$ has a self-interaction potential $\mathcal{V}(\varphi)=-\Xi\varphi$,
with $\Xi$ a normalization constant. We show that the scalar field is twice the gravitational permittivity
in the weak-field limit. Far from a spherical source of density $\rho_s(r)$, the transition between
the Newtonian and the RG regime appears below the acceleration scale $a_\Xi=(2\Xi-8\pi G\rho/\varphi)^{1/2}$,
with $\rho=\rho_s+\rho_\mathrm{bg}$ and $\rho_\mathrm{bg}$ an isotropic and homogeneous background.
In the limit $2\Xi\gg 8\pi G\rho/\varphi$, we obtain $a_\Xi\sim 10^{-10}$~m~s$^{-2}$. This acceleration
is comparable to the acceleration $a_0$ originally introduced in Modified Newtonian Dynamics
(MOND). From CRG, we also derive the modified Friedmann equations for an expanding, homogeneous,
and isotropic universe. We find that the same scalar field that mimics dark matter also drives the
accelerated expansion of the Universe. Since $\Xi$ plays a role roughly similar to the cosmological
constant $\Lambda$ in the standard model and has a comparable value, CRG suggests a natural explanation
of the known relation $a_0\sim \Lambda^{1/2}$. CRG thus appears to describe both the dynamics of
cosmic structure and the expanding Universe with a single scalar field, and falls within the family
of models that unify the two dark sectors, highlighting a possible deep connection between phenomena
currently attributed to dark matter and dark energy separately.

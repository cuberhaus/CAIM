The problem of radiation by the charged particles of the intergalactic medium (IGM) when a passing
gravitational wave (GW) accelerate them is investigated. The largest acceleration (taking a charge
from rest to a maximum speed which remains non-relativistic in the rest frame of the unperturbed
spacetime) is found to be limited by the curvature of a propagating spherical gravitational wavefront.
Interesting physics arises from the ensuing emission of radiation into the warm hot IGM, which to
lowest order is a fully ionized hydrogen plasma with a frozen-in magnetic field $B$. It is found that
for a vast majority of propagation directions, the right-handed polarized radiation can penetrate
the plasma at frequencies below the plasma frequency $\om_p$, provided $\om<\om_b,$ where $\om_b=eB/m_e$
satisfies $\om_b<\om_p$ for typical IGM conditions. Moreover, the refractive index under such
a scenario is $n\gg 1,$ resulting in an enhanced radiative dissipation of GW energy (relative to
the vacuum scenario), which is more severe for electrons if both charge species are in thermal equilibrium
and accelerated in the same way. The emission by the electrons then prevails, and is further amplified
by coherent addition of amplitudes within the size one wavelength. The conversion of GWs of $\lam\gtrsim
5\times 10^{13}$~cm to electromagnetic waves means such GWs can only propagate a distance $\lesssim
1$~Gpc before being significantly damped by an IGM B field of $\sim10^{-8}$ G. The low-frequency
GWs \textcolor{black}{targeted by pulsar-timing-arrays} will not survive unless the IGM magnetic
field is much lower than expected. The \textcolor{black}{mHz} frequency GW inspirals targeted
by future \textcolor{black}{space based} detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna
remain intact and can be detected.

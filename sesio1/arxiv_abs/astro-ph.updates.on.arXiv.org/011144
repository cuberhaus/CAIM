Supermassive black hole masses (MBH) can dynamically be estimated with various methods and using
different kinematic tracers. Different methods have only been cross-checked for a small number
of galaxies and often show discrepancies. To understand these discrepancies, detailed cross-comparisons
of additional galaxies are needed. We present the first part of our cross-comparison between stellar-
and gas-based MBH estimates in the nearby fast-rotating early-type galaxy NGC 6958. The measurements
presented here are based on ground-layer adaptive optics-assisted Multi-Unit Spectroscopic
Explorer (MUSE) science verification data at around 0.6 arcsec spatial resolution. The spatial
resolution is a key ingredient for the measurement and we provide a Gaussian parametrisation of
the adaptive optics-assisted point spread function (PSF) for various wavelengths. From the MUSE
data, we extracted the stellar kinematics and constructed dynamical models. Using an axisymmetric
Schwarzschild technique, we measured an MBH of (3.6+2.7-2.4)\times 10^8 Msun at 3\sigma significance
taking kinematical and dynamical systematics (e.g.,radially-varying mass-to-light ratio)
into account. We also added a dark halo, but our data does not allow to constrain the dark matter fraction.
Adding dark matter with an abundance matching prior results in a 25 per cent more massive black hole.
Jeans anisotropic models return MBH of (4.6+2.5-2.7) \times 10^8 Msun and (8.6+0.8-0.8) \times
10^8 Msun at 3\sigma confidence for spherical and cylindrical alignment of the velocity ellipsoid,
respectively. In a follow-up study, we will compare the stellar-based MBH with those from cold and
warm gas tracers, which will provide additional constraints for the MBH for NGC 6958, and insights
into assumptions that lead to potential systematic uncertainty.

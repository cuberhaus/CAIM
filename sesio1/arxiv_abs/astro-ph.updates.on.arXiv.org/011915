Astrometry is less sensitive to stellar activity than the radial velocity technique when attempting
to detect Earth mass planets in the habitable zone of solar-type stars. This is due to a smaller number
of physical processes affecting the signal, and a larger ratio of the amplitude of the planetary
signal to the stellar signal. A few high-precision astrometric missions have therefore been proposed
over the past two decades. We aim to re-estimate the detection limits in astrometry for the nearby
stars which are the main targets proposed for the THEIA astrometric mission, the most elaborate
mission to search for planets, and to characterise its performance. This analysis is performed
for the 55 F-G-K stars in the THEIA sample. We used realistic simulations of stellar activity and
selected those that correspond best to each star in terms of spectral type and average activity level.
Then, we performed blind tests to estimate the performance. We find worse detection limits compared
to those previously obtained for that sample based on a careful analysis of the false positive rate,
with values in the Earth-mass regime for most stars of the sample. The difference is attributed to
the fact that we analysed full time series, adapted to each star in the sample, rather than using the
expected solar jitter only. Although these detection limits have a relatively low signal-to-noise
ratio, the fitted parameters have small uncertainties. We confirm the low impact of stellar activity
on exoplanet detectability for solar-type stars, although it plays a significant role for the closest
stars such as alpha Cen A and B. However, for the few stars in the sample with a habitable zone corresponding
to long periods, namely subgiants, the THEIA observational strategy is not well adapted and should
prevent the detection of planets in the habitable zone, unless a longer mission can be proposed.

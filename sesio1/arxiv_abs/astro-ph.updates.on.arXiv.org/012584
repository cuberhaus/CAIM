Precision analysis of galaxy-galaxy strong gravitational lensing images provides a unique way
of characterizing small-scale dark matter halos, and could allow us to uncover the fundamental
properties of dark matter's constituents. In recent years, gravitational imaging techniques
made it possible to detect a few heavy subhalos. However, gravitational lenses contain numerous
subhalos and line-of-sight halos, whose subtle imprint is extremely difficult to detect individually.
Existing methods for marginalizing over this large population of sub-threshold perturbers in
order to infer population-level parameters are typically computationally expensive, or require
compressing observations into hand-crafted summary statistics, such as a power spectrum of residuals.
In this work we present the first analysis pipeline to combine parametric lensing models and a recently-developed
neural simulation-based inference technique called truncated marginal neural ratio estimation
(TMNRE) to constrain the warm dark matter halo mass function cutoff scale directly from multiple
lensing images. Through a proof-of-concept application to simulated data, we show that our approach
enables empirically testable inference of the dark matter cutoff mass through marginalization
over a large population of realistic perturbers that would be undetectable on their own, and over
lens and source parameters uncertainties. To obtain our results, we combine the signal contained
in a set of images with Hubble Space Telescope resolution. Our results suggest that TMNRE can be a
powerful approach to put tight constraints on the mass of warm dark matter in the multi-keV regime,
which will be relevant both for existing lensing data and in the large sample of lenses that will be
delivered by near-future telescopes.

Here we present a low frequency (170-200MHz) search for coherent radio emission associated with
nine short GRBs detected by the Swift and/or Fermi satellites using the Murchison Widefield Array
(MWA) rapid-response observing mode. The MWA began observing these events within 30 to 60s of their
high-energy detection, enabling us to capture any dispersion delayed signals emitted by short
GRBs for a typical range of redshifts. We conducted transient searches at the GRB positions on timescales
of 5s, 30s and 2min, resulting in the most constraining flux density limits on any associated transient
of 0.42, 0.29, and 0.084Jy, respectively. We also searched for dispersed signals at a temporal and
spectral resolution of 0.5s and 1.28MHz but none were detected. However, the fluence limit of 80-100Jy
ms derived for GRB 190627A is the most stringent to date for a short GRB. We compared the fluence and
persistent emission limits to short GRB coherent emission models, placing constraints on key parameters
including the radio emission efficiency of the nearly merged neutron stars ($\lesssim10^{-4}$),
the fraction of magnetic energy in the GRB jet ($\lesssim2\times10^{-4}$), and the radio emission
efficiency of the magnetar remnant ($\lesssim10^{-3}$). Comparing the limits derived for our
full GRB sample to the same emission models, we demonstrate that our 30-min flux density limits were
sensitive enough to theoretically detect the persistent radio emission from magnetar remnants
up to a redshift of $z\sim0.6$. Our non-detection of this emission could imply that some GRBs in the
sample were not genuinely short or did not result from a binary neutron star merger, the GRBs were
at high redshifts, these mergers formed atypical magnetars, the radiation beams of the magnetar
remnants were pointing away from Earth, or the majority did not form magnetars but rather collapse
directly into black holes.

Altough both components of the bright eclipsing binary $\alpha$ Dra having been resolved using
long baseline interferometry and the secondary component shown to contribute some 15\% of the total
flux, a spectroscopic detection of the companion star was so far unsuccessful. To achieve our goals,
we use a combined data set from interferometry with the Navy Precision Optical Interferometer (NPOI),
photometry with the TESS space observatory, and high-resolution spectroscopy with the HERMES
fibre-fed spectrograph at the La Palma observatory. We use the method of spectral disentangling
to search for the contribution of a companion star in the observed composite HERMES spectra, to separate
the spectral contributions of both components, and to determine orbital elements of the $\alpha$
Dra system. TESS light curves are analysed in an iterative fashion with spectroscopic inference
of stellar atmospheric parameters to determine fundamental stellar properties and their uncertainties.
Finally, NPOI interferometric measurements are used for determination of the orbital parameters
of the system and angular diameters of both binary components. We report the first firm spectroscopic
detection of the secondary component in $\alpha$ Dra and deliver disentangled spectra of both binary
components. The inferred near-core mixing properties of both components do not support a dependence
of the convective core overshooting on the stellar mass. At the same time, the $\alpha$ Dra system
provides extra support to hypothesise that the mass discrepancy in eclipsing spectroscopic double-lined
binaries is associated with inferior atmospheric modelling of intermediate- and high-mass stars,
and less so with the predictive power of stellar structure and evolution models as to the amount of
near-core mixing and mass of the convective core. (abridged abstract)

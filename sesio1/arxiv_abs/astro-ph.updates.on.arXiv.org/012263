We report on the discovery of a bound exoplanetary microlensing event from a blind search of data
gathered from Campaign 9 of the Kepler K2 mission (K2C9). K2-2016-BLG-0005Lb is a densely sampled,
binary caustic-crossing microlensing event with caustic entry and exit points that are resolved
in the K2C9 data, enabling the lens-source relative proper motion to be measured. We have fitted
a binary microlens model to the K2 dataset, and to simultaneous observations from the Optical Gravitational
Lensing Experiment (OGLE-IV), Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), Microlensing Observations
in Astrophysics (MOA-2), the Korean Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet), and the United Kingdom
InfraRed Telescope (UKIRT). Whilst the ground-based data only sparsely sample the binary caustic,
they provide a clear detection of parallax that allows us to break completely the microlensing mass-position-velocity
degeneracy and measure the planet's mass directly. We find a host mass of $0.58\pm0.03 ~{\rm M}_\odot$
and a planetary mass of $1.1 \pm 0.1 ~{\rm M_J}$. The system lies at a distance of $5.2 \pm 0.2~$kpc
from Earth towards the Galactic bulge. The projected physical separation of the planet from its
host is found to be $4.2 \pm 0.3~$au which, for circular orbits, corresponds to $a = 4.4^{+1.9}_{-0.4}~$au
and period $P = 13^{+9}_{-2}~$yr, making K2-2016-BLG-0005Lb a close Jupiter analogue. Though
previous exoplanet microlensing events have included space-based data, this event is the first
bound microlensing exoplanet to be discovered from space-based data. Even through a space telescope
not designed for microlensing studies, this result highlights the advantages for exoplanet microlensing
discovery that come from continuous, high-cadence temporal sampling that is possible from space.

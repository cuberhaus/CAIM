Most of the currently known planets are small worlds with radii between that of the Earth and that
of Neptune. The characterization of planets in this regime shows a large diversity in compositions
and system architectures, with distributions hinting at a multitude of formation and evolution
scenarios. Using photometry from the K2 satellite and radial velocities measured with the HARPS
and CORALIE spectrographs, we searched for planets around the bright and slightly evolved Sun-like
star HD 137496. We precisely estimated the stellar parameters, $M_*$ = 1.035 +/- 0.022 $M_\odot$,
$R_*$ = 1.587 +/- 0.028 $R_\odot$, $T_\text{eff}$ = 5799 +/- 61 K, together with the chemical composition
of the slightly evolved star. We detect two planets orbiting HD 137496. The inner planet, HD 137496
b, is a super-Mercury (an Earth-sized planet with the density of Mercury) with a mass of $M_b$ = 4.04
+/- 0.55 $M_\oplus$, a radius of $R_b = 1.31_{-0.05}^{+0.06} R_\oplus,$ and a density of $\rho_b
= 10.49_{-1.82}^{+2.08}$ $\mathrm{g cm^{-3}}$. With an interior modeling analysis, we find that
the planet is composed mainly of iron, with the core representing over 70% of the planet's mass ($M_{core}/M_{total}
= 0.73^{+0.11}_{-0.12}$). The outer planet, HD 137496 c, is an eccentric ($e$ = 0.477 +/- 0.004),
long period ($P$ = $479.9_{-1.1}^{+1.0}$ days) giant planet ($M_c\sin i_c$ = 7.66 +/- 0.11 $M_{Jup}$)
for which we do not detect a transit. HD 137496 b is one of the few super-Mercuries detected to date.
The accurate characterization reported here enhances its role as a key target to better understand
the formation and evolution of planetary systems. The detection of an eccentric long period giant
companion also reinforces the link between the presence of small transiting inner planets and long
period gas giants.

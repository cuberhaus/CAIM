The Gaia DR3 Catalogue contains for the first time about eight hundred thousand solutions with either
orbital elements or trend parameters for astrometric, spectroscopic and eclipsing binaries,
and combinations of them. This paper aims to illustrate the huge potential of this large non-single
star catalogue. Using the orbital solutions together with models of the binaries, a catalogue of
tens of thousands of stellar masses, or lower limits, partly together with consistent flux ratios,
has been built. Properties concerning the completeness of the binary catalogues are discussed,
statistical features of the orbital elements are explained and a comparison with other catalogues
is performed. Illustrative applications are proposed for binaries across the H-R diagram. The
binarity is studied in the RGB/AGB and a search for genuine SB1 among long-period variables is performed.
The discovery of new EL CVn systems illustrates the potential of combining variability and binarity
catalogues. Potential compact object companions are presented, mainly white dwarf companions
or double degenerates, but one candidate neutron star is also presented. Towards the bottom of the
main sequence, the orbits of previously-suspected binary ultracool dwarfs are determined and
new candidate binaries are discovered. The long awaited contribution of Gaia to the analysis of
the substellar regime shows the brown dwarf desert around solar-type stars using true, rather than
minimum, masses, and provides new important constraints on the occurrence rates of substellar
companions to M dwarfs. Several dozen new exoplanets are proposed, including two with validated
orbital solutions and one super-Jupiter orbiting a white dwarf, all being candidates requiring
confirmation. Beside binarity, higher order multiple systems are also found.

The offset microlensing degeneracy, recently proposed by Zhang et al. (2021), has been shown to
generalize the close-wide and inner-outer caustic degeneracies into a unified regime of magnification
degeneracy in the interpretation of 2-body planetary microlensing observations. The offset degeneracy
states that for two planetary lenses that differ only in the projected star-planet separation ($s_{\rm
A}\neq s_{\rm B}$), the source trajectory is required to cross their point of equal magnification
on the lens-axis, located at $u=(s_{\rm A}-1/s_{\rm A}+s_{\rm B}-1/s_{\rm B})/2$ from the primary,
to give rise to degenerate observations. Crucially, the above formalism applies to all three caustic
topologies, and implies that the $s_{\rm A}=1/s_{\rm B}$ solution of the close-wide degeneracy
never strictly manifests in microlensing observations unless $u=0$. However, the offset degeneracy
was proposed upon numerical calculations, and no theoretical justification was given. Here, we
provide a theoretical treatment of the offset degeneracy, which demonstrates its nature as a mathematical
degeneracy. From first principles, we show that the offset degeneracy formalism is exact to zeroth-order
in the mass ratio ($q$) for two cases: when the source crosses the lens-axis inside of caustics, and
for $(s_A-s_B)^6\ll1$ when crossing outside of caustics. The extent to which the offset degeneracy
persists in oblique source trajectories is explored numerically. Additionally, it is shown that
the superposition principle allows for a straightforward generalization to $N$-body microlenses
with $N$-1 planetary lens components ($q\ll1$), which results in a $2^{N-1}$-fold degeneracy.
Lastly, we demonstrate that the recently proposed "$s^\dagger$" heuristic results from the $s\rightarrow1$
limit of the offset degeneracy, and thus does not correctly unify the close-wide and inner-outer
degeneracies.

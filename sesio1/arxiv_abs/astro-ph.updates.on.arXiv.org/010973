We report our new spectropolarimetric observations for 67P dust over 4,000--9,000 Angstrom using
the ESO/Very Large Telescope in January--March 2016 (phase angle ranging $\sim$26--5 deg) to constrain
the properties of the dust particles of 67P and therefrom diagnose the dust environment of its coma
and near-surface layer at around the end of the Southern summer of the comet. We examined the optical
behaviours of the dust, which, together with Rosetta colour data, were used to search for dust evolution
with cometocentric distance. Modelling was also conducted to identify the dust attributes compatible
with the results. The spectral dependence of the polarisation degree of 67P dust is flatter than
found in other dynamical groups of comets in similar observing geometry. The depth of its negative
polarisation branch appears to be a bit shallower than in long-period comets and might be getting
shallower as 67P repeats its apparitions. Its dust colour shows a change in slope around 5,500 Angstrom,
(17.3 $\pm$ 1.4) and (10.9 $\pm$ 0.6) % (1,000 Angstrom)$^{\rm -1}$ for shortward and longward of
the wavelength, respectively, which are slightly redder but broadly consistent with the average
of Jupiter-Family comets. Observations of 67P dust in this study can be attributed to dust agglomerates
of $\sim$100 $\mu$m in size detected by Rosetta in early 2016. A porosity of 60 % shows the best match
with our polarimetric results, yielding a dust density of $\sim$770 kg m$^{\rm -3}$. Compilation
of Rosetta and our data indicates the dust's reddening with increasing nucleus distance, which
may be driven by water-ice sublimation as the dust moves out of the nucleus. We estimate the possible
volume fraction of water ice in the initially ejected dust as $\sim$6 % (i.e. the refractory-to-ice
volume ratio of $\sim$14).

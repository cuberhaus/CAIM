Solar flares significantly impact the conditions of the Earth's ionosphere. In particular, the
sudden increase in X-ray flux during a flare penetrates down to the lowest-lying D-region and dominates
ionization at these altitudes (60-100 km). Measurements of very low frequency (VLF: 3-30kHz) radio
waves that reflect at D-region altitudes provide a unique remote-sensing probe to investigate
the D-region response to solar flare emissions. Here, using a combination of VLF amplitude measurements
at 24kHz together with X-ray observations from the Geostationary Operational Environment Satellite
(GOES) X-ray sensor, we present a large-scale statistical study of 334 solar flare events and their
impacts on the D-region over the past solar cycle. Focusing on both GOES broadband X-ray channels,
we investigate how the flare peak fluxes and position on the solar disk dictate an ionospheric response
and extend this to investigate the characteristic time delay between incident X-ray flux and the
D-region response. We show that the VLF amplitude linearly correlates with both the 1-8 A and 0.5-4
A channels, with correlation coefficients of 0.80 and 0.79, respectively. Unlike higher altitude
ionospheric regions for which the location of the flare on the solar disk affects the ionospheric
response, we find that the D-region response to solar flares does not depend on the flare location.
By comparing the time delays between the peak X-ray fluxes in both GOES channels and VLF amplitudes,
we find that there is an important difference between the D-region response and the X-ray spectral
band. We also demonstrate for several flare events that show a negative time delay, the peak VLF amplitude
matches with the impulsive 25-50 keV hard X-ray fluxes measured by the Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic
Imager (RHESSI).

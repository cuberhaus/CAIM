(Abridged) We characterize a series of neutral vanadium atomic absorption lines in the 800--910nm
wavelength region of high signal-to-noise, high-resolution, telluric-corrected M-dwarf spectra
from the CARMENES survey. Many of these lines are prominent and exhibit a distinctive broad and flat-bottom
shape, which is a result of hyperfine structure (HFS). We investigate the potential and implications
of these HFS split lines for abundance analysis of cool stars. With standard spectral synthesis
routines, as provided by the spectroscopy software iSpec and the latest atomic data (including
HFS) available from the VALD3 database, we modeled these striking line profiles. We used them to
measure V abundances of cool dwarfs. We determined V abundances for 135 early M dwarfs (M0.0V to M3.5V)
in the CARMENES guaranteed time observations sample. They exhibit a [V/Fe]-[Fe/H] trend consistent
with that derived from nearby FG dwarfs. The tight ($\pm$ 0.1 dex) correlation between [V/H] and
[Fe/H] suggests the potential application of V as an alternative metallicity indicator in M dwarfs.
We also show hints that neglecting to model HFS could partially explain the temperature correlation
in V abundance measurements observed in previous studies of samples involving dwarf stars with
$T_{\rm eff} \lesssim 5300$K. Our work suggests that HFS can impact certain absorption lines in
cool photospheres more severely than in Sun-like ones. Therefore, we advocate that HFS should be
carefully treated in abundance studies in stars cooler than $\sim 5000$K. On the other hand, strong
HFS split lines in high-resolution spectra present an opportunity for precision chemical analyses
of large samples of cool stars. The V-to-Fe trends exhibited by the local M dwarfs continue to challenge
theoretical models of V production in the Galaxy.

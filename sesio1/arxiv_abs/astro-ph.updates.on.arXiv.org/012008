We present a solution to determine the actual or physical relative positions between CCD chips.
Due to the limited depth of the Gaia catalogue, there may be few stars identified from the Gaia catalogue
for astrometric calibration on the deep observation of a large, ground-based or space-based telescope,
such as the planned two-metre Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST). For this reason, we referred
to the idea from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) astrometry to only use stars' pixel positions to
derive the relative positions between chips. We refer to the practice as differential astrometry
in this paper. In order to ensure the results are reliable, we took advantage of Gaia EDR3 to derive
the relative positions between chips, to provide a close comparison. We refer to the practice as
photographic astrometry. We implemented the technique for the CCD mosaic chips of the Bok 2.3-m
telescope based on two epochs of observations (Jan 17,2016 and Mar 5,2017). There is a good agreement
between the two types of astrometry for the relative positions between chips. For the two epochs
of observations, the averages of the gaps derived from photographic astrometry and differential
astrometry differ to about 0.046 pixels (~0.021 arcsec) and 0.001 pixels (~0.001 arcsec), respectively,
while the average precisions of the gaps are about 0.018 pixel (~0.008 arcsec) and 0.028 pixels (<0.013
arcsec), respectively. The results provide us with more confidence in applying this solution for
the CCD mosaic chips of the CSST by means of differential astrometry. Compared with the solution
described by Anderson & King, which has been used to determine the interchip offset of Wide Field
Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) chips and Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) chips at the HST, the solution proposed
in this paper shows at least a factor of two improvement in precision, on average.

The repeating FRB 20190520B is localized to a galaxy at $z=0.241$, much closer than expected given
its dispersion measure $\rm DM=1205\pm4\ pc\ cm^{-3}$. Here we assess implications of the large
DM and scattering observed from FRB 20190520B for the host galaxy's plasma properties. A sample
of 75 bursts detected with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope shows scattering
on two scales: a mean temporal delay $\tau(1.41\ {\rm GHz})=10.9\pm1.5$ ms, which is attributed
to the host galaxy, and a mean scintillation bandwidth $\nu_{\rm d}(1.41\ {\rm GHz})=0.21\pm0.01$
MHz, which is attributed to the Milky Way. Balmer line measurements for the host imply an H$\alpha$
emission measure (galaxy frame) $\rm EM_s=620$ pc cm$^{-6} \times (T/10^4 {\rm K})^{0.9}$, implying
$\rm DM_{\rm H\alpha}$ of order the value inferred from the FRB DM budget, $\rm DM_h=1121^{+89}_{-138}$
pc cm$^{-3}$ for plasma temperatures greater than the typical value $10^4$ K. Combining $\tau$
and $\rm DM_h$ yields a nominal constraint on the scattering amplification from the host galaxy
$\tilde{F} G=1.5^{+0.8}_{-0.3}$ (pc$^2$ km)$^{-1/3}$, where $\tilde{F}$ describes turbulent
density fluctuations and $G$ represents the geometric leverage to scattering that depends on the
location of the scattering material. For a two-screen scattering geometry where $\tau$ arises
from the host galaxy and $\Delta \nu_{\rm d}$ from the Milky Way, the implied distance between the
FRB source and dominant scattering material is $\lesssim100$ pc. The host galaxy scattering and
DM contributions support a novel technique for estimating FRB redshifts using the $\tau-\rm DM$
relation, and are consistent with previous findings that scattering of localized FRBs is largely
dominated by plasma within host galaxies and the Milky Way.

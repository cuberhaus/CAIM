Variable \gama-ray emission from blazars, one of the most powerful classes of astronomical sources
featuring relativistic jets, is a widely discussed topic. In this work, we present the results of
a variability study of a sample of 20 blazars using \gama-ray (0.1--300~GeV) observations from
Fermi/LAT telescope. Using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) methods, we find that the probability
density functions that best describe the $\gamma$-ray blazar flux distributions use the stable
distribution family, which generalizes the Gaussian distribution. The results suggest that the
average behavior of the \gama-ray flux variability over this period can be characterized by log-stable
distributions. For most of the sample sources, this estimate leads to standard log-normal distribution
($\alpha=2$). However, a few sources clearly display heavy tail distributions (MLE leads to $\alpha<2$),
suggesting underlying multiplicative processes of infinite variance. Furthermore, the light
curves were analyzed by employing novel non-stationarity and autocorrelation analyses. The former
analysis allowed us to quantitatively evaluate non-stationarity in each source -- finding the
forgetting rate (corresponding to decay time) maximizing the log-likelihood for the modeled evolution
of the probability density functions. Additionally, evaluation of local variability allows us
to detect local anomalies, suggesting a transient nature of some of the statistical properties
of the light curves. With the autocorrelation analysis, we examined the lag dependence of the statistical
behavior of all the $\{(y_t,y_{t+l})\}$ points, described by various mixed moments, allowing
us to quantitatively evaluate multiple characteristic time scales and implying possible hidden
periodic processes.

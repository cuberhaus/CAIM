The high-magnification microlensing event KMT-2021-BLG-1077 exhibits a subtle and complex anomaly
pattern in the region around the peak. We analyze the lensing light curve of the event with the aim
of revealing the nature of the anomaly. We test various models in combination with several interpretations.
We find that the anomaly cannot be explained by the usual three-body (2L1S and 1L2S) models. The 2L2S
model improves the fit compared to the three-body models, but it still leaves noticeable residuals.
On the other hand, the 3L1S interpretation yields a model explaining all the major anomalous features
in the lensing light curve. According to the 3L1S interpretation, the estimated mass ratios of the
lens companions to the primary are $\sim 1.56 \times 10^{-3}$ and $\sim 1.75 \times 10^{-3}$, which
correspond to $\sim 1.6$ and $\sim 1.8$ times the Jupiter/Sun mass ratio, respectively, and therefore
the lens is a multiplanetary system containing two giant planets. With the constraints of the event
time-scale and angular Einstein radius, it is found that the host of the lens system is a low-mass
star of mid-to-late M spectral type with a mass of $M_{\rm h} = 0.14^{+0.19}_{-0.07}~M_\odot$,
and it hosts two gas giant planets with masses of $M_{\rm p_1}=0.22^{+0.31}_{-0.12}~M_{\rm J}$
and $M_{\rm p_2}=0.25^{+0.35}_{-0.13}~M_{\rm J}$. The planets lie beyond the snow line of the
host with projected separations of $a_{\perp, {\rm p}_1}=1.26^{+1.41}_{-1.08}~{\rm AU}$ and
$a_{\perp, {\rm p}_2}=0.93^{+1.05}_{-0.80}~{\rm AU}$. The planetary system resides in the Galactic
bulge at a distance of $D_{\rm L}=8.24^{+1.02}_{-1.16}~{\rm kpc}$. The lens of the event is the
fifth confirmed multiplanetary system detected by microlensing following OGLE-2006-BLG-109L,
OGLE-2012-BLG-0026L, OGLE-2018-BLG-1011L, and OGLE-2019-BLG-0468L.

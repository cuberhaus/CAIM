We explore the possibility and practical limitations of using a three-line approach to measure
both the slope and normalization of the dust attenuation law in individual galaxies. To do this,
we focus on a sample of eleven galaxies with existing ground-based Balmer H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$
measurements from slit spectra, plus space-based grism constraints on Paschen-$\beta$. When
accounting for observational uncertainties, we show that one galaxy has a well-constrained dust
law slope and normalization in the range expected from theoretical arguments; this galaxy therefore
provides an example of what may be possible in the future. However, most of the galaxies are best-fit
by unusually steep or shallow slopes. We then explore whether additional astrophysical effects
or observational biases could explain the elevated Paschen-$\beta$/H$\alpha$ ratios driving
these results. We find that galaxies with high Paschen-$\beta$/H$\alpha$ ratios may be explained
by slightly sub-unity covering fractions ($>$97%). Alternatively, differing slit losses for
different lines can have a large impact on the results, emphasizing the importance of measuring
all three lines with a consistent spectroscopic aperture. We conclude that while the three-line
approach to constraining the shape of the dust attenuation law in individual galaxies is promising,
deep observations and a consistent observational strategy will be required to minimize observational
biases and to disentangle the astrophysically interesting effect of differing covering fractions.
The James Webb Space Telescope will provide more sensitive measurements of Balmer and Paschen lines
for galaxies at $z\approx0.3-2$, enabling uniform constraints on the optical-infrared dust attenuation
law and its intrinsic variation.

Close encounters between neutron stars and main-sequence stars occur in globular clusters and
may lead to various outcomes. Here we study encounters resulting in tidal disruption of the star.
Using $N$-body models, we predict the typical stellar masses in these disruptions and the dependence
of the event rate on host cluster properties. We find that tidal disruption events occur most frequently
in core-collapsed globular clusters and that roughly $25\%$ of the disrupted stars are merger products
(i.e., blue straggler stars). Using hydrodynamic simulations, we model the tidal disruptions
themselves (over timescales of days) to determine the mass bound to the neutron star and the properties
of the remnant disks formed. Depending on the impact parameter and mass of the disrupted star, we
find disk masses ranging from roughly $0.1-1\,M_{\odot}$ and typical radii of $\rm{a\,few}\,\it{R}_{\odot}$.
Additionally, we find that neutron stars receive impulsive kicks of up to about $20\,$km/s as a result
of the asymmetry of unbound ejecta; these kicks place these neutron stars on elongated orbits within
their host cluster, with apocenter distances well outside the cluster core. Finally, we model the
evolution of the (hypercritical) accretion disks on longer timescales (days to years after disruption)
to estimate the accretion rate onto the neutron stars and accompanying spin-up. As long as $\gtrsim1\%$
of the bound mass accretes onto the neutron star, millisecond spin periods can be attained. We argue
the growing numbers of {\em isolated\/} millisecond pulsars observed in globular clusters may
have formed, at least in part, through this mechanism. In the case of significant mass growth, some
of these neutron stars may collapse to form low-mass ($\lesssim3\,M_{\odot}$) black holes.

Volatile molecules containing hydrogen, carbon and nitrogen atoms are key components of planetary
atmospheres. In the pebble accretion model for terrestrial planet formation, these volatile species
are accreted during the main planetary formation phase. We model here the partitioning of volatiles
within a growing planet and the outgassing to the surface. The core stores more than 90% of the hydrogen
and carbon budgets of Earth for realistic values of the partition coefficients of H and C between
metal and silicate melts. The magma oceans of Earth and Venus are sufficiently deep to undergo oxidation
of ferrous Fe$^{2+}$ to ferric Fe$^{3+}$. This increased oxidation state leads to the outgassing
of primarily CO$_2$ and H$_2$O from the magma ocean of Earth. In contrast, the oxidation state of
Mars' mantle remains low and the main outgassed hydrogen carrier is H$_2$. This hydrogen easily
escapes the atmosphere due to the XUV irradiation from the young Sun, dragging with it the majority
of the CO, CO$_2$, H$_2$O and N$_2$ contents of the atmosphere. A small amount of surface water is
maintained on Mars, in agreement with proposed ancient ocean shorelines, assuming a slightly higher
mantle oxidation. Nitrogen distributes relatively evenly between the core and the atmosphere
due to its extremely low solubility in magma; burial of large reservoirs of nitrogen in the core is
thus not possible. The overall low N contents of Earth disagree with the high abundance of N in all
chondrite classes and favours volatile delivery by pebble snow. Our model of rapid rocky planet
formation by pebble accretion displays broad consistency with the volatile contents of the Sun's
terrestrial planets. The diversity of the terrestrial planets can therefore be used as benchmark
cases to calibrate models of extrasolar rocky planets and their atmospheres.

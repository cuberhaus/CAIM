We investigate the scaling relations between X-ray observables of the clusters detected in the
eFEDS field using Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma/eROSITA observations taking into account the selection
effects and the distributions of observables with cosmic time. We extract X-ray observables (Lx,
Lbol, T, Mgas, Yx) within R500 for the sample of 542 clusters in the eFEDS field. By applying detection
and extent likelihoods, we construct a subsample of 265 clusters with a contamination level of <10%
(including AGNs and spurious fluctuations) to be utilized in the scaling relation analysis. The
selection function based on the state-of-the-art simulations of the eROSITA sky is fully accounted
for in our work. We provide the X-ray observables in the core-included <R500 and core-excised 0.15*R500-R500
apertures for 542 galaxy clusters and groups detected in the eFEDS field. Additionally, we present
our best-fit results for the normalization, slope, redshift evolution and intrinsic scatter parameters
of the X-ray scaling relations between Lx-T, Lx-Mgas, Lx-Yx, Lbol-T, Lbol-Mgas, Lbol-Yx and Mgas-T.
We find that the best-fit slopes significantly deviate from the self-similar model at a >3sigma
confidence level however, our results are in good agreement with the simulations including non-gravitational
physics and the recent results that take into account selection effects. Strong deviations we find
from the self-similar scenario indicate that the non-gravitational effects play an important
role in shaping the observed physical state of clusters. This work extends the scaling relations
to low mass, low luminosity galaxy cluster and group regime using eFEDS observations, demonstrating
eROSITA's ability to measure ICM emission out to R500 with survey-depth exposures and constrain
the scaling relations in a wide mass-luminosity-redshift range.

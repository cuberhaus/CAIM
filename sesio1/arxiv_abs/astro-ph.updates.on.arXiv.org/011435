In the context of gravitational lensing, the density profile of lensing galaxies is often considered
to be perfectly elliptical. Potential angular structures are generally ignored, except to explain
flux ratios anomalies. Surprisingly, the impact of azimuthal structures on extended images of
the source has not been characterized, nor its impact on the H0 inference. We address this task by
creating mock images of a point source embedded in an extended source, lensed by an elliptical galaxy
on which multipolar components are added to emulate boxy/discy isodensity contours. Modeling
such images with a density profile free of angular structure allow us to explore the detectability
of image deformation induced by the multipoles in the residual frame. Multipole deformations are
almost always detectable for our highest signal-to-noise mock data. However the detectability
depends on the lens ellipticity and Einstein radius, on the S/N of the data, and on the specific lens
modeling strategy. Multipoles also introduce small changes to the time delays. We therefore quantify
how undetected multipoles would impact H0 inference. When no multipoles are detected in the residuals,
the impact on H0 for a given lens is in general less than a few km/s/Mpc, but in the worst case scenario,
combining low S/N in the ring and large intrinsic boxyness/discyness, the bias on H0 can reach 10-12
km/s/Mpc. If we now look at the inference on H0 from a population of lensing galaxies, having a distribution
of multipoles representative of what is found in the light-profile of elliptical galaxies, we then
find a systematic bias on H0 < 1%. The comparison of our mock systems to the state-of-the-art time
delay lens sample studied by the H0LiCOW and TDCOSMO collaborations, indicates that multipoles
are currently unlikely to be a source of substantial systematic bias on the inferred value of H0 from
time-delay lenses.

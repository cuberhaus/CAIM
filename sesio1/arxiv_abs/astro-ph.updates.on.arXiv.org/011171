The core collapse of rapidly rotating massive ~10 Msun stars ("collapsars"), and resulting formation
of hyper-accreting black holes, are a leading model for the central engines of long-duration gamma-ray
bursts (GRB) and promising sources of r-process nucleosynthesis. Here, we explore the signatures
of collapsars from progenitors with extremely massive helium cores >130 Msun above the pair-instability
mass gap. While rapid collapse to a black hole likely precludes a prompt explosion in these systems,
we demonstrate that disk outflows can generate a large quantity (up to >50 Msun) of ejecta, comprised
of >5-10 Msun in r-process elements and ~0.1-1 Msun of $^{56}$Ni, expanding at velocities ~0.1c.
Radioactive heating of the disk-wind ejecta powers an optical/infrared transient, with a characteristic
luminosity $\sim 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and spectral peak in the near-infrared (due to the high optical/UV
opacities of lanthanide elements) similar to kilonovae from neutron star mergers, but with longer
durations $\gtrsim$ 1 month. These "super-kilonovae" (superKNe) herald the birth of massive black
holes >60 Msun, which, as a result of disk wind mass-loss, can populate the pair-instability mass
gap 'from above' and could potentially create the binary components of GW190521. SuperKNe could
be discovered via wide-field surveys such as those planned with the Roman Space Telescope or via
late-time infrared follow-up observations of extremely energetic GRBs. Gravitational waves
of frequency ~0.1-50 Hz from non-axisymmetric instabilities in self-gravitating massive collapsar
disks are potentially detectable by proposed third-generation intermediate and high-frequency
observatories at distances up to hundreds of Mpc; in contrast to the "chirp" from binary mergers,
the collapsar gravitational-wave signal decreases in frequency as the disk radius grows ("sad
trombone").

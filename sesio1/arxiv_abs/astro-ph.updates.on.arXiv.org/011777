We present Lyman continuum (LyC) radiation escape fraction $f_{\rm{esc}}$ measurements for 183
spectroscopically confirmed star-forming galaxies in the redshift range $3.11 < z < 3.53$ in the
\textit{Chandra} Deep Field South. We use ground-based imaging to measure $f_{\rm{esc}}$, and
use ground- and space-based photometry to derive galaxy physical properties using spectral energy
distribution (SED) fitting. We additionally derive [O III]+H$\beta$ equivalent widths (that
fall in the observed K band) by including nebular emission in the SED fitting. After removing foreground
contaminants, we report the discovery of 11 new candidate LyC leakers, with absolute LyC escape
fractions, $f_{\rm{esc}}$ in the range $0.14-0.85$. From non-detections, we place $1\sigma$
upper limits of $f_{\rm{esc}}<0.12$, where the Lyman-break selected galaxies have $f_{\rm{esc}}
< 0.11$ and `blindly' discovered galaxies with no prior photometric selection have $f_{\rm{esc}}<0.13$.
We find a slightly higher $1\sigma$ limit of $f_{\rm{esc}}<0.20$ for extreme emission line galaxies
with rest-frame [O III]+H$\beta$ equivalent widths $>300$A. For candidate LyC leakers, we find
a weak negative correlation between $f_{\rm{esc}}$ and galaxy stellar masses, no correlation
between $f_{\rm{esc}}$ specific star-formation rates (sSFRs) and a positive correlation between
$f_{\rm{esc}}$ and EW$_0$([O III]+H$\beta$). The weak/no correlations between stellar mass
and sSFRs may be explained by misaligned viewing angles and/or non-coincident timescales of starburst
activity and periods of high $f_{\rm{esc}}$. Alternatively, escaping radiation may predominantly
occur in highly localised star-forming regions, or $f_{\rm{esc}}$ measurements may be impacted
by stochasticity of the intervening neutral medium, obscuring any global trends with galaxy properties.
These hypotheses have important consequences for models of reionisation.

Several software packages for relativistic cosmological simulations that do not fully implement
the Einstein equation have recently been developed. Two of the free-licensed ones are inhomog and
gevolution. A key question is whether globally emergent volume evolution that is faster than that
of a Friedmannian reference model results from the averaged effects of structure formation. Checking
that emergent volume evolution is correctly modelled by the packages is thus needed. We numerically
replace the software's default random realisation of initial seed fluctuations by a fluctuation
of spatially constant amplitude in a simulation's initial conditions. The average volume evolution
of the perturbed model should follow that of a Friedmannian expansion history that corresponds
to the original Friedmannian reference solution modified by the insertion of the spatially constant
perturbation. We derive the equations that convert from the perturbed reference solution to the
effective solution. We find that inhomog allows emergent volume evolution correctly at first order
through to the current epoch. For initial conditions with a resolution of $N = 128^3$ particles and
an initial non-zero extrinsic curvature invariant $I_i = 0.001$, inhomog matches an exact Friedmannian
solution to -0.0058% (Einstein-de Sitter, EdS) or -0.0033% (LCDM). We find that gevolution models
the decaying mode to fair accuracy, and excludes the growing mode by construction. For $N = 128^3$
and an initial scalar potential $\Phi$ = 0.001, gevolution is accurate for the decaying mode to 0.012%
(EdS) or 0.013% (LCDM). We conclude that this special case of an exact non-linear solution for a perturbed
Friedmannian model provides a robust calibration for relativistic cosmological simulations.

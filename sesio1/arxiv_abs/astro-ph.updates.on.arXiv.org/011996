The theory of General Relativity was established on a spacetime manifold equipped with a metric
tensor, $(\mathcal{M}_4,\text{g})$, and the connection on $\mathcal{M}_4$ identified with
the Levi-Civita one. Even though there are valid reasons to assume a torsionless manifold that preserves
the metric, it was shown that dealing away with these assumptions the Levi-Civita condition can
be reproduced at the level of equations of motion of GR. It was not long before the equivalence of General
Relativity between the two descriptions, known as the Palatini or first-order formalism in which
the connection is independent of the metric, and the conventional metric or second-order formalism,
was broken for more complicated actions involving higher-order curvature invariants and/or nonminimal
couplings between the gravitational and matter sector. Nowadays these types of theories are prominent
in modeling inflation where they have found major success. Since the paradigm of inflation is fused
with the gravitational degrees of freedom and thus their parametrisation, it is interesting to
understand how the predictions of these models differ between the two formulations. One of the outstanding
models of inflation is the Starobinsky or quadratic gravity model. However in the Palatini formalism
the scalar degree of freedom sourced by the $R^2$ term is nondynamical and is unable to drive an inflationary
phase. In order for inflation to be realised in the first-order formalism the Starobinsky model
has to be coupled with a fundamental scalar field that will assume the role of the inflaton. In this
thesis we investigate different inflationary scenarios, starting with previously ruled-out
models, where we find that the $R^2$ term has a significant role in flattening the Einstein-frame
inflaton potential and thus giving the opportunity for these models to come in contact with observations.

Observations of the high redshift universe provide a promising avenue for constraining the nature
of the dark matter (DM). This will be even more true following the now successful launch of the James
Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We run cosmological simulations of galaxy formation as a part of the
Effective Theory of Structure Formation (ETHOS) project to compare the properties of high redshift
galaxies in Cold (CDM) and alternative DM models which have varying relativistic coupling and self-interaction
strengths. Phenomenologically, the interacting DM scenarios result in a cutoff in the linear power
spectrum on small-scales, followed by a series of "dark acoustic oscillations" (DAOs). We find
that DM interactions suppress the abundance of galaxies below $M_\star \sim 10^8\, M_\odot$ for
the models considered. The cutoff in the linear power spectrum generally causes a delay in structure
formation relative to CDM. Objects in ETHOS that end up at the same final masses as their CDM counterparts
are characterised by a more vigorous phase of early star formation. While galaxies with $M_\star
\lesssim 10^6\,{M_\odot}$ make up more than 60 per cent of star formation in CDM at $z\approx 10$,
they contribute only about half the star formation density in ETHOS. These differences in star formation
diminish with decreasing redshift. We find that the effects of DM self-interactions are negligible
compared to effects of relativistic coupling (i.e. the effective initial conditions for galaxy
formation) in all properties of the galaxy population we examine. Finally, we show that the clustering
strength of galaxies at high redshifts depends sensitively on DM physics, although these differences
are manifest on scales that may be too small to be measurable by JWST.

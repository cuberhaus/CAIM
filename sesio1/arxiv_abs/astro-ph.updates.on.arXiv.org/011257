Characterizing the polarized dust emission from our Galaxy will be decisive for the quest for the
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) primordial $B$-modes. The incomplete modelling of its potentially
complex spectral properties could lead to biases in the CMB polarization analyses and to a spurious
detection of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. It is crucial for future surveys like the $LiteBIRD$
satellite, which aims at constraining the primordial signal leftover by Inflation with an accuracy
on $r$ of the order 1e-3. Variations of the dust properties along and between lines of sight lead to
distortions of the spectral energy distribution (SED) that can not be easily anticipated by standard
component separation methods. This issue can be tackled with a moment expansion of the dust SED,
an innovative parametrization method imposing minimal assumptions on the sky complexity. In this
paper, we apply this formalism to the $B$-mode cross-angular power spectra computed from simulated
$LiteBIRD$ polarization data at frequencies between 100 and 402 GHz, containing CMB, dust and instrumental
noise. The spatial variation of the dust spectral parameters (spectral index $\beta$ and temperature
$T$) in our simulations, lead to significant biases on $r$ if not properly taken into account. Performing
the moment expansion in $\beta$, reduces the bias but do not lead to reliable enough estimates of
$r$. We introduce for the first time the expansion of the cross-angular power spectra SED in $\beta$
and $T$, showing that, at the $LiteBIRD$ sensitivity, it is required to take into account the SED
complexity due to temperature variations to prevent analysis biases on $r$. Thanks to this expansion
and despite the existing correlations between some of the dust moments and the CMB signal, responsible
for a rise of the error on $r$, we can measure an unbiased value of $r$ with an uncertainty of $\sigma(r)$=8.8e-4.

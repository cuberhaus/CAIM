(abridged) Quantifying the ISM porosity to ionizing photons in nearby galaxies may improve our
understanding of the mechanisms leading to Lyman Continuum photons leakage from galaxies. Primitive
galaxies with low metal and dust content have been shown to host a more patchy and porous ISM than their
high-metallicity counterparts. To what extent this peculiar structure contributes to the leakage
of ionizing photons remains to be quantitatively studied. To address these questions we build a
refined grid of models including density-bounded regions and a possible contribution of an X-ray
source. Using MULTIGRIS, a new Bayesian code based on Monte Carlo sampling, we combine the models
as sectors under various assumptions to extract the probability density distributions of the parameters
and infer the corresponding escape fractions from H II regions (fesc,HII). We apply this new code
to a sample of 39 well-know local starbursting dwarf galaxies from the Dwarf Galaxy Survey. We confirm
previous results hinting at an increased porosity to ionizing photons of the ISM in low-metallicity
galaxies and provide, for the first time, quantitative predictions for fesc,HII. The predicted
fesc,HII for low-metallicity objects span a large range of values, up to 60%, while the values derived
for more metal-rich galaxies are globally lower. We also examine the influence of other parameters
on the escape fractions, and find that the specific star-formation rate correlates best with fesc,HII
. Finally, we provide observational line ratios which could be used as tracers of the photons escaping
from density-bounded regions. Although this multi-sector modelling remains too simple to fully
capture the ISM complexity, it can be used to preselect galaxy samples with potential leakage of
ionizing photons based on current and up-coming spectral data in unresolved surveys of local and
high-redshift galaxies.

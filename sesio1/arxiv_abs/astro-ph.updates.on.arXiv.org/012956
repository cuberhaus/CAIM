Driven largely by multiple ground-based radial-velocity (RV) surveys and photometric space missions
such as Kepler and K2, the discovery of new exoplanets has increased rapidly since the early 2000s.
However, due to a target selection bias in favor of main-sequence stars, only a handful of transiting
planets have been found orbiting evolved hosts. These planets, most of which are giants, hold important
information regarding the formation and evolution of planetary systems. In this thesis, I sought
to increase the sample of known giant planets orbiting red-giant stars, focusing on data from NASA's
Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission, and to improve their characterization.
Specifically, I focused on close-in giant planets orbiting (preferably) oscillating low-luminosity
red-giant branch (LLRGB) stars. To improve characterization, I developed a method to model planetary
transits and stellar signals simultaneously, implementing Gaussian processes to model stellar
granulation and the oscillations envelope in the time domain. My results show that the model enables
time-domain asteroseismology, inferring the frequency of maximum oscillation amplitude, $\nu_\text{max}$,
to within 1\%. The method's implementation is open-source and available to the community. Regarding
the planet search, I assembled a pipeline, mostly comprised of third-party open-source software
and explored a sample of $\sim$40,000 bright LLRGB stars in the southern hemisphere of TESS's field
of view. The search identified four planet candidates, two of which are not currently known planets
and orbit red-giant stars. Radial-velocity follow-up observations of both these candidates have
tentatively confirmed their planetary nature. Finally, I also confirmed the planetary nature
of an additional candidate, not part of the above sample, through RV observations.

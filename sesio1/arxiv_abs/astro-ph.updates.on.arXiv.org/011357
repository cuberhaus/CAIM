Reionization is an inhomogeneous process, thought to begin in small ionized bubbles of the intergalactic
medium (IGM) around overdense regions of galaxies. Recent Lyman-alpha (Ly$\alpha$) studies during
the epoch of reionization show growing evidence that ionized bubbles formed earlier around brighter
galaxies, suggesting higher IGM transmission of Ly$\alpha$ from these galaxies. We investigate
this problem using IR slitless spectroscopy from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide-Field Camera
3 (WFC3) G102 grism observations of 148 galaxies selected via photometric redshifts at $6.0<z<8.2$.
These galaxies have spectra extracted from the CANDELS Ly$\alpha$ Emission at Reionization (CLEAR)
survey. We combine the CLEAR data for 275 galaxies with the Keck/DEIMOS+MOSFIRE dataset from the
Texas Spectroscopic Search for Ly$\alpha$ Emission at the End of Reionization Survey. We then constrain
the Ly$\alpha$ equivalent-width (EW) distribution at $6.0<z<8.2$, which is described by an exponential
form, $dN/d\text{EW}\propto\text{exp(-EW)}/W_0$, with the characteristic $e$-folding scale
width ($W_0$). We confirm a significant drop of the Ly$\alpha$ strength (or $W_0$) at $z>6$. Furthermore,
we compare the redshift evolution of $W_0$ between galaxies at different UV luminosities. The UV-bright
($M_{\text{UV}}<-21$, or $L_{\text{UV}}>L^{*}$) galaxies show weaker evolution with a decrease
of 0.4 ($\pm$0.2) dex in $W_0$ at $z>6$ while UV-faint ($M_{\text{UV}}>-21$, or $L_{\text{UV}}<L^{*}$)
galaxies exhibit a significant drop by a factor of 0.7-0.8 ($\pm0.2$) dex in $W_0$ from $z<6$ to $z>6$.
Our results add to the accumulating evidence that UV-bright galaxies exhibit boosted Ly$\alpha$
transmission in the IGM, suggesting that reionization completes sooner in regions proximate to
galaxies of higher UV luminosity.

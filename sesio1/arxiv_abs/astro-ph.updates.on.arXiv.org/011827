We present a detection of 21-cm emission from large-scale structure (LSS) between redshift 0.78
and 1.43 made with the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME). Radio observations
acquired over 102 nights are used to construct maps which are foreground filtered and stacked on
the angular and spectral locations of luminous red galaxies (LRG), emission line galaxies (ELG),
and quasars (QSO) from the eBOSS clustering catalogs. We find decisive evidence for a detection
when stacking on all three tracers of LSS, with the logarithm of the Bayes Factor equal to 18.9 (LRG),
10.8 (ELG), and 56.3 (QSO). An alternative frequentist interpretation, based on the likelihood-ratio
test, yields a detection significance of $7.1\sigma$ (LRG), $5.7\sigma$ (ELG), and $11.1\sigma$
(QSO). These are the first 21-cm intensity mapping measurements made with an interferometer. We
constrain the effective clustering amplitude of neutral hydrogen (HI), defined as $\mathcal{A}_{\rm
HI}\equiv 10^{3}\,\Omega_\mathrm{HI}\left(b_\mathrm{HI}+\langle\,f\mu^{2}\rangle\right)$,
where $\Omega_\mathrm{HI}$ is the cosmic abundance of HI, $b_\mathrm{HI}$ is the linear bias of
HI, and $\langle\,f\mu^{2}\rangle=0.552$ encodes the effect of redshift-space distortions
at linear order. We find $\mathcal{A}_\mathrm{HI}=1.51^{+3.60}_{-0.97}$ for LRGs $(z=0.84)$,
$\mathcal{A}_\mathrm{HI}=6.76^{+9.04}_{-3.79}$ for ELGs $(z=0.96)$, and $\mathcal{A}_\mathrm{HI}=1.68^{+1.10}_{-0.67}$
for QSOs $(z=1.20)$, with constraints limited by modeling uncertainties at nonlinear scales.
We are also sensitive to bias in the spectroscopic redshifts of each tracer, and find a non-zero bias
$\Delta\,v= -66 \pm 20 \mathrm{km/s}$ for the QSOs. We split the QSO catalog into three redshift
bins and have a decisive detection in each, with the upper bin at $z=1.30$ producing the highest redshift
21-cm intensity mapping measurement thus far.

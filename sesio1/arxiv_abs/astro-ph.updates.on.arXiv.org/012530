We investigated the impact of selected cloud condensates in exoplanetary atmospheres on the polarization
of scattered stellar radiation. We considered a selection of 25 cloud condensates that are expected
to be present in extrasolar planetary atmospheres. Using the three-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative
transfer code POLARIS and assuming Mie scattering theory, we calculated and studied the net polarization
of scattered radiation as a function of planetary phase angle at optical to near-infrared wavelengths.
In addition to the well-known characteristics in the state of polarization, such as the rainbow
determined by the real part of the refractive index, the behavior of the underlying imaginary part
of the refractive index causes an increase or decrease in the degree of polarization and a change
of sign in the polarization at a characteristic wavelength. In contrast to Al$_2$O$_3$ and MgFeSiO$_4$,
clouds composed of SiO, MnS, Na$_2$S, or ZnS produce a rapidly decreasing degree of polarization
with increasing wavelength in the context of an exoplanetary atmosphere. Furthermore, the sign
of the polarization changes at a wavelength of about 0.5 $\mu$m to 0.6 $\mu$m, depending on the specific
cloud condensate. The resulting net polarization is mainly positive for cloud compositions with
large imaginary parts of the refractive index, such as Fe, FeS, and FeO. In addition, for Fe and FeS
clouds, the maximum degree of polarization at long wavelengths is shifted to larger phase angles
than for FeO. We found that most of these cloud condensates are distinguishable from each other due
to their unique wavelength-dependent complex refractive index. In particular, an increase or
decrease of the net polarization as a function of wavelength and a change of sign in the polarization
at specific wavelengths are important features for characterizing cloud compositions in exoplanetary
atmospheres.

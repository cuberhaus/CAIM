This thesis makes use of the imaging data from the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) of the Hubble
Space Telescope (HST) in the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) and the Deep Extragalactic VIsible
Legacy Survey (DEVILS) field. We provide visual morphological classifications of 44,000 galaxies
out to redshift $z = 1$ and above a stellar mass of $10^{9.5} M_\odot$ (D10/ACS sample). We perform
a robust Bayesian bulge-disk decomposition analysis of the D10/ACS sample. This study forms one
of the largest morphological classification and structural analyses catalogues in this field
to date. Using these catalogues, we explore the evolution of the stellar mass function (SMF) and
the stellar mass density (SMD) together with the stellar mass-size relations ($M_*-R_e$) of galaxies
as a function of morphological type as well as for disks and bulges, separately. We quantify that
one-third of the current stellar mass of the Universe was formed during the last 8 Gyr. We find that
the moderate growth of the high-mass end of the SMF is dominated by the growth of elliptical systems
and that the vast majority of the stellar mass of the Universe is locked up in disk+bulge systems at
all epochs and that they increase their contribution to the total SMD with time. The contribution
of the pure-disk morphology gradually decreases with time ($\sim40\%$), while ellipticals increase
their contribution by a factor of $1.7$ since $z = 1$. By decomposing galaxies into disks and bulges
we quantify that on average $\sim50\%$ of the total stellar mass of the Universe at all epochs is in
disk structures with this contribution relatively unchanged since $z \sim 0.6$. With this comes
more rapid growth of pseudo-bulges and spheroids (bulges and ellipticals) in mass. Furthermore,
while the cosmic star-formation history is declining the Universe is transitioning from a disk
dominated era to ...

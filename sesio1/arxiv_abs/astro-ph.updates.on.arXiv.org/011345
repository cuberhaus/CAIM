The chemical element nickel is of particular interest in stellar physics. In the layers in which
the Fe-peak elements dominate the mean opacity (the so-called Z-bump), Ni is the second contributor
to the Rosseland opacity after iron, according to the Opacity Project data. Reliable nickel cross
sections are therefore mandatory for building realistic stellar models, especially for main-sequence
pulsators such as $\beta$ Cep and slowly pulsating B stars, whose oscillations are triggered by
the $\kappa$-mechanism of the Fe-peak elements. Unfortunately, the Opacity Project data for Ni
were extrapolated from those of Fe, and previous studies have shown that they were underestimated
in comparison to detailed calculations. We investigate the impact of newly computed monochromatic
cross sections on the Rosseland mean opacity of Ni and on the structure of main-sequence massive
pulsators. We compare our results with the widely used Opacity Project and OPAL data. Monochromatic
cross sections for Ni were obtained with the SCO-RCG code. The Toulouse-Geneva evolution code was
used to build the stellar models. With the new data, the Rosseland opacities of Ni are roughly the
same as those of the Opacity Project or OPAL at high temperatures ($\log\ T>6$). At lower temperatures,
significant departures are observed; the ratios are up to six times higher with SCO-RCG. These discrepancies
span a wider temperature range in the comparison with OPAL than in comparison with the Opacity Project.
For massive star models, the results of the comparison with a structure computed with Opacity Project
data show that the Rosseland mean of the global stellar mixture is only marginally altered in the
Z-bump. The maximum opacity is shifted towards slightly more superficial layers. A new maximum
appears in the temperature derivative of the mean opacity, and the driving of the pulsations should
be affected.

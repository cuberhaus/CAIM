Luminous blue variable stars (LBVs) are of great interest in massive-star evolution as they experience
very high mass-loss episodes within short periods of time. HR Car is a famous member of this class
in the Galaxy. It has a large circumstellar nebula and has also been confirmed as being in a binary
system. One means of gaining information about the evolutionary status and physical nature of LBVs
is studying their environments. We investigated the stellar content within ~100 pc of HR Car and
also its circumstellar nebula. Very Large Telescope (VLT) Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE)
observations of a 2'x2' region around the star highlight the incompleteness of stellar classification
for stars with magnitudes of V > 13 mag. Eight B0 to B9 stars have been identified which may lie in close
spatial vicinity to HR Car. For a region with a radius of r =1.2 degree (~100 pc at a distance of 4.8 kpc)
around HR Car, existing catalogs list several late O-type and early B-type stars, but only one early
O-type star. Given the relatively low stellar and nebular masses in the HR Car system, no early O-type
stars and only a few late O-type stars would be expected in association with HR Car. Instead, HR Car's
location in a point vector diagram suggests that HR Car is not isolated, but is part of a moving group
with a population of B-type stars in a spiral arm, and it has not received a strong kick from a supernova
explosion of a companion star or a merger event. Potential binary evolution pathways for the HR Car
system cannot be fully explored because of the unknown nature of the companion star. Furthermore,
the MUSE observations reveal the presence of a fast outflow and "bullets" that have been ejected
at intervals of about 400 years. These features may have been caused by recurrent mass transfer in
the system.

Traditional dark matter models, eg. WIMPs, assume dark matter is weakly coupled to the standard
model so that elastic scattering between dark matter and baryons can be described perturbatively
by Born approximation. Most direct detection experiments are analyzed according to that assumption.
We show that when the fundamental DM-baryon interaction is attractive, dark matter-nucleus scattering
is non-perturbative in much of the relevant parameter range. The cross section exhibits rich resonant
behavior with a highly non-trivial dependence on atomic mass; furthermore, the extended rather
than point-like nature of nuclei significantly impacts the cross sections. The repulsive case
also requires full numerical calculation. These non-perturbative effects change existing constraints.
Near a resonance value of the parameters, the cross section has non-trivial velocity dependence
rather than the usual $\sigma \sim v^0$; we take the velocity dependence into account. (However
doing so has little impact on current constraints.) We report the corrected exclusion regions superseding
previous limits from XQC, CRESST Surface Run, CMB power spectrum and extensions with Lyman-$\alpha$
and Milky Way satellites, and Milky Way gas clouds. Some limits become weaker than previous bounds
in the literature, while others become stronger. Gaps which open by correct treatment of some particular
constraint can sometimes be closed using a different constraint. We also discuss the dependence
on mediator mass and give approximate expressions for the velocity dependence near a resonance.
Sexaquark ($uuddss$) DM with mass around 2 GeV, which exchanges QCD mesons with baryons, remains
unconstrained for most of the parameter space of interest. A statement in the literature that a DM-nucleus
cross section larger than $10^{-25}\,{\rm cm}^2$ implies dark matter is composite, is corrected.

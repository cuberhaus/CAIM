Context. Gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows originate from the interaction between the relativistic
ejecta and the surrounding medium. Consequently, their properties depend on several aspects:
radiation mechanisms, relativistic shock micro-physics, circumburst environment, and the structure
and geometry of the relativistic jet. While the standard afterglow model accounts for the overall
spectral and temporal evolution for a number of GRBs, its validity limits emerge when the data set
is particularly rich and constraining, especially in the radio band. Aims. We aimed to model the
afterglow of the long GRB160131A (redshift $z = 0.972$), for which we collected a rich, broadband,
and accurate data set, spanning from $6\times10^{8}$ to $7\times10^{17}$ Hz in frequency, and
from 330 s to 160 days post burst in time. Methods. We modelled the spectral and temporal evolution
of this GRB afterglow through two approaches: the adoption of empirical functions to model optical/X-rays
data set, later assessing their compatibility with the radio domain; the inclusion of the entire
multi-frequency data set simultaneously through the Python package named sAGa (Software for AfterGlow
Analysis), to come up with an exhaustive and self-consistent description of the micro-physics,
geometry, and dynamics of the afterglow. Results. From deep broadband analysis (from radio to X-ray
frequencies) of the afterglow light curves, GRB160131A outflow shows evidence of jetted emission.
Moreover, we observe dust extinction in the optical spectra, and energy injection in the optical/X-ray
data. Radio spectra are characterised by several peaks, that could be due to either interstellar
scintillation (ISS) effects or a multi-component structure. Conclusions. The inclusion of radio
data in the broadband set of GRB160131A makes a self-consistent modelling hardly attainable within
the standard model of GRB afterglows.

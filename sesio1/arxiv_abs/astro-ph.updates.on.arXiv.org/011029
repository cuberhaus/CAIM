Arc- and tail-like structures associated with disks around Herbig stars can be a consequence of
infall events occurring after the initial collapse phase of a forming star. An encounter event of
gas with a star can lead to the formation of a second-generation disk after the initial protostellar
collapse phase. Additionally, observations of shadows in disks can be well described by a configuration
of misaligned inner and outer disk, such that the inner disk casts a shadow on the outer disk. Carrying
out altogether eleven 3D hydrodynamical models with the moving mesh code AREPO, we test whether
a late encounter of an existing star-disk system with a cloudlet of gas can lead to the formation of
an outer disk that is misaligned with respect to the primordial inner disk. Our models demonstrate
that a second-generation disk with large misalignment with respect to an existing primordial disk
can easily form if the infall angle is large. The second-generation outer disk is more eccentric,
though the asymmetric infall also triggers eccentricity of the inner disk of $e\approx 0.05$ to
$0.1$. Retrograde infall can lead to the formation of counter-rotating disks and enhanced accretion.
As the angular momentum of the inner disk is reduced, the inner disk shrinks and a gap forms between
the two disks. The resulting misaligned disk system can survive for $\sim 100$ kyr or longer without
aligning each other even for low primordial disk masses given an infall mass of $\sim 10^{-4}$ M$_{\odot}$.
A synthetic image reveals shadows in the outer disk similar to the ones observed in multiple transition
disks that are caused by the misaligned inner disk. We conclude that late inclined infall onto a star-disk
system leads to the formation of a misaligned outer disk. Infall might therefore be responsible
for observations of shadows in at least some transition disks.

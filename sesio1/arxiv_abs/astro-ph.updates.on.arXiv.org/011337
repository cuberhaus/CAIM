We report on the masses ($M_\mathrm{WD}$), effective temperatures ($T_\mathrm{eff}$) and secular
mean accretion rates ($\langle \dot{M} \rangle$) of 43 cataclysmic variable (CV) white dwarfs,
42 of which were obtained from the combined analysis of their $\mathit{Hubble~Space~Telescope}$
ultraviolet data with the parallaxes provided by the Early Third Data Release of the $\mathit{Gaia}$
space mission, and one from the white dwarf gravitational redshift. Our results double the number
of CV white dwarfs with an accurate mass measurement, bringing the total census to 89 systems. From
the study of the mass distribution, we derive $\langle M_\mathrm{WD} \rangle = 0.81^{+0.16}_{-0.20}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$,
in perfect agreement with previous results, and find no evidence of any evolution of the mass with
orbital period. Moreover, we identify five systems with $M_\mathrm{WD} < 0.5\mathrm{M_\odot}$,
which are most likely representative of helium-core white dwarfs, showing that these CVs are present
in the overall population. We reveal the presence of an anti-correlation between the average accretion
rates and the white dwarf masses for the systems below the $2-3\,$h period gap. Since $\langle \dot{M}
\rangle$ reflects the rate of system angular momentum loss, this correlation suggests the presence
of an additional mechanism of angular momentum loss that is more efficient at low white dwarf masses.
This is the fundamental concept of the recently proposed empirical prescription of consequential
angular momentum loss (eCAML) and our results provide observational support for it, although we
also highlight how its current recipe needs to be refined to better reproduce the observed scatter
in $T_\mathrm{eff}$ and $\langle \dot{M} \rangle$, and the presence of helium-core white dwarfs.

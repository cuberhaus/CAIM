There may be a chance of small-scale ephemeral liquid water formation on present day Mars, even though
the current climate does not support the existence of larger bodies of water. Through a process called
deliquescence, hygroscopic salts can enter solution by absorbing water vapor directly from the
atmosphere. Due to the absence of in-situ deliquescence experiments so far, the most reliable way
to forecast deliquescence is through atmospherical modeling, however, the locations and times
when salty liquid water could emerge are not yet well known. In this paper we present our results of
likely brine formation on Mars, their proposed locations and seasons, as well as the possible limiting
factors. For our calculations we used the data of Laboratoire de M\'et\'eorologie Dynamique Mars
General Circulation Model version 5. The results show that from L$_s$ 35$^\circ$ - L$_s$ 160$^\circ$,
between 9 PM and 11 PM there is a good chance for calcium perchlorate deliquescence above 30$^\circ$
N, while in this zone the ideal regions are concentrated mostly to Acidalia Planitia and Utopia Planitia
between 1 AM and 3 AM. We found that in the Southern Hemisphere, between L$_s$ 195$^\circ$ and L$_s$
320$^\circ$, there is a noticeable, but weaker band in the vicinity of 60$^\circ$ S, and both Argyre
Planitia and Hellas Planitia show some chance for brine formation. According to our statistics
the key limiting factor of deliquescence could be relative humidity in most cases. Our results suggest
that during summer -- early fall seasons, there could be deliquescence in both hemispheres in specific
areas from the late evening until the early morning hours. There are only few studies detailing the
geological and temporal distribution of brine formation through deliquescence, thus this work
could be used as a good guide for future landing site analysis or in choosing a specific location for
further research.

We present the results from high-resolution observations carried out with the eMERLIN UK-array
and the European VLBI network (EVN) for a sample of 15 FR0s, i.e. compact core-dominated radio sources
associated with nearby early-type galaxies (ETGs) which represent the bulk of the local radio galaxy
population. The 5-GHz eMERLIN observations available for 5 objects exhibit sub-mJy core components,
and reveal pc-scale twin jets for 4 out of 5 FR0s once the eMERLIN and JVLA archival visibilities data
are combined. The 1.66-GHz EVN observations available for 10 FR0s display one- and two-sided jetted
morphologies and compact cores. The pc-scale core emission contributes, on average, to about one
tenth of the total extended radio emission, although we note a increasing core contribution for
flat/inverted-spectrum sources. We found an unprecedented linear correlation between the pc-scale
core luminosity ($\sim$10$^{21.3}$-10$^{23.6}$ W Hz$^{-1}$) and [O III] line luminosity, generally
considered as proxy of the accretion power, for a large sample of LINER-type radio-loud low-luminosity
active nuclei, all hosted in massive ETGs, which include FR0s and FRIs. This result represents further
evidence of a common jet-disc coupling in FR0s and FRIs, despite they differ in kpc-scale radio structure.
For our objects and for other FR0 samples reported in the literature, we estimate the jet brightness
sidedness ratios, which typically range between 1 and 3. This parameter roughly gauges the jet bulk
Lorentz factor $\Gamma$, which turns out to range between 1 and 2.5 for most of the sample. This corroborates
the scenario that FR0s are characterized by mildly-relativistic jets, possibly as a result of lower
spinning black holes (BHs) than the highly-spinning BHs of relativistic-jetted radio galaxies,
FRIs.

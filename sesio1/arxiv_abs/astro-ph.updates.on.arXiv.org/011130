Dark sector, constituting about 95 percent of the Universe, remains the subject of numerous studies.
There are lots of models dealing with the cause of the effects assigned to dark matter and dark energy.
This brief review is devoted to the very recent theoretical advances in these areas: only to the advances
achieved in the last few years. For example, in section devoted to particle dark matter we overview
recent publications on sterile neutrinos, self-interacting dark matter, dibarions, dark matter
from primordial bubbles, primordial black holes as dark matter, axions escaping from neutron stars,
and dark and usual matter interacting via the fifth dimension. We also overview the second flavor
of hydrogen atoms: their existence was proven by analyzing atomic experiments and is also evidenced
by the latest astrophysical observations of the 21 cm spectral line from the early Universe. While
discussing non-particle models of the cause of dark matter effects, we refer to modified Newtonian
dynamics and modifications of the strong equivalence principles. We also consider exotic compact
objects, primordial black holes, and retardation effects. Finally, we review recent studies on
the cause of dark energy effects. Specifically, we cover two disputes that arose in 2019 and 2020
on whether the observations of supernovas, previously interpreted as the proof of the existence
of dark energy, could have alternative explanations. Besides, we note a study of 2021, where dark
energy is substituted by a new hypothetical type of dark matter having a magnetic-type interaction.
We also refer to the recent model of a system of nonrelativistic neutral gravitating particles providing
an alternative explanation of the entire dynamics of the Universe expansion. without introducing
dark energy or new gravitational degrees of freedom.

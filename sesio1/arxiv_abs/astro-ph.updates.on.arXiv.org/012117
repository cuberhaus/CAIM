The MOND paradigm is an empirical theory with modified gravity to reproduce many astronomical observations
without invoking the dark matter hypothesis. Instead of falsifying the existence of dark matter,
we propose that MOND is an effective theory naturally emerging from the long-range and collisionless
nature of dark matter flow. It essentially describes the dynamics of baryonic mass suspended in
fluctuating dark matter fluid. We first review the unique properties of self-gravitating collisionless
dark matter flow (SG-CFD), followed by their implications in the origin of MOND theory. To maximize
system entropy, the long-range interaction requires a broad size of halos to be formed. These halos
facilitate an inverse mass and energy cascade from small to large mass scales that involves a constant
rate of energy transfer $\epsilon_u$=$-4.6\times10^{-7}m^2/s^3$. In addition to the velocity
fluctuation with a typical scale $u$, the long-range interaction leads to a fluctuation in acceleration
with a typical scale $a_0$ that matches the value of critical MOND acceleration. The velocity and
acceleration fluctuations in dark matter flow satisfy the equality $\epsilon_u$=$-a_0u/(3\pi)^2$
such that $a_0$ can be determined. A notable (unexplained) coincidence of cosmological constant
$\Lambda\propto (a_0/c)^2$ might point to a dark energy density proportional to acceleration
fluctuation, i.e. $\rho_{vac}\propto a_0^2/G$. At z=0 with $u$=354.61km/s, $a_0$=$1.2\times10^{-10}m/s^2$
can be obtained. For given particle velocity $v_p$, maximum entropy distributions developed from
mass/energy cascade lead to a particle kinetic energy $\epsilon_k\propto v_p$ at small acceleration
$<a_0$ and $\epsilon_k\propto v_p^2$ for large acceleration $>a_0$. Combining this with the constant
rate of energy transfer $\epsilon_u$, both regular Newtonian dynamics and deep-MOND behavior
can be fully recovered.

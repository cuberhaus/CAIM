Improving our understanding of the nuclear properties of high-Eddington ratio ($\lambda_\mathrm{Edd}$)
active galactic nuclei (AGN) is necessary since the bulk of X-ray spectroscopic studies have been
focused on low-Eddington AGN. We present here the X-ray spectral analysis of 14 radio-quiet, $\lambda_\mathrm{Edd}\gtrsim1$
AGN at $0.4\leq z \leq 0.75$, observed with XMM-Newton. Optical/UV data from simultaneous Optical
Monitor observations have been also considered. These AGN have been selected to have relatively
high values of black hole mass ($M_\mathrm{BH}\sim10^{8-8.5}M_\odot$) and bolometric luminosity
($L_\mathrm{bol} \sim 10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$), in order to complement previous studies of high-Eddington
AGN at lower $M_\mathrm{BH}$ and $L_\mathrm{bol}$. We studied the relation between $\lambda_\mathrm{Edd}$
and other key X-ray spectral parameters, such as the photon index of the power-law continuum $\Gamma$,
the X-ray bolometric correction $k_\mathrm{bol,X}$ and $\alpha_\mathrm{ox}$. Despite the homogeneous
optical and SMBH accretion properties, the X-ray properties of these high-Eddington AGN are quite
heterogeneous. We measured values of $\Gamma$ comprised between 1.3 and 2.5, at odds with the expectations
based on previously reported $\Gamma-\lambda_\mathrm{Edd}$ relations, by which $\Gamma\geq2$
would be an ubiquitous hallmark of AGN with $\lambda_\mathrm{Edd}\sim1$. We found that $\sim30\%$
of the sources are X-ray weak, with an X-ray emission about a factor of $\sim10-80$ fainter than that
of typical AGN at similar UV luminosities. The X-ray weakness seems to be intrinsic and not due to
intervening obscuration. This may indicate that high-Eddington AGN commonly undergo periods
of intrinsic X-ray weakness. Furthermore, results from a follow-up monitoring with Swift of one
of these X-ray weak AGN suggest that these periods can last for several years.

We present a study of the filamentary structure in the atomic hydrogen (HI) emission at the 21 cm wavelength
toward the Galactic plane using the observations in the HI4PI survey. Using the Hessian matrix method
across radial velocity channels, we identified the filamentary structures and quantified their
orientations using circular statistics. We found that the regions of the Milky Way's disk beyond
10 kpc and up to roughly 18 kpc from the Galactic center display HI filamentary structures predominantly
parallel to the Galactic plane. For regions at lower Galactocentric radii, we found that the HI filaments
are mostly perpendicular or do not have a preferred orientation with respect to the Galactic plane.
We interpret these results as the imprint of supernova feedback in the inner Galaxy and Galactic
rotation in the outer Milky Way. We found that the HI filamentary structures follow the Galactic
warp and that they highlight some of the variations interpreted as the effect of the gravitational
interaction with satellite galaxies. In addition, the mean scale height of the filamentary structures
is lower than that sampled by the bulk of the HI emission, thus indicating that the cold and warm atomic
hydrogen phases have different scale heights in the outer galaxy. Finally, we found that the fraction
of the column density in HI filaments is almost constant up to approximately 18 kpc from the Galactic
center. This is possibly a result of the roughly constant ratio between the cold and warm atomic hydrogen
phases inferred from the HI absorption studies. Our results indicate that the HI filamentary structures
provide insight into the dynamical processes shaping the Galactic disk. Their orientations record
how and where the stellar energy input, the Galactic fountain process, the cosmic ray diffusion,
and the gas accretion have molded the diffuse interstellar medium in the Galactic plane.

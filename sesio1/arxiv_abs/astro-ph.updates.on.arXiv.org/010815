Knowledge of solar irradiance variability is critical to Earth's climate models and understanding
the solar influence on Earth's climate. Direct solar irradiance measurements are only available
since 1978. Reconstructions of past variability typically rely on sunspot data. These provide
only indirect information on the facular and network regions, which are decisive contributors
to irradiance variability on timescales of the solar cycle and longer. Our ultimate goal is to reconstruct
past solar irradiance variations using historical full-disc Ca II K observations to describe the
facular contribution independently of sunspot observations. Here, we develop the method and test
it extensively by using modern CCD-based Ca II K observations and carry out initial tests on two photographic
archives. We employ carefully reduced and calibrated Ca II K images from 13 datasets, such as those
from the Meudon, Mt Wilson, and Rome observatories. We convert them to unsigned magnetograms and
then use them as input to the adapted SATIRE model to reconstruct TSI variations over the period 1978-2019,
for which direct irradiance measurements are available. The reconstructed TSI from the analysed
Ca II K archives agrees well with direct TSI measurements and existing reconstructions. The model
also returns good results on data taken with different bandpasses and images with low spatial resolution.
Historical Ca II K archives suffer from numerous inconsistencies, but we show that these archives
can still be used to reconstruct TSI with reasonable accuracy provided the observations are accurately
processed. By using the unsigned magnetograms of the Sun reconstructed from high-quality Ca II
K observations as input into the SATIRE model, we can reconstruct solar irradiance variations nearly
as accurately as from directly recorded magnetograms.

The variety of star formation histories (SFHs) of $z\gtrsim6$ galaxies provides important insights
into early star formation, but has been difficult to systematically quantify. Some observations
suggest that many $z\sim6-9$ galaxies are dominated by old ($\gtrsim200$ Myr) stellar populations,
implying significant star formation at $z\gtrsim9$, while others find that most reionization
era galaxies are young ($\lesssim10$ Myr), consistent with little $z\gtrsim9$ star formation.
In this work, we quantify the distribution of ages and SFHs of UV-bright ($-22.5\lesssim M_{UV}\lesssim-21$)
galaxies colour-selected to lie at $z\simeq6.6-6.9$, a redshift range where stellar and nebular
emission can be photometrically separated and galaxy properties robustly inferred, providing
the ideal opportunity to systematically study the SFHs of reionization era galaxies. We infer the
properties of the sample with two spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling codes and compare
their results, finding that stellar masses are largely insensitive to the physical model, but the
inferred ages can vary by an order of magnitude. We then infer a distribution of ages assuming a simple,
parametric SFH model, finding a median age of $\sim30-100$ Myr depending on the SED model. We quantify
the fractions of young ($\leq10$ Myr) and old ($\geq250$ Myr) galaxies and find that these systems
comprise $\sim10-30$% and $\sim20-30$% of the population, respectively. With a more flexible
SFH model, the general shape of the SFHs are consistent with those implied by the simple model (e.g.
young galaxies have rapidly rising SFHs). However, stellar masses can differ significantly, with
those of young systems sometimes being more than an order of magnitude larger with the flexible SFH.
Finally, we quantify the implications of these results for $z\gtrsim9$ stellar mass assembly and
discuss improvements expected from JWST.

Spectroscopically, TDEs are characterized by broad ( 10$^{4}$ km/s) emission lines and show large
diversity as well as different line profiles. After carefully and consistently performing a series
of data reduction tasks including host galaxy light subtraction, we present here the first detailed,
spectroscopic population study of 16 optical/UV TDEs. We report a time lag between the peaks of the
optical light-curves and the peak luminosity of H$\alpha$ spanning between 7 - 45 days. If interpreted
as light-echoes, these lags correspond to distances of 2 - 12 x 10$^{16}$ cm, one to two orders of magnitudes
larger than the estimated blackbody radii (R$_{\rm BB}$) of the same TDEs and we discuss the possible
origin of this surprisingly large discrepancy. We also report time lags for the peak luminosity
of He I $\lambda$5876 line; smaller than the ones of H$\alpha$ for H TDEs and similar or larger for
N III Bowen TDEs. We report that N III Bowen TDEs have lower H$\alpha$ velocity widths compared to
the rest of the TDEs in our sample and we also find that a strong X-ray to optical ratio might imply weakening
of the line widths. Furthermore, we study the evolution of line luminosities and ratios with respect
to their radii (R$_{\rm BB}$) and temperatures (T$_{\rm BB}$). We find a linear relationship between
H$\alpha$ luminosity and the R$_{\rm BB}$ and potentially an inverse power-law relation with T$_{\rm
BB}$ leading to weaker H$\alpha$ emission for T$_{\rm BB}$ $\geq$ 25000 K. The He II/He I ratio becomes
large at the same temperatures possibly pointing to an ionization effect. The He II/H$\alpha$ ratio
becomes larger as the photospheric radius recedes, implying a stratified photosphere where Helium
lies deeper than Hydrogen. We suggest that the large diversity of the spectroscopic features seen
in TDEs along with their X-ray properties, can potentially be attributed to viewing angle effects.

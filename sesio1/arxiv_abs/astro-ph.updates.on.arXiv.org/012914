Nuclear systems under constraints, with high degrees of symmetries and/or collectivities may
be considered as moving effectively in spaces with reduced spatial dimensions. We first derive
analytical expressions for the nucleon specific energy $E_0(\rho)$, pressure $P_0(\rho)$, incompressibility
coefficient $K_0(\rho)$ and skewness coefficient $J_0(\rho)$ of symmetric nucleonic matter
(SNM), the quadratic symmetry energy $E_{\rm{sym}}(\rho)$, its slope parameter $L(\rho)$ and
curvature coefficient $K_{\rm{sym}}(\rho)$ as well as the fourth-order symmetry energy $E_{\rm{sym,4}}(\rho)$
of neutron-rich matter in general $d$ spatial dimensions (abbreviated as "$d$D") in terms of the
isoscalar and isovector parts of the isospin-dependent single-nucleon potential according to
the generalized Hugenholtz-Van Hove (HVH) theorem. The equation of state (EOS) of nuclear matter
in $d$D can be linked to that in the conventional 3-dimensional (3D) space by the $\epsilon$-expansion
which is a perturbative approach successfully used previously in treating second-order phase
transitions and related critical phenomena and more recently in studying the EOS of cold atoms.
The $\epsilon$-expansion of nuclear EOS in $d$D based on a reference dimension $d_{\rm{f}}=d-\epsilon$
is shown to be effective with $-1\lesssim\epsilon\lesssim1$ starting from $1\lesssim d_{\rm{f}}\lesssim3$
in comparison with the exact expressions derived using the HVH theorem. Moreover, the EOS of SNM
(with/without considering its potential part) is found to be reduced (enhanced) in lower (higher)
dimensions, indicating in particular that the many-nucleon system tends to be deeper bounded but
saturate at higher densities in spaces with lower dimensions. The links between the EOSs in 3D and
$d$D spaces from the $\epsilon$-expansion provide new perspectives to the EOS of neutron-rich
matter.

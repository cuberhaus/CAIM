The fragmentation process in massive star-forming regions is one of the contemporary problems
in astrophysics, and several physical processes have been proposed to control the fragmentation
including turbulence, magnetic field, rotation, stellar feedback, and gravity. However, the
fragmentation process has been poorly studied at small spatial scales well below 1000 AU. We aim
to use ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter and Submillimeter Array) high angular resolution data to
identify the fragments in W51 IRS2 and to study the fragmentation properties on a spatial scale of
200 AU. We used ALMA data of W51 IRS2 from three projects, which give an angular resolution of 0.028$^{\prime\prime}$
(144 AU) at millimeter wavelengths. We identified compact fragments by using {\it uv}-range constrained
1.3 mm continuum data. A Mean Surface Density of Companions (MSDC) analysis has been performed to
study the separations between fragments. A total number of 33 continuum sources are identified
and 29 out of them are defined as fragments in the surveyed region.The MSDC analysis reveals two breaks
corresponding to spatial sales of 1845 AU and 7346 AU, indicative of a two-level clustering phenomenon,
along with a linear regime below 1845 AU, mostly associated with W51 North, whose slope is consistent
with the slope for the clustering regime of other cluster-like regions in the Galaxy. The typical
masses and separations of the fragments as well as the relation between density and number of fragments
can be explained through a thermal Jeans process operating at high temperatures of 200--400 K, consistent
with previous measurements of the temperature in the region, and produced by the nearby massive
stars. Therefore, although W51 IRS2 seems to be undergoing a thermally inhibited fragmentation
phase, this does not seem to prevent the formation of a protocluster associated with W51 North.

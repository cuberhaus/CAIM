We present band 6 ALMA observations of a heavily-obscured radio-loud ($L_{1.4\ \mathrm{GHz}}=10^{25.4}$
W Hz$^{-1}$) AGN candidate at $z_\mathrm{phot}=6.83\pm0.06$ found in the 1.5 deg$^2$ COSMOS field.
The ALMA data reveal detections of exceptionally strong [CII]158$\mu$m ($z_\mathrm{[CII]}=6.8532$)
and underlying dust continuum emission from this object (COS-87259), where the [CII] line luminosity,
line width, and 158$\mu$m continuum luminosity are comparable to that seen from $z\sim7$ sub-mm
galaxies and quasar hosts. The 158$\mu$m continuum detection suggests a total infrared luminosity
of $9\times10^{12}$ $L_\odot$ with corresponding very large obscured star formation rate (1300
$M_\odot$/yr) and dust mass ($2\times10^9$ $M_\odot$). The apparent strong Balmer break seen
between the VIRCam and IRAC photometry suggests that COS-87259 is an extremely massive reionization
era galaxy with $M_\ast\approx1.7\times10^{11}$ $M_\odot$. Moreover, the MIPS, PACS, and SPIRE
detections imply that this object harbors an AGN that is heavily obscured ($\tau_{_{\mathrm{9.7\mu
m}}}=2.3$) with a bolometric luminosity of approximately $5\times10^{13}$ $L_\odot$. Such a
very high AGN luminosity suggests this object is powered by an $\approx$1.6 $\times$ 10$^9$ $M_\odot$
black hole if accreting near the Eddington limit, and is effectively a highly-obscured version
of an extremely UV-luminous ($M_{1450}\approx-27.3$) $z\sim7$ quasar. Notably, these $z\sim7$
quasars are an exceedingly rare population ($\sim$0.001 deg$^{-2}$) while COS-87259 was identified
over a relatively small field. Future very wide-area surveys with, e.g., Roman and Euclid have the
potential to identify many more extremely red yet UV-bright $z\gtrsim7$ objects similar to COS-87259,
providing richer insight into the occurrence of intense obscured star formation and supermassive
black hole growth among this population.

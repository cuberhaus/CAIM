For sufficiently wide ranges of applied control signals (control voltages), MEMS and piezoelectric
Deformable Mirrors (DMs), exhibit nonlinear behavior. The nonlinear behavior manifests itself
in nonlinear actuator couplings, nonlinear actuator deformation characteristics, and in the
case of piezoelectric DMs, hysteresis. Furthermore, in a number of situations, DM behavior can
change over time, and this requires a procedure for updating the DM models on the basis of the observed
data. If not properly modeled and if not taken into account when designing control algorithms, nonlinearities,
and time-varying DM behavior, can significantly degrade the achievable closed-loop performance
of Adaptive Optics (AO) systems. Widely used approaches for DM control are based on pre-estimated
linear time-invariant DM models in the form of influence matrices. Often, these models are not being
updated during system operation. Consequently, when the nonlinear DM behavior is excited by control
signals with wide operating ranges, or when the DM behavior changes over time, the state-of-the-art
DM control approaches relying upon linear control methods, might not be able to produce a satisfactory
closed-loop performance of an AO system. Motivated by these key facts, we present a novel method
for data-driven DM control. Our approach combines a simple open-loop control method with a recursive
least squares method for dynamically updating the DM model. The DM model is constantly being updated
on the basis of the dynamically changing DM operating points. That is, the proposed method updates
both the control actions and the DM model during the system operation. We experimentally verify
this approach on a Boston Micromachines MEMS DM with 140 actuators. Preliminary experimental results
reported in this manuscript demonstrate good potential for using the developed method for DM control.

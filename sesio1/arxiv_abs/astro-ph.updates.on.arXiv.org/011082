Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are mysterious astronomical radio transients with extremely short intrinsic
duration. Until now, the physical origins of them still remain elusive especially for the non-repeating
FRBs. Strongly inspired by recent progress on possible evidence of Earth-mass primordial black
holes, we revisit the model of Earth-mass primordial black holes mergers as sources for non-repeating
FRBs. Under the null hypothesis that the observed non-repeating FRBs are originated from the mergers
of Earth-mass primordial black holes, we analyzed four independent samples of non-repeating FRBs
to study the model parameters i.e. the typical charge value $q_{\rm{c}}$ and the power index $\alpha$
of the charge distribution function of the primordial black hole population $\phi(q) \propto (q/q_{\rm{c}})^{-\alpha}$
which describe how the charge was distributed in the population. $q$ is the charge of the hole in the
unit of $\sqrt{G} M$, where $M$ is the mass of the hole. It turns out that this model can explain the
observed data well. {Assuming the monochromatic mass spectrum for primordial black holes}, we
get the average value of typical charge $\bar{q}_{\rm{c}}/10^{-5}=1.59^{+0.08}_{-0.18}$ and
the power index $\bar{\alpha}=4.53^{+0.21}_{-0.14}$ by combining the fitting results given
by four non-repeating FRB samples. The event rate of the non-repeating FRBs can be explained in the
context of this model, if the abundance of the primordial black hole populations with charge $q \gtrsim
10^{-6}$ is larger than $10^{-5}$ which is far below the upper limit given by current observations
for the abundance of Earth-mass primordial black holes. In the future, simultaneous detection
of FRBs and high frequency gravitational waves produced by mergers of Earth-mass primordial black
holes may directly confirm or deny this model.

Though cluster-summed luminosities have served as mass proxies, cluster-summed colors have received
less attention. Since galaxy colors have given useful insights into dust content and specific star
formation rates, this research investigates possible correlations between cluster-summed colors
and various observable and intrinsic halo properties for clusters in subsamples of TNG, SDSS, and
Buzzard. Cluster color--magnitude space shows a peak towards the red and bright corner, drawn there
by bright red galaxies. Summing colors across a cluster reduces the scatter in color spaces, since
magnitude summing acts somewhat like a weighted average. The correlation between these summed
colors were $(73 \pm 24)\%$ across all three datasets. Summed colors and cluster properties typically
had low correlations but ranged up to $\sim 40\%$. The correlation between color and mass didn't
change significantly with richness threshold for TNG and Buzzard, but for SDSS the correlation
decreased dramatically with increasing richness, passing from positive correlation to negative
correlation near a richness threshold of ten. We also looked at mass proxy scaling relations with
richness or magnitude and measured the reduction in mass scatter once we added cluster colors. The
reduction was generally insignificant, but several large reductions in mass scatter occurred
under certain circumstances: high-richness Buzzard mass--magnitude relation saw a reduction
of $(19 \pm 28)\%$ while low-richness SDSS saw similar order reductions of $(16 \pm 8)\%$ and $(14
\pm 8)\%$ for the mass--richness and mass--magnitude relations respectively. This first look
at summed cluster color shows potential in aiding mass proxies under certain circumstances, but
more deliberate and thorough investigations are needed to better characterize and make use of cluster-summed
colors.

Dark Energy is the largest fraction of the energy density of our Universe - yet it remains one of the
enduring enigmas of our times. Here we show that Dark Energy can be used to solve 2 tantalizing mysteries
of the observable universe. We build on existing models of Dark Energy linked to neutrino masses.
In these models Dark Energy can undergo Phase Transitions and form Black Holes. Here we look at the
implications of the family structure of neutrinos for the phase transitions in dark energy and associated
peaks in black hole formation. It has been previously shown that one of these peaks in Black Hole formation
is associated with the observed peak in Quasar formation. Here, we predict that there will also be
an earlier peak in the Dark Energy Black Holes at high redshifts. These Dark Energy Black Holes formed
at high redshifts are Intermediate Mass Black Holes (IMBHs).These Dark Energy Black Holes at large
redshift can help explain both the EDGES observations and the observations of large Supermassive
Black Holes (SMBHs) at redshifts $z \sim 7$. The existence of an earlier phase of Dark Energy Black
Holes take care of some current challenges to theory implied by existing astronomical data and also
helps us look for these Dark Energy Black Holes at high redshifts as predicted here through targeted
searches for these Black Holes at the redshifts $z \sim 18$. There is a slight dependence of the location
of the peak on the lightest neutrino mass - so the peak may be located at a slightly lower value of the
redshift. This may actually enable a measurement of the lightest neutrino mass. Finding these Dark
Energy Black Holes of Intermediate Mass should be within the reach of upcoming observations - particularly
with the James Webb Space Telescope - but perhaps also through the use of other innovative techniques
focusing specifically on the redshifts around $z \sim 18$.

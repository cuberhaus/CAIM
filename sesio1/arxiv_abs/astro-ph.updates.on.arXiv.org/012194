In this paper we propose a new mathematical model capable of merging Darwinian Evolution, Human
History and SETI into a single mathematical scheme: 1) Darwinian Evolution over the last 3.5 billion
years is defined as one particular realization of a certain stochastic process called Geometric
Brownian Motion (GBM). This GBM yields the fluctuations in time of the number of species living on
Earth. Its mean value curve is an increasing exponential curve, i.e. the exponential growth of Evolution.
2) In 2008 this author provided the statistical generalization of the Drake equation yielding the
number N of communicating ET civilizations in the Galaxy. N was shown to follow the lognormal probability
distribution. 3) We call "b-lognormals" those lognormals starting at any positive time b ("birth")
larger than zero. Then the exponential growth curve becomes the geometric locus of the peaks of a
one-parameter family of b-lognormals: this is our way to re-define Cladistics. 4) b-lognormals
may be also be interpreted as the lifespan of any living being (a cell, or an animal, a plant, a human,
or even the historic lifetime of any civilization). Applying this new mathematical apparatus to
Human History, leads to the discovery of the exponential progress between Ancient Greece and the
current USA as the envelope of all b-lognormals of Western Civilizations over a period of 2500 years.
5) We then invoke Shannon's Information Theory. The b-lognormals' entropy turns out to be the index
of "development level" reached by each historic civilization. We thus get a numerical estimate
of the entropy difference between any two civilizations, like the Aztec-Spaniard difference in
1519. 6) In conclusion, we have derived a mathematical scheme capable of estimating how much more
advanced than Humans an Alien Civilization will be when the SETI scientists will detect the first
hints about ETs.

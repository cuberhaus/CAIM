Orbital characteristics based on Gaia Early Data Release 3 astrometric parameters are analyzed
for ${\sim} 8,000$ metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] $\leq -0.8$) compiled from the RAdial Velocity Experiment
(RAVE) Data Release 6. Selected as metal-poor candidates based on broadband photometry, RAVE collected
moderate-resolution ($R \sim 7,500$) spectra in the region of the Ca triplet for these stars. About
$20\%$ of the stars in this sample also have medium-resolution ($1,200 \lesssim R \lesssim 2,000$)
validation spectra obtained over a four-year campaign from $2014$ to $2017$ with a variety of telescopes.
We match the candidate stars to photometric metallicity determinations from the Huang et al. recalibration
of the Sky Mapper Southern Survey Data Release 2. We obtain dynamical clusters of these stars from
the orbital energy and cylindrical actions using the \HDBSCAN ~unsupervised learning algorithm.
We identify $179$ Dynamically Tagged Groups (DTGs) with between $5$ and $35$ members; $67$ DTGs
have at least $10$ member stars. Milky Way (MW) substructures such as Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus,
the Metal-Weak Thick Disk, the Splashed Disk, Thamnos, the Helmi Stream, and LMS-1 (Wukong) are
identified. Associations with MW globular clusters are determined for $10$ DTGs; no recognized
MW dwarf galaxies were associated with any of our DTGs. Previously identified dynamical groups
are also associated with our DTGs, with emphasis placed on their structural determination and possible
new identifications. We identify chemically peculiar stars as members of several DTGs; we find
$22$ DTGs that are associated with \textit{r}-process-enhanced stars. Carbon-enhanced metal-poor
(CEMP) stars are identified among the targets with available spectroscopy, and we assign these
to morphological groups following the approach given by Yoon et al.

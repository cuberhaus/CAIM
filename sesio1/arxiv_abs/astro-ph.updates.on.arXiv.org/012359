Combining large segmented space telescopes, coronagraphy and wavefront control methods is a promising
solution to produce a dark hole (DH) region in the coronagraphic image of an observed star and study
planetary companions. The thermal and mechanical evolution of such a high-contrast facility leads
to wavefront drifts that degrade the DH contrast during the observing time, thus limiting the ability
to retrieve planetary signals. Lyot-style coronagraphs are starlight suppression systems that
remove the central part of the image for an unresolved observed star, the point spread function,
with an opaque focal plane mask (FPM). When implemented with a flat mirror containing an etched pinhole,
the mask rejects part of the starlight through the pinhole which can be used to retrieve information
about low-order aberrations. We propose an active control scheme using a Zernike wavefront sensor
(ZWFS) to analyze the light rejected by the FPM, control low-order aberrations, and stabilize the
DH contrast. The concept formalism is first presented before characterizing the sensor behavior
in simulations and in laboratory. We then perform experimental tests to validate a wavefront control
loop using a ZWFS on the HiCAT testbed. By controlling the first 11 Zernike modes, we show a decrease
in wavefront error standard deviation by a factor of up to 9 between open- and closed-loop operations
using the ZWFS. In the presence of wavefront perturbations, we show the ability of this control loop
to stabilize a DH contrast around 7x10^-8 with a standard deviation of 7x10^-9. Active control with
a ZWFS proves a promising solution in Lyot coronagraphs with an FPM-filtered beam to control and
stabilize low-order wavefront aberrations and DH contrast for exoplanet imaging with future space
missions.

The bright central galaxies (BCGs) dominate the inner portion of the diffuse cluster light, but
it is still unclear where the intracluster light (ICL) takes over. To investigate the BCG-ICL transition,
we stack the images of ${\sim}3000$ clusters between $0.2{<}z{<}0.3$ in the SDSS $gri$ bands, and
measure their BCG+ICL stellar surface mass profile $\Sigma_{*}^{\texttt{B+I}}$ down to $3{\times}10^4\,M_{\odot}/\mathrm{kpc}^{2}$
at $R{\simeq}1\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ (${\sim}32$ mag/arcsec$^2$ in the $r$-band). We develop a physically-motivated
method to decompose $\Sigma_{*}^{\texttt{B+I}}$ into three components, including an inner de
Vaucouleurs' profile, an outer ICL that follows the dark matter distribution measured from weak
lensing, and an intriguing transitional component between 70 and 200 kpc. To investigate the origin
of this transition, we split the clusters into two subsamples by their BCG stellar mass $M_*^{\mathrm{BCG}}$
(mass enclosed roughly within 50 kpc) while making sure they have the same distribution of satellite
richness. The $\Sigma_{*}^{\texttt{B+I}}$ profiles of the two subsamples differ by more than
a factor of two at $R{<}50\,\mathrm{kpc}$, consistent with their 0.34 dex difference in $M_*^{\mathrm{BCG}}$,
whereas on scales beyond 400 kpc the two profiles converge to the same amplitudes, suggesting a satellite-stripping
origin of the outer ICL. Remarkably, however, the discrepancy between the two $\Sigma_{*}^{\texttt{B+I}}$
profiles persist at above $50\%$ level on all scales below 200 kpc, thereby revealing the BCG sphere
of influence with radius $R_{\mathrm{SOI}}{\simeq}$ 200 kpc. Finally, we speculate that the surprisingly
large sphere of influence of the BCG is tied to the elevated escape velocity profile within $r_s$,
the characteristic radius of the dark matter haloes.

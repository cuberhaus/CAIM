We introduce and validate a delensing framework for the Simons Observatory (SO), which will be used
to improve constraints on inflationary gravitational waves (IGWs) by reducing the lensing noise
in measurements of the $B$-modes in CMB polarization. SO will initially observe CMB by using three
small aperture telescopes and one large-aperture telescope. While polarization maps from small-aperture
telescopes will be used to constrain IGWs, the internal CMB lensing maps used to delens will be reconstructed
from data from the large-aperture telescope. Since lensing maps obtained from the SO data will be
noise-dominated on sub-degree scales, the SO lensing framework constructs a template for lensing-induced
$B$-modes by combining internal CMB lensing maps with maps of the cosmic infrared background from
Planck as well as galaxy density maps from the LSST survey. We construct a likelihood for constraining
the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ that contains auto- and cross-spectra between observed $B$-modes
and lensing $B$-mode template. We test our delensing analysis pipeline on map-based simulations
containing survey non-idealities, but that, for this initial exploration, do not include contamination
from Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds. We find that the SO survey masking and inhomogeneous
and atmospheric noise have very little impact on the delensing performance, and the $r$ constraint
becomes $\sigma(r)\approx 0.0015$ which is close to that obtained from the idealized forecasts
in the absence of the Galactic foreground and is nearly a factor of two tighter than without delensing.
We also find that uncertainties in the external large-scale structure tracers used in our multi-tracer
delensing pipeline lead to bias much smaller than the $1\,\sigma$ statistical uncertainties.

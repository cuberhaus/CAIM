Migration of giant planets in discs with low viscosity has been studied recently. The proportionality
between migration speed and the disc's viscosity is broken by the presence of vortices that appear
at the edges of the planet-induced gap. Our goal is to investigate vortex-driven migration in low-viscosity
discs in the presence of radial advection of gas, as expected from angular momentum removal by magnetised
disc winds. We performed three dimensional simulations using the grid-based code FARGOCA. We mimicked
the effects of a disc wind by applying a synthetic torque on a surface layer of the disc characterised
by a prescribed column density Sigma_A so that it results in a disc accretion rate of 10^-8 Solar masses
per year. Discs with this structure are called 'layered' and the layer where the torque is applied
is denoted as 'active'. We also consider the case of accretion focussed near the disc midplane to
mimic transport properties induced by a large Hall effect or by weak Ohmic diffusion. We observe
two migration phases: in the first phase, the migration of the planet is driven by the vortex and is
directed inwards. This phase ends when the vortex disappear. Migration depends on the ability of
the torque from the planet to block the accretion flow. When the flow is fast and unimpeded (small
Sigma_A) migration is very slow. When the accretion flow is completely blocked, migration is faster
and the speed is controlled by the rate at which the accretion flow refills the gap behind the migrating
planet. The migration speed of a giant planet in a layered protoplanetary disc depends on the thickness
of the accreting layer. The lack of large-scale migration apparently experienced by the majority
of giant exoplanets can be explained if the accreting layer is sufficiently thin to allow unimpeded
accretion through the disc.

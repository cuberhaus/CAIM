The morphology of galaxies reflects their assembly history and ongoing dynamical perturbations
from the environment. Analyzing i-band images from the Pan-STARRS1 Survey, we study the optical
morphological asymmetry of the host galaxies of a large, well-defined sample of nearby active galactic
nuclei (AGNs) to investigate the role of mergers and interactions in triggering nuclear activity.
The AGNs, comprising 245 type 1 and 4514 type 2 objects, are compared with 4537 star-forming galaxies
matched in redshift and stellar mass. We develop a comprehensive masking strategy to isolate the
emission of the target from foreground stars and other contaminating sources, all the while retaining
projected companions of comparable brightness that may be major mergers. Among three variants
of nonparametric indices, both the popular CAS asymmetry parameter and the outer asymmetry parameter
(A_outer) yield robust measures of morphological distortion for star-forming galaxies and type
2 AGNs, while only A_outer is effective for type 1 AGNs. The shape asymmetry, by comparison, is affected
more adversely by background noise. Asymmetry indices > 0.4 effectively trace systems that are
candidate ongoing mergers. Contrary to theoretical expectations, galaxy interactions and mergers
are not the main drivers of nuclear activity, at least not in our sample of low-redshift, relatively
low-luminosity AGNs, whose host galaxies are significantly less asymmetric than the control sample
of star-forming galaxies. Moreover, type 2 AGNs are morphologically indistinguishable from their
type 1 counterparts. The level of AGN activity does not correlate with asymmetry, not even among
the major merger candidates. As a by-product, we find, consistent with previous studies, that the
average asymmetry of star-forming galaxies increases above the main sequence, although not all
major mergers exhibit enhanced star formation.

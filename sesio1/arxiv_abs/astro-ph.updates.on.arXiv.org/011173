The aim of this work is to determine fundamental parameters of three Ap stars, GO And (HD 4778), $\kappa$
Psc (HD 220825), and 84 UMa (HD 120198), using spectroscopic techniques. By analysing these stars,
we complete the sample of Ap stars for which fundamental parameters have additionally been derived
by means of interferometry. This enables a cross-comparison of results derived by direct and indirect
methods. For all investigated stars, we determined fundamental parameters and derived chemical
abundances that are typical for Ap stars. The abundances are mainly characterised by a gradual increase
of heavy element atmospheric abundances from an order of magnitude for iron peak elements up to very
significant excesses of 3-4 dex of the rare-earth elements relative to the solar values. The only
exception is Ba, whose abundance is close to the solar abundance. There is also a significant He deficiency
in the atmospheres of HD 120198 and HD 220825, whereas the He abundance in HD 4778 is close to the solar
abundance. We do not find significant Fe and Cr stratification. Using these abundances, we constructed
self-consistent atmospheric models for each star. The effect of the surface chemical inhomogeneity
on the derived fundamental parameters did not exceed +/-100 K in effective temperature, which lies
within the range of errors in similar self-consistent analyses of Ap stars. Finally, we compared
spectroscopically derived effective temperatures, radii, and luminosity for 13 out of 14 Ap stars
in a benchmark sample with the interferometric results. While radii and luminosity agree within
the quoted errors of both determinations, the spectroscopic effective temperatures are higher
than the interferometric temperatures for stars with temperatures $T_{eff} >$ 9000 K. The observed
hydrogen line profiles favour the spectroscopically derived temperatures.

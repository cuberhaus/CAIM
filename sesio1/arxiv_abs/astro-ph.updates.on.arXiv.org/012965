The Beam Expander Testing X-ray facility (BEaTriX) is a unique X-ray apparatus now operated at the
Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica (INAF), Osservatorio Astronomico di Brera (OAB), in Merate,
Italy. It has been specifically designed to measure the point spread function (PSF) and the effective
area (EA) of the X-ray mirror modules (MMs) of the Advanced Telescope for High-ENergy Astrophysics
(ATHENA), based on silicon pore optics (SPO) technology, for verification before integration
into the mirror assembly. To this end, BEaTriX generates a broad, uniform, monochromatic, and collimated
X-ray beam at 4.51 keV. [...] In BEaTriX, a micro-focus X-ray source with a titanium anode is placed
in the focus of a paraboloidal mirror, which generates a parallel beam. A crystal monochromator
selects the 4.51 keV line, which is expanded to the final size by a crystal asymmetrically cut with
respect to the crystalline planes. [...] After characterization, the BEaTriX beam has the nominal
dimensions of 170 mm x 60 mm, with a vertical divergence of 1.65 arcsec and a horizontal divergence
varying between 2.7 and 3.45 arcsec, depending on the monochromator setting: either high collimation
or high intensity. The flux per area unit varies from 10 to 50 photons/s/cm2 from one configuration
to the other. The BEaTriX beam performance was tested using an SPO MM, whose entrance pupil was fully
illuminated by the expanded beam, and its focus was directly imaged onto the camera. The first light
test returned a PSF and an EA in full agreement with expectations. As of today, the 4.51 keV beamline
of BEaTriX is operational and can characterize modular X-ray optics, measuring their PSF and EA
with a typical exposure of 30 minutes. [...] We expect BEaTriX to be a crucial facility for the functional
test of modular X-ray optics, such as the SPO MMs for ATHENA.

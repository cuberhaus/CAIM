The SKA will be the largest radio astronomy observatory ever built, providing unprecedented sensitivity
over a very broad frequency (50 MHz to 15.3 GHz). The SKA-Low (50 - 350 MHz), will be built at the MRO
in Western Australia. It will consist of 512 stations each composed of 256 dual-polarised antennas,
and the sensitivity of an individual station is pivotal to the performance of the entire SKA-Low
telescope. The answer to the question in the title is, it depends. The sensitivity of a low frequency
array, such as an SKA-Low station, depends strongly on the pointing direction of the digitally formed
station beam and the local sidereal time (LST), and is different for the two orthogonal polarisations
of the antennas. The accurate prediction of the SKA-Low sensitivity in an arbitrary direction in
the sky is crucial for future observation planning. We present here a sensitivity calculator for
the SKA-Low radio telescope, using a database of pre-computed sensitivity values for two realisations
of an SKA-Low station architecture. One realisation uses the log-periodic antennas selected for
SKA-Low. The second uses a known benchmark, in the form of the bowtie dipoles of the MWA. Data collected
by both stations (deployed at the MRO in 2019) were used to measure their sensitivity at selected
frequencies and over at least 24 h intervals, and were compared to the predictions described in this
paper. The sensitivity values stored in the SQLite database were pre-computed for the X, Y and Stokes
I polarisations in 10 MHz frequency steps, 0.5 hour LST intervals, and 5 degree resolution in pointing
directions. The database allows users to estimate the sensitivity of SKA-Low for their favourite
object using interactive web-based or command line interface, which can also calculate the sensitivity
for arbitrary pointing directions, frequencies, and times without interpolations.

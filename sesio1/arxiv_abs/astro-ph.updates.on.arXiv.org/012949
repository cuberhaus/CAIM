Context: Stellar evolution models are highly dependent on accurate mass estimates, especially
for high-mass stars in the early stages of evolution. The most direct method for obtaining model-independent
masses is derivation from the orbit of close binaries. Aims: To derive the first astrometric+RV
orbit solution for the single-lined spectroscopic binary MWC 166 A, based on CHARA and VLTI near-infrared
interferometry over multiple epochs and ~100 archival radial velocity measurements, and to derive
fundamental stellar parameters from this orbit. We also sought to model circumstellar activity
in the system from K-band spectral lines. Methods: We geometrically modelled the dust continuum
to derive astrometry at 13 epochs and constrain individual stellar parameters. We used the continuum
models as a base to examine differential phases, visibilities and closure phases over the Br-$\gamma$
and He-I emission lines. Results: Our orbit solution suggests a period of $367.7\pm0.1$ d, twice
as long as found with previous RV orbit fits, subsequently constraining the component masses to
$M_1=12.2\pm2.2 M_\odot$ and $M_2=4.9\pm0.5 M_\odot$. The line-emitting gas was found to be localised
around the primary and is spatially resolved on scales of ~11 stellar radii, with the spatial displacement
between the line wings consistent with a rotating disc. Conclusions: The large radius and stable
orientation of the line emission are inconsistent with magnetospheric or boundary-layer accretion,
but indicate an ionised inner gas disk around MWC 166 Aa. We observe line variability that could be
explained either with generic line variability in a Herbig star disc or V/R variations in a decretion
disc. We also constrained the age of the system to ~$(7\pm2)\times10^5$ yr, consistent with the
system being comprised of a main-sequence primary and a secondary still contracting towards the
main sequence.

The Gaia-ESO Survey (GES) is a public, high-resolution spectroscopic survey with FLAMES@VLT.
GES targeted in particular a large sample of open clusters (OCs) of all ages. The different kinds
of OCs are useful to reach the main science goals, which are the study of the OC structure and dynamics,
the use of OCs to constrain and improve stellar evolution models, and the definition of Galactic
disc properties (e.g. metallicity distribution). GES is organised in 19 working groups (WGs).
We describe here the work of three of them, WG4 in charge of the selection of the targets within each
cluster), WG1 responsible for defining the most probable candidate members, and WG6 in charge of
the preparation of the observations. As GES has been conducted before Gaia DR2, we could not make
use of the Gaia astrometry to define cluster members. We made use of public and private photometry
to select the stars to be observed with FLAMES. Candidate target selection was based on ground-based
proper motions, radial velocities, and X-ray properties when appropriate, and it was mostly used
to define the position of the clusters' evolutionary sequences in the colour-magnitude diagrams.
Targets for GIRAFFE were selected near the sequences in an unbiased way. We used available information
on membership only for the few UVES stars. We collected spectra for 62 confirmed OCs (a few more were
taken from the ESO archive). Among them are very young clusters, where the main targets are pre-main
sequence stars, clusters with very hot and massive stars currently on the main sequence, intermediate-age
and old clusters where evolved stars are the main targets. The selection of targets was as inclusive
and unbiased as possible and we observed a representative fraction of all possible targets, thus
collecting the largest, most accurate, and most homogeneous spectroscopic data set on ever achieved.

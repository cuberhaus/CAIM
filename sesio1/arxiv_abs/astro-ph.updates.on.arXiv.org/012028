It is one of the biggest issues in black hole (BH) astrophysics how to precisely evaluate BH feedback
to its environments. Aiming at studying the unique gas dynamics of super-Eddington flow around
supermassive black hole (SMBH) seeds at high redshift, we carried out axisymmetric two dimensional
radiation hydrodynamic simulations by a nested simulation-box method. Here we divide the simulation
box into the inner zone at $(2 - 3 \times 10^3) r_{\rm{Sch}}$ (with $r_{\rm Sch}$ being the Schwarzschild
radius) and the outer zone at $(2\times 10^{3} - 3\times 10^6) r_{\rm{Sch}}$, with smooth connection
of the physical quantities, such as gas density, velocity, and radiation energy. We start the calculation
by injecting mass through the outer boundary of the inner zone at a constant rate of $\dot{M}_{\rm{inj}}=10^3L_{\rm{Edd}}/c^2$,
where $L_{\rm{Edd}}$ is the Eddington luminosity and $c$ is the speed of light. A powerful outflow
is generated in the innermost region and it propagates from the inner zone to the outer zone. The outflows
are characterized by a velocity of 0.02$c$ (0.7$c$) and density of $10^{-17}$ ($10^{-19}$) g cm$^{-3}$
for near the edge-on (face-on) direction. The outflow is gradually accelerated as it travels by
accepting radiation-pressure force. The final mass outflow rate at the outermost boundary is $\dot{M}_{\rm{out}}\sim
0.3 \times \dot{M}_{\rm{inj}}$. By extrapolating the outflow structure to a further larger scale,
we find that the momentum and energy fluxes at $r \sim 0.1$ pc are $\sim 10-100 L_{\rm{Edd}}/c $ and
$\sim 0.1-10 L_{\rm{Edd}}$, respectively. Moreover, we find that the impacts are highly anisotropic
in the sense that larger impacts are given towards the face-on direction than in the edge-on direction.
These results indicate that the BH feedback will more efficiently work on the interstellar medium
than that assumed in the cosmological simulations.

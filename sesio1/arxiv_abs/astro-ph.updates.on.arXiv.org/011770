We present a comparative study of X-ray and IR AGNs at $z\approx2$ to highlight the important AGN
selection effects on the distributions of host galaxy properties. Compared with non-AGN star-forming
galaxies (SFGs) on the main sequence, X-ray AGNs have similar median star formation (SF) properties,
but their incidence (q$_{\rm{AGN}}$) is higher among galaxies with either enhanced or suppressed
SF, and among galaxies with larger stellar mass surface density, regardless if it is measured within
half-light radius ($\Sigma_e$) or central 1kpc ($\Sigma_{\rm{1kpc}}$). Unlike X-ray AGNs, IR
AGNs are less massive, and have enhanced SF and similar distributions of colors, $\Sigma_e$ and
$\Sigma_{\rm{1kpc}}$ relative to non-AGN SFGs. Given that $\Sigma_e$ and $\Sigma_{\rm{1kpc}}$
strongly correlate with M$_*$, we introduce the fractional mass within central 1kpc ($\rm{\frac{M_{1kpc}}{M_*}}$),
which only weakly depends on M$_*$, to quantify galaxy compactness. Both AGN populations have similar
$\rm{\frac{M_{1kpc}}{M_*}}$ distributions compared to non-AGN SFGs'. While q$_{\rm{AGN}}$
increases with $\Sigma_e$ and $\Sigma_{\rm{1kpc}}$, it remains constant with $\rm{\frac{M_{1kpc}}{M_*}}$,
indicating that the trend of increasing q$_{\rm{AGN}}$ with $\rm{\Sigma}$ is driven by M$_*$ more
than morphology. While our findings are not in conflict with the scenario of AGN quenching, they
do not imply it either, because the incidence of AGNs hosted in transitional galaxies depends crucially
on AGN selections. Additionally, despite the relatively large uncertainty of AGN bolometric luminosities,
their very weak correlation, if any, with SF activities, regardless of AGN selections, also argues
against a direct causal link between the presences of AGNs and the quenching of massive galaxies
at $z\sim2$.

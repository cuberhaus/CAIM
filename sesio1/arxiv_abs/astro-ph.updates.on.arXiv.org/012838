The third release of the Gaia catalogue contains the radial velocities for 33,812,183 stars having
effective temperatures ranging from 3100 K to 14,500 K. The measurements are based on the comparison
of the observed RVS spectrum (wavelength coverage: 846--870 nm, median resolving power: 11,500)
to synthetic data broadened to the adequate Along-Scan Line Spread Function. The additional line-broadening,
fitted as it would only be due to axial rotation, is also produced by the pipeline and is available
in the catalogue (field name gaia_source:vbroad). To describe the properties of the line-broadening
information extracted from the RVS and published in the catalogue, as well as to analyse the limitations
imposed by the adopted method, wavelength range, and instrument. We use simulations to express
the link existing between the line broadening measurement provided in Gaia Data Release 3 and Vsin(i).
We then compare the observed values to the measurements published by various catalogues and surveys
(GALAH, APOGEE, LAMOST, ...). While we recommend being cautious in the interpretation of the vbroad
measurement, we also find a reasonable global agreement between the Gaia Data Release 3 line broadening
values and those found in the other catalogues. We discuss and establish the validity domain of the
published vbroad values. The estimate tends to be overestimated at the lower vsini end, and at $T_\mathrm{eff}>7500\,\mathrm{K}$
its quality and significance degrade rapidly when $G_\mathrm{RVS}>10$. Despite all the known
and reported limitations, the Gaia Data Release 3 line broadening catalogue contains the measurements
obtained for 3,524,677 stars with $T_\mathrm{eff}$\ ranging from 3500 to 14,500 K, and $G_\mathrm{RVS}<12$.
It gathers the largest stellar sample ever considered for the purpose, and allows a first mapping
of the \Gaia\ line broadening parameter across the HR diagram.

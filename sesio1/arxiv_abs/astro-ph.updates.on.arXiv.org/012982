We assemble a large sample of 13,863 high-velocity stars (HiVels) with total velocity ${V}_{\rm{GSR}}
\ge {\rm300} \rm{km\,s^{-1}}$, selected from the RAVE DR5, SDSS DR12, LAMOST DR8, APOGEE DR16,
GALAH DR2, and $Gaia$ EDR3. In this HiVel sample, 43 sources are hypervelocity stars (HVSs) that
have ${V}_{\rm{GSR}}$ exceeding their local escape velocities, $V_{\rm esc}$, 32 of which are
discovered for the first time. Interestingly, all the HVSs are metal-poor and late-type, significantly
different from the previous HVSs in the literature, which are largely massive, metal-rich early-type
stars, identified originally by extreme radial velocity alone. This finding suggests that our
newly found HVSs are ejected by different mechanisms from the previous population. To investigate
their origins, for the 571 extreme HiVel stars with ${V}_{\rm{GSR}}\ge0.8V_{\rm{esc}}$ in our
sample, we reconstruct their backward-integrated trajectories in the Galactic potential. According
to the orbital analysis, no HVSs are found to be definitely ejected from the Galactic center (GC),
while 8 late-type metal-poor HiVels are found to have a closest distance to the GC within 1 kpc. Intriguingly,
15 HiVels (including 2 HVSs) are found from their backward-integrated trajectories to have experienced
a close encounter with the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (Sgr dSph), suggesting that they
originated from this dSph. This hypothesis is supported by an analysis of the [$\alpha$/Fe]--[Fe/H]
diagram. From a preliminary analysis of all the HiVels in our sample, we propose a general picture:
Star ejection from Galactic subsystems such as dwarf galaxies and globular clusters, either via
tidal stripping or even the Hills mechanism, can be an important channel to produce HiVels/HVSs,
particularly the metal-poor late-type halo population.

The quadruple lensed system WGD2038-4008 was recently discovered with the help of new techniques
and observations. Even though black hole mass has been estimated for lensed quasars, it has been
calculated mostly for one broad emission line of one image, but the images could be affected by microlensing,
affecting the results. We present black hole mass (MBH) estimations for images A and B using the three
most prominent broad emission lines (H$\alpha$, H$\beta$ and MgII) obtained in one single-epoch
spectra. This is the first time the mass is estimated in a lensed quasar in two images, allowing us
to disentangle the effects of microlensing. We used the X-shooter instrument mounted in VLT, to
observe this system taking advantage of its wide spectral range. Using the flux ratio between the
continuum and the core of the emission lines we analyzed if microlensing was present in the continuum
source. We obtained MBH using the single-epoch method with the H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ emission
lines from the monochromatic luminosity and the velocity width. The luminosity at 3000 \r{A} was
obtained using the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of image A while the luminosity at 5100 \r{A}
was estimated directly from the spectra. The average MBH between the images obtained was $\rm log_{10}$(M$_{BH}/M_{\odot}$)
= 8.27 $\pm$ 1.05, 8.25 $\pm$ 0.32 and 8.59 $\pm$ 0.35 for MgII, H$\beta$ and H$\alpha$ respectively.
We find Eddington ratios similar to those measured in the literature for unlensed low-luminosity
quasars. Microlensing of -0.16 $\pm$ 0.06 mag. in the continuum was found but the induced error in
the MBH is minor compared to the one associated to the macromodel magnification. We also obtained
the accretion disk size using the MBH for the three emission lines, obtaining an average value of
$\rm log_{10}(r_{s}/cm)$ = 15.3 +/- 0.63, which is in agreement with theoretical estimates.

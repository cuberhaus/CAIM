We present spectroscopic and high-precision photometric observations, spanning the optical
UV to the far red, before, during, and after the NASA Deep Impact event of July 4, 2005. The inner 2000
km of the pre and post-impact coma was about 0.3 magnitude redder in B-R than in the outer coma. The
pre-impact spectrum was a faint reflected solar spectrum dominated by molecular emissions extending
> 40000 km from the nucleus. The post-impact light curve in R and I showed a rapid rise consistent with
an expanding optically thick cloud during the first 18 minutes after impact. During the next 8 minutes
the cloud became optically thin. Sixty minutes after impact the impact R-band flux reached a plateau
at 7.5 x 10-15 erg cm-2 s-1 {\AA}-1, the comet brightening by a factor of ~4.3 above its pre-impact
value observed in a 15" aperture. The mean expansion velocity of the grains during the first 49 minutes
was 229 {\pm} 49 m s-1. The spectrum became dominated by scattered sunlight during the first hour
after impact. The volume scattering function (VSF) observed 32 minutes after impact shows strong
reddening. At 49 minutes, however, the VSF shows an additional two-fold increase in the blue but
only a 20 per-cent increase at 5500{\AA}. Post-impact spectra and R-I photometry showed rapid reddening.
The particle size distribution, dominated by 1 to 2.5 micron particles shortly after impact, changed
dramatically during the first hour due to sublimation of water-ice particles of this size. On the
night following impact the comet was still substantially brighter than before impact, but R-I had
returned to its pre-impact value. B-R remained significantly redder. The ejecta 25 hours after
impact was fan-shaped subtending ~180{\deg} roughly symmetrical about position angle 225{\deg}.
The mean expansion velocity 90{\deg} from the direction to the Sun was 185{\deg} 12 m s-1.

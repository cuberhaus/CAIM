Active galactic nuclei play a key role in the evolution of galaxies, but their inner workings and
physical connection to the host are poorly understood due to a lack of angular resolution. Infrared
interferometry makes it possible to resolve the circumnuclear dust in the nearby Seyfert 2 galaxy,
Circinus. Previous observations have revealed complex structures and polar dust emission but
interpretation was limited to simple models. MATISSE makes it possible to image these structures
for the first time. We observed the Circinus Galaxy with VLTI/MATISSE, producing 150 correlated
flux spectra and 100 closure phase spectra. We reconstructed images in the N-band at ~10 mas resolution.
We fit blackbody functions with dust extinction to several aperture-extracted fluxes from the
images to produce a temperature distribution of central dusty structures. We find significant
substructure in the circumnuclear dust: central unresolved flux of ~0.5 Jy, a thin disk 1.9 pc in
diameter oriented along ~45 deg,and a ~4x1.5 pc polar emission extending orthogonal to the disk.
The polar emission exhibits patchiness, which we attribute to clumpy dust. Flux enhancements to
the east and west of the disk are seen for the first time. We distinguish the temperature profiles
of the disk and of the polar emission: the disk shows a steep temperature gradient indicative of denser
material; the polar profile is flatter, indicating clumpiness and/or lower dust density. The unresolved
flux is fitted with a high temperature, ~370 K. The polar dust remains warm (~200 K) out to 1.5 pc from
the disk. The recovered morphology and temperature distribution resembles modeling of accretion
disks with radiation-driven winds at large scales, but we placed new constraints on the subparsec
dust. The subparsec features imaged here place new constraints on the physical modeling of circumnuclear
dust in active galaxies.

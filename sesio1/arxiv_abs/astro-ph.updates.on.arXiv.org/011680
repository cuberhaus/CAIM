Aims. The goal of this study is to investigate the small-scale magnetic fields of the two spectroscopic
binary T Tauri stars V1878 Ori and V4046 Sgr. This is done to complete the observational characterisation
of the surface magnetic fields of these stars because only their large-scale magnetic fields have
been studied with Zeeman Doppler imaging (ZDI) so far. Methods. To investigate the small-scale
magnetic fields, the differential Zeeman intensification of near-infrared Ti I lines was investigated
using high-resolution archival spectra obtained with the ESPaDOnS spectrograph at the CFHT. In
order to study the binary components separately, the spectra were disentangled by considering
observations taken at different orbital phases. The Zeeman-intensification analysis was performed
based on detailed polarised radiative transfer calculations aided by the Markov chain Monte Carlo
inference, treating magnetic field filling factors and other stellar parameters that could affect
the spectra as free parameters. Results. The obtained average magnetic field strengths of the components
of V1878 Ori are 1.33 and 1.57 kG, respectively. Previous ZDI studies of V1878 Ori recovered about
14 and 20% of this magnetic field strength. For V4046 Sgr, the magnetic field strengths are 1.96 and
1.83 kG, respectively. In this case, about 12 and 9% of the total magnetic field strength was detected
by ZDI. Conclusions. The small-scale magnetic field strengths obtained from Zeeman intensification
are similar for the two components of each binary. This is in contrast to the large-scale magnetic
fields obtained from ZDI investigations, performed using the same observations. While the large-scale
field might look significantly different. This indicates that the efficiency of the magnetic dynamo
is comparable for the components of the two binaries, because most energy is carreid by the small
scale fields.

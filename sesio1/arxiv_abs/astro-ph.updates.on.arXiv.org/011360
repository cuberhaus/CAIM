The lenticular galaxy NGC474 hosts a rich system of tidal shells and streams, some of which are exceptionally
bright. Two teams recently presented spectroscopic observations of the brightest shells. These
were the first shell spectra ever observed in integrated starlight. The authors studied the stellar
populations of the shell, of the center of the galaxy and of its globular clusters. The precise formation
scenario for the tidal features of this prominent galaxy however still remained unclear. Here,
we add further clues on their formation from the radii of the shells, and we present a scenario for
the formation of the tidal features that seems to be unique and explaining all available data. Shell
radii are analyzed with the shell identification method, and we run self-consistent simulations
of the formation of the tidal features. We consider Newtonian as well as MOND gravity. Observations
suggest that the tidal features originate from the accretion of a spiral galaxy. The shell identification
method yields that the merging galaxies collided first 1.3Gyr ago and then again 0.9Gyr ago, thereby
forming the shells in two generations. This would also explain the young ages of stellar populations
in the center of the galaxy and the young age of the globular clusters. The analytic models of shell
propagation, that underlie the shell identification method, are verified by a simulation. The
simulations reproduce well the observed morphology of the tidal features. The accreted spiral
likely reached NGC474 nearly radially, in the plane of the sky, from the south, its rotation axis
pointing toward us. It should have had a stellar mass of around 1/6 of NGC474, i.e. $10^{9.8}\,M_\odot$.
It seems that all tidal features in the galaxy originate from one merger.

Machine Learning (ML) is the branch of computer science that studies computer algorithms that can
learn from data. It is mainly divided into supervised learning, where the computer is presented
with examples of entries, and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs, and unsupervised
learning, where no label is provided to the learning algorithm, leaving it alone to find structures.
Deep learning is a branch of machine learning based on many layers of artificial neural networks,
which are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal
brains. In asteroid dynamics, machine learning methods have been recently used to identify members
of asteroid families, and to identify resonant arguments images of asteroids in three-body resonances,
among other applications. Here, we will conduct a review of available literature in the field, and
classify it in terms of metrics recently used by other authors to assess the state of the art of applications
of machine learning in other astronomical subfields. For comparison, applications of machine
learning to Solar System bodies, a larger area that includes imaging and spectrophotometry of small
bodies, have already reached a state classified as progressing. Research communities and methodologies
are more established, and the use of ML led to the discovery of new celestial objects or features.
ML applied to asteroid dynamics, however, is still in the emerging phase, with smaller groups, and
fewer papers producing discoveries. Large observational surveys, like those conducted at the
Vera C. Rubin Observatory, will produce very substantial datasets of orbital and physical properties
for asteroids. Applications of ML for clustering, image identification, and anomaly detection,
among others, are currently being developed and are expected of being of great help.

Accurate determinations of stellar parameters and distances for large complete samples of stars
are keys for conducting detailed studies of the formation and evolution of our Galaxy. Here we present
stellar atmospheric parameters ($T_{\rm eff}$, luminosity classifications, and [Fe/H]) estimates
for some 24 million stars determined from the stellar colors of SMSS DR2 and Gaia EDR3, based on training
datasets with available spectroscopic measurements from previous high/medium/low-resolution
spectroscopic surveys. The number of stars with photometric-metallicity estimates is 4-5 times
larger than that collected by the current largest spectroscopic survey to date - LAMOST - over the
course of the past decade. External checks indicate that the precision of the photometric-metallicity
estimates are quite high, comparable to or slightly better than that derived from spectroscopy,
with typical values around 0.05-0.15dex for both dwarf and giant stars with [Fe/H]>$-$1.0, 0.10-0.20dex
for giant stars with $-$2.0<[Fe/H]<$-$1.0. and 0.20-0.25dex for giant stars with [Fe/H]<$-$2.0,
and include estimates for stars as metal-poor as [Fe/H]~$-$3.5, substantially lower than previous
photometric techniques. Photometric-metallicity estimates are obtained for an unprecedented
number of metal-poor stars, including a total of over three million metal-poor (MP; [Fe/H] <$-$1.0)
stars, over half a million very metal-poor (VMP; [Fe/H]<$-$2.0) stars, and over 25,000 extremely
metal-poor (EMP; [Fe/H]<$-$3.0) stars. Moreover, distances are determined for over 20 million
stars in our sample. For the over 18 million sample stars with accurate Gaia parallaxes, stellar
ages are estimated by comparing with theoretical isochrones. Astrometric information is provided
for the stars in our catalog, along with radial velocities for ~10% of our sample stars, taken from
completed/ongoing large-scale spectroscopic surveys.

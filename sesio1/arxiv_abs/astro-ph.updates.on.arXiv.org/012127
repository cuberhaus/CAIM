We measure the colour evolution and quenching time-scales of $z=1.0-1.8$ galaxies across the green
valley. We derive rest-frame $NUVrK$ colours and select blue-cloud, green-valley and red-sequence
galaxies from the spectral energy distribution modelling of CANDELS GOODS-South and UDS multi-band
photometry. Separately, we constrain the star-formation history (SFH) parameters (ages, $\tau$)
of these galaxies by fitting their deep archival HST grism spectroscopy. We derive the galaxy colour-age
relation and show that only rapidly evolving galaxies with characteristic delayed-$\tau$ SFH
time-scales of $<0.5$ Gyr reach the red sequence at these redshifts, after a period of accelerated
colour evolution across the green valley. These results indicate that the stellar mass build-up
of these galaxies stays minimal after leaving the blue cloud and entering the green valley (i.e.,
it may represent $\lesssim 5\%$ of the galaxies' final, quiescent masses). Visual inspection of
age-sensitive features in the stacked spectra also supports the view that these galaxies follow
a quenching sequence along the blue-cloud $\rightarrow$ green-valley $\rightarrow$ red-sequence
track. For this rapidly evolving population, we measure a green-valley crossing time-scale of
$0.99^{+0.42}_{-0.25}$ Gyr and a crossing rate at the bottom of the green valley of $0.82^{+0.27}_{-0.25}$
mag/Gyr. Based on these time-scales, we estimate that the number density of massive ($M_\star>10^{10}
M_\odot$) red-sequence galaxies doubles every Gyr at these redshifts, in remarkable agreement
with the evolution of the quiescent galaxy stellar mass function. These results offer a new approach
to measuring galaxy quenching over time and represent a pathfinder study for future JWST, Euclid,
and Roman Space Telescope programs.

Short rise times of Fast Blue Optical Transients (FBOTs) require very light ejected envelopes,
$M_{ej} \leq 10^{-1} M_\odot$, much smaller than of a typical supernova. Short peak times also mean
that FBOTs should be hydrodynamically, not radioactively powered. The detection by Chandra of
X-ray emission in AT2020mrf of $L_X \sim 10^{42} $ erg s$^{-1}$ after 328 days implies total, overall
dominant, X-ray energetics at the Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) level of $\sim 6 \times 10^{49}$ erg. We
further develop a model of Lyutikov & Toonen (2019), whereby FBOTs are the results of a late accretion
induced collapse (AIC) of the product of super-Chandrasekhar double white dwarf (WD) merger between
ONeMg WD and another WD. Small ejecta mass, and the rarity of FBOTs, result from the competition between
mass loss from the merger product to the wind, and ashes added to the core, on time scale of $\sim 10^3-10^4$
years. FBOTs occur only when the envelope mass before AIC is $\leq 10^{-1} M_\odot$. FBOTs proper
come from central engine-powered radiation-dominated forward shock as it propagates through
ejecta. FBOTs' duration is determined by the diffusion time of photons produced by the NS-driven
forward shock within the expanding ejecta. All the photons produced by the central source deep inside
the ejecta escape almost simultaneously, producing a short bright event. The high energy emission
is generated at the highly relativistic and highly magnetized termination shock, qualitatively
similar to Pulsar Wind Nebulae. The X-ray bump observed in AT2020mrf by SRG/eROSITA, predicted
by Lyutikov & Toonen (2019), is coming from the break-out of the engine-powered shock from the ejecta
into the preceding wind. The model requires total energetics of just few $\times 10^{50}$ ergs,
slightly above the observed X-rays. We predict that the system is hydrogen poor.

We present a basic, fast, and flexible planet formation model, called SimAb (Simulating Abundances),
to form giant planets and study their primary atmospheric composition soon after their formation.
In SimAb we introduce parameters to simplify the assumptions about the complex physics involved
in the formation of a planet. This approach allows us to trace and understand the influence of complex
physical processes on the formed planets. We focus on the C/O ratio and the metallicity of the planetary
atmosphere as an indicator of their compositions. We show that the initial protoplanet core mass
does not influence the final composition of the planetary atmosphere in the context of our model.
The initial orbital distance affects the C/O ratio due to the different C/O ratios in the gas phase
and the solid phase at different orbital distances. Additionally, the initial orbital distance
together with the amount of accreted planetesimals cause the planet to have sub-solar or super-solar
metallicity. Furthermore, the C/O ratio is affected by the dust grain fraction and the planetesimal
fraction. Planets that accrete most of their heavy elements through dust grains will have a C/O ratio
close to the solar C/O ratio, while planets that accrete most of their heavy elements from the planetesimals
in the disk will end up with a C/O ratio closer to the C/O ratio in the solid phase of the disk. By using
the C/O ratio and metallicity together we can put a lower and upper boundary on the initial orbital
distance where super-solar metallicity planets are formed. We show that planetesimals are the
main source for reaching super-solar metallicity planets. On the other hand, planets that mainly
accrete dust grains will show a more solar composition. Super-solar metallicity planets that initiate
their formation farther than the CO ice line have a C/O ratio closer to the solar value.

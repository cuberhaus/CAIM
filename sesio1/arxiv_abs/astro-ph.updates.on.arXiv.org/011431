Apertif (APERture Tile In Focus) is one of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) pathfinder facilities.
The Apertif project is an upgrade to the 50-year-old Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT)
using phased-array feed technology. The new receivers create 40 individual beams on the sky, achieving
an instantaneous sky coverage of 6.5 square degrees. The primary goal of the Apertif Imaging Survey
is to perform a wide survey of 3500 square degrees (AWES) and a medium deep survey of 350 square degrees
(AMES) of neutral atomic hydrogen (up to a redshift of 0.26), radio continuum emission and polarisation.
Each survey pointing yields 4.6 TB of correlated data. The goal of Apercal is to process this data
and fully automatically generate science ready data products for the astronomical community while
keeping up with the survey observations. We make use of common astronomical software packages in
combination with Python based routines and parallelisation. We use an object oriented module-based
approach to ensure easy adaptation of the pipeline. A Jupyter notebook based framework allows user
interaction and execution of individual modules as well as a full automatic processing of a complete
survey observation. If nothing interrupts processing, we are able to reduce a single pointing survey
observation on our five node cluster with 24 physical cores and 256 GB of memory each within 24h keeping
up with the speed of the surveys. The quality of the generated images is sufficient for scientific
usage for 44 % of the recorded data products with single images reaching dynamic ranges of several
thousands. Future improvements will increase this percentage to over 80 %. Our design allowed development
of the pipeline in parallel to the commissioning of the Apertif system.

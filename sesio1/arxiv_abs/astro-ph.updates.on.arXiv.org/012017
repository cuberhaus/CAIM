Some remarkable examples of alternative cosmological theories are reviewed here, ranging from
a compilation of variations on the Standard Model through the more distant quasi-steady-state
cosmology, plasma cosmology, or universe models as a hypersphere, to the most exotic cases including
static models. The present-day standard model of cosmology, Lambda-CDM, gives us a representation
of a cosmos whose dynamics is dominated by gravity with a finite lifetime, large scale homogeneity,
expansion and a hot initial state, together with other dark elements necessary to avoid certain
inconsistencies with observations. There are however some models with characteristics that are
close to those of the standard model but differing in some minor aspects: different considerations
on CP violation, inflation, number of neutrino species, quark-hadron phase transition, baryonic
or non-baryonic dark-matter, dark energy, nucleosynthesis scenarios, large-scale structure
formation scenarios; or major variations like a inhomogeneous universe, Cold Big Bang, varying
physical constants or gravity law, zero-active mass (also called `R_h=ct'), Milne, and cyclical
models. At the most extreme distance from the standard model, the static models, a non-cosmological
redshift includes `tired-light' hypotheses, which assume that the photon loses energy owing to
an intrinsic property or an interaction with matter or light as it travels some distance, or other
non-standard ideas. Our impression is that none of the alternative models has acquired the same
level of development as Lambda-CDM in offering explanations of available cosmological observations.
One should not, however, judge any theory in terms of the number of observations that it can successfully
explain (ad hoc in many cases) given the much lower level of development of the alternative ones.

We present the forward cosmological analysis of an $XMM$ selected sample of galaxy clusters out
to a redshift of unity. Following our previous 2018 study based on the dn/dz quantity alone, we perform
an upgraded cosmological analysis of the same XXL C1 cluster catalogue (178 objects), with a detailed
account of the systematic errors. We follow the ASpiX methodology: the distribution of the observed
X-ray properties of the cluster population is analysed in a 3D observable space (count rate, hardness
ratio, redshift) and modelled as a function of cosmology. Compared to more traditional methods,
ASpiX allows the inclusion of clusters down to a few tens of photons. We obtain an improvement by a
factor of 2 compared to the previous analysis by letting the normalisation of the M-T relation and
the evolution of the L-T relation free. Adding constraints from the XXL cluster 2-point correlation
function and the BAO from various surveys decreases the uncertainties by 23 and 53 % respectively,
and 62% when adding both. Switching to the scaling relations from the Subaru analysis, and letting
free more parameters, our final constraints are $\sigma_8$ = $0.99^{+0.14}_{-0.23}$, $\Omega_m$
= 0.296 $\pm$ 0.034 ($S_8 = 0.98^{+0.11}_{-0.21}$) for the XXL sample alone. Finally, we combine
XXL ASpiX, the XXL cluster 2-point correlation function and the BAO, with 11 free parameters, allowing
for the cosmological dependence of the scaling relations in the fit. We find $\sigma_8$ = $0.793^{+0.063}_{-0.12}$,
$\Omega_m$ = 0.364 $\pm$ 0.015 ($S_8 = 0.872^{+0.068}_{-0.12}$), but still compatible with Planck
CMB at 2.2$\sigma$. The results obtained by the ASpiX method are promising; further improvement
is expected from the final XXL cosmological analysis involving a cluster sample twice as large.
Such a study paves the way for the analysis of the eROSITA and future Athena surveys.

WASP-12b stands out among the planets of its class of hot Jupiters because of the observed fast orbital
decay attributed to tidal dissipation. The measured rate of the orbital period is $\stackrel{\bf\centerdot}{\textstyle{P}}_{\rm
orb}\,=\,-\,29\pm3\;\mbox{ms/yr}\;$=$\;(9.2\pm1.0)\times10^{-10}\;\mbox{s/s}$. In the
literature heretofore, all attempts to explain this high rate were based on the assumption that
the orbital evolution is dominated by the tides in the star. Since the modified tidal quality factor
in yellow dwarfs is insufficient to warrant such a decay rate, a hypothesis was put forward that the
star may actually be a subgiant. Using the latest data from the Gaia mission, we deduce that WASP-12a
at $1.36\,{M_{Sun}}$ is an evolving dwarf at an early stage of post-turn-off evolution that has
not yet depleted hydrogen in its core. Its unremarkable position in the color-magnitude diagram
and the existence of close planets orbiting red giants of similar mass contradict the hypothesis
of an abrupt boost of tidal quality due to structural internal changes. The previous research neglected
the tidal dissipation in the planet assuming it to be negligible due to the likely synchronisation
of its rotation and a presumed high quality factor. We critically reassess this assumption in the
light of recent astrometric results for Jupiter and Saturn, also employing more advanced theories
of frequency-dependent tidal dissipation. Assuming that WASP-12b, like our Jupiter and Saturn,
has a solid core, we find that the observed orbital decay is well explained by the tides in the planet.
We calculate the exact value of the modified quality factor from the observed orbital decay and the
upper bound eccentricity, which happens to coincide almost precisely with that of our Jupiter.

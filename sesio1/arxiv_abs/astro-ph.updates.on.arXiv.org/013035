12CO and 13CO lines, as well as a mm-wave continuum, have been observed for a sample of 22 OH/IR stars
in directions within 2 degrees of the Galactic Centre. Photometry data have been gathered from the
literature to construct SEDs and to determine pulsational variability. Radiative transfer models
have been used to interpret the data. All stars in the sample were detected in at least one CO line,
and 8 objects were detected in 324 GHz continuum. Based on luminosity criteria, the sample is divided
into 17 objects that most likely lie within the inner Galactic Bulge, and 5 objects that are most likely
foreground objects. The median luminosity of the inner-Galactic-Bulge objects, 5600 Lsun, corresponds
to an initial mass in the range 1.2-1.6 Msun, indicating that these OH/IR stars descend from solar-type
stars. The objects in this sub-sample are further divided into two classes based on their SED characteristics:
11 objects have SEDs that are well matched by models invoking dust envelopes extending from a few
stellar radii and outwards, while 6 objects are better modelled as having detached dust envelopes
with inner radii in the range 200-600 au and warmer central stars. The former objects have periodic
variability, while the latter objects are predominantly non-periodic. The median gas-mass-loss
rate, gas terminal expansion velocity, gas-to-dust mass ratio, and circumstellar 12CO/13CO abundance
ratio have been estimated to be 2x10{-5} Msun/yr, 18 km/s, 200 (excluding the sources with detached
dust envelopes, which show markedly lower gas-to-dust ratios), and 5, respectively, for the inner-Galactic-Bulge
objects. The inner-Galactic-Bulge OH/IR stars studied here constitute an excellent sample of
equidistant objects for the purpose of understanding the evolution of the mass-loss-rate characteristics
at the tip of the AGB.

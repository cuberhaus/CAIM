Images of the extended solar corona, as observed by white-light coronagraphs as observed by different
white-light coronagraphs include the K- and F-corona and suffer from a radial variation in intensity.
These images require separation of the two coronal components with some additional image-processing
to reduce the intensity gradient and analyse the structures and processes occurring at different
heights in the solar corona within the full field of view. To process these bulk coronagraph images
with steep radial-intensity gradients, we have developed an algorithm: Simple Radial Gradient
Filter (SiRGraF). This algorithm is based on subtracting a minimum background (F-corona) created
using long-duration images and then dividing the resultant by a uniform intensity gradient image
to enhance the K-corona. We demonstrate the utility of this algorithm to bring out the short time-scale
transient structures of the corona. SiRGraF could be used to reveal and analyse such structures.
It is not suitable for quantitative estimations based on intensity. We have successfully tested
the algorithm on images of the LASCO-C2 onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO),
and COR-2A onboard the STEREO with good signal to noise ratio (SNR) along with low-SNR images of STEREO/COR-1A
and the KCoronagraph. We also compared the performance of SiRGraF with Normalising Radial Gradient
Filter (NRGF). We found that when hundreds of images have to be processed, SiRGraF works faster than
NRGF, providing similar brightness and contrast in the images and separating the transient features.
Moreover, SiRGraF works better on low-SNR images of COR-1A than NRGF, providing better identification
of dynamic coronal structures throughout the field of view. We discuss the advantages and limitations
of the algorithm.

Analysis of interstellar absorption lines observed in high-resolution {\em HST} spectra of nearby
stars provides temperatures, turbulent velocities, and kinetic properties of warm interstellar
clouds. Previous studies identified 15 warm partially ionized clouds within about 10~pc of the
Sun and measured their mean thermal and kinematic properties. A new analysis of 100 interstellar
velocity components reveals a wide range of temperatures and turbulent velocities within the Local
Interstellar Cloud (LIC) and other nearby clouds. These variations appear to be random with Gaussian
distributions. We find no trends of these properties with stellar distance, angle from the Galactic
Center, the main source of EUV radiation (the star $\epsilon$~CMa), the center of the LIC, or the
direction of inflowing interstellar matter into the heliosphere. The spatial scale for temperature
variations in the LIC is likely smaller than 5,100~au, a distance that the Sun will traverse in 1,000
years. Essentially all velocity components align with known warm clouds. We find that within 4~pc
of the Sun, space is completely filled with partially ionized clouds, but at larger distances space
is only partially filled with partially ionized clouds, indicating that fully ionized inter-cloud
gas fills the voids. We find that the neutral hydrogen number density in the LIC and likely other warm
clouds in the CLIC is about 0.10~cm$^{-3}$ rather than the 0.20~cm$^{-3}$ density that may be representative
of only the immediate environment of the LIC. The 3,000--12,000~K temperature range for the gas
is consistent with the predictions of theoretical models of the WNM and WIM, but the high degree of
inhomogeneity within clouds argues against simple theoretical models. Finally, we find evidence
for a shock in the sight line to the star AD~Leo.

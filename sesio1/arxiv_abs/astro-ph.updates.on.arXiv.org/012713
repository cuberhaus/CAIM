Deviations from the blackbody spectral energy distribution of the CMB are a precise probe of physical
processes active both in the early universe (such as those connected to particle decays and inflation)
and at later times (e.g. reionization and astrophysical emissions). Limited progress has been
made in the characterization of these spectral distortions after the pioneering measurements
of the FIRAS instrument on the COBE satellite in the early 1990s, which mainly targeted the measurement
of their average amplitude across the sky. Since at present no follow-up mission is scheduled to
update the FIRAS measurement, in this work we re-analyze the FIRAS data and produce a map of $\mu$-type
spectral distortion across the sky. We provide an updated constraint on the $\mu$ distortion monopole
$|\langle\mu\rangle|<47\times 10^{-6}$ at 95\% confidence level that sharpens the previous
FIRAS estimate by a factor of $\sim 2$. We also constrain primordial non-Gaussianities of curvature
perturbations on scales $10\lesssim k\lesssim 5\times 10^4$ through the cross-correlation of
$\mu$ distortion anisotropies with CMB temperature and, for the first time, the full set of polarization
anisotropies from the Planck satellite. We obtain upper limits on $f_{\rm NL}\lesssim 3.6 \times
10^6$ and on its running $n_{\rm NL}\lesssim 1.4$ that are limited by the FIRAS sensitivity but robust
against galactic and extragalactic foreground contaminations. We revisit previous similar analyses
based on data of the Planck satellite and show that, despite their significantly lower noise, they
yield similar or worse results to ours once all the instrumental and astrophysical uncertainties
are properly accounted for. Our work is the first to self-consistently analyze data from a spectrometer
and demonstrate the power of such instrument to carry out this kind of science case with reduced systematic
uncertainties.

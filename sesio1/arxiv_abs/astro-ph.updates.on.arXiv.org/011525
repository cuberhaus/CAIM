The Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption spectrum associated with photons traversing the intergalactic
medium allows us to probe the linear matter power spectrum down to relatively small distance scales.
Finding ways of accurately evaluating Lyman-$\alpha$ constraints across large classes of candidate
models of dark-matter physics is thus of paramount importance. While such constraints have been
evaluated for dark-matter models with relatively simple dark-matter velocity distributions,
more complex models -- particularly those with dark-matter velocity distributions stretching
across multiple scales -- are receiving increasing attention. In this paper, we undertake a study
of the Lyman-$\alpha$ constraints associated with general dark-matter velocity distributions.
Although these constraints are difficult to evaluate in principle, in practice there exist two
ways of recasting them into forms which are easier to evaluate and which therefore allow a more rapid
determination of whether a given dark-matter model is ruled in or out. We utilize both of these recasts
in order to determine the Lyman-$\alpha$ bounds on different classes of dark-matter velocity distributions.
We also develop a general method by which the results of these different recasts can be compared.
For relatively simple dark-matter velocity distributions, we find that these two classes of recasts
tend to align and give similar results. However, the situation is far more complex for distributions
involving multiple velocity scales: while these two recasts continue to yield similar results
within certain regions of parameter space, they nevertheless yield dramatically different results
within precisely those regions of parameter space which are likely to be phenomenologically relevant.
This, then, serves as a cautionary tale regarding the use of such recasts for complex dark-matter
velocity distributions.

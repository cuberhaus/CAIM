Aims: Contamination from bright diffuse Galactic thermal and non-thermal radio emission poses
crucial challenges in experiments aiming to measure the 21-cm signal of neutral hydrogen from the
Cosmic Dawn (CD) and Epoch of Reionization (EoR). If not included in calibration, this diffuse emission
can severely impact the analysis and signal extraction in 21-cm experiments. We examine large-scale
diffuse Galactic emission at 122 MHz, around the North Celestial Pole, using the AARTFAAC-HBA system.
Methods: In this pilot project, we present the first-ever wide-field image produced with a single
sub-band of the data recorded with AARTFAAC-HBA. We demonstrate two methods: multiscale CLEAN
and shapelet decomposition, to model the diffuse emission revealed in the image. We use angular
power spectrum metrics to quantify different components of the emission and compare the performance
of the two diffuse structure modelling approaches. Results: We observe that the point sources dominate
the angular power spectrum ($\ell(\ell+1)C_{\ell}/2\pi\equiv\Delta^2_{\ell}$) of the emission
in the field on scales $\ell\gtrsim60$ ($\lesssim3$ degree). The angular power spectrum after
subtraction of compact sources is flat within $20\lesssim\ell\lesssim200$ range, suggesting
that the residual power is dominated by the diffuse emission on scales $\ell\lesssim200$. The residual
diffuse emission has a brightness temperature variance of $\Delta^2_{\ell=180} = (145.64\pm
13.61)~{\rm K}^2$ at 122 MHz on angular scales of 1 degree, and is consistent with a power-law following
$C_{\ell}\propto\ell^{-2.0}$ in $20\lesssim\ell\lesssim200$ range. We also find that, in the
current setup, the multiscale CLEAN is suitable to model the compact and diffuse structures on a
wide range of angular scales, whereas the shapelet decomposition method better models the large
scales, which are of the order of a few degrees and wider.

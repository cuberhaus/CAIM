The bimodal absorption system imaging campaign (BASIC) aims to characterize the galaxy environments
of a sample of 36 HI-selected partial Lyman limit systems (pLLSs) and Lyman limit systems (LLSs)
in 23 QSO fields at $z \lesssim 1$. These pLLSs/LLSs provide a unique sample of absorbers with unbiased
and well-constrained metallicities, allowing us to explore the origins of metal-rich and low-metallicity
circumgalactic medium (CGM) at $z<1$. Here we present Keck/KCWI and VLT/MUSE observations of 11
of these QSO fields (19 pLLSs) that we combine with HST/ACS imaging to identify and characterize
the absorber-associated galaxies. We find 23 unique absorber-associated galaxies, with an average
of one associated galaxy per absorber. For seven absorbers, all with $<10\%$ solar metallicities,
we find no associated galaxies with $\log M_\star \gtrsim 9.0$ within $\rho/R_{vir}$ and $|\Delta
v|/v_{esc} \le$ 1.5 with respect to the absorber. We do not find any strong correlations between
the metallicities or HI column densities of the gas and most of the galaxy properties, except for
the stellar mass of the galaxies: the low-metallicity ([X/H] $\le -1.4$) systems have a probability
of $0.39^{+0.16}_{-0.15}$ for having a host galaxy with $\log M_\star \ge 9.0$ within $\rho/R_{vir}
\le 1.5$, while the higher metallicity absorbers have a probability of $0.78^{+0.10}_{-0.13}$.
This implies metal-enriched pLLSs/LLSs at $z<1$ are typically associated with the CGM of galaxies
with $\log M_\star > 9.0$, whereas low-metallicity pLLSs/LLSs are found in more diverse locations,
with one population arising in the CGM of galaxies and another more broadly distributed in overdense
regions of the universe. Using absorbers not associated with galaxies, we estimate the unweighted
geometric mean metallicity of the intergalactic medium to be [X/H] $\lesssim -2.1$ at $z<1$, which
is lower than previously estimated.

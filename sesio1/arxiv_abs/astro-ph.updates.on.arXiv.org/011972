The search for life on exoplanets is motivated by the universal ways in which life could modify its
planetary environment. Atmospheric gases such as oxygen and methane are promising candidates
for such environmental modification due to the evolutionary benefits their production would confer.
However, confirming that these gases are produced by life, rather than by geochemical or astrophysical
processes, will require a thorough understanding of planetary context, including the expected
counterfactual atmospheric evolution for lifeless planets. Here, we evaluate current understanding
of planetary context for several candidate biosignatures and their upcoming observability. We
review the contextual framework for oxygen and describe how conjectured abiotic oxygen scenarios
may be testable. In contrast to oxygen, current understanding of how planetary context controls
non-biological methane (CH$_4$) production is limited, even though CH$_4$ biosignatures in anoxic
atmospheres may be readily detectable with the James Webb Space Telescope. We assess environmental
context for CH$_4$ biosignatures and conclude that abundant atmospheric CH$_4$ coexisting with
CO$_2$, and CO:CH$_4$ << 1 is suggestive of biological production, although precise thresholds
are dependent on stellar context and sparsely characterized abiotic CH$_4$ scenarios. A planetary
context framework is also considered for alternative or agnostic biosignatures. Whatever the
distribution of life in the Universe, observations of terrestrial exoplanets in coming decades
will provide a quantitative understanding of the atmospheric evolution of lifeless worlds. This
knowledge will inform future instrument requirements to either corroborate the presence of life
elsewhere or confirm its apparent absence.

We present Lyman continuum (LyC) radiation escape fraction $f_{\rm{esc}}$ measurements for 183
spectroscopically confirmed star-forming galaxies in the redshift range $3.11 < z < 3.53$ in the
\textit{Chandra} Deep Field South. We use ground-based imaging to measure $f_{\rm{esc}}$, and
use ground- and space-based photometry to derive galaxy physical properties using spectral energy
distribution (SED) fitting. We additionally derive [O\,\textsc{iii}]\,+\,H$\beta$ equivalent
widths (that fall in the observed $K$ band) by including nebular emission in the SED fitting. After
removing foreground contaminants, we report the discovery of 11 new candidate LyC leakers, with
absolute LyC escape fractions, $f_{\rm{esc}}$ in the range $0.07-0.52$. Most galaxies in our sample
($\approx94\%$) do not show any LyC leakage, and we place $1\sigma$ upper limits of $f_{\rm{esc}}
< 0.07$ through weighted averaging, where the Lyman-break selected galaxies have $f_{\rm{esc}}
< 0.07$ and `blindly' discovered galaxies with no prior photometric selection have $f_{\rm{esc}}
< 0.10$. We additionally measure $f_{\rm{esc}} < 0.09$ for extreme emission line galaxies in our
sample with rest-frame [O\,\textsc{iii}]\,+\,H$\beta$ equivalent widths $>300$\,\AA. For
the candidate LyC leakers, we do not find a strong dependence of $f_{\rm{esc}}$ on their stellar
masses and/or specific star-formation rates, and no correlation between $f_{\rm{esc}}$ and EW$_0$([O\,\textsc{iii}]\,+\,H$\beta$).
We suggest that this lack of correlations may be explained by viewing angle and/or non-coincident
timescales of starburst activity and periods of high $f_{\rm{esc}}$. Alternatively, escaping
radiation may predominantly occur in highly localised star-forming regions, thereby obscuring
any global trends with galaxy properties. Both hypotheses have important consequences for models
of reionisation.

Automating classification of galaxy components is important for understanding the formation
and evolution of galaxies. Traditionally, only the larger galaxy structures such as the spiral
arms, bulge, and disc are classified. Here we use machine learning (ML) pixel-by-pixel classification
to automatically classify all galaxy components within digital imagery of massive spiral galaxy
UGC 2885. Galaxy components include young stellar population, old stellar population, dust lanes,
galaxy center, outer disc, and celestial background. We test three ML models: maximum likelihood
classifier (MLC), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM). We use high-resolution
Hubble Space Telescope (HST) digital imagery along with textural features derived from HST imagery,
band ratios derived from HST imagery, and distance layers. Textural features are typically used
in remote sensing studies and are useful for identifying patterns within digital imagery. We run
ML classification models with different combinations of HST digital imagery, textural features,
band ratios, and distance layers to determine the most useful information for galaxy component
classification. Textural features and distance layers are most useful for galaxy component identification,
with the SVM and RF models performing the best. The MLC model performs worse overall but has comparable
performance to SVM and RF in some circumstances. Overall, the models are best at classifying the
most spectrally unique galaxy components including the galaxy center, outer disc, and celestial
background. The most confusion occurs between the young stellar population, old stellar population,
and dust lanes. We suggest further experimentation with textural features for astronomical research
on small-scale galactic structures.

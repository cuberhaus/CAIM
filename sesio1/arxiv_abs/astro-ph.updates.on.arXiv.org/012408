The detection of a branched alkyl molecule in the high-mass star forming protocluster Sgr B2(N)
permitted by the advent of ALMA revealed a new dimension of interstellar chemistry. Astrochemical
simulations subsequently predicted that beyond a certain degree of molecular complexity, branched
molecules could even dominate over their straight-chain isomers. More generally, we aim at probing
further the presence in the ISM of complex organic molecules with the capacity to exhibit both a normal
and iso form, via the attachment of a functional group to either a primary or secondary carbon atom.
We used the imaging spectral line survey survey ReMoCA performed with ALMA and the results of a recent
spectroscopic study of propanol to search for the iso and normal isomers of this molecule in the hot
molecular core Sgr B2(N2). We expanded the network of the astrochemical model MAGICKAL to explore
the formation routes of propanol. We report the first interstellar detection of iso-propanol toward
a position of Sgr B2(N2) that shows narrow linewidths. We also report the first secure detection
of normal-propanol in a hot core. i-Propanol is found to be nearly as abundant as n-propanol, with
an abundance ratio of 0.6 similar to the ratio of 0.4 that we obtained previously for i- and n-propyl
cyanide in Sgr B2(N2). The results are in good agreement with the outcomes of our astrochemical models,
which indicate that OH-radical addition to propylene in dust-grain ice mantles, driven by water
photodissociation, can produce appropriate quantities of n- and i-propanol. The n-to-i ratio
in Sgr B2(N2) may be a direct inheritance of the branching ratio of this reaction process. The detection
of n- and i-propanol and their ratio indicate that the modest preference toward the normal form of
propyl cyanide determined previously may be a more general feature among similarly sized interstellar
molecules. [abridged]

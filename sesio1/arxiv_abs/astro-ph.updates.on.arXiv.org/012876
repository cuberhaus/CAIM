Double-lined eclipsing binaries allow the direct determination of masses and radii, which are
key to test stellar models. With the launch of the TESS mission, many well-known eclipsing binaries
have been observed at higher photometric precision, permitting the improvement of the absolute
dimensions determinations. Using TESS data and newly-obtained spectroscopic observations,
we aim at determining the masses and radii of the eccentric eclipsing binary systems V889 Aql and
V402 Lac, together with their apsidal motion parameters. We modelled simultaneously radial velocity
curves and times of eclipse for each target to precisely determine the orbital parameters of the
systems, which we used to analyse the light curves and then obtain their absolute dimensions. We
compared the obtained values with those predicted by theoretical models. We determined masses
and radii of the components of both systems with relative uncertainties lower than 2%. V889 Aql is
composed of two stars with masses $2.17\pm0.02$ M$_{\odot}$ and $2.13\pm0.01$ M$_{\odot}$ and
radii $1.87\pm0.04$ R$_{\odot}$ and $1.85\pm0.04$ R$_{\odot}$. We found conclusive evidence
of the presence of a third body orbiting V889 Aql with a period of 67 years. Based on the detected third
light and the absence of signal in the spectra, we suggest that this third body could in turn be a binary
composed by two $\sim$1.4 M$_{\odot}$ stars. V402 Lac is composed by two stars with masses $2.80\pm0.05$
M$_{\odot}$ and $2.78\pm0.05$ M$_{\odot}$ and radii $2.38\pm0.03$ R$_{\odot}$ and $2.36\pm0.03$
R$_{\odot}$. The times of minimum light are compatible with the presence of a third body for this
system too, although its period is not yet fully sampled. In both cases we have found a good agreement
between the observed apsidal motion rates and the model predictions.

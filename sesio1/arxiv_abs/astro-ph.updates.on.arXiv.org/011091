The environment of NGC1052 has recently attracted much attention due to the presence of low surface
brightness galaxies (LSBGs) with claimed exotic properties, making the detection of new objects
in this region of high interest. We have used public deep photometric data from DECaLS to carry out
a comprehensive search for LSBGs over a wide region of 6x6 degrees, equivalent to 2x2 Mpc at the distance
of NGC1052. We detected 42 LSBGs with r_e > 5" and mu_g(0) > 24 mag arcsec-2, of which 20 are previously
undetected objects. Among all the newly detected objects, RCP32 stands out with extreme properties:
r_e = 23.0" and <mu_g>_e = 28.6 mag arcsec-2. This makes RCP32 one of the lowest LSBGs ever detected
through integrated photometry, located at just 10 arcmin from the extensively studied NGC1052-DF2.
We explored the presence of globular clusters (GCs) in the LSBGs. We marginally detected a GC system
in RCP32, and argue the great interest of follow-up observations on RCP32 given its extremely low
baryon density. After analyzing the distribution of galaxies with available spectroscopy, we
identified a large-scale structure of approximately 1 Mpc, well isolated in redshift-space, centred
on NGC1052. The spatial correlation analysis between the LSBGs and this large-scale structure
suggests their association. However, when exploring the distribution of effective radius we found
an overpopulation of large LSBGs (r_e > 15") located close to the line of sight of NGC1052. We argue
that this is suggestive of a substructure with similar radial velocity in sight projection, but
at a closer distance, to which some of these apparently larger LSBGs could be associated, however
possible effects derived from tidal interactions are worth further study. Our work expands the
catalogue of LSBGs with new interesting objects and provides a detailed environmental context
for the study of LSBGs in this region.

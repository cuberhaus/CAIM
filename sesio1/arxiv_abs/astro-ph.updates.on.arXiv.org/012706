We present the stellar population properties of 68 short gamma-ray burst (GRB) host galaxies, representing
the largest uniformly-modeled sample to date. Using the Prospector stellar population inference
code, we jointly fit the photometry and/or spectroscopy of each host galaxy. We find a population
median redshift of $z=0.60^{+0.90}_{-0.34}$ (68% confidence), including 10 new or revised photometric
redshifts at $z\gtrsim1$. We further find a median mass-weighted age of $t_m=0.85^{+2.49}_{-0.57}$
Gyr, a stellar mass of $\log(M_*/M_\odot)=9.69^{+0.95}_{-0.66}$, a star formation rate of SFR=$1.46^{+10.55}_{-1.38}M_\odot$/yr,
a stellar metallicity of $\log(Z_*/Z_\odot)=-0.4^{+0.46}_{-0.42}$, and a dust attenuation
of $A_V=0.51^{+0.94}_{-0.43}$ mag (68% confidence). Overall, the majority of short GRB hosts
are star-forming ($\approx85$%), with small fractions that are either transitioning ($\approx6$%)
or quiescent ($\approx$9%); however, we observe a much larger fraction ($\approx60$%) of quiescent
and transitioning hosts at $z\lesssim0.25$, commensurate with galaxy evolution. We find that
short GRB hosts populate the star-forming main sequence of normal field galaxies, but do not include
as many high-mass galaxies, implying that their binary neutron star (BNS) merger progenitors are
dependent on a combination of host star formation and stellar mass. The distribution of ages and
redshifts implies a broad delay-time distribution, with a fast-merging channel at $z>1$ and a decreased
BNS formation efficiency at lower redshifts. Moreover, we find that short GRBs originate in environments
with a wide range of stellar metallicities. If short GRB hosts are representative of BNS merger hosts
within the horizon of current gravitational wave detectors, these results can inform future searches
for electromagnetic counterparts. All of the data and modeling products are available on the BRIGHT
website.

Cosmological fine-tuning has traditionally been associated with the narrowness of the intervals
in which the parameters of the physical models must be located to make life possible. A more thorough
approach focuses on the probability of the interval, not on its size. Most attempts to measure the
probability of the life-permitting interval for a given parameter rely on a Bayesian statistical
approach for which the prior distribution of the parameter is uniform. However, the parameters
in these models often take values in spaces of infinite size, so that a uniformity assumption is not
possible. This is known as the normalization problem. This paper explains a framework to measure
tuning that, among others, deals with normalization, assuming that the prior distribution belongs
to a class of maximum entropy (maxent) distributions. By analyzing an upper bound of the tuning probability
for this class of distributions the method solves the so-called weak anthropic principle, and offer
a solution, at least in this context, to the well-known lack of invariance of maxent distributions.
The implication of this approach is that, since all mathematical models need parameters, tuning
is not only a question of natural science, but also a problem of mathematical modeling. Cosmological
tuning is thus a particular instantiation of a more general scenario. Therefore, whenever a mathematical
model is used to describe nature, not only in physics but in all of science, tuning is present. And
the question of whether the tuning is fine or coarse for a given parameter -- if the interval in which
the parameter is located has low or high probability, respectively -- depends crucially not only
on the interval but also on the assumed class of prior distributions. Novel upper bounds for tuning
probabilities are presented.

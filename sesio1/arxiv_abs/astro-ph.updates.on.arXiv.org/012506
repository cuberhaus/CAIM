Gravitational entropy is an elusive concept. Various theoretical proposals have been presented,
initially based on Penrose's Weyl Curvature Hypothesis, and variations of it. A more recent proposal
by Clifton, Ellis, and Tavakol (CET) considered a novel approach by defining such entropy from a
Gibbs equation constructed from an effective stress-energy tensor that emerges from the 'square
root' algebraic decomposition of the Bel-Robinson tensor, the simplest divergence-less tensor
related to the Weyl tensor. Since, so far all gravitational entropy proposals have been applied
to highly restrictive and symmetric spacetimes, we probe in this paper the CET proposal for a class
of much less idealized spactimes (the Szekeres class I models) capable of describing the joint evolution
of arrays of arbitrary number of structures: overdensities and voids, all placed on selected spatial
locations in an asymptotic $\Lambda$CDM backgound. By using suitable covariant variables and
their fluctuations, we find the necessary and sufficient conditions for a positive CET entropy
production to be a negative sign of the product of the density and Hubble expansion fluctuations.
To examine the viability of this theoretical result we examine numerically the CET entropy production
for two elongated over dense regions surrounding a central spheroidal void, all evolving jointly
from initial linear perturbations at the last scattering era into present day Mpc-size CDM structures.
We show that CET entropy production is positive for all times after last scattering at the precise
spatial locations where structure growth occurs and where the exact density growing mode is dominant.
The present paper provides the least idealized (and most physically robust) probe of a gravitational
entropy proposal in the context of structure formation.

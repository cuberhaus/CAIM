We discuss an implementation of a deep learning framework to gain insight into the dark matter structure
formation. We investigate the impact of velocity and density field information on the construction
of halo mass function through cosmological $N$-body simulations. In this direction, we train a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the initial snapshot of an only dark matter simulation to
predict the halo mass that individual particles fall into at $z=0$, in the halo mass range of $10.5<
\log(M / M_{\odot})<14$. Our results show a negligible improvement from including the velocity
in addition to the density information when considering simulations based on the standard model
of cosmology ($\Lambda$CDM) with the amplitude of initial scalar perturbations $A_s = 2\times10^{-9}$.
In order to investigate the ellipsoidal collapse models and to study the effect of velocity in smaller
mass ranges, we increase the initial power spectrum such that we see the effect of velocities in larger
halos which are in the resolution of our simulation. The CNN model trained on the simulation snapshots
with large $A_s$ shows a considerable improvement in the halo mass prediction when adding the velocity
field information. Eventually, for the simulation with $A_s = 8 \times 10^{-8}$, the model trained
with only density information shows at least $80\%$ increase in the mean squared error relative
to the model with both velocity and density information at almost all mass scales, which indicates
the failure of the density-only model to predict the halo masses in this case. Our results indicate
that the effect of velocity field on the halo collapse is scale-dependent with a negligible effect
for the standard model of cosmology in mass scales $10.5 < \log(M/ M_{\odot}) < 14$.

HD 129929 is a slowly-rotating $\beta$ Cephei pulsator with a rich spectrum of detected oscillations,
including two rotational multiplets. The asteroseismic interpretation revealed the presence
of radial differential rotation in this massive star of $\sim$9.35 M . The stellar core is indeed
estimated to spin $\sim$3.6 times faster than the surface. The surface rotation was consequently
derived as $\sim$2 km/s. This massive star represents an ideal counter-part to the wealth of space-based
photometry results for main-sequence and evolved low-mass stars. Those latter have revealed a
new, and often unexpected, picture of the angular momentum transport processes acting in stellar
interiors. We investigate in a new way the constraints on the internal rotation of HD 129929, focusing
on their interpretation for the evolution of the internal rotation during the main sequence of a
massive star. We test separately hydrodynamic and magnetic instability transport processes of
angular momentum. We used the best asteroseismic model obtained in an earlier work. We calibrated
stellar models including rotation, with different transport processes, to reproduce that reference
model. We then looked whether one process is favoured to reproduce the rotation profile of HD 129929,
based on the fit of the asteroseismic multiplets. The impact of the Tayler magnetic instability
on the angular momentum transport predicts a ratio of the core-to-surface rotation rate of only
1.6, while the recently revised prescription of this mechanism predicts solid-body rotation.
Both are too low in comparison with the asteroseismic inference. The models with only hydrodynamic
processes are in good agreement with the asteroseismic measurements. Strikingly, we can also get
a constraint on the profile of rotation on the zero age main sequence: likely, the ratio between the
core and surface rotation was at least $\sim$1.7.

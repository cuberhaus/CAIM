Active region evolution plays an important role in the generation and variability of magnetic fields
on the surface of lower main-sequence stars. However, determining the lifetime of active region
growth and decay as well as their evolution is a complex task. We aim to test whether the lifetime for
active region evolution shows any dependency on the stellar parameters. We identify a sample of
stars with well-defined ages via their kinematics. We made use of high-resolution spectra to compute
rotational velocities, activity levels, and emission excesses. We use these data to revisit the
activity-rotation-age relationship. The time-series of the main optical activity indicators
were analysed together with the available photometry by using Gaussian processes to model the stellar
activity of these stars. Autocorrelation functions of the available photometry were also analysed.
We use the derived lifetimes for active region evolution to search for correlations with the stellar
age, the spectral type, and the level of activity. We also use the pooled variance technique to characterise
the activity behaviour of our targets. Our analysis confirms the decline of activity and rotation
as the star ages. We also confirm that the rotation rate decays with age more slowly for cooler stars
and that, for a given age, cooler stars show higher levels of activity. We show that F- and G-type young
stars also depart from the inactive stars in the flux-flux relationship. The gaussian process analysis
of the different activity indicators does not seem to provide any useful information on active region's
lifetime and evolution. On the other hand, active region's lifetimes derived from the light-curve
analysis might correlate with the stellar age and temperature. Although we caution the small number
statistics, our results suggest that active regions seem to live longer on younger, cooler, and
more active stars.

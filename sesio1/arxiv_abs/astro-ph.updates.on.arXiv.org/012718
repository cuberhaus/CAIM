Galaxy mergers have been observed to trigger nuclear activity by feeding gas to the central supermassive
black hole. One such class of objects are Ultra Luminous InfraRed Galaxies (ULIRGs), which are mostly
late stage major mergers of gas-rich galaxies. Recently, large-scale ($\sim$100 kpc) radio continuum
emission has been detected in a select number of ULIRGs, all of which also harbour powerful Active
Galactic Nuclei (AGN). This hints at the presence of large-scale radio emission being evidence
for nuclear activity. Exploring the origin of this radio emission and its link to nuclear activity
requires high sensitivity multi-frequency data. We present such an analysis of the ULIRG Mrk 273.
Using the International LOFAR telescope (ILT), we detected spectacular large-scale arcs in this
system. This detection includes, for the first time, a giant $\sim$190 kpc arc in the north. We propose
these arcs are fuelled by a low power radio AGN triggered by the merger. We also identified a bright
$\sim$45 kpc radio ridge, which is likely related to the ionised gas nebula in that region. We combined
this with high sensitivity data from APERture Tile In Focus (Apertif) and archival data from the
Very Large Array (VLA) to explore the spectral properties. The ILT simultaneously allowed us to
probe the nucleus at a resolution of $\sim$0.3 arcsec, where we detected three components, and,
for the first time, diffuse emission around these components. Combining this with archival high
frequency VLA images of the nucleus allowed us to detect absorption in one component, and a steep
spectrum radio AGN in another. We then extrapolate from this case study to the importance of investigating
the presence of radio emission in more ULIRGs and what it can tell us about the link between mergers
and the presence of radio activity.

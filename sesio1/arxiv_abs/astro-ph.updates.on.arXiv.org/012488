Understanding the physical and evolutionary properties of Hot Stellar Systems (HSS) is a major
challenge in astronomy. We studied the dataset on 13456 HSS of Misgeld and Hilker (2011) that includes
12763 candidate globular clusters using stellar mass ($M_s$), effective radius ($R_e$) and mass-to-luminosity
ratio ($M_s/L_\nu$), and found multi-layered homogeneous grouping among these stellar systems.
Our methods elicited eight homogeneous ellipsoidal groups at the finest sub-group level. Some
of these groups have high overlap and were merged through a multi-phased syncytial algorithm motivated
from Almod\'ovar-Rivera and Maitra (2020). Five groups were merged in the first phase, resulting
in three complex-structured groups. Our algorithm determined further complex structure and permitted
another merging phase, revealing two complex-structured groups at the highest level. A nonparametric
bootstrap procedure was also used to estimate the confidence of each of our group assignments. These
assignments generally had high confidence in classification, indicating great degree of certainty
of the HSS assignments into our complex-structured groups. The physical and kinematic properties
of the two groups were assessed in terms of $M_s$, $R_e$, surface density and $M_s/L_\nu$. The first
group consisted of older, smaller and less bright HSS while the second group consisted of brighter
and younger HSS. Our analysis provides novel insight into the physical and evolutionary properties
of HSS and also helps understand physical and evolutionary properties of candidate globular clusters.
Further, the candidate globular clusters (GCs) are seen to have very high chance of really being
GCs rather than dwarfs or dwarf ellipticals that are also indicated to be quite distinct from each
other.

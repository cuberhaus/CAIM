Pre-stellar cores are the basic unit for the formation of stars and stellar systems. The anatomy
of the physical and chemical structures of pre-stellar cores is critical for understanding the
star formation process. L1544 is a prototypical pre-stellar core, which shows significant chemical
differentiation surrounding the dust peak. We aim to constrain the physical conditions at the different
molecular emission peaks. This study allows us to compare the abundance profiles predicted from
chemical models together with the classical density structure of Bonnor-Ebert (BE) sphere. We
conducted multi-transition pointed observations of CH$_{3}$OH, c-C$_{3}$H$_{2}$ and HNCO with
the IRAM 30m telescope, towards the dust peak and the respective molecular peaks of L1544. With non-LTE
radiative transfer calculations and a 1-dimensional model, we revisit the physical structure
of L1544, and benchmark with the abundance profiles from current chemical models. We find that the
HNCO, c-C$_{3}$H$_{2}$ and CH$_{3}$OH lines in L1544 are tracing progressively higher density
gas, from $\sim$10$^{4}$ to several times 10$^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$. Particularly, we find that to produce
the observed intensities and ratios of the CH$_{3}$OH lines, a local gas density enhancement upon
the BE sphere is required. This suggests that the physical structure of an early-stage core may not
necessarily follow a smooth decrease of gas density profile locally, but can be intercepted by clumpy
substructures surrounding the gravitational center. Multiple transitions of molecular lines
from different molecular species can provide a tomographic view of the density structure of pre-stellar
cores. The local gas density enhancement deviating from the BE sphere may reflect the impact of accretion
flows that appear asymmetric and are enhanced at the meeting point of large-scale cloud structures.

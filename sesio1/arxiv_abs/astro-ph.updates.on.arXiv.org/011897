Molecular outflows are often detected originating from both protostellar and extragalactic sources.
Studies of low-mass, isolated high-mass, and extragalactic sources reveal scaling relations
connecting the force carried by an outflow and the properties of the source that drives it. The aim
of this work is to examine the effects of clustered star formation on the protostellar outflows and
their scaling relations and to explore the possibility that outflows varying greatly scale and
energetics are consistent with being launched by the same physical processes. High-angular resolution
CO J = 3-2 observations were used of ten high-mass protostars in the Cygnus-X molecular cloud, obtained
at the SMA as part of the PILS-Cygnus survey. From these data, the outflow force was measured. In addition,
an extended sample of protostellar and extragalactic outflow-force measurements was assembled
from existing literature to allow for a direct comparison of the scaling relations of the two types
of outflows. Molecular outflows were detected originating from all ten sources of the PILS-Cygnus
survey, and their outflow forces are found in close agreement with measurements from the literature.
The comparison of the protostellar and extragalactic sources reveals, with 95\% confidence, that
Class 0 protostars and extragalactic sources follow the same outflow force--bolometric luminosity
correlation. The close agreement between the Cygnus-X sources and sources of similar envelope
mass and bolometric luminosity suggests that clustered star formation has no significant effect
on protostellar outflows. We find a strong indication that protostellar and extragalactic outflows
are consistent with having a similar launch mechanism. The existence of such a mechanism would enable
the development of a single universal outflow launch model, although more observations are required
in order to verify this connection.

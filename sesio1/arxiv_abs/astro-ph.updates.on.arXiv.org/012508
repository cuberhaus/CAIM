Spectropolarimetric data allow for simultaneous monitoring of stellar chromospheric $\log{R^{\prime}_{\rm{HK}}}$
activity and the surface-averaged longitudinal magnetic field, $B_l$, giving the opportunity
to probe the relationship between large-scale stellar magnetic fields and chromospheric manifestations
of magnetism. We present $\log{R^{\prime}_{\rm{HK}}}$ and/or $B_l$ measurements for 954 mid-F
to mid-M stars derived from spectropolarimetric observations contained within the PolarBase
database. Our magnetically active sample complements previous stellar activity surveys that
focus on inactive planet-search targets. We find a positive correlation between mean $\log{R^{\prime}_{\rm{HK}}}$
and mean $\log|B_l|$, but for G stars the relationship may undergo a change between $\log{R'_{\rm{HK}}}\sim-4.4$
and $-4.8$. The mean $\log{R^{\prime}_{\rm{HK}}}$ shows a similar change with respect to the $\log{R^{\prime}_{\rm{HK}}}$
variability amplitude for intermediately-active G stars. We also combine our results with archival
chromospheric activity data and published observations of large-scale magnetic field geometries
derived using Zeeman Doppler Imaging. The chromospheric activity data indicate a slight under-density
of late-F to early-K stars with $-4.75\leq\log{R'_{\rm HK}}\leq-4.5$. This is not as prominent
as the original Vaughan-Preston gap, and we do not detect similar under-populated regions in the
distributions of the mean $|B_l|$, or the $B_l$ and $\log{R'_{\rm HK}}$ variability amplitudes.
Chromospheric activity, activity variability and toroidal field strength decrease on the main
sequence as rotation slows. For G stars, the disappearance of dominant toroidal fields occurs at
a similar chromospheric activity level as the change in the relationships between chromospheric
activity, activity variability and mean field strength.

Observational evidence for the accelerated expansion of the universe requires dark energy for
its explanation if general relativity is an accurate model of gravity. However, dark energy is a
mysterious quantity and we do not know much about its nature so understanding dark energy is an exciting
scientific challenge. Cosmological dark energy models are fairly well tested in the low and high
redshift parts of the universe. The highest of the low redshift, $z\sim2.3$, region is probed by
baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements and the only high redshift probe is the cosmic microwave
background anisotropy which probes the $z\sim1100$ part of redshift space. In the intermediate
redshift range $2.3 < z < 1100$ there are only a handful of observational probes and cosmological
models are poorly tested in this region. In this thesis we constrain three pairs of general relativistic
cosmological dark energy models using observational data which reach beyond the current BAO limit.
We use quasar X-ray and UV flux measurements, the current version of these data span $0.009 \leq z
\leq 7.5413$. We have discovered that most of these data cannot be standardized using the proposed
method. However, the lower redshift part, $z \lesssim 1.5-1.7$, of these data are standardizable
and can be used to derive lower-$z$ cosmological constraints. Another data set we use are gamma-ray
burst measurements which span $0.3399 \leq z \leq 8.2$. Cosmological constraints derived from
these data are significantly weaker than, but consistent with, those obtained from better-established
cosmological probes. We also study and standardize 78 reverberation-measured Mg II time-lag quasars
in the redshift range $0.0033 \leq z \leq 1.89$ by using their radius-luminosity relation. We also
study 118 reverberation-measured H$\beta$ time-lag quasars which span $0.0023 \leq z \leq 0.89$.

Atmospheric abundances are thought to constrain the planet formation pathway, because different
species evaporate at different temperatures leaving distinct signatures in the accreted atmosphere.
The planetary C/O ratio is thought to constrain the planet formation pathway, because of the condensation
sequence of H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CH$_4$, and CO, resulting in an increase of the gas phase C/O ratio with
increasing distance. Here we use a disc evolution model including pebble growth, drift and evaporation
coupled with a planet formation model that includes pebble and gas accretion as well as planet migration
to compute the atmospheric compositions of giant planets. We compare our results to the recent observations
of the hot Jupiters WASP-77A b and $\tau$ Bo\"otis b, which feature sub-solar and super-solar C/H
and O/H values, respectively. Our simulations reproduce these measurements and show that giants
like WASP-77A b should start to form beyond the CO$_2$ evaporation front, while giants like $\tau$
Bo\"otis b should originate from beyond the H$_2$O line. Our model allows the formation of sub- and
super-solar atmospheric compositions. However simulations without pebble evaporation can not
reproduce the super-solar C/H and O/H ratios of $\tau$ Bo\"otis b's atmosphere without additional
accretion of solids. We identify the $\alpha$ viscosity parameter of the disc as a key ingredient,
because the viscosity drives the inward motion of volatile enriched vapor, responsible for the
accretion of gaseous C and O. Depending on the planet's migration history order-of-magnitude differences
in atmospheric C/H and O/H are expected. Our simulations also predict super-solar N/H for $\tau$
Bo\"otis b and solar N/H for WASP-77A b. We conclude that pebble evaporation is a key ingredient to
explain the variety of exoplanet atmospheres, because it can explain both, sub- and super-solar
atmospheric abundances.

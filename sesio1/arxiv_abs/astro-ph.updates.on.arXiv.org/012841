To properly quantify possible residual systematic errors affecting the Classical Cepheid distance
scale, a detailed theoretical scenario is recommended. By extending the set of nonlinear convective
pulsation models published for $Z=0.02$ \citep[][]{Desomma2020a} to $Z=0.004$, $Z=0.008$ and
$Z=0.03$, we provide a detailed homogeneous nonlinear model grid taking into account simultaneous
variations of the mass-luminosity relation, the efficiency of super-adiabatic convection and
the chemical composition. The dependence of the inferred Period-Radius, Period-Mass-Radius,
and Period-Mass-Luminosity-Temperature relations on the input parameters is discussed for both
the Fundamental and First Overtone modes. The trend of the instability strip getting redder as the
metallicity increases is confirmed for the additional ML assumptions and mixing length values.
From the obtained multi-filter light curves, we derive mean magnitudes and colors and in turn Period-Luminosity-Color
and Period-Wesenheit relations for each assumed chemical composition, mass-luminosity relation
and efficiency of super-adiabatic convection. Application to a well-studied sample of Cepheids
in the Large Magellanic Cloud allows us to constrain the dependence of the inferred distance modulus
on the assumed mass-luminosity relation, and the inclusion of the metallicity term in the derivation
of Period-Wesenheit relations allows us, for each assumed mass-luminosity relation, to predict
the metallicity dependence of the Cepheid distance scale. The obtained metal-dependent Period-Wesenheit
relations are compared with recent results in the literature and applied to a sample of Gaia Early
Data Release 3 Galactic Cepheids with known metal abundances to derive individual parallaxes.
The comparison of these predictions with Gaia results is finally discussed.

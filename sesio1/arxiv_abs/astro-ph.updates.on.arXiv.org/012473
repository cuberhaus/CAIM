We examine the radial evolution of correlation lengths perpendicular (\(\lambda_C^{\perp}\))
and parallel (\(\lambda_C^{\parallel}\)) to the magnetic-field direction, computed from solar
wind magnetic-field data measured by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) during its first eight orbits, Helios
1, Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE), WIND, and Voyager 1 spacecraft. Correlation lengths are
grouped by an interval's alignment angle; the angle between the magnetic-field and solar wind velocity
vectors (\(\Theta_{\rm BV}\)). Parallel and perpendicular angular channels correspond to angles
\(0^{\circ}~<~\Theta_{\rm BV}~<~40^{\circ}\) and \(50^{\circ}~<~\Theta_{\rm BV}~<~90^{\circ}\),
respectively. We observe an anisotropy in the inner heliosphere within 0.40~au, with \(\lambda_C^{\parallel}
/ \lambda_C^{\perp} \approx 0.75\) at 0.10~au. This anisotropy reduces with increasing heliocentric
distance and the correlation lengths roughly isotropize within 1~au. Results from ACE and WIND
support a reversal of the anisotropy, such that \(\lambda_C^{\parallel} /\lambda_C^{\perp}
\approx 1.29\) at 1~au. The ratio does not appear to change significantly beyond 1~au, although
the small number of parallel intervals in the Voyager dataset precludes unambiguous conclusions
from being drawn. This study provides insights regarding the radial evolution of the large, most
energetic interacting turbulent fluctuations in the heliosphere. We also emphasize the importance
of tracking the changes in sampling direction in PSP measurements as the spacecraft approaches
the Sun, when using these data to study the radial evolution of turbulence. This can prove to be vital
in understanding the more complex dynamics of the solar wind in the inner heliosphere and can assist
in improving related simulations.

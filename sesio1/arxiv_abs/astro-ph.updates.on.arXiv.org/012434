Aims: We investigate the atmospheric response to coronal heating driven by random flows with different
characteristic time scales and amplitudes. Methods: We conducted a series of 3D MHD simulations
of random driving imposed on a gravitationally stratified model of the solar atmosphere. In order
to understand differences between alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) heating, we
considered the effects of changing the characteristic time scales of the imposed velocities. We
also investigated the effects of the magnitude of the velocity driving. Results: Complex foot point
motions lead to a proliferation of current sheets and energy dissipation throughout the corona.
For a given amplitude, DC driving typically leads to a greater rate of energy injection when compared
to AC driving. This leads to the formation of larger currents, increased heating rates and higher
temperatures in DC simulations. There is no difference in the spatial distribution of energy dissipation
across simulations, however, energy release events in AC cases tend to be more frequent and last
for less time. Higher velocity driving is associated with larger currents, higher temperatures
and the corona occupying a larger fraction of the simulation volume. In all cases, most of heating
is associated with small energy release events, which occur much more frequently than large events.
Conclusions: When combined with observational results showing a greater abundance of power in
low frequency modes, these findings suggest that energy release in the corona is likely to be driven
by long time scale motions. In the corona, AC and DC driving will occur concurrently and their effects
remain difficult to isolate. The distribution of field line temperatures and the asymmetry of temperature
profiles may reveal the frequency and longevity of energy release events and therefore the relative
importance of AC and DC heating.

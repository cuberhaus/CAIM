Our understanding of reionization has advanced considerably over the past decade, with several
results now demonstrating that the IGM transitioned from substantially neutral at $z=7$ to largely
reionized at $z=6$. However, little remains known about the sizes of ionized bubbles at $z\gtrsim7$
as well as the galaxy overdensities which drive their growth. Fortunately, rest-UV spectroscopic
observations offer a pathway towards characterizing these ionized bubbles thanks to the resonant
nature of Lyman-alpha photons. In a previous work, we presented Ly$\alpha$ detections from three
closely-separated Lyman-break galaxies at $z\simeq6.8$, suggesting the presence of a large ($R>1$
physical Mpc) ionized bubble in the 1.5 deg$^2$ COSMOS field. Here, we present new deep Ly$\alpha$
spectra of ten UV-bright ($\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{UV}}^{} \leq -20.4$) $z\simeq6.6-6.9$ galaxies
in the surrounding area, enabling us to better characterize this potential ionized bubble. We confidently
detect (S/N$>$7) Ly$\alpha$ emission at $z=6.701-6.882$ in nine of ten observed galaxies, revealing
that the large-scale volume spanned by these sources (characteristic radius $R = 3.2$ physical
Mpc) traces a strong galaxy overdensity ($N/\langle N\rangle \gtrsim 3$). Our data additionally
confirm that the Ly$\alpha$ emission of UV-bright galaxies in this volume is significantly enhanced,
with 40% (4/10) showing strong Ly$\alpha$ emission (equivalent width$>$25 $\mathrm{\mathring{A}}$)
compared to the 8$-$9% found on average at $z\sim7$. The median Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width of our
observed galaxies is also $\approx$2$\times$ that typical at $z\sim7$, consistent with expectations
if a very large ($R\sim3$ physical Mpc) ionized bubble is allowing the Ly$\alpha$ photons to cosmologically
redshift far into the damping wing before encountering HI.

We derive a simple analytical model for the propagation of HSSs from the Sun to Earth and thereby show
how the area of coronal holes and the size of their boundary regions affect the HSS velocity, temperature,
and density near Earth. We presume that velocity, temperature, and density profiles form across
the HSS cross section close to the Sun and that these spatial profiles translate into corresponding
temporal profiles in a given radial direction due to the solar rotation. These temporal distributions
drive the stream interface to the preceding slow solar wind plasma and disperse with distance from
the Sun. The HSS properties at 1 AU are then given by all HSS plasma parcels launched from the Sun that
did not run into the stream interface at Earth distance. We show that the velocity plateau region
of HSSs as seen at 1 AU, if apparent, originates from the center region of the HSS close to the Sun, whereas
the velocity tail at 1 AU originates from the trailing boundary region. The peak velocity of HSSs
at Earth further depends on the longitudinal width of the HSS close to the Sun. The temperature and
density of HSS plasma parcels at Earth depend on their radial expansion from the Sun to Earth. The
radial expansion is determined by the velocity gradient across the HSS boundary region close to
the Sun and gives the velocity-temperature and density-temperature relationships at Earth their
specific shape. When considering a large number of HSSs, the presumed correlation between the HSS
velocities and temperatures close to the Sun degrades only slightly up to 1 AU, but the correlation
between the velocities and densities is strongly disrupted up to 1 AU due to the radial expansion.
Finally, we show how the number of particles of the piled-up slow solar wind in the stream interaction
region depends on the velocities and densities of the HSS and preceding slow solar wind plasma.

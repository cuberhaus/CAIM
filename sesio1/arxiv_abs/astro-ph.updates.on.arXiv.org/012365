In L\"ovdal et al, we presented a data-driven method for clustering in Integrals of Motion space
and applied it to a large sample of nearby halo stars with 6D phase-space information. We identified
a large number of clusters, many of which could tentatively be merged into larger groups. Our goal
is to establish the reality of the clusters through a combined study of their stellar populations
to gain more insights into the accretion history of the Milky Way. We develop a procedure that quantifies
the similarity of clusters based on KS tests using their metallicity distribution functions, and
an isochrone fitting method to determine their average age, which is also used to compare the distribution
of stars in the Colour-Absolute magnitude diagram. This allows us to group clusters into substructures,
and to compare substructures with one another. The clusters identified are merged into 12 extended
substructures, while 8 small clusters remain as such. The large substructures include the previously
known Gaia-Enceladus, Helmi streams, Sequoia, and Thamnos 1 and 2. We identify overdensities associated
with the hot thick disc and hosting a metal-poor population. Especially notable is our largest substructure
which, although peaking at the metallicity characteristic of the thick disk has a well populated
metal-poor component, and dynamics in-between hot thick disc and halo. We identify additional
debris in the region occupied by Sequoia with distinct kinematics, likely remnants of three different
accretion events with progenitors of similar mass. We also identify different trends of [Mg/Fe]
vs [Fe/H] for the various substructures confirming our dissection of the nearby halo. At least 20\%
of the halo near the Sun is associated to substructures. When comparing their global properties,
we note that those substructures on retrograde orbits are not only more metal-poor on average but
also older.

Using the high angular resolution provided by the ALMA interferometre we want to resolve the COM
emission in the hot molecular core Sagittarius B2(N1) and thereby shed light on the desorption process
of Complex Organic Molecules (COMs) in hot cores. We use data taken as part of the 3 mm spectral line
survey Re-exploring Molecular Complexity with ALMA (ReMoCA) to investigate the morphology of
COM emission in Sagittarius B2(N1). Spectra of ten COMs are modelled under the assumption of LTE
and population diagrams are derived for positions at various distances to the south and west from
the continuum peak. Based on this analysis, resolved COM rotation temperature and COM abundance
profiles are derived. Based on the morphology, a rough separation into O- and N-bearing COMs can
be done. Temperature profiles are in agreement with expectations of protostellar heating of an
envelope with optically thick dust. Abundance profiles reflect a similar trend as seen in the morphology
and, to a great extent, agree with results of astrochemical models that, besides the co-desorption
with water, predict that O-bearing COMs are mainly formed on dust grain surfaces at low temperatures
while at least some N-bearing COMs and CH$_3$CHO are substantially formed in the gas phase at higher
temperatures. Our observational results, in comparison with model predictions, suggest that
COMs that are exclusively or to a great extent formed on dust grains desorb thermally at ~100 K from
the grain surface likely alongside water. Non-zero abundance values below ~100 K suggest that another
desorption process is at work at these low temperatures: either non-thermal desorption or partial
thermal desorption related to lower binding energies experienced by COMs in the outer, water-poor
ice layers. In either case, this is the first time that the transition between two regimes of COM desorption
has been resolved in a hot core.

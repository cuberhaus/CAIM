To understand the role of the galaxy group environment on galaxy evolution, we present a study of
radio luminosity functions (RLFs) of group galaxies based on the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array-COSMOS
3 GHz Large Project. The radio-selected sample of 7826 COSMOS galaxies with robust optical/near-infrared
counterparts, excellent photometric coverage, and the COSMOS X-ray galaxy groups (M_200c > 10^13.3
M_0) enables us to construct the RLF of group galaxies (GGs) and their contribution to the total RLF
since z ~ 2.3. Using the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, we fit a redshift-dependent pure luminosity
evolution model and a linear and power-law model to the luminosity functions. We compare it with
past RLF studies from VLA-COSMOS on individual populations of radio-selected star-forming galaxies
(SFGs) and galaxies hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN). These populations are classified based
on the presence or absence of a radio excess concerning the star-formation rates derived from the
infrared emission. We find that the fraction of radio group galaxies evolves by a factor of ~ 3 from
z ~ 2 to the present day. The increase in the galaxy group contribution is due to the radio activity
in groups being nearly constant at z < 1, while it is declining in the field. We show that massive galaxies
inside galaxy groups remain radio active below redshift 1, contrary to the ones in the field. This
evolution in the GG RLF is driven mainly by satellite galaxies in groups. Group galaxies associated
with SFGs dominate the GG RLF at z_med = 0.3, while at z_med = 0.8, the peak in the RLF, coinciding with
a known overdensity in COSMOS, is mainly driven by AGN. The study provides an observational probe
for the accuracy of the numerical predictions of the radio emission in galaxies in a group environment.

Relatively little is understood about the atmospheric composition of temperate to warm exoplanets
(equilibrium temperature $T_{\rm eq}<$ 1000 K), as many of them are found to have uncharacteristically
flat transmission spectra. Their flattened spectra are likely due to atmospheric opacity sources
such as planet-wide photochemical hazes and condensation clouds. We compile the transmission
spectra of 23 warm exoplanets previously observed by the \textit{Hubble Space Telescope} and quantify
the haziness of each exoplanet using a normalized amplitude of the water absorption feature ($A_{\rm
H}$). By examining the relationships between $A_{\rm H}$ and various planetary and stellar forcing
parameters, we endeavor to find correlations of haziness associated with planetary properties.
Our analysis shows that the previously identified linear trends between $A_{\rm H}$ and $T_{\rm{eq}}$
or hydrogen-helium envelope mass fraction (f$_{\rm{HHe}}$) break down with the addition of new
exoplanet data. Among all the parameters we investigated, atmospheric scale height ($H$), planet
gravity ($g_{\rm p}$), and planet density ($\rho_{\rm p}$) hold the most statistically significant
linear or linear logarithmic correlations with $A_{\rm H}$ ($p\leq0.02$). We also tentatively
identified positive correlations for eccentricity ($e$) and stellar age ($t_{\rm age}$) with
$A_{\rm H}$. Specifically, lower $H$, higher $g_{\rm p}$, $\rho_{\rm p}$, $e$, or $t_{\rm age}$
lead to clearer atmospheres. However, none of the parameters show very strong linear correlations
with $A_{\rm H}$, suggesting that haziness in warm exoplanets is not simply controlled by any single
planetary/stellar parameter. Additional observations and laboratory experiments are needed
to fully understand the complex physical and chemical processes that lead to the hazy/cloudy atmospheres
in warm exoplanets.

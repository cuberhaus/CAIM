The M dwarf Proxima~Centauri is known to be magnetically active and it hosts a likely Earth-like
planet in its habitable zone. Understanding the characteristics of stellar radiation by understanding
the properties of the emitting plasma is of paramount importance for a proper assessment of the conditions
on Proxima~Centauri~b and exoplanets around M dwarfs in general. We determine the temperature
structure of the coronal and transition region plasma of Proxima Centauri from simultaneous X-ray
and far-ultraviolet (FUV) observations. The differential emission measure distribution (DEM)
was constructed for flaring and quiescent periods by analysing optically thin X-ray and FUV emission
lines. Four X-ray observations of Proxima Centauri were conducted by the LETGS instrument on board
of the Chandra X-ray Observatory and four FUV observations were carried out using the Hubble STIS
spectrograph. From the X-ray light curves, we determined a variation of the quiescent count rate
by a factor of two within 20\% of the stellar rotation period. To obtain the DEM, 18 optically thin
emission lines were analysed (12 X-ray and six FUV). The flare fluxes differ from the quiescence
fluxes by factors of 4-20 (FUV) and 1-30 (X-ray). The temperature structure of the stellar corona
and transition region was determined for both the quiescence and flaring state by fitting the DEM(T)
with Chebyshev polynomials for a temperature range $\log$T = 4.25 - 8. Compared to quiescence, the
emission measure increases during flares for temperatures below 0.3\,MK (FUV dominated region)
and beyond 3.6\,MK (X-ray dominated region). The reconstructed DEM shape provides acceptable
line flux predictions compared to the measured values. We provide synthetic spectra at 1-1700 \AA,
which may be considered as representative for the high-energy irradiation of Proxima~Cen~b during
quiescent and flare periods.

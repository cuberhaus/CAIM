The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope Coronagraph Instrument is a high-contrast imager, polarimeter,
and spectrometer that will enable the study of exoplanets and circumstellar disks at visible wavelengths
($\sim$550--850~nm) at contrasts 2--3 orders of magnitude better than can currently be achieved
by ground or space-based direct imaging facilities. To capitalize on this sensitivity, precise
flux calibration will be required. The Roman Coronagraph, like other space-based missions, will
use on-orbit flatfields to measure and correct for phenomena that impact the measured total effective
throughput. However, the Coronagraph does not have internal lamp sources, therefore we have developed
a method to perform flatfield calibrations using observations of extended sources, such as Uranus
and Neptune, using a combination of rastering the Coronagraph's Fast Steering Mirror, tiling the
planet across the field of view, and matched-filter image processing. Here we outline the process
and present the results of simulations using images of Uranus and Neptune from the Hubble Space Telescopes
Wide Field Camera 3, in filters approximate to the Coronagraph's Band 1 and Band 4. The simulations
are performed over the Coronagraph's direct imaging and polarimetric modes. We model throughput
effects in 3 different spatial frequency regimes including 1) high spatial frequency detector
pixel-to-pixel quantum efficiency variations, 2) medium spatial frequency "measles" caused
by particle deposition on the detector or other focal-plane optics post-launch, and 3) low spatial
frequency detector fringing caused by self-interference due to internal reflections in the detector
substrate as well as low spatial frequency vignetting at the edges of the Coronagraph's field of
view. We show that Uranus and Neptune can be used as astrophysical flat sources with high precision
($\sim$0.5% relative error)

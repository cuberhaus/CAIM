RV surveys of evolved stars allow us to probe a higher stellar mass range compared to main-sequence
samples. Differences between the planet populations can be caused by either the differing stellar
mass or stellar evolution. To properly disentangle the effects of both, the planet population around
giant stars needs to be characterized as accurately as possible. Our goal is to investigate the giant
planet occurrence rate around evolved stars and determine its dependence on stellar mass, metallicity,
and orbital period. We combine data from the Lick, EXPRESS, and PPPS giant star surveys, yielding
a sample of 482 evolved stars and 37 planets. We homogeneously rederived the stellar parameters
and accounted for varying observational coverage, precision, and stellar noise properties by
computing detection maps via injection and retrieval of synthetic planetary signals. We then computed
occurrence rates as a function of period, stellar mass, and metallicity, corrected for incompleteness.
Our findings agree with previous studies that found a positive planet-metallicity correlation
for evolved stars and identified a peak in the occurrence rate as a function of stellar mass, but our
results place it at a slightly smaller mass of 1.68Msun. The period dependence of the occurrence
rate seems to follow a broken power-law or log-normal peaking at 700-800 days, roughly corresponding
to 1.6AU for a 1Msun star and 2.0AU for a 2Msun star. This peak could be a remnant from halted migration
around intermediate-mass stars, caused by stellar evolution, or an artifact from contamination
by false positives. The global occurrence rate of giant planetary systems is 10.7% for the entire
sample, while the subsets of RGB and HB stars exhibit 14.2% and 6.6%, respectively. However, we demonstrate
that the different stellar mass distributions suffice to explain the apparent change of occurrence
with evolutionary stage.

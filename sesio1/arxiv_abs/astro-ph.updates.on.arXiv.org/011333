[Abridged] AGN are thought to be intimately connected with their host galaxies through feeding
and feedback processes. A spatially resolved multiwavelength survey is required to map the interaction
of AGN with their host galaxies on different spatial scales and different phases of the ISM. The goal
of CARS is to obtain the necessary spatially resolved multiwavelength observations for an unbiased
sample of local unobscured luminous AGN. We present the overall CARS survey design and the associated
wide-field optical IFU spectroscopy for all 41 CARS targets at z<0.06 randomly selected from the
Hamburg/ESO survey of luminous unobscured AGN. This data set provides the backbone of CARS and allows
us to characterize host galaxy morphologies, AGN parameters, precise systemic redshifts, and
ionized gas distributions including excitation conditions, kinematics, and metallicities in
unprecedented detail. We focus our study on the size of the ENLR which has been traditionally connected
to AGN luminosity. Given the large scatter in the ENLR size-luminosity relation, we performed a
large parameter search to identify potentially more fundamental relations. Remarkably, we identified
the strongest correlation between the maximum projected ENLR size and the black hole mass, consistent
with an $R_\mathrm{ENLR,max}\sim M_\mathrm{BH}^{0.5}$ relationship. We interpret the maximum
ENLR size as a timescale indicator of a single BH radiative-efficient accretion episode for which
we inferred log(t_AGN) = (0.45+- 0.08)log(M_BH)+1.78 using forward modeling. The extrapolation
of our inferred relation toward higher BH masses is consistent with an independent lifetime estimate
from the HeII proximity zones around luminous AGN at z~3. While our proposed link between the BH mass
and AGN lifetime might be a secondary correlation itself or impacted by unknown biases, it has a few
relevant implications if confirmed.

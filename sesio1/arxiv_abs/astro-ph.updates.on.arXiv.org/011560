The thick-target model predicts that in flare foot points, we should observe lowering of HXR sources'
altitude with increasing energy. The foot point of HXR sources result from the direct interaction
of non-thermal electron beams with plasma in the lower part of the solar atmosphere, where the density
increases rapidly. Therefore, we can estimate the plasma density distribution along the non-thermal
electron beam directly from the observations of the altitude-energy relation obtained for the
HXR foot point sources. The relation's shape is density-dependent and is also determined by the
power-law distribution of non-thermal electrons. Additionally, during the impulsive phase these
parameters may change dramatically. Thus, the interpretation of observed HXR foot point sources'
altitudes is not straightforward and needs detailed numerical modelling of the electron precipitation
process. The numerical model was calculated using the hydrodynamic 1D model with an application
of the Fokker-Planck formalism for non-thermal beam precipitation. HXR data from RHESSI were used
to trace chromospheric density changes during a non-thermal emission burst, in detail. We have
found that the amount of mass that evaporated from the chromosphere is in good agreement with the
ranges obtained from hydrodynamical modelling of a flaring loop, and from an analysis of observed
emission measure in the loop top, and with specific scaling laws. Consistency between the obtained
values shows that HXR images may provide an important constraint for models - a mass of plasma that
evaporated due to a non-thermal electron beam depositing energy in the chromosphere. High-energy,
non-thermal sources' (above 20 keV in this case) positions fit the column density changes obtained
from the hydrodynamical model perfectly. Density changes seem to be less affected by the electrons'
spectral index.

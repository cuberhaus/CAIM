Gamma-rays, the most energetic photons, carry information from the far reaches of extragalactic
space with minimal interaction or loss of information. They bring messages about particle acceleration
in environments so extreme they cannot be reproduced on earth for a closer look. Gamma-ray astrophysics
is so complementary with collider work that particle physicists and astroparticle physicists
are often one in the same. Gamma-ray instruments, especially the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope,
have been pivotal in major multi-messenger discoveries over the past decade. There is presently
a great deal of interest and scientific expertise available to push forward new technologies, to
plan and build space- and ground-based gamma-ray facilities, and to build multi-messenger networks
with gamma rays at their core. It is therefore concerning that before the community comes together
for planning exercises again, much of that infrastructure could be lost to a lack of long-term planning
for support of gamma-ray astrophysics. Gamma-rays with energies from the MeV to the EeV band are
therefore central to multiwavelength and multi-messenger studies to everything from astroparticle
physics with compact objects, to dark matter studies with diffuse large scale structure. These
goals and new discoveries have generated a wave of new gamma-ray facility proposals and programs.
This paper highlights new and proposed gamma-ray technologies and facilities that have each been
designed to address specific needs in the measurement of extreme astrophysical sources that probe
some of the most pressing questions in fundamental physics for the next decade. The proposed instrumentation
would also address the priorities laid out in the recent Astro2020 Decadal Survey, a complementary
study by the astrophysics community that provides opportunities also relevant to Snowmass.

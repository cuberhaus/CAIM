Context. Recently, SDSS J143016.05+230344.4 (J1430+2303) was reported to be a supermassive black
hole binary (SMBHB) in the final coalescence phase. It is probably the first SMBHB coalescence event
observable in human history. Radio observations of J1430+2303 before and after coalescence will
provide a unique diagnosis of the energetics and environment of the SMBHB. Aims. We explore the radio
emission from the galactic nucleus region that is closely related to the current X-ray and optical
activities and helps to understand the state of black hole accretion and outflow before coalescence.
Methods. Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) imaging is the only method that offers milli-arcsecond-level
high resolution that can exclude the contamination by diffuse emission on galactic scales. We observed
J1430+2303 with the European VLBI Network at 1.7 GHz and with the Very Long Baseline Array at 1.6 and
4.9 GHz in late February and early March 2022. Results. A compact component is detected in all three
VLBI images. It has a brightness temperature of > 10^8 K, an unresolved morphology with a size < 0.8
pc, and a flat radio spectrum. These observational features are inconsistent with large opening-angle
outflows or winds, but indicate that this compact component might be a jet or a corona. Nearly 60%
of the emission is resolved by VLBI and may come from remnant lobes of previous radio activities,
the outer layers of a structured jet, or shocks formed by the disc winds in the narrow line region.
Conclusions. Current VLBI images do not yet show signs of radio outbursts. Our observations provide
pre-coalescence radio data that are an important reference for future comparative studies with
the post-merger. In particular, further resolving the jet will pave the way for probing the dynamical
features associated with inspiralling binary black holes.

We analyze 11 years of Fermi-LAT data corresponding to the sky regions of 7 dwarf irregular (dIrr)
galaxies. DIrrs are dark matter (DM) dominated systems, proposed as interesting targets for the
indirect search of DM with gamma rays. The galaxies represent interesting cases with a strong disagreement
between the density profiles (core vs. cusp) inferred from observations and numerical simulations.
In this work, we addressed the problem by considering two different DM profiles, based on both the
fit to the rotation curve (in this case a Burkert cored profile) and results from N-body cosmological
simulations (i.e., NFW cuspy profile). We also include halo substructures in our analysis, which
is expected to boost the DM signal a factor of ten in halos such as those of dIrrs. For each DM model and
dIrr, we create a spatial template of the expected DM-induced gamma-ray signal to be used in the analysis
of Fermi-LAT data. No significant emission is detected from any of the targets in our sample. Thus,
we compute upper limits on the DM annihilation cross-section versus mass parameter space. Among
the 7 dIrrs, we find IC10 and NGC6822 to yield the most stringent individual constraints, independently
of the adopted DM profile. We also produce combined DM limits for all objects in the sample, which
turn out to be dominated by IC10 for all DM models and annihilation channels, i.e. $b\bar{b}$, $\tau^+\tau^-$
and $W^+W^-$. The strongest constraints are obtained for $b\bar{b}$ and are at the level of $\langle\sigma
v \rangle \sim 7 \times 10^{-26}\text{cm}^{3}\text{s}^{-1}$ at $m_\chi\sim 6$ GeV. Though these
limits are a factor of 3 higher than the thermal relic cross section at low WIMP masses, they are independent
from and complementary to those obtained by means of other targets.

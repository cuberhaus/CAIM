Metal hydrides and oxides are important species in hot-Jupiters since they can affect their energy
budgets and the thermal structure of their atmospheres. One such species is VO, which is prominent
in stellar M-dwarf spectra. Evidence for VO has been found in the low-resolution transmission spectrum
of WASP-121b, but this has not been confirmed at high resolution. It has been suggested that this
is due to inaccuracies in its line list. In this paper, we quantitatively evaluate the VO line list
and assess whether inaccuracies are responsible for the non-detections at high resolution in WASP-121b.
Furthermore, we investigate whether the detectability can be improved by selecting only those
lines associated with the most accurate quantum transitions. A cross-correlation analysis was
applied to archival HARPS and CARMENES spectra of several M dwarfs. VO cross-correlation signals
from the spectra were compared with those in which synthetic VO models were injected, providing
an estimate of the ratio between the potential strength (in case of a perfect model) and the observed
strength of the signal. This was repeated for the reduced model covering the most accurate quantum
transitions. The findings were fed into injection and recovery tests of VO in a UVES transmission
spectrum of WASP-121b. We find that inaccuracies cause VO cross-correlation signals in M-dwarf
spectra to be suppressed by about a factor 2.1 and 1.1 for the complete and reduced line lists, respectively,
corresponding to a reduced observing efficiency of a factor 4.3 and 1.2. The reduced line list outperforms
the complete line list in recovering the actual VO signal in the M-dwarf spectra by about a factor
of 1.8. Neither line list results in a VO detection in WASP-121b. Injection tests show that with the
reduced efficiency of the line lists, the potential signal as seen at low resolution is not detectable
in these data.

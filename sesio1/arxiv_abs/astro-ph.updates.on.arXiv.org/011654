We report the discovery and characterisation of a pair of sub-Neptunes transiting the bright K-dwarf
TOI-1064 (TIC 79748331), initially detected in TESS photometry. To characterise the system, we
performed and retrieved CHEOPS, TESS, and ground-based photometry, HARPS high-resolution spectroscopy,
and Gemini speckle imaging. We characterise the host star and determine $T_{\rm eff, \star}=4734\pm67$
K, $R_{\star}=0.726\pm0.007$ $R_{\odot}$, and $M_{\star}=0.748\pm0.032$ $M_{\odot}$. We
present a novel detrending method based on PSF shape-change modelling and demonstrate its suitability
to correct flux variations in CHEOPS data. We confirm the planetary nature of both bodies and find
that TOI-1064 b has an orbital period of $P_{\rm b}=6.44387\pm0.00003$ d, a radius of $R_{\rm b}=2.59\pm0.04$
$R_{\oplus}$, and a mass of $M_{\rm b}=13.5_{-1.8}^{+1.7}$ $M_{\oplus}$, whilst TOI-1064 c has
an orbital period of $P_{\rm c}=12.22657^{+0.00005}_{-0.00004}$ d, a radius of $R_{\rm c}=2.65\pm0.04$
$R_{\oplus}$, and a 3$\sigma$ upper mass limit of 8.5 ${\rm M_{\oplus}}$. From the high-precision
photometry we obtain radius uncertainties of $\sim$1.6%, allowing us to conduct internal structure
and atmospheric escape modelling. TOI-1064 b is one of the densest, well-characterised sub-Neptunes,
with a tenuous atmosphere that can be explained by the loss of a primordial envelope following migration
through the protoplanetary disc. It is likely that TOI-1064 c has an extended atmosphere due to the
tentative low density, however further RVs are needed to confirm this scenario and the similar radii,
different masses nature of this system. The high-precision data and modelling of TOI-1064 b are
important for planets in this region of mass-radius space, and it allows us to identify a trend in
bulk density-stellar metallicity for massive sub-Neptunes that may hint at the formation of this
population of planets.

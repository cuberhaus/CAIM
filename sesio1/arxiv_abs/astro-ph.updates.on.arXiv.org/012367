We present an ALMA-Herschel joint analysis of sources detected by the ALMA Lensing Cluster Survey
(ALCS) at 1.15 mm. Herschel/PACS and SPIRE data at 100-500 $\mu$m are deblended for 180 ALMA sources
in 33 lensing cluster fields that are either detected securely (141 sources; in our main sample)
or tentatively at S/N$\geq$4 with cross-matched HST/Spitzer counterparts, down to a delensed
1.15-mm flux density of $\sim0.02$ mJy. We performed far-infrared spectral energy distribution
modeling and derived the physical properties of dusty star formation for 125 sources (109 independently)
that are detected at $>2\sigma$ in at least one Herschel band. 27 secure ALCS sources are not detected
in any Herschel bands, including 17 optical/near-IR-dark sources that likely reside at $z=4.2\pm1.2$.
The 16-50-84 percentiles of the redshift distribution are 1.15-2.08-3.59 for ALCS sources in the
main sample, suggesting an increasing fraction of $z\simeq1-2$ galaxies among fainter millimeter
sources ($f_{1150}\sim 0.1$ mJy). With a median lensing magnification factor of $\mu = 2.6_{-0.8}^{+2.6}$,
ALCS sources in the main sample exhibit a median intrinsic star-formation rate of $94_{-54}^{+84}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$,
lower than that of conventional submillimeter galaxies at similar redshifts by a factor of $\sim$3.
Our study suggests weak or no redshift evolution of dust temperature with $L_\mathrm{IR}<10^{12}\,\mathrm{L}_\odot$
galaxies within our sample at $z \simeq 0 - 2$. At $L_\mathrm{IR}>10^{12}\,\mathrm{L}_\odot$,
the dust temperatures show no evolution across $z \simeq 1 -4$ while being lower than those in the
local Universe. For the highest-redshift source in our sample ($z=6.07$), we can rule out an extreme
dust temperature ($>$80 K) that was reported for MACS0416 Y1 at $z=8.31$.

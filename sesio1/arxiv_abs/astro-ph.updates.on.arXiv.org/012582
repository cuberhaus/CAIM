In a recent work, a large sample of double-peak (DP) emission line galaxies have been identified
from the SDSS. While the two peaks could represent two kinematic components, they may be linked to
the large bulges which their host galaxies tend to have. Star-forming DP galaxies display a central
star formation enhancement and have been discussed to be compatible with a sequence of recent minor
mergers. In order to probe merger induced star formation mechanisms, we conducted observations
of the molecular gas content of 35 star-forming DP galaxies in the upper part of the main sequence
(MS) of star formation with the IRAM 30m telescope. Including similar galaxies 0.3 dex above MS and
with existing molecular gas observations from the literature, we finally obtain a sample of 52 such
galaxies. We succeed in fitting the same kinematic parameters to the optical ionised and molecular
gas emission lines for 10 (19%) galaxies. We find a central star formation enhancement resulting
most likely from a galaxy merger or galaxy interaction, which is indicated by an excess of gas extinction
found in the centre. This star formation is traced by radio continuum emissions at 150MHz, 1.4 and
3GHz, which are all three linearly correlated in log with the CO luminosity with the same slope. The
52 DP galaxies are found to have a significantly larger amount of molecular gas and larger depletion
times, hence a lower star formation efficiency, than the expected values at their distance of the
MS. This is consistent with a scenario of minor mergers increasing the mass of bulges and driving
gas to the centre. We also exclude the inwards directed gas migration and central star formation
enhancement to be the origin of a bar morphology. Hence, these 52 DP galaxies could be the results
of recent minor mergers that funnelled molecular gas towards their centre, triggering star formation,
but with a moderate efficiency.

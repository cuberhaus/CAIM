Cold, non-self-gravitating clumps occur in various astrophysical systems, ranging from the interstellar
and circumgalactic medium (CGM), to AGN outflows and solar coronal loops. Cold gas has diverse origins
such as turbulent mixing or precipitation from hotter phases. We obtain the analytic solution for
a steady pressure-driven 1-D cooling flow around cold, local over-densities, irrespective of
their origin. Our solutions describe the slow and steady radiative cooling-driven gas inflow in
the saturated regime of nonlinear thermal instability in clouds, sheets and filaments. Such a cooling
flow develops when the gas around small clumps undergoes radiative cooling. These small-scale,
cold `seeds' are embedded in a large volume-filling hot CGM maintained by feedback. We use a simple
two-fluid treatment to include magnetic fields as an additional polytropic fluid. To test the limits
of applicability of these analytic solutions, we compare with the gas structure found in and around
small-scale cold clouds in the CGM of massive halos in the TNG50 cosmological MHD simulation from
the IllustrisTNG suite. Despite qualitative resemblance of the gas structure, we find deviations
from steady state profiles generated by our model. Complex geometries and turbulence all add complexity
beyond our analytic solutions. We derive an exact relation between the mass cooling rate ($\dot{\rm
M}_{\rm cool}$) and the radiative cooling rate ($\dot{\rm E}_{\rm cool}$) for a steady cooling
flow. A comparison with the TNG50 clouds shows that this cooling flow relation only applies in a narrow
temperature range around $\rm \sim 10^{4.5}$ K where the isobaric cooling time is the shortest.
In general, turbulence and mixing, instead of radiative cooling, may dominate the transition of
gas between different temperature phases.

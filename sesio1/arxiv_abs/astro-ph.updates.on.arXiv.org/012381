The stellar halo of the Milky Way is known to have a highly lumpy structure due to the presence of tidal
debris and streams accreted from the satellite galaxies. The abundance and distribution of these
substructures can provide a wealth of information on the assembly history of the Milky Way. We use
some information-theoretic measures to study the anisotropy in a set of Milky Way-sized stellar
halos from the Bullock & Johnston suite of simulations. Our analysis shows that the radial anisotropy
in each stellar halo increases with the distance from its centre and eventually plateaus out beyond
a certain radius. All the stellar halo have a very smooth structure within a radius of $\sim 50$ kpc
and a highly anisotropic structure in the outskirts. At a given radius, the polar and azimuthal anisotropies
in a stellar halo have two distinct components: (i) a nearly unvarying component from the smooth
distribution of stars and (ii) a highly fluctuating component possibly from the substructures.
We destroy the substructures and any non-spherical shape of the halo by randomizing the polar and
azimuthal coordinates of the stellar particles while keeping their radial distances fixed. We
observe that the fluctuating part of the anisotropy is completely eliminated, and the unvarying
part of the anisotropy is significantly reduced after the sphericalization. A comparison between
the original halo and its sphericalized versions reveals that the unvarying part of the anisotropy
originates from the discreteness noise and the non-spherical shape of the halo whereas the substructures
contribute to the fluctuating part. We show that such distinction between the anisotropies can
constrain the shape of the stellar halo and its substructures. Finally, we map the distribution
of the individual substructures by combining the polar and azimuthal anisotropy profiles of the
halo at different radial distances.

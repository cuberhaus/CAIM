We present a large VLT/MUSE mosaic (3.8 x 3.8 kpc) of the nearby spiral galaxy M83, with a spatial resolution
~20 pc. We obtained the kinematics of the stars and ionised gas, and compared them with molecular
gas kinematics from ALMA CO(2-1). We separated the ionised gas into HII regions and diffuse ionised
gas (DIG) and determined the fraction of Ha luminosity originating from the DIG (f_DIG). We observe
that both stars and gas trace the galactic disk rotation, as well as a fast-rotating nuclear component,
likely connected to secular processes driven by the galactic bar. In the gas kinematics, we observe
a stream east of the nucleus, redshifted with respect to the disk. The stream is surrounded by an extended
ionised gas region with enhanced velocity dispersion and a high ionisation state, which is largely
consistent with being ionised by slow shocks. We interpret this feature as either the superposition
of the disk and an extraplanar layer of DIG, or as a bar-driven inflow of shocked gas. A double Gaussian
component fit to the Ha line also reveals the presence of a nuclear biconic structure whose axis of
symmetry is perpendicular to the bar. The two cones appear blue- and redshifted along the line of
sight and stand out for having an Ha emission separated by up to 200 km s-1 from that of the disk, and
a high velocity dispersion ~80-200 km s-1. At the far end of the cones, we observe that the gas is consistent
with being ionised by shocks. These features had never been observed before in M83; we postulate
that they are tracing a starburst-driven outflow shocking into the surrounding ISM. Finally, we
obtain f_DIG ~ 13% in our field of view. We inspect the emission of the HII regions and DIG in `BPT' diagrams,
finding that in HII regions photoionisation accounts for 99.8% of the Ha flux, whereas the DIG has
a mixed contribution from photoionisation (94.9%) and shocks (5.1%). [abridged]

We determined the differential rotation (DR) parameters $A$ and $B$ (corresponding to the equatorial
rotation velocity and the gradient of the solar DR) by tracing sunspot groups in sunspot drawings
of the Kanzelh\"ohe Observatory for Solar and Environmental Research (KSO; 1964-2008, for solar
cycles (SC) 20-23) and KSO white-light images (2009-2016, for SC 24). We used different statistical
methods and approaches to analyse cycle related variations, solar cycle phase-related variations
and long-term variations of the DR. $A$ and $B$ show statistically significant periodic variability.
The changes in $A$ related to solar cycle phase are in accordance with previously reported theoretical
and experimental results (higher $A$ during solar minimum, lower $A$ during the maximum of activity),
while changes in $B$ differ from the theoretical predictions as we observe more negative values
of $B$, that is, a more pronounced DR during activity maximum. The main result of this paper for the
long-term variations in $A$ is the detection of a phase shift between the activity flip (in the 1970s)
and the equatorial rotation velocity flip (in the early 1990s). During this time period both $A$
and activity show a secular decreasing trend, indicating their correlation. Therefore, the theoretical
model fails in the phase-shift time period that occurs after the modern Gleissberg maximum, while
in the time period thereafter (after the 1990s), theoretical and experimental results are consistent.
The long-term variations in $B$ in general yield an anticorrelation of $B$ and activity, as a rise
of $B$ is observed during the entire time period (1964-2016) we analysed, during which activity
decreased. We study for the first time the variation in solar DR and activity based on 53 years of KSO
data. Our results agree well with the results related to the solar cycle phase from corona observations.

We present detailed abundance measurements for 45 globular clusters (GCs) in galaxies in (and,
in one case, beyond) the Local Group. The measurements are based on new high-resolution integrated-light
spectra of GCs in NGC 185, NGC 205, M31, M33, and NGC 2403, combined with reanalysis of previous observations
of GCs in the Fornax dSph, WLM, NGC 147, NGC 6822, and the Milky Way. The GCs cover the range -2.8 < [Fe/H]
< -0.1 and we determined abundances for Fe, Na, Mg, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn, Zr, Ba, and Eu.
Corrections for non local thermodynamic equilibrium effects are included for Na, Mg, Ca, Ti, Mn,
Fe, Ni, and Ba. For several of the galaxies, our measurements provide the first quantitative constraints
on the detailed composition of their metal-poor stellar populations. Overall, the GCs in different
galaxies exhibit remarkably uniform abundance patterns of the alpha-, iron-peak, and neutron-capture
elements, with a dispersion of less than 0.1 dex in [alpha/Fe] for the full sample. There is a hint
that GCs in dwarf galaxies are slightly less alpha-enhanced (by about 0.04 dex on average) than those
in larger galaxies. One GC in M33 (HM33-B) resembles the most metal-rich GCs in the Fornax dSph (Fornax
4) and NGC 6822 (SC7) by having alpha-element abundances closer to scaled-solar values, possibly
hinting at an accretion origin. We find that the alpha-element abundances strongly correlate with
those of Na, Sc, Ni, and Zn. Several GCs with [Fe/H]<-1.5 are deficient in Mg compared to other alpha-elements.
We find no GCs with strongly enhanced r-process abundances as reported for metal-poor stars in some
ultra-faint dwarfs and the Magellanic Clouds. The similarity of the abundance patterns for metal-poor
GCs in different environments points to similar early enrichment histories and only allow for minor
variations in the initial mass function.

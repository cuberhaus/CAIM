Next generation telescopes, such as Euclid, Rubin/LSST, and Roman, will open new windows on the
Universe, allowing us to infer physical properties for tens of millions of galaxies. Machine learning
methods are increasingly becoming the most efficient tools to handle this enormous amount of data,
not only as they are faster to apply to data samples than traditional methods, but because they are
also often more accurate. Properly understanding their applications and limitations for the exploitation
of these data is of utmost importance. In this paper we present an exploration of this topic by investigating
how well redshifts, stellar masses, and star-formation rates can be measured with deep learning
algorithms for galaxies within data that mimics the Euclid and Rubin/LSST surveys. We find that
Deep Learning Neural Networks and Convolutional Neutral Networks (CNN), which are dependent on
the parameter space of the sample used for training, perform well in measuring the properties of
these galaxies and have an accuracy which is better than traditional methods based on spectral energy
distribution fitting. CNNs allow the processing of multi-band magnitudes together with $H_{E}$-band
images. We find that the estimates of stellar masses improve with the use of an image, but those of
redshift and star-formation rates do not. Our best machine learning results are deriving i) the
redshift within a normalised error of less than 0.15 for 99.9% of the galaxies in the sample with S/N>3
in the $H_{E}$-band; ii) the stellar mass within a factor of two ($\sim$0.3 dex) for 99.5% of the considered
galaxies; iii) the star-formation rates within a factor of two ($\sim$0.3 dex) for $\sim$70% of
the sample. We discuss the implications of our work for application to surveys, mainly but not limited
to Euclid and Rubin/LSST, and how measurements of these galaxy parameters can be improved with deep
learning.

Over the past decades, several studies have discovered a population of galaxies undergoing very
strong star formation events, called extreme emission line galaxies (EELGs). In this work, we exploit
the capabilities of the Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS), a wide field multifilter
survey, with 2000 square degrees observed. We use it to identify EELGs at low redshift by their [OIII]5007
emission line. We intend to provide with a more complete, deep, and less biased sample of local EELGs.
We select objects with an excess of flux in the J-PLUS mediumband $J0515$ filter, which covers the
[OIII] line at z$<$0.06. We remove contaminants (stars and higher redshift systems) using J-PLUS
and WISE infrared data, with SDSS spectra as a benchmark. We perform spectral energy distribution
fitting to estimate the properties of the galaxies: line fluxes, equivalent widths (EWs), masses,
etc. We identify 466 EELGs at ${\rm z} < 0.06$ with [OIII] EW over 300 \text{\AA} and $r$-band mag.
below 20, of which 411 were previously unknown. Most show compact morphologies, low stellar masses
($\log (M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) \sim {8.13}^{+0.61}_{-0.58}$), low dust extinction ($E(B-V)\sim{0.1}^{+0.2}_{-0.1}$),
and very young bursts of star formation (${3.0}^{+2.7}_{-2.0}$ Myr). Our method is up to $\sim$
20 times more efficient detecting EELGs per Mpc$^3$ than broadband surveys, and as complete as magnitude-limited
spectroscopic surveys (and reaching fainter objects). The sample is not directly biased against
strong H$\alpha$ emitters, in contrast with broadband surveys. We demonstrate the capability
of J-PLUS to identify, following a clear selection process, a large sample of previously unknown
EELGs showing unique properties. A fraction of them are likely similar to the first galaxies in the
Universe, but at a much lower redshift, which makes them ideal targets for follow-up studies.

After giving a short overview of previous results on constraining of Extended Gravity (EG) by stellar
orbits, we discuss the Schwarzschild orbital precession of S2 star assuming the congruence with
predictions of General Relativity (GR). At the moment, the S2 star trajectory is remarkably fitted
with the first post-Newtonian (pN) approximation of GR. In particular, both Keck and VLT (GRAVITY)
teams declared that the gravitational redshift near its pericenter passage for the S2 star orbit
corresponds to theoretical estimates found with the first pN approximation. In 2020, the GRAVITY
Collaboration detected the orbital precession of the S2 star around the supermassive black hole
(SMBH) at the Galactic Center (GC) and showed that it is close to the GR prediction. Based on this observational
fact, we evaluated parameters of the EG theories with the Schwarzschild precession of the S2 star.
Using the mentioned method, we estimate the orbital precession angles for some EG models including
power-law f(R), general Yukawa-like corrections, scalar-tensor gravity (STG), and non-local
gravity (NLG) theories formulated in both metric and Palatini formalism. In this consideration
we assume that a gravitational field is spherically symmetric, therefore, alternative theories
of gravity could be described only with a few parameters. Specifically, considering the orbital
precession, we estimate the range of parameters of these EG models for which the orbital precession
is like in GR. We then compare these results with our previous results, which were obtained by fitting
the simulated orbits of S2 star to its observed astrometric positions. In case of power-law f(R),
generic Yukawa-like correction, STG and NLG theories, we were able to obtain a prograde orbital
precession, like in GR. According to these results, the method is a useful tool to evaluate parameters
of the gravitational potential at the GC.

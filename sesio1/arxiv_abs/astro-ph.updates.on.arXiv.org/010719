Surges are cool and dense ejections typically observed in chromospheric lines and closely related
to other solar phenomena like UV bursts or coronal jets. Our aim is to address the current lack of inverted
models and diagnostics of surges as well as characterizing their plasma properties. We have analyzed
different surges related to UV bursts observed with the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph
(IRIS) on 2016 April. The mid- and low-chromosphere of the surges are examined by getting their representative
Mg II h&k line profiles through the k-means algorithm and performing inversions on them using the
STiC code. We have studied the far-UV spectra focusing on the O IV 1399.8 and 1401.2 \r{A} lines, carrying
out density diagnostics to determine the transition region properties of these ejections. We have
also used experiments performed with the Bifrost code for comparisons. Thanks to k-means, we reduce
the number of Mg II h&k profiles to invert by a factor 43.2. The inversions of the representative profiles
show that the mid- and low-chromosphere of the surges have temperatures mainly around T $=6$ kK at
$ -6.0 \le \log_{10}(\tau) \le -3.2$. For the electronic number density, $n_e$, and line-of-sight
velocity, $V_{\mathrm{LOS}}$, the most reliable results from the inversions are within $ -6.0
\le \log_{10}(\tau) \le -4.8$, with $n_e$ ranging from $\sim1.6 \times 10^{11}$ up to $10^{12}$
cm$^{-3}$, and $V_{\mathrm{LOS}}$ of a few km s$^{-1}$. We find, for the first time, observational
evidence of enhanced O IV emission within the surges, indicating that these phenomena have a considerable
impact on the transition region even in the weakest far-UV lines. The O IV emitting layers show electron
number densities from $2.5\times 10^{10}$ to $10^{12}$ cm$^{-3}$. The simulations provide theoretical
support in terms of the topology and of the location of the O IV emission of the surges.

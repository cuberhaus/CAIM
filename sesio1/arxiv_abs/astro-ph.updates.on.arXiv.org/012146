In recent times, large organic molecules of exceptional complexity have been found in diverse regions
of the interstellar medium. In this context, we aim to provide accurate frequencies of the ground
vibrational state of two key aliphatic aldehydes, n-butanal and its branched-chain isomer, i-butanal,
to enable their eventual detection in the interstellar medium. We employ a frequency modulation
millimeter-wave absorption spectrometer to measure the rotational features of n- and i-butanal.
We use the spectral line survey ReMoCA performed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array to search for n- and i-butanal toward the star-forming region Sgr B2(N). We also search for
both aldehydes toward the molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027 with IRAM 30 m and Yebes 40 m observations.
Several thousand rotational transitions belonging to the lowest-energy conformers have been
assigned in the laboratory spectra up to 325 GHz. A precise set of the relevant rotational spectroscopic
constants has been determined for each structure. We report non-detections of n- and i-butanal
toward both sources, Sgr B2(N1S) and G+0.693-0.027. We find that n- and i-butanal are at least 2-6
and 6-18 times less abundant than acetaldehyde toward Sgr B2(N1S), respectively, and that n-butanal
is at least 63 times less abundant than acetaldehyde toward G+0.693-0.027. Comparison with astrochemical
models indicates good agreement between observed and simulated abundances (where available).
Grain-surface chemistry appears sufficient to reproduce aldehyde ratios in G+0.693-0.027; gas-phase
production may play a more active role in Sgr B2(N1S). Our astronomical results indicate that the
family of interstellar aldehydes in the Galactic center region is characterized by a drop of one
order of magnitude in abundance at each incrementation in the level of molecular complexity.

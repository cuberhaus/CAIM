The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) has embarked on an ambitious five-year survey
to explore the nature of dark energy with spectroscopy of 40 million galaxies and quasars. DESI will
determine precise redshifts and employ the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation method to measure distances
from the nearby universe to z > 3.5, as well as measure the growth of structure and probe potential
modifications to general relativity. In this paper we describe the significant instrumentation
we developed for the DESI survey. The new instrumentation includes a wide-field, 3.2-deg diameter
prime-focus corrector that focuses the light onto 5020 robotic fiber positioners on the 0.812 m
diameter, aspheric focal surface. The positioners and their fibers are divided among ten wedge-shaped
petals. Each petal is connected to one of ten spectrographs via a contiguous, high-efficiency,
nearly 50 m fiber cable bundle. The ten spectrographs each use a pair of dichroics to split the light
into three channels that together record the light from 360 - 980 nm with a resolution of 2000 to 5000.
We describe the science requirements, technical requirements on the instrumentation, and management
of the project. DESI was installed at the 4-m Mayall telescope at Kitt Peak, and we also describe the
facility upgrades to prepare for DESI and the installation and functional verification process.
DESI has achieved all of its performance goals, and the DESI survey began in May 2021. Some performance
highlights include RMS positioner accuracy better than 0.1", SNR per \sqrt{\AA} > 0.5 for a z > 2 quasar
with flux 0.28e-17 erg/s/cm^2/A at 380 nm in 4000s, and median SNR = 7 of the [OII] doublet at 8e-17
erg/s/cm^2 in a 1000s exposure for emission line galaxies at z = 1.4 - 1.6. We conclude with highlights
from the on-sky validation and commissioning of the instrument, key successes, and lessons learned.

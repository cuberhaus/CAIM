The IBIS data Archive (IBIS-A) stores data acquired with the Interferometric BIdimensional Spectropolarimeter
(IBIS), which was operated at the Dunn Solar Telescope of the US National Solar Observatory from
2003 to 2019. The instrument provided series of high-resolution narrowband spectropolarimetric
imaging observations of the photosphere and chromosphere in the range 5800$-$8600 \AA~ and co-temporal
broadband observations in the same spectral range and with the same field of view of the polarimetric
data. We present the data currently stored in IBIS-A, as well as the interface utilized to explore
such data and facilitate its scientific exploitation. To this purpose we also describe the use of
IBIS-A data in recent and undergoing studies relevant to solar physics and space weather research.
IBIS-A includes raw and calibrated observations, as well as science-ready data. The latter comprise
maps of the circular, linear, and net circular polarization, and of the magnetic and velocity fields
derived for a significant fraction of the series available in the archive. IBIS-A furthermore contains
links to observations complementary to the IBIS data, such as co-temporal high-resolution observations
of the solar atmosphere available from the instruments onboard the Hinode and IRIS satellites,
and full-disc multiband images from INAF solar telescopes. IBIS-A currently consists of 30 TB of
data taken with IBIS during 28 observing campaigns performed in 2008 and from 2012 to 2019 on 159 days.
Metadata and movies of each calibrated and science-ready series are also available to help users
evaluating observing conditions. IBIS-A represents a unique resource for investigating the plasma
processes in the solar atmosphere and the solar origin of space weather events.

The ESA Euclid mission will produce photometric galaxy samples over 15 000 square degrees of the
sky that will be rich for clustering and weak lensing statistics. The accuracy of the cosmological
constraints derived from these measurements will depend on the knowledge of the underlying redshift
distributions based on photometric redshift calibrations. A new approach is proposed to use the
stacked spectra from Euclid slitless spectroscopy to augment the broad-band photometric information
to constrain the redshift distribution with spectral energy distribution fitting. The high spectral
resolution available in the stacked spectra complements the photometry and helps to break the colour-redshift
degeneracy and constrain the redshift distribution of galaxy samples. We model the stacked spectra
as a linear mixture of spectral templates. The mixture may be inverted to infer the underlying redshift
distribution using constrained regression algorithms. We demonstrate the method on simulated
Vera C. Rubin Observatory and Euclid mock survey data sets based on the Euclid Flagship mock galaxy
catalogue. We assess the accuracy of the reconstruction by considering the inference of the baryon
acoustic scale from angular two-point correlation function measurements. We select mock photometric
galaxy samples at redshift z>1 using the self-organizing map algorithm. Considering the idealized
case without dust attenuation, we find that the redshift distributions of these samples can be recovered
with 0.5% accuracy on the baryon acoustic scale. The estimates are not significantly degraded by
the spectroscopic measurement noise due to the large sample size. However, the error degrades to
2% when the dust attenuation model is left free. We find that the colour degeneracies introduced
by attenuation limit the accuracy considering the wavelength coverage of the Euclid near-infrared
spectroscopy.

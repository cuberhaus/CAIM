X-ray emission detection in a galaxy is one of the efficient tools for selecting Active Galactic
Nuclei (AGNs). However, many X-ray-selected AGNs are not easily selected as AGNs by their optical
emission. These galaxies, so-called optically dull (OD) AGNs, are fascinating since their X-ray
emission is bright even though the AGN signature in the optical regime is absent. In a deep multiwavelength
survey over 2 deg$^2$ of the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) field, we have looked for the OD AGNs
using photometric, spectroscopic, and X-ray data. We identified 310 non-broad line sources with
optical spectra as AGN using X-ray selection up to redshift $z\sim 1.5$. We inspected the spectra
to check for any AGN signature in their optical emission lines: [Ne V] forbidden emission line, Mass
Excitation diagram (MEx), color excitation diagram (TBT), and excess in [O II ] emission line. Finally,
we found 48 AGNs show AGN signatures in the optical spectrum classified as narrow-line AGN and 180
AGNs that did not show any AGN signature as OD AGN sample. The simple explanation of OD AGN's nature
is due to a bright host galaxy that dilutes the AGN light or dust materials obscuring the AGN light.
The bright host galaxy dilution explains nearly $70\%$ of our OD AGN sample. At the same time, the
dust material obscuration is unlikely for the main reason. By estimating the Eddington ratio, we
also found that 95/180 of our OD AGNs have a lower accretion rate of $(\lambda_\text{Edd})\lesssim
10^{-2}$ than the typical AGN value. We expected the lower accretion rate sources that suffer from
neither host galaxy dilution nor obscuration to have Radiatively Inefficient Flow (RIAF) in their
accretion disk. Finally, nine sources have been identified to be most likely host the RIAF disk.

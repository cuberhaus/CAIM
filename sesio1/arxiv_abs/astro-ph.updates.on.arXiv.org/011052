Cluster strong lensing cosmography is a promising probe of the background geometry of the Universe
and several studies have emerged, thanks to the increased quality of observations using space and
ground-based telescopes. For the first time, we use a sample of five cluster strong lenses to measure
the values of cosmological parameters and combine them with those from classical probes. In order
to assess the degeneracies and the effectiveness of strong-lensing cosmography in constraining
the background geometry of the Universe, we adopt four cosmological scenarios. We find good constraining
power on the total matter density of the Universe ($\Omega_{\rm m}$) and the equation of state of
the dark energy parameter $w$. For a flat $w$CDM cosmology, we find $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.30_{-0.11}^{+0.09}$
and $w=-1.12_{-0.32}^{+0.17}$ from strong lensing only. Interestingly, we show that the constraints
from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) are improved by factors of 2.5 and 4.0 on $\Omega_{\rm
m}$ and $w$, respectively, when combined with our posterior distributions in this cosmological
model. In a scenario where the equation of state of dark energy evolves with redshift, the strong
lensing constraints are compatible with a cosmological constant (i.e. $w=-1$). In a curved cosmology,
our strong lensing analyses can accommodate a large range of values for the curvature of the Universe
of $\Omega_{\rm k}=0.28_{-0.21}^{+0.16}$. In all cosmological scenarios, we show that our strong
lensing constraints are complementary and in good agreement with measurements from the CMB, baryon
acoustic oscillations and Type Ia supernovae. Our results show that cluster strong lensing cosmography
is a potentially powerful probe to be included in the cosmological analyses of future surveys.

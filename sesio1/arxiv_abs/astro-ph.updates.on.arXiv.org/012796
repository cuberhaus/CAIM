The star formation history of a galaxy is modulated by a plethora of internal processes and environmental
conditions. The details of how these evolve and couple together is not fully understood yet. In this
work, we study the effects that galaxy mergers and morphological transformations have on setting
different modes of star formation at galactic scales and across cosmic time. We monitor the global
properties of VINTERGATAN, a 20 pc resolution cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-type
galaxy. Between redshifts 1 and 5, we find that major mergers trigger multiple starburst episodes,
corresponding to a tenfold drop of the gas depletion time down to 100 Myr. Bursty star formation is
enabled by the emergence of a galactic disc, when the rotational velocity of gas starts to dominate
over its velocity dispersion. Coherent motions of gas then outweigh disordered ones, such that
the galaxy responds to merger-induced forcings by redistributing large amounts of gas towards
high densities. As a result, the overall star formation rate is enhanced with an associated decrease
in the depletion time. Before redshift 5, mergers are expected to be even more frequent. However,
a more turbulent interstellar medium, is incapable of reacting in such a collective manner so as
to spark rapid star formation. Thus, a constant long depletion time of 1 Gyr is kept, along with a low,
but gradually increasing star formation rate. After the last major merger at redshift 1, VINTERGATAN
spends the next 8 Gyr evolving secularly. It has a settled and adiabatically growing disc, and a constant
star formation rate with gas depletion times of 1-2 Gyr. Our results are compatible with the observed
rapid transition between different modes of star formation when galaxies leave the main sequence.

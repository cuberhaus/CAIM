Results from the TESS mission showed that previous studies strngly underestimated the number of
slow rotators, revealing the importance of studying those asteroids. For most slowly rotating
asteroids (P > 12), no spin and shape model is available because of observation selection effects.
This hampers determination of their thermal parameters and accurate sizes. We continue our campaign
in minimising selection effects among main belt asteroids. Our targets are slow rotators with low
light-curve amplitudes. The goal is to provide their scaled spin and shape models together with
thermal inertia, albedo, and surface roughness to complete the statistics. Rich multi-apparition
datasets of dense light curves are supplemented with data from Kepler and TESS. In addition to data
in the visible range, we also use thermal data from infrared space observatories (IRAS, Akari and
WISE) in a combined optimisation process using the Convex Inversion Thermophysical Model (CITPM).
This novel method has so far been applied to only a few targets, and in this work we further validate
the method. We present the models of 16 slow rotators. All provide good fits to both thermal and visible
data. The obtained sizes are on average accurate at the 5% precision, with diameters in the range
from 25 to 145 km. The rotation periods of our targets range from 11 to 59 hours, and the thermal inertia
covers a wide range of values, from 2 to <400 SI units, not showing any correlation with the period.
With this work we increase the sample of slow rotators with reliable spin and shape models and known
thermal inertia by 40%. The thermal inertia values of our sample do not display a previously suggested
increasing trend with rotation period, which might be due to their small skin depth.

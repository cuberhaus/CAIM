The ultraviolet (UV) to sub-millimetre (submm) spectral energy distribution of galaxies can be
roughly divided into two sections: the stellar emission (attenuated by dust) at UV to near-infrared
wavelengths and dust emission at longer wavelengths. In Dobbels et al. (2020), we show that these
two sections are strongly related, and we can predict the global dust properties from the integrated
UV to mid-infrared emission with the help of machine learning techniques. We investigate if these
machine learning techniques can also be extended to resolved scales. Our aim is to predict resolved
maps of the specific dust luminosity, specific dust mass, and dust temperature starting from a set
of surface brightness images from UV to mid-infrared wavelengths. We used a selection of nearby
galaxies retrieved from the DustPedia sample, in addition to M31 and M33. These were convolved and
resampled to a range of pixel sizes, ranging from 150 pc to 3 kpc. We trained a random forest model which
considers each pixel individually. We find that the predictions work well on resolved scales, with
the dust mass and temperature having a similar root mean square error as on global scales (0.32 dex
and 3.15 K on 18" scales respectively), and the dust luminosity being noticeably better (0.11 dex).
We find no significant dependence on the pixel scale. Predictions on individual galaxies can be
biased, and we find that about two-thirds of the scatter can be attributed to scatter between galaxies
(rather than within galaxies). A machine learning approach can be used to create dust maps, with
its resolution being only limited to the input bands, thus achieving a higher resolution than Herschel.
These dust maps can be used to improve global estimates of dust properties, they can lead to a better
estimate of dust attenuation, and they can be used as a constraint on cosmological simulations that
trace dust.

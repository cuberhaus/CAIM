The small-scale moving intensity enhancements remotely observed in the extreme ultraviolet images
of the solar active regions, which we refer to as active region moving campfires (ARMCs), are related
to local plasma temperature and/or density enhancements. Their dynamics is driven by the physical
processes in the entire coronal plasma. Our previous study of ARMCs indicates that they have characteristic
velocities at around the background sound speed. The main goal of our work is to carry out a simultaneous
analysis of EUV images from two observational missions, SDO/AIA and Hi-C 2.1. The aims of the performed
cross-validating analysis of both SDO/AIA and Hi-C 2.1 data were to reveal how the observed moving
features are distributed over the studied active region, AR12712, test the existence of different
groups of ARMCs with distinct physical characteristics. We use the statistical model of intensity
centroid convergence and tracking that was developed in our previous paper. Furthermore, a Gaussian
mixture model fit of the observed complex of moving ARMCs is elaborated to reveal the existence of
distinct ARMC groups and to study the physical characteristics of these different groups. In data
from the 171\AA, 193\AA\ and 211\AA\ channels of SDO/AIA, we identified several groups of ARMCs
with respect to both blob intensity and velocity profiles. The existence of such groups is confirmed
by the cross-validation of the 172\AA\ data sets from Hi-C 2.1. The ARMCs studied in this paper have
characteristic velocities in the range of the typical sound speeds in coronal loops. Hence, these
moving objects differ from the well-known rapid Alfv\'enic velocity jets from magnetic reconnection
sites. This is also proven by the fact that ARMCs propagate along the active region magnetic structure
(strands). The nature of the discovered statistical grouping of the ARMC events is not known.

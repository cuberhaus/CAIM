Astronomers have yet to establish whether high-mass protostars form from high-mass prestellar
cores, similar to their lower-mass counterparts, or from lower-mass fragments at the heart of a
pre-protostellar cluster undergoing large-scale collapse. Part of the uncertainty is due to a
shortage of envelope structure data on protostars of a few tens of solar masses, where we expect to
see a transition from intermediate-mass star formation to the high-mass process. We sought to derive
the masses, luminosities, and envelope density profiles for eight sources in Cygnus-X, whose mass
estimates in the literature placed them in the sampling gap. Combining these sources with similarly
evolved sources in the literature enabled us to perform a meta-analysis of protostellar envelope
parameters over six decades in source luminosity. We performed spectral energy distribution (SED)
fitting on archival broadband photometric continuum data from 1.2 to 850 $\mu$m, to derive bolometric
luminosities for our eight sources plus initial mass and radius estimates for modelling density
and temperature profiles with the radiative transfer package Transphere. The envelope masses,
densities at 1000 AU, outer envelope radii, and density power law indices as functions of bolometric
luminosity all follow established trends in the literature spanning six decades in luminosity.
Most of our sources occupy an intermediate to moderately high range of masses and luminosities,
which helps to more firmly establish the continuity between low- and high-mass star formation mechanisms.
Our density power law indices are consistent with observed values in literature, which show no discernible
trends with luminosity. Finally, we show that the trends in all of the envelope parameters for high-mass
protostars are statistically indistinguishable from trends in the same variables for low- and
intermediate-mass protostars.

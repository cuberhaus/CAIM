(Abridged) We explored 18 clusters from LoCuSS at z~0.2 with ACReS spectra of ~1800 cluster members
at R<R200 in a mass-complete sample. The metallicities of SF cluster galaxies with R<R200 were found
to be enhanced with respect to the MZR of coeval field SF galaxies. This metallicity enhancement
is limited to lower-mass satellites of the 9 clusters with a passive BCG. Many of the SF galaxies with
enhanced metallicities are found in the core regions of the phase-space diagram expected for virialized
populations. We find a higher fraction of higher mass SF galaxies at R<R500 in clusters with active
BCGs compared to clusters with passive BCGs, a signal for galactic conformity. In contrast, much
higher fractions of AGNs and especially recently quenched galaxies (RQGs) at R<R500 are found in
clusters with passive BCGs in comparison to clusters with active BCGs. We deduce that strangulation
is initiated in clusters with passive BCGs when SF satellite galaxies pass R200, by stopping the
pristine gas inflow which would otherwise dilute the ISM and would maintain their metallicities
at values similar to those of field galaxies at similar redshifts. For galaxies with higher masses
which survived to be SF when travelling to R<R500 of clusters with passive BCGs, we assume that they
suffer a rapid quenching of star formation, likely due to AGNs triggered by the increasing RPS toward
the cluster center, which can compress the gas and fuel AGNs; these AGNs can rapidly quench and maintain
quenched satellite galaxies. On the other hand, we found that surviving SF massive satellite galaxies
around active BCGs are less affected by environment when they enter R<R500, since we observe R<R500
SF galaxies with higher masses and with metallicities typical of coeval field galaxies. This observed
galactic conformity implies that active BCGs must maintain their activity over timescales of at
least ~1Gyr.

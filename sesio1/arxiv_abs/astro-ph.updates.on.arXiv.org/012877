Simplified assumptions about the thermodynamics of the electrons are normally employed in general-relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of accretion onto black holes. To counter this, we have
developed a self-consistent approach to study magnetised and radiatively cooled two-temperature
accretion flows around a Kerr black hole in two spatial dimensions. The approach includes several
heating processes, radiative cooling, and a coupling between the electrons and the ions via Coulomb
interaction. We test our approach by performing axisymmetric GRMHD simulations of magnetised
tori accreting onto a Kerr black hole under various astrophysical scenarios. In this way, we find
that the inclusion of the Coulomb interaction and the radiative cooling impacts the thermodynamical
properties of both the ions and electrons, changing significantly the temperature distribution
of the latter. Since the electrons are responsible for the electromagnetic emission from these
accretion flows, our results underline the importance of a two-temperature approach when imaging
these flows. In addition, we find that the accretion rate influences the bulk properties of the flow
and the thermodynamics of the electrons and ions. Interestingly, we observe qualitatively distinct
temperature properties for SANE and MAD accretion modes while maintaining the same accretion rates,
which could help distinguishing MAD and SANE accretion flows via observations. Finally, we propose
two new relations for the temperature ratios of the electrons, ions, and of the gas in terms of the
plasma-$\beta$ parameter. The new relations not only provide a more accurate description of the
thermodynamics of the accretion flow in all relevant regimes, but they also represent a simple and
effective approach to treat two-temperature accretion flows on supermassive black holes such
as Sgr A* and M\,87*.

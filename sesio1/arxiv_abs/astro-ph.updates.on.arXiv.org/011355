Directly characterising the first generations of stars in distant galaxies is a key quest of observational
cosmology. Here, we present a case study of ID53 at z = 4.77, the UV-brightest (yet L*) star-forming
galaxy at z > 3 in the MUSE eXtremely Deep Field with a mass of ~$10^9$ M$_{\odot}$. Besides very strong
Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) emission, we clearly detect the (stellar) continuum and a NV P-Cygni
feature, interstellar absorption, fine-structure emission and nebular CIV emission-lines in
the 140 hr spectrum. Continuum emission from spatially resolved components in the HST data are blended
in the MUSE data, but we show that the nebular CIV emission originates from a subcomponent of the galaxy.
The UV spectrum can be fit with recent BPASS stellar population models combined with single burst
or continuous star formation histories (SFHs), a standard initial mass function and attenuation
law. Models with a young age and low metallicity (log10(age/yr)=6.5-7.6 and [Z/H]=-2.15 to -1.15)
are preferred. The intrinsic H$\alpha$ luminosity of the best-fit models is an order of magnitude
higher than the H$\alpha$ luminosity inferred from Spitzer/IRAC data, which either suggests a
high escape fraction of ionising photons, a high relative nebular to stellar dust attenuation or
a complex star formation history. The metallicity appears lower than the metallicity in more massive
galaxies at z = 3 - 5, consistent with the picture in which younger galaxies have lower metallicities.
Such chemical immaturity likely facilitates Ly$\alpha$ escape, explaining why the Ly$\alpha$
equivalent width anti-correlates with stellar metallicity. Finally, we stress that uncertainties
in SFHs impose a challenge for future inferences of the stellar metallicity of young galaxies. This
highlights the need for joint (spatially resolved) analyses of stellar spectra and photo-ionisation
models.

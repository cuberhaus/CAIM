Numerical simulations are at the center of predicting the space debris environment of the upcoming
decades. In light of debris generating events, such as continued anti-satellite weapon tests and
planned mega-constellations, accurate predictions of the space debris environment are critical
to ensure the long-term sustainability of critical satellite orbits. Given the computational
complexity of accurate long-term trajectory propagation for a large number of particles, numerical
models usually rely on Monte-Carlo approaches for stochastic conjunction assessment. On the other
hand, deterministic methods bear the promise of higher accuracy and can serve to validate stochastic
approaches. However, they pose a substantial challenge to computational feasibility. In this
work, we present the architecture and proof of concept results for a numerical simulation capable
of modeling the long term debris evolution over decades with a deterministic conjunction tracking
model. For the simulation, we developed an efficient propagator in modern C++ accounting for Earth's
gravitational anomalies, solar radiation pressure, and atmospheric drag. We utilized AutoPAS,
a sophisticated particle container, which automatically selects the most efficient data structures
and algorithms. We present results from a simulation of 16 024 particles in low-Earth orbit over
20 years. Overall, conjunctions are tracked for predicted collisions and close encounters to allow
a detailed study of both. We analyze the runtime and computational cost of the simulation in detail.
In summary, the obtained results show that modern computational tools finally enable deterministic
conjunction tracking and can serve to validate prior results and build higher-fidelity numerical
simulations of the long-term debris environment.

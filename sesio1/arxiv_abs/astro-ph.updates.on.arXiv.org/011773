Super-Earths and sub-Neptunes have been found simultaneously in multiplanetary systems, suggesting
that they are appropriate to study composition and formation within the same environment. We perform
a homogeneous interior structure analysis of five multiplanetary systems to explore the compositional
trends and its relation with planet formation. For K2-138, we present revised masses and stellar
host chemical abundances to improve the constraints on the planetary interior. We conduct a line-by-line
differential spectroscopic analysis on the stellar spectra to obtain its chemical abundances
and the planetary parameters. We select multiplanetary systems with five or more low-mass planets
that have both mass and radius data available. We carry out a homogeneous interior structure analysis
on the systems K2-138, TOI-178, Kepler-11, Kepler-102 and Kepler-80 and estimate the volatile
mass fraction of their planets assuming a volatile layer constituted of water in steam and supercritical
phases. Our interior-atmosphere model takes into account the effects of irradiation on the surface
conditions. K2-138 inner planets present an increasing volatile mass fraction with distance from
its host star, while the outer planets present an approximately constant water content. This is
similar to the trend observed in TRAPPIST-1 in a previous analysis with the same interior-atmosphere
model. The Kepler-102 system could potentially present this trend. In all multiplanetary systems,
the low volatile mass fraction of the inner planets could be due to atmospheric escape while the higher
volatile mass fraction of the outer planets can be the result of accretion of ice-rich material in
the vicinity of the ice line with later inward migration. Kepler-102 and Kepler-80 present inner
planets with high core mass fractions which could be due to mantle evaporation, impacts or formation
in the vicinity of rocklines.

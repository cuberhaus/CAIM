Using $\it{Herschel}$-SPIRE imaging and the Canada-France Imaging Survey (CFIS) Low Surface
Brightness data products from the Ultraviolet Near-Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS),
we present a cross-correlation between the cosmic infrared background and cosmic optical background
fluctuations. With a combined sky area of $91\,{\rm deg}^2$ and a minimum resolved scale of $18\,$arcsec,
the cross-spectrum is measured for two cases: all galaxies are kept in the images; or all individually-detected
galaxies are masked to produce `background' maps. We report the detection of the cross-correlation
signal at $\gtrsim 22\,\sigma$ ($\gtrsim 18\,\sigma$ for the background map). The part of the optical
brightness variations that are correlated with the submm emission translates to an rms brightness
of $\simeq 32.5\,{\rm mag}\,{\rm arcsec}^{-2}$ in the $r$ band, a level normally unreachable for
individual sources. A critical issue is determining what fraction of the cross-power spectrum
might be caused by emission from Galactic cirrus. For one of the fields, the Galactic contamination
is approximately a factor of 10 higher than the extragalactic signal, with the contamination being
estimated using a linear regression from several external survey maps; however, for the other fields,
the contamination is typically around 20 per cent. An additional discriminant is that the cross-power
spectrum is of the approximate form $P(k)\propto 1/k$, much shallower than that of Galactic cirrus.
We interpret the results in a halo-model framework, which shows good agreement with independent
measurements for the scalings of star-formation rates in galaxies. The approach presented in this
study holds great promise for future surveys such as FYST/CCAT-prime combined with ${\it Euclid}$
or the Vera Rubin Observatory (LSST), which will enable a detailed exploration of the evolution
of star formation in galaxies.

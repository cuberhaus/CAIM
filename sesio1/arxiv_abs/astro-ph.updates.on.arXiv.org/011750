The difference from 4 to 6 $\sigma$ in the Hubble constant ($H_0$) between the values observed with
the local (Cepheids and Supernovae Ia, SNe Ia) and the high-z probes (CMB obtained by the Planck data)
still challenges the astrophysics and cosmology community. Previous analysis by Dainotti et al.
(2021) has shown that there is an evolution in the Hubble constant that scales as $f(z)=\mathcal{H}_{0}/(1+z)^{\eta}$,
where $\mathcal{H}_0$ is $H_{0}(z=0)$ and $\eta$ is the evolutionary parameter. Here, we investigate
if this evolution still holds by using the SNe Ia gathered in the Pantheon sample and the BAOs. We assume
$H_{0}=70 \textrm{km s}^{-1}\textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ as the local value and divide the Pantheon into
3 bins ordered in increasing values of redshift. Similar to Dainotti et al. (2021) but varying two
cosmological parameters contemporaneously ($H_0$, $\Omega_{0m}$ in the $\Lambda$CDM model
and $H_0$, $w_a$ in the $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM model), for each bin we implement a MCMC analysis obtaining
the value of $H_0$ $[...]$. Subsequently, the values of $H_0$ are fitted with the model $f(z)$. Our
results show that a decreasing trend with $\eta \sim10^{-2}$ is still visible in this sample. The
$\eta$ coefficient reaches zero in 2.0 $\sigma$ for the $\Lambda$CDM model up to 5.8 $\sigma$ for
$w_{0}w_{a}$CDM model. This trend, if not due to statistical fluctuations, could be explained
through a hidden astrophysical bias, such as the effect of stretch evolution, or it requires new
theoretical models, a possible proposition is the modified gravity theories, $f(R)$ $[...]$.
This work is also a preparatory to understand how the combined probes still show an evolution of the
$H_0$ by redshift and what is the current status of simulations on GRB cosmology to obtain the uncertainties
on the $\Omega_{0m}$ comparable with the ones achieved through SNe Ia.

Relativistic plasmas are central to the study of black hole accretion, jet physics, neutron star
mergers, and compact object magnetospheres. Despite the need to accurately capture the dynamics
of these plasmas and the implications for relativistic transients, their fluid modeling is typically
done using a number of (overly) simplifying assumptions, which do not hold in general. This is especially
true when the mean free path in the plasma is large compared to the system size, and kinetic effects
start to become important. Going beyond common approaches used in the literature, we describe a
fully relativistic covariant 14-moment based two-fluid system appropriate for the study of electron-ion
or electron-positron plasmas. This generalized Israel-Stewart-like system of equations of motion
is obtained directly from the relativistic Boltzmann-Vlasov equation. Crucially, this new formulation
can account for non-ideal effects, such as anisotropic pressures and heat fluxes. We show that a
relativistic two-fluid plasma can be recast as a single fluid coupled to electromagnetic fields
with (potentially large) out-of-equilibrium corrections. In particular, we keep all electron
degrees of freedom, which provide self-consistent evolution equations for electron temperature
and momentum. The equations outlined in this paper are able to capture the full two-fluid character
of collisionless plasmas found in black hole accretion and flaring processes around compact objects,
as well Braginskii-like two-fluid magnetohydrodynamics applicable to weakly collisional plasmas
inside accretion disks. This new formulation will be instrumental in the construction of a large
class of next-generation simulations of relativistic transient phenomena produced around black
holes and neutron stars.

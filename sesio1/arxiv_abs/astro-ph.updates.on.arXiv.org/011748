The cold dark matter (CDM) scenario predicts that galactic halos should host a huge amount of subhalos
possibly as light as or lighter than planets, depending on the nature of dark matter. Predicting
their abundance and distribution on such small scales has important implications for dark matter
searches and searches for subhalos themselves, which could provide a decisive test of the CDM paradigm.
A major difficulty in subhalo population model building is to account for the gravitational stripping
induced by baryons, which strongly impact on the overall dynamics within the scale radii of galaxies.
In this paper, we focus on these "baryonic" tides from analytical perspectives, summarizing previous
work on galactic disk shocking, and thoroughly revisiting the impact of individual encounters
with stars. For the latter, we go beyond the reference calculation of Gerhard and Fall (1983) to deal
with penetrative encounters, and provide new analytical results. Based upon a full statistical
analysis of subhalo energy change during multiple stellar encounters possibly occurring during
disk crossing, we show how subhalos lighter than $\sim 1$~M$_\odot$ are very efficiently pruned
by stellar encounters, and how that modifies their mass function in a stellar environment. If reasonably
resilient, surviving subhalos have lost all their mass but the inner cusp, with a tidal mass function
strongly departing from the cosmological one; otherwise, their number density can drop by an order
of magnitude at the solar position in the Milky Way with respect to disk-shocking effects only. For
illustration, we integrate these results into our analytical subhalo population model. They can
easily be incorporated to any other analytical or numerical approach. This study complements those
using cosmological simulations, which cannot resolve dark matter subhalos on such small scales.

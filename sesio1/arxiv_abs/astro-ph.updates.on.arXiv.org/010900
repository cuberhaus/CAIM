The multiplicity of stars, down to the substellar regime, is a parameter of fundamental importance
for stellar formation, evolution, and planetology. The census of multiple stars in the solar neighborhood
is however incomplete. The presence of a companion in orbit around a star affects its proper motion.
We aim at detecting companions of Hipparcos stars from the proper motion anomaly (PMa) they induce
on their host star, that is, the difference between their long-term Hipparcos-Gaia and short-term
Gaia proper motion vectors. We also aim at detecting resolved, gravitationally bound companions
of the Hipparcos stars (117,955 stars), and of the Gaia EDR3 stars closer than 100 pc (542,232 stars).
Using the Hipparcos and EDR3 data, we revise the PMa catalog for the Hipparcos stars. To identify
gravitationally bound visual companions, we search the EDR3 catalog for common proper motion (CPM)
candidates. The detection of tangential velocity anomalies with a median accuracy of 26 cm/s per
parsec of distance is demonstrated with the EDR3. This improvement by a factor 2.5 compared to the
DR2 results in detection limits well into the planetary mass regime for many targets. We identify
37,515 Hipparcos stars with a PMa S/N>3, that is, a fraction of 32% (30% in the DR2) and 12,914 (11%)
hosting CPM bound candidate companions. Including the RUWE>1.4 as an additional indicator, 50,720
stars of the Hipparcos catalog (43%) exhibit at least one signal of binarity. Among the EDR3 stars
located within 100 pc, we find CPM bound candidate companions for 39,490 stars (7.3% of the sample).
The combination of the PMa, CPM and RUWE indicators significantly improves the exhaustivity of
the multiplicity survey. The detection of CPM companions of very bright stars provides a useful
proxy to estimate their distance with a higher accuracy than Hipparcos.

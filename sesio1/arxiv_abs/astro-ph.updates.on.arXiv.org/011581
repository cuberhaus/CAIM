The Galactic globular cluster system is incomplete, especially in the low latitude regions of the
Galactic bulge and disk. We report the physical characterization of twelve star clusters in the
Milky Way, most of which are explored here for the first time. Our aim is determining their main physical
parameters, such as reddening and extinction, metallicity, age, total luminosity, mean cluster
proper motions (PMs), distances, in order to unveil their physical nature. We study the clusters
using optical and near-infrared (NIR) datasets. We use the Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) PMs in
order to perform a PM-decontamination procedure and build final catalogues. We match the Gaia EDR3
with the VISTA Variables in the V\'ia L\'actea extended (VVVX) survey and Two Micron All Sky survey
(2MASS) in the NIR, in order to construct complete colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) and investigate
the clusters properties. The extinctions are evaluated using existing reddening maps, spanning
$0.09\lesssim A_{Ks}\lesssim 0.86$ mag and $0.89 \lesssim A_{G}\lesssim 4.72$ mag in the NIR and
optical, respectively. We obtain their heliocentric distances, that range from about 4 to 20 kpc,
placing these clusters at $3\lesssim R_{G}\lesssim 14$ kpc from the Galactic centre. The best PARSEC
isochrone fit yields a metallicity range of $-1.8<$[Fe/H]$<+0.3$ and an approximative age range
of $2<$Age$<14$ Gyr. We find that all clusters have low-luminosities, with $-6.9<M_{V}<-3.5$
mag. Based on our photometric analysis, we confirm the OC nature for Kronberger100, while we classify
Patchick125 as a metal-poor GC, Ferrero54 as a metal-rich GC, and ESO92-18 as a possible old OC or
young GC. The classification as GC candidates is also suggested for Kronberger99, Patchick122,
Patchick126, Riddle15, FSR190 and Gaia2. We also conclude that Kronberger119 and Kronberger143
might be either old OCs or young GCs.

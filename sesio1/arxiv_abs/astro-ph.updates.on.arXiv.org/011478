We provide stability estimates, obtained by implementing the Nekhoroshev theorem, in reference
to the orbital motion of a small body (satellite or space debris) around the Earth. We consider a Hamiltonian
model, averaged over fast angles, including the $J_2$ geopotential term as well as third-body perturbations
due to Sun and Moon. We discuss how to bring the Hamiltonian into a form suitable for the implementation
of the Nekhoroshev theorem in the version given by P\"oschel(1993) for the `non-resonant' regime.
The manipulation of the Hamiltonian includes i) averaging over fast angles, ii) a suitable expansion
around reference values for the orbit's eccentricity and inclination, and iii) a preliminary normalization
allowing to eliminate particular terms whose existence is due to the non-zero inclination of the
invariant plane of secular motions known as the `Laplace plane'. After bringing the Hamiltonian
to a suitable form, we examine the domain of applicability of the theorem in the action space, translating
the result in the space of physical elements. We find that the necessary conditions for the theorem
to hold are fulfilled in some non-zero measure domains in the eccentricity and inclination plane
(e, i) for a body's orbital altitude (semi-major axis) up to about 20000 km. For altitudes around
11000 km we obtain stability times of the order of several thousands of years in domains covering
nearly all eccentricities and inclinations of interest in applications of the satellite problem,
except for narrow zones around some so-called `inclination-dependent' resonances. On the other
hand, the domains of Nekhoroshev stability recovered by the present method shrink in size as the
semi-major axis a increases (and the corresponding Nekhoroshev times reduce to hundreds of years),
while the stability domains practically all vanish for a > 20000 km.

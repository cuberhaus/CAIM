Planetary Climate Models (PCMs) are developed to explore planetary climates other than the Earth.
Therefore, the methods implemented need to be suitable for a large diversity of conditions. Every
planet with a significant atmosphere has condensible cycles (e.g., hydrological cycle), which
can play an essential role in the planet's appearance and environment. We must accurately represent
a condensible cycle in our planet simulations to build a powerful planetary climate predictor.
OASIS is a 3D PCM capable of self-consistently representing the main physical processes that drive
a planet's environment. In this work, we improve the representation of mass transport in OASIS,
which is the first step towards a complete and flexible implementation of a condensible cycle. We
implement an upwind-biased scheme on a piece-wise linear approximation with a flux-limiter to
solve the mass transport equation. We first benchmark the new scheme on a 2D problem that confirms
the superior properties of the new method over the central finite-volume method in terms of performance,
accuracy and shape-preserving mass distribution. Due to the new scheme's less dispersive nature,
we do not have to apply any unphysical diffusion to maintain the model stable. OASIS includes the
new improved solver in the total mass and the tracers (e.g., clouds/hazes and individual gas chemical
species) transport. We couple the new formulation with physical schemes and validate the new code
on two 3D simulations of an ocean Earth-like planet and an ocean tidally-locked planet. The new OASIS
simulations are robust and do not show any known problems from the dynamics-physics coupling. We
show that the two simulations capture the main characteristics of ocean planet atmospheres and
are easy to set up. We propose these two simulations to be the first standard benchmark tests for models
built to explore moist planetary environments.

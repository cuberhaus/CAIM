Dating stars is a major challenge with a deep impact on many astrophysical fields. One of the most
promising techniques for this is using chemical abundances. Recent space- and ground-based facilities
have improved the quantity of stars with accurate observations. This has opened the door for using
Bayesian inference tools to maximise the information we can extract from them. Our aim is to present
accurate and reliable stellar age estimates of FGK stars using chemical abundances and stellar
parameters. We used one of the most flexible Bayesian inference techniques (hierarchical Bayesian
models) to exceed current possibilities in the use of chemical abundances for stellar dating. Our
model is a data-driven model. We used a training set that has been presented in the literature with
ages estimated with isochrones and accurate stellar abundances and general characteristics.
The core of the model is a prescription of certain abundance ratios as linear combinations of stellar
properties including age. We gathered four different testing sets to assess the accuracy, precision,
and limits of our model. We also trained a model using chemical abundances alone. We found that our
age estimates and those coming from asteroseismology, other accurate sources, and also with ten
Gaia benchmark stars agree well. The mean absolute difference of our estimates compared with those
used as reference is 0.9 Ga, with a mean difference of 0.01 Ga. When using open clusters, we reached
a very good agreement for Hyades, NGC 2632, Ruprecht 147, and IC4651. We also found outliers that
are a reflection of chemical peculiarities and/or stars at the limit of the validity ranges of the
training set. The model that only uses chemical abundances shows slightly worse mean absolute difference
(1.18 Ga) and mean difference (-0.12 Ga).

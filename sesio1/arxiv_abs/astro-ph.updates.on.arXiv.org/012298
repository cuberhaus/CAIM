The X-ray emission in BL Lac objects is believed to be dominated by synchrotron emission from their
relativistic jets. However, when the jet emission is not strong, one could expect signatures of
X-ray emission from inverse Compton scattering of accretion disc photons by the corona. Moreover,
the observed X-ray variability can also originate in the disc, and gets propagated and amplified
by the jet. Here, we present results on the BL Lac object Mrk 421 using the NuSTAR data acquired during
2017 when the source was in a moderate X-ray brightness state. For comparison with high jet activity,
we also considered one epoch data in April 2013 during a very high X-ray brightness state. Our aim
is to explore the possibility of the signature of accretion disc emission in the overall X-ray emission
from Mrk 421. The spectral fitting of the data using the two component advective flow model shows
gives (a) the size of the dynamic corona at the base of the jet from ~28 to 10 r$_s$, (b) the disc mass
accretion rate from 0.021 to 0.051 $\dot M_{\rm Edd}$, (c) the halo mass accretion rate from 0.22
to 0.35 $\dot M_{\rm Edd}$, and (d) the viscosity parameter of the Keplerian accretion disc from
0.18 $-$ 0.25. In the assumed model, the total flux, disc and jet flux correlate with the radio flux
observed during these epochs. We conclude that the spectra of all the epochs of Mrk 421 in 2017 are
well described by the accretion disc based two component advective flow model. The estimated disc
and jet flux relations with radio flux show that accretion disc can contribute to the observed X-ray
emission, when X-ray data (that covers a small portion of the broad band spectral energy distribution
of Mrk 421) is considered in isolation. However, the present disc based models are disfavoured with
respect to the relativistic jet models when considering the X-ray data in conjunction with data
at other wavelengths.

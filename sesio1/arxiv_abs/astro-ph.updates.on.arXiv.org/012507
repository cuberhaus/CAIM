Wind-fed supergiant X-ray binaries are precious laboratories not only to study accretion under
extreme gravity and magnetic field conditions, but also to probe still highly debated properties
of massive star winds. These includes the so-called clumps, originated from the inherent instability
of line driven winds, and larger structures. In this paper, we report on the results of the last (and
not yet published) monitoring campaigns that our group has been carrying out since 2007 with both
XMM-Newton and the Swift Neil Gehrels observatory. Data collected with the EPIC cameras on-board
XMM-Newton allow us to carry out a detailed hardness ratio-resolved spectral analysis that can
be used as an efficient way to detect spectral variations associated to the presence of clumps. Long-term
observations with the XRT on-board Swift, evenly sampling the X-ray emission of supergiant X-ray
binaries over many different orbital cycles, are exploited to look for the presence of large scale
structures in the medium surrounding the compact objects. The results reported in this paper represent
the outcomes of the concluded observational campaigns we carried out on the supergiant X-ray binaries
4U 1907+09, IGR J16393-4643, IGR J19140+0951, and XTE J1855-026, as well as the supergiant fast
X-ray transients IGR J17503-2636, IGR J18410-0535, and IGR J11215-5952. All results are discussed
in the context of wind-fed supergiant X-ray binaries and shall ideally serve to optimally shape
the next observational campaigns aimed at sources in the same classes. We show in one of the paper
appendices that IGR J17315-3221, preliminary classified in the literature as a possible supergiant
X-ray binary discovered by INTEGRAL, is the product of a data analysis artifact and should thus be
disregarded for future studies.

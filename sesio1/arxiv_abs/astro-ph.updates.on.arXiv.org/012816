We study pre-supernova feedback in a sample of $\sim$ 4700 HII regions in the nearby spiral galaxy
M83, identified on their H$\alpha$ emission. We pectroscopically identify Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars
populating the star-forming regions. For each HII region, we compute the pressure of ionised gas
($P_{\rm ion}$) and the direct radiation pressure ($P_{\rm dir}$) acting in the region, and investigate
how they vary with galactocentric distance, with the physical properties of the region, and with
the pressure of the galactic environment ($P_\mathrm{DE}$). For a subset of $\sim$ 500 regions,
we also investigate the link between the pressure terms and the properties of the cluster population
(age, mass, and LyC flux). We find that $P_{\rm ion}$ dominates over $P_{\rm dir}$ by at least a factor
of 10 on average over the disk. Both pressure terms are strongly enhanced and become almost comparable
in the central starburst region. In the disk ($R \geq 0.15~R_e$), we observe that $P_{\rm dir}$ stays
approximately constant with galactocentric distance. $P_{\rm dir}$ is positively correlated
with an increase in radiation field strength (linked to the negative metallicity gradient in the
galaxy), while it decreases in low extinction regions. $P_{\rm ion}$ decreases constantly for
increasing galactocentric distances. In general, we observe that HII regions near the center are
underpressured with respect to their surroundings, whereas regions in the disk are overpressured
and hence expanding. We find that regions hosting younger clusters or having more mass in young star
clusters have a higher internal pressure, indicating that clustered star formation is likely playing
a dominant role in setting the pressure. Finally, we estimate that only 13 % of HII regions hosting
young clusters and WR stars have $f_{\rm esc} \geq 0$.[Abridged]

The detection and characterization of Earth-like exoplanets is one of the major science drivers
for the next generation of telescopes. Current direct imaging instruments are limited by evolving
non-common path aberrations (NCPAs). The NCPAs must be compensated for by using the science focal-plane
image. A promising sensor is the self-coherent camera (SCC). An SCC modifies the Lyot stop in the
coronagraph to introduce a probe electric field. However, the SCC has a weak probe electric field
due to the requirements on the pinhole separation. A spectrally modulated self-coherent camera
(SM-SCC) is proposed as a solution to the throughput problem. The SM-SCC uses a pinhole with a spectral
filter and a dichroic beam splitter, which creates images with and without the probe electric field.
This allows the pinhole to be placed closer to the pupil edge and increases the throughput. Combining
the SM-SCC with an integral field unit (IFU) can be used to apply more complex modulation patterns
to the pinhole and the Lyot stop. A modulation scheme with at least three spectral channels (e.g.
IFU) can be used to change the pinhole to an arbitrary aperture with higher throughput. Numerical
simulations show that the SM-SCC increases the pinhole throughput by a factor of 32, which increases
the wavefront sensor sensitivity by a factor of 5.7. The SM-SCC reaches a contrast of $1\cdot10^{-9}$
for bright targets in closed-loop control with the presence of photon noise, phase errors, and amplitude
errors. The contrast floor on fainter targets is photon-noise-limited and reaches $1\cdot10^{-7}$.
For bright targets, the SM-SCC-IFU reaches a contrast of $3\cdot10^{-9}$ in closed-loop control
with photon noise, amplitude errors, and phase errors. The SM-SCC is a promising focal-plane wavefront
sensor for systems that use multiband observations, either through integral field spectroscopy
or dual-band imaging.

We analyze the clustering of galaxies using the z=1.006 snapshot of the CosmoDC2 simulation, a high-fidelity
synthetic galaxy catalog designed to validate analysis methods for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope
(LSST). We present sub-percent measurements of the galaxy auto-correlation and galaxy-dark matter
cross correlations in Fourier space and configuration space for a magnitude-limited galaxy sample.
At these levels of precision, the statistical errors of the measurement are comparable to the systematic
effects present in the simulation and measurement procedure; nevertheless, using a hybrid-PT
model, we are able to model non-linear galaxy bias with 0.5% precision up to scales of $k_{\rm max}=
0.5 \ h/{\rm Mpc}$ and $r_{\rm min}= 4 \ {\rm Mpc}/h$. While the linear bias parameter is measured
with 0.01% precision, other bias parameters are determined with considerably weaker constraints
and sometimes bimodal posterior distributions. We compare our fiducial model with lower dimensional
models where the higher-order bias parameters are fixed at their co-evolution values and find that
leaving these parameters free provides significant improvements in our ability to model small
scale information. We also compare bias parameters for galaxy samples defined using different
magnitude bands and find agreement between samples containing equal numbers of galaxies. Finally,
we compare bias parameters between Fourier space and configuration space and find moderate tension
between the two approaches. Although our model is often unable to fit the CosmoDC2 galaxy samples
within the 0.1% precision of our measurements, our results suggest that the hybrid-PT model used
in this analysis is capable of modeling non-linear galaxy bias within the percent level precision
needed for upcoming galaxy surveys.

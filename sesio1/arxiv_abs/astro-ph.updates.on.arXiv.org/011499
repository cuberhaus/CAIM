For the subclass of Horndeski theory of gravity, we investigate the effects of reheating on the predictions
of natural inflation. In the presence of derivative self-interaction of a scalar field and its kinetic
coupling to the Einstein tensor, the gravitational friction to inflaton dynamics is enhanced.
As a result, the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ is suppressed. We place the observational constraints
on a natural inflation model and show that the model is now consistent with the observational data
for some plausible range of the model parameter $\Delta$, mainly due to the suppressed tensor-to-scalar
ratio. To be consistent with the data at the $1\sigma$ ($68\%$ confidence) level, a slightly longer
$N_k\gtrsim60$ duration of inflation than usually assumed is preferred. Since the duration of
inflation, for any specific inflaton potential, is related to reheating parameters, including
the duration $N_{re}$, temperature $T_{re}$, and equation-of-state $\omega_{re}$ parameter
during reheating, we imposed the effects of reheating to the inflationary predictions to put further
constraints. The results show that the duration of inflation $N_k$ is affected by considerations
of reheating, mainly by the $\omega_{re}$ and $T_{re}$ parameters. If reheating occurs instantaneously
for which $N_{re}=0$ and $\omega_{re}=1/3$, the duration of inflation is estimated to be $N_k\simeq57$,
where the exact value is less sensitive to the model parameter $\Delta$ compatible with the CMB data.
The duration of inflation is longer (or shorter) than $N_k\simeq57$ for the equation of state larger
(or smaller) than 1/3 hence $N_{re}\neq0$. The maximum temperature at the end of reheating is $T_{re}^\text{max}\simeq3\times
10^{15}$ GeV, which corresponds to the instantaneous reheating. The low reheating temperature,
as low as a few MeV, is also possible when $\omega_{re}$ is closer to $1/3$.

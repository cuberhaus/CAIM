We explore the validity of the recently reported fundamental plane (FP) relation of gamma-ray pulsars
using 190 pulsars included in the latest 4FGL-DR3 catalog. This sample number is more than twice
as large as that of the original study. The FP relation incorporates 4 parameters, i.e., the spin-down
power, $\dot{\mathcal{E}}$, the surface magnetic field, $B_{\star}$, the total gamma-ray luminosity,
$L_{\gamma}$, and a spectral cutoff energy, $\epsilon_{\rm cut}$. The derivation of $\epsilon_{\rm
cut}$ is the most intriguing one because $\epsilon_{\rm cut}$ depends on the proper interpretation
of the available phase-averaged spectra. We construct synthetic phase-averaged spectra, guided
by the few existing phase-resolved ones, to find that the best fit cutoff energy, $\epsilon_{\rm
c1}$, corresponding to a purely exponential cutoff (plus a power law) spectral form, is the parameter
that optimally probes the maximum cutoff energy of the emission that originates from the core of
the dissipative region, i.e., the equatorial current sheet. Computing this parameter for the 190
4FGL pulsars, we find that the resulting FP relation, i.e. the gamma-ray luminosity in terms of the
other observables, reads $L_{\gamma}=10^{14.3\pm 1.3}(\epsilon_{\rm c1}/{\rm MeV})^{1.39\pm0.17}(B_{\star}/{\rm
G})^{0.12\pm 0.03}(\dot{\mathcal{E}}/{\rm erg\;s^{-1}})^{0.39\pm 0.05}{\rm ~erg\;s^{-1}}$;
this is in good agreement with both the empirical relation reported by Kalapotharakos et al. (2019)
and the theoretically predicted relation for curvature radiation. Finally, we revisit the radiation
reaction limited condition, to find it is a sufficient but not necessary condition for the theoretical
derivation of the FP relation. However, the assumption of the radiation reaction limited acceleration
reveals the underlying accelerating electric field component and its scaling with $\dot{\mathcal{E}}$.

Recent rapid progress in neutron-star (NS) observations offers great potential to constrain the
properties of strongly interacting matter under the most extreme conditions. In order to fully
exploit the current observational inputs and to study the impact of future observations of NS masses,
radii, and tidal deformabilities, we analyze a large ensemble of randomly generated viable NS-matter
equations of state (EoSs) and the corresponding rotating stellar structures. We discuss the compatibility
and impact of various hypotheses and measurements on the EoS, including those involving the merger
product of the gravitational-wave (GW) event GW170817, the binary merger components in GW190814,
and radius measurements of the pulsar PSR J0740+6620. We obtain an upper limit for the dimensionless
spin of a rigidly rotating NS, $|\chi| < 0.81$, an upper limit for the compactness of a NS, $GM/(Rc^2)
< 0.33$, and find that the conservative hypothesis that the remnant in GW170817 ultimately collapsed
to a black hole strongly constrains the EoS and the maximal mass of NSs, implying $M_\text{TOV} <
2.53 M_\odot$ (or $M_\text{TOV} < 2.19 M_\odot$ if we assume that a hypermassive NS was created).
Additionally, we derive a novel lower limit for the tidal deformability as a function of NS mass and
provide fitting formulae that can be used to set priors for parameter estimation and to discern whether
neutron stars or other compact objects are involved in future low-mass GW events. Finally, we find
that the recent NICER results for the radius of the massive NS PSR J0740+6620 place strong constraints
for the behavior of the EoS, and that the indicated radius values $R(2M_\odot) \gtrsim 11$ km are
compatible with moderate speeds of sound in NS matter and thus with the existence of quark matter
cores in massive NSs.

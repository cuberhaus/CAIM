We present a full $\Lambda$CDM analysis of the BOSS DR12 dataset, including information from the
power spectrum multipoles, the real-space power spectrum, the reconstructed power spectrum and
the bispectrum monopole. This is the first analysis to feature a complete treatment of the galaxy
bispectrum, including a consistent theoretical model and without large-scale cuts. Unlike previous
works, the statistics are measured using window-free estimators: this greatly reduces computational
costs by removing the need to window-convolve the theory model. Our pipeline is tested using a suite
of high-resolution mocks and shown to be robust and precise, with systematic errors far below the
statistical thresholds. Inclusion of the bispectrum yields consistent parameter constraints
and shrinks the $\sigma_8$ posterior by $13\%$ to reach $<5\%$ precision; less conservative analysis
choices would reduce the error-bars further. Our constraints are broadly consistent with Planck:
in particular, we find $H_0 = 69.6^{+1.1}_{-1.3}\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$,
$\sigma_8 = 0.692^{+0.035}_{-0.041}$ and $n_s=0.870^{+0.067}_{-0.064}$, including a BBN prior
on the baryon density. When $n_s$ is set by Planck, we find $H_0 = 68.31^{+0.83}_{-0.86}\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$
and $\sigma_8 = 0.722^{+0.032}_{-0.036}$. Our $S_8$ posterior, $0.751\pm0.039$, is consistent
with weak lensing studies, but lower than Planck. Constraints on the higher-order bias parameters
are significantly strengthened from the inclusion of the bispectrum, and we find no evidence for
deviation from the dark matter halo bias relations. These results represent the most complete full-shape
analysis of BOSS DR12 to-date, and the corresponding spectra will enable a variety of beyond-$\Lambda$CDM
analyses, probing phenomena such as the neutrino mass and primordial non-Gaussianity.

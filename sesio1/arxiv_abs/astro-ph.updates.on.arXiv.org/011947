Observations of scattering polarization and the Hanle effect in various spectral lines are increasingly
used to complement traditional solar magnetic field determination techniques. One of the strongest
scattering polarization signals in the photosphere is measured in the Sr I line at 4607.3 {\AA} when
observed close to the solar limb. Here, we present the first observational evidence of Hanle rotation
in the linearly polarized spectrum of this at several limb distances. We observed with the Zurich
IMaging POLarimeter, ZIMPOL, at the IRSOL observatory, with exceptionally good seeing conditions,
allowing for long integration times. We combined the fast modulating polarimeter with a slow modulator
installed in front of the telescope. This combination allows the measurement of spectropolarimetric
data being highly precise and unprecedentedly accurate. Fixing the reference direction for positive
Stokes $Q$ parallel to the limb, we detect singly-peaked $U/I$ signals well above the noise level.
We can exclude instrumental origin for such $U/I$ signals. These signatures are exclusively found
in the Sr I line, but not in the adjoining Fe I line, therefore eliminating the Zeeman effect as the
mechanism responsible for their appearance. However, we find a clear spatial correlation between
the circular polarization produced by the Zeeman effect and the $U/I$ amplitudes. This suggests
that the detected $U/I$ signals are the signatures of Hanle rotation caused by a spatially resolved
magnetic field. A novel measurement technique allows for determining the absolute level of polarization
with unprecedented precision. Using this technique, high-precision spectropolarimetric observations
reveal for the first time unambiguous $U/I$ signals due to Hanle rotation in the Sr I line.

Modeling the evolution of progenitors of gravitational-wave merger events in binary stars faces
two major uncertainties: the common-envelope phase and supernova kicks. These two processes are
critical for the final orbital configuration of double compact-object systems with neutron stars
and black holes. Predictive one-dimensional models of common-envelope interaction are lacking
and multidimensional simulations are challenged by the vast range of relevant spatial and temporal
scales. Here, we present three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the common-envelope
interaction of an initially $10\,M_{\odot}$ red supergiant primary star with a black-hole and
a neutron-star companion. We show that the high-mass regime is accessible to full ab-initio simulations.
Nearly complete envelope ejection is reached assuming that all recombination energy still available
at the end of our simulation continues to help unbinding the envelope. In contrast to previous assumptions,
we find that the dynamical plunge-in of both companions terminates at orbital separations too wide
for gravitational waves to merge the systems in a Hubble time. We discuss the further evolution of
the system based on analytical estimates. A subsequent mass-transfer episode from the remaining
$3\,M_{\odot}$ core of the supergiant to the compact companion does not shrink the orbit sufficiently
either. A neutron-star--neutron-star and neutron-star--black-hole merger is still expected
for a fraction of the systems if the supernova kick aligns favorably with the orbital motion. For
double neutron star (neutron-star--black-hole) systems we estimate mergers in about $9 \%$ ($1
\%$) of cases while about $77 \%$ ($94 \%$) of binaries are disrupted, i.e., supernova kicks actually
enable gravitational-wave mergers in our cases; however, we expect a reduction in predicted gravitational-wave
merger events. (abbr.)

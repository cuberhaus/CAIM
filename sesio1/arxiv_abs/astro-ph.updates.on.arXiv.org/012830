The star formation and gas content of satellite galaxies around the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda
(M31) are depleted relative to more isolated galaxies in the Local Group (LG) at fixed stellar mass.
We explore the environmental regulation of gas content and quenching of star formation in $z=0$
galaxies at $M*=10^{5-10}\rm{M}_{\odot}$ around 14 MW-mass hosts from the FIRE-2 simulations.
Lower-mass satellites ($M*\lesssim10^7\rm{M}_{\odot}$) are mostly quiescent and higher-mass
satellites ($M*\gtrsim10^8\rm{M}_{\odot}$) are mostly star-forming, with intermediate-mass
satellites ($M*\approx10^{7-8}\rm{M}_{\odot}$) split roughly equally between quiescent and
star-forming. Hosts with more gas in their circumgalactic medium have a higher quiescent fraction
of massive satellites ($M*=10^{8-9}\rm{M}_{\odot}$). We find no significant dependence on isolated
versus paired (LG-like) host environments, and the quiescent fractions of satellites around MW-mass
and LMC-mass hosts from the FIRE-2 simulations are remarkably similar. Environmental effects
that lead to quenching can also occur as preprocessing in low-mass groups prior to MW infall. Lower-mass
satellites typically quenched before MW infall as central galaxies or rapidly during infall into
a low-mass group or a MW-mass galaxy. Most intermediate- to high-mass quiescent satellites have
experienced $\geq1-2$ pericentre passages ($\approx2.5-5$ Gyr) within a MW-mass halo. Most galaxies
with $M*\gtrsim10^{6.5}\rm{M}_{\odot}$ did not quench before falling into a host, indicating
a possible upper mass limit for isolated quenching. The simulations reproduce the average trend
in the LG quiescent fraction across the full range of satellite stellar masses. Though the simulations
are consistent with the SAGA survey's quiescent fraction at $M*\gtrsim10^8\rm{M}_{\odot}$,
they do not generally reproduce SAGA's turnover at lower masses.

Luminous quasars powered by accretion onto billion solar mass black holes already exist at the epoch
of Reionisation, when the Universe was 0.5-1 Gyr old. These objects likely reside in over-dense
regions of the Universe, and will grow to form today's giant galaxies. How their huge black holes
formed in such short times is debated, particularly as they lie above the local black hole mass-galaxy
dynamical mass correlation, thus following the black hole-dominance growth path. It is unknown
what slowed down the black hole growth, leading towards the symbiotic growth observed in the local
Universe, and when this process started, although black hole feedback is a likely driver. This deadlock
is due to the lack of large, homogeneous samples of high-redshift quasars with high-quality, broad-band
spectroscopic information. Here we report results from a VLT/X-shooter survey of 30 quasars at
redshift 5.8$\le$z$\le$6.6 (XQR-30). About 50% of their spectra reveal broad blue-shifted absorption
line (BAL) throughs, tracing powerful ionised winds. The BAL fraction in z$\gtrsim$6 quasars is
2-3 times higher than in quasars at z~2-4.5. XQR-30 BAL quasars exhibit extreme outflow velocities,
up to 17% of the light speed, rarely observed at lower redshift. These outflows inject large amounts
of energy into the galaxy interstellar medium, which can contrast nuclear gas accretion, slowing
down the black-hole growth. The star-formation rate in high-z quasar hosts is generally $>$100
M$_\odot$/yr, so these galaxies are growing at a fast rate. The BAL phase may then mark the beginning
of significant feedback, acting first on black hole growth and possibly later on galaxy growth.
The red optical colors of BAL quasars at z$\gtrsim$6 indeed suggest that these systems are dusty
and may be caught during an initial quenching phase of obscured accretion.

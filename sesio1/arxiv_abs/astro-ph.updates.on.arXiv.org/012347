We present observations of three-dimensional magnetic power spectra in wavevector space to investigate
the anisotropy and scalings of sub-Alfv\'enic solar wind turbulence in low$-\beta_p$ plasma at
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) scale using the Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft. The magnetic
power distributions are organized in a new coordinate determined by wavevectors (k) and background
magnetic field ($b_0$) in Fourier space. This study utilizes two approaches to determine wavevectors:
the singular value decomposition method and multi-spacecraft timing analysis. The combination
of both methods allows an examination of magnetic field fluctuation properties in terms of mode
compositions without spatiotemporal hypothesis. Observations show that fluctuations ($\delta
B_{\perp1}$) in the direction perpendicular to k and $b_0$ prominently cascade perpendicular
to $b_0$, and such anisotropy increases with wavenumber. The reduced power spectra of $\delta B_{\perp1}$
follow Goldreich-Sridhar scalings: $P(k_\perp)\sim k_\perp^{-5/3}$ and $P(k_{||}) \sim k_{||}^{-2}$.
In contrast, fluctuations within $kb_0$ plane show isotropic behaviors: perpendicular power
distributions are approximately the same as parallel distributions. The reduced power spectra
of fluctuations within $kb_0$ plane follow the scalings: $P(k_\perp)\sim k_\perp^{-3/2}$ and
$P(k_{||})\sim k_{||}^{-3/2}$. Comparing frequency-wavevector spectra with theoretical dispersion
relations of MHD modes, we find that $\delta B_{\perp1}$ are probably associated with Alfv\'en
modes. On the other hand, magnetic field fluctuations within $kb_0$ plane more likely originate
from fast modes in low-$\beta_p$ plasma based on their isotropic behaviors. The observations of
anisotropy and scalings of different magnetic field components are consistent with the predictions
of current compressible MHD theory.

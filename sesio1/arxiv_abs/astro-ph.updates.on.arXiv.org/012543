Context. Component separation is the process to extract the sources of emission in astrophysical
maps generally by taking into account multi-frequency information. Developing more reliable
methods to perform component separation is crucial for future CMB experiments. Aims. We aim to develop
a new method based on fully convolutional neural networks called the Cosmic microwave background
Extraction Neural Network (CENN) in order to extract the CMB signal in total intensity. The frequencies
used are the Planck channels 143, 217 and 353 GHz. We validate the network at all sky, and at three latitude
intervals: lat1=0^{\circ}<b<5^{\circ}, lat2=5^{\circ}<b<30^{\circ} and lat3=30^{\circ}<b<90^{\circ},
without using any Galactic or point source masks. Methods. For training, we make realistic simulations
in the form of patches of area 256 pixels, which contain the CMB, Dust, CIB and PS emissions, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
effect and the instrumental noise. After validate the network, we compare the power spectrum from
input and output maps. We analyse the power spectrum from the residuals at each latitude interval
and at all sky and we study the performance of our model dealing with high contamination at small scales.
Results. We obtain a power spectrum with an error of 13{\pm}113 {\mu}K^2 for multipoles up to above
4000. For residuals, we obtain 7{\pm}25 {\mu}K^2 for lat1, 2{\pm}10 {\mu}K^2 for lat2 and 2{\pm}3
{\mu}K^2 for lat3. For all sky, we obtain 5{\pm}12 {\mu}K^2. We validate the network in a patch with
strong contamination at small scales, obtaining an error of 50{\pm}120 {\mu}K^2 and residuals
of 40{\pm}10 {\mu}K^2. Conclusions. Fully convolutional neural networks are promising methods
to perform component separation in future CMB experiments. Particularly, CENN is reliable against
different levels of contamination from Galactic and point source foregrounds at both large and
small scales.

Solar nanoflares are small eruptive events releasing magnetic energy in the quiet corona. If nanoflares
follow the same physics as their larger counterparts, they should emit hard X-rays (HXRs) but with
a rather faint intensity. A copious and continuous presence of nanoflares would deliver enormous
amounts of energy into the solar corona, possibly accounting for its high temperatures. To date,
there has not been any direct observation of such sustained and persistent HXRs from the quiescent
Sun. However, Hannah et al. in 2010 constrained the quiet Sun HXR emission using almost 12 days of
quiescent solar-off-pointing observations by RHESSI. These observations set upper limits at
$3.4\times 10^{-2}$ photons$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ keV$^{-1}$ and $9.5\times 10^{-4}$ photons$^{-1}$
s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ keV$^{-1}$ for the 3-6 keV and 6-12 keV energy ranges, respectively. Observing
feeble HXRs is challenging because it demands high sensitivity and dynamic range instruments in
HXRs. The Focusing Optics X-ray Solar Imager (FOXSI) sounding rocket experiment excels in these
two attributes. Particularly, FOXSI completed its third successful flight (FOXSI-3) on September
7th, 2018. During FOXSI-3's flight, the Sun exhibited a fairly quiet configuration, displaying
only one aged non-flaring active region. Using the entire $\sim$6.5 minutes of FOXSI-3 data, we
constrained the quiet Sun emission in HXRs. We found $2\sigma$ upper limits in the order of $\sim
10^{-3}$ photons$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ keV$^{-1}$ for the 5-10 keV energy range. FOXSI-3's
upper limit is consistent with what was reported by Hannah et al., 2010, but FOXSI-3 achieved this
result using $\sim$1/2640 less time than RHESSI. A possible future spacecraft using FOXSI's concept
would allow enough observation time to constrain the current HXR quiet Sun limits further or perhaps
even make direct detections.

Context: Accreting black holes (BHs) may be surrounded by a highly magnetized plasma threaded by
a poloidal magnetic field. Non-thermal flares and high energy components could originate from
a hot, collisionless and nearly force-free corona. The jets we often observe from these systems
are believed to be rotation-powered and magnetically-driven. Aims: We study axisymmetric BH magnetospheres
where some magnetic field lines anchored in a surrounding disk can connect to the event horizon of
a rotating BH. We identify the sites of magnetic reconnection within 30 gravitational radii depending
on the BH spin. Methods: With the fully general relativistic particle-in-cell code GRZeltron,
we solve the time-dependent dynamics of the electron-positron pair plasma and of the electromagnetic
fields around the BH. The disk is represented by a steady plasma in Keplerian rotation, threaded
by a frozen dipolar field. Results: For prograde disks, twisted open magnetic field lines crossing
the horizon power a Blandford-Znajek jet while beyond a critical distance, open field lines on the
disk are open. In the innermost regions, coupling field lines ensure the transfer of significant
amounts of angular momentum and energy between the BH and the disk. From the Y-point at the intersection,
a current sheet forms where particle acceleration via magnetic reconnection takes place. We compute
the synchrotron images of the current sheet emission. Conclusions: Our estimates for jet power
and BH-disk exchanges match those derived from purely force-free models. Dissipation at the Y-point
heats the corona and provides a physically motivated source of hard X-rays above the disk for reflection
models. Episodic plasmoid ejection might explain millisecond flares observed in Cyg X-1. Particles
flowing from the Y-point down to the disk could produce a hot spot at the footpoint of the outermost
closed field line.

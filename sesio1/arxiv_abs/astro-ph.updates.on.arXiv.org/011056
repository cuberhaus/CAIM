Extensive photometric surveys are and will continue producing massive amounts of data on small
bodies. Usually, these data will be sparsely obtained at arbitrary (and unknown)rotational phases.
Therefore, new methods to process such data need to be developed to make the most of those large catalogs.
We aim to produce a method to create phase curves of small bodies considering the uncertainties introduced
by the nominal errors in the magnitudes and the effect introduced by rotational variations. We use
the SLOAN Moving Objects Catalog data as a benchmark to construct phase curves of all small bodies
in there, in u', g', r', i', and z' filters. We will obtain from the phase curves the absolute magnitudes
and set up with them the absolute colors, which are the colors of the asteroids not affected by changes
in phase angle. We select objects with $\geq3$ observations taken in at least one filter and spanned
over a minimum of 5 degrees in phase angle. We developed a method that combines Monte Carlo simulations
and Bayesian inference to estimate the absolute magnitudes using the HG$_{12}^*$ photometric
system. We obtained almost 15\,000 phase curves, about 12,000 including all five filters. The absolute
magnitudes and absolute colors are compatible with previously published data, supporting our
method. The method we developed is fully automatic and well suited to be run on large amounts of data.
Moreover, it includes the nominal uncertainties in the magnitudes and the whole distribution of
possible rotational states of the objects producing, possibly, less precise values, i.e., larger
uncertainties, but more accurate, i.e., closer to the actual value. To our knowledge, this work
is the first to include the effect of rotational variations in such a manner.

Solar eruptions are explosive release of coronal magnetic field energy as manifested in solar flares
and coronal mass ejection. Observations have shown that the core of eruption-productive regions
are often a sheared magnetic arcade, i.e., a single bipolar configuration, and, particularly,
the corresponding magnetic polarities at the photosphere are elongated along a strong-gradient
polarity inversion line (PIL). It remains unclear what mechanism triggers the eruption in a single
bipolar field and why the one with a strong PIL is eruption-productive. Recently, using high accuracy
simulations, we have established a fundamental mechanism of solar eruption initiation that a bipolar
field as driven by quasi-static shearing motion at the photosphere can form an internal current
sheet, and then fast magnetic reconnection triggers and drives the eruption. Here we investigate
the behavior of the fundamental mechanism with different photospheric magnetic flux distributions,
i.e., magnetograms, by combining theoretical analysis and numerical simulation. Our study shows
that the bipolar fields of different magnetograms, as sheared continually, all exhibit similar
evolutions from the slow storage to fast release of magnetic energy in accordance with the fundamental
mechanism, which demonstrates the robustness of the mechanism. We further found that the magnetograms
with stronger PIL produce larger eruptions, and the key reason is that the sheared bipolar fields
with stronger PIL can achieve more non-potentiality, and their internal current sheet can form
at a lower height and with a larger current density, by which the reconnection can be more efficient.
This also provides a viable trigger mechanism for the observed eruptions in active region with strong
PIL.

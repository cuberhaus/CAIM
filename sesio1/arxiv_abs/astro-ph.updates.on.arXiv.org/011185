Compact object mergers which produce both detectable gravitational waves and electromagnetic
emission can provide valuable insights into the neutron star equation of state, the tension in the
Hubble constant, and the origin of the r-process elements. However, electromagnetic follow-up
of gravitational wave sources is complicated by false positive detections, sources which do not
emit light, and the transient nature of the associated electromagnetic emission. GWSkyNet-Multi
is a machine learning model that attempts to resolve these issues by providing real-time predictions
of the source of a gravitational wave detection. The model uses information from Open Public Alerts
(OPAs) released by LIGO-Virgo within minutes of a gravitational wave detection. GWSkyNet was first
introduced in Cabero et al. (2020) as a binary classifier and uses the OPA skymaps to classify sources
as either astrophysical or as glitches. In this paper, we introduce GWSkyNet-Multi, a new version
of GWSkyNet which further distinguishes sources as binary black hole mergers, mergers involving
a neutron star, or non-astrophysical glitches in the detectors. GWSkyNet-Multi is a sequence of
three one-versus-all classifiers trained using a class-balanced and physically-motivated source
mass distribution. Training on this data set, we obtain test set accuracies of 94% for BBH-versus-all,
94% for NS-versus-all, and 95% for glitch-versus-all. We obtain an overall accuracy of 93% using
a hierarchical classification scheme. Furthermore, we correctly identify 36 of the 40 gravitational
wave detections from the first half of LIGO-Virgo's third observing run (O3a) and present predictions
for O3b sources. We also briefly discuss the interpretability of our models. As gravitational wave
detections increase in number and frequency, GWSkyNet-Multi will be a powerful tool for prioritizing
successful electromagnetic follow-up.

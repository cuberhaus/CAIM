Images collected with ground-based telescopes suffer blurring and distortions from turbulence
in Earth's atmosphere. Adaptive optics (AO) can only partially compensate for these effects. Neither
multi-frame blind deconvolution (MFBD) nor speckle techniques restore AO compensated images
to the correct power spectrum and contrast. MFBD can only compensate for a finite number of low-order
aberrations, leaving a tail of uncorrected high-order modes. Speckle restoration of AO-corrected
data depends on calibrations of the AO corrections and assumptions regarding the height distribution
of atmospheric turbulence. We seek to develop an improvement to MFBD that combines speckle's usage
of turbulence statistics to account for high-order modes with the ability of MFBD to sense low-order
modes that can be partially corrected by AO and/or include fixed or slowly changing instrumental
aberrations. We modify the image formation model, supplementing the fitted low-order wavefront
aberrations with tails of random high-order aberrations that follow Kolmogorov statistics, scaled
to estimated or measured values of Fried's parameter, r0, that characterize the strength of the
seeing at the moment of data collection. We refer to this as statistical diversity (SD). We test MFBD
with SD with noise-free synthetic data, simulating many different r0 and numbers of AO-corrected
modes. SD improves the contrasts and power spectra of restored images, both in accuracy and in consistency
with varying r0, without penalty in processing time. With focus diversity (FD), the results are
almost perfect. SD also reduces errors in the fitted wavefront parameters. MFBD with SD and FD seems
robust with respect to several percents of error in r0. Adding SD to MFBD shows great promise for improving
contrasts and power spectra in restored images. Further studies with real data are motivated.

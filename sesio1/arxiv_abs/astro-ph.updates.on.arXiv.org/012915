This study explores the link between the [OIII]88mu emission, a well-known tracer of HII regions,
and 24mu continuum, often used to trace warm dust in the ionized phases of galaxies. We investigate
the local conditions driving the relation between those tracers in the Magellanic Clouds, comparing
observations with Cloudy models consisting of an HII region plus a photodissociation region (PDR)
component, varying the stellar age, the initial density (at the illuminated edge of the cloud),
and the ionization parameter. We introduce a new parameter, cPDR, to quantify the proportion of
emission arising from PDRs and that with an origin in HII regions along each line of sight. We use the
ratio ([CII]+[OI])/[OIII] as a proxy for the ratio of PDR versus HII region emission, and compare
it to [OIII]/24mu. The use of [OIII]/24mu and [OIII]/70mu together allows us to constrain the models
most efficiently. We find a correlation over at least 3 orders of magnitude in [OIII]88mu and 24mu
continuum in spatially resolved maps of the Magellanic Cloud regions as well as unresolved galaxy-wide
low metallicity galaxies of the Dwarf Galaxy Survey. Most of the regions have low proportions of
PDRs along the lines of sight (< 12%), while a limited area of some of the mapped regions can reach 30
to 50%. For most lines of sight within the star-forming regions we have studied in the Magellanic
Clouds, HII regions are the dominant phase. We propose the use of the correlation between the [OIII]88mu
and 24mu continuum as a new predictive tool to estimate, for example, the [OIII]88mu emission when
the 24mu continuum is available or inversely. This can be useful to prepare for ALMA observations
of [OIII]88mu in high-z galaxies. This simple and novel method may also provide a way to disentangle
different phases along the line of sight, when other 3D information is not available.

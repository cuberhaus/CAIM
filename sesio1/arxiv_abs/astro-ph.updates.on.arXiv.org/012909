(Abridged) Long Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) offer a promising tool to trace the cosmic history of star
formation, especially at high redshift where conventional methods are known to suffer from intrinsic
biases. Previous studies of GRB host galaxies at low redshift showed that high surface densities
of stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR) can potentially enhance the GRB production. We assess
how the size, the stellar mass and SFR surface densities of distant galaxies affect their probability
to host a long GRB, using a sample of GRB hosts at $z > 1$ and a control sample of star-forming sources
from the field. We gather a sample of 45 GRB host galaxies at $1 < z < 3.1$ observed with the Hubble Space
Telescope WFC3 camera in the near-infrared. Using the GALFIT parametric approach, we model the
GRB host light profile and derive the half-light radius for 35 GRB hosts, which we use to estimate
the SFR and stellar mass surface densities of each object. We compare the distribution of these physical
quantities to the SFR-weighted properties of a complete sample of star-forming galaxies from the
3D-HST deep survey at comparable redshift and stellar mass. We show that, similarly to $z < 1$, GRB
hosts are smaller in size and they have higher stellar mass and SFR surface densities than field galaxies
at $1 < z < 2$. Interestingly, this result is robust even when considering separately the hosts of
GRBs with optically-bright afterglows and the hosts of dark GRBs. At $z > 2$ though, GRB hosts appear
to have sizes and stellar mass surface densities more consistent with those characterizing the
field galaxies. In addition to a possible trend toward low metallicity environment, other environmental
properties such as stellar density appears to play a role in the formation of long GRBs, at least up
to $z \sim 2$. This might suggest that GRBs require special environments to be produced.

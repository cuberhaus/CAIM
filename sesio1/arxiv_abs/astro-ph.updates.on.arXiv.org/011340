Virial black hole mass ($M_{BH}$) determination directly involves knowing the broad line region
(BLR) clouds velocity distribution, their distance from the central supermassive black hole ($R_{BLR}$)
and the virial factor ($f$). Understanding whether biases arise in $M_{BH}$ estimation with increasing
obscuration is possible only by studying a large (N$>$100) statistical sample of obscuration unbiased
(hard) X-ray selected active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the rest-frame near-infrared (0.8-2.5$\mu$m)
since it penetrates deeper into the BLR than the optical. We present a detailed analysis of 65 local
BAT-selected Seyfert galaxies observed with Magellan/FIRE. Adding these to the near-infrared
BAT AGN spectroscopic survey (BASS) database, we study a total of 314 unique near-infrared spectra.
While the FWHMs of H$\alpha$ and near-infrared broad lines (He\textsc{i}, Pa$\beta$, Pa$\alpha$)
remain unbiased to either BLR extinction or X-ray obscuration, the H$\alpha$ broad line luminosity
is suppressed when $N_H\gtrsim10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, systematically underestimating $M_{BH}$
by $0.23-0.46$ dex. Near-infrared line luminosities should be preferred to H$\alpha$ until $N_H<10^{22}$
cm$^{-2}$, while at higher obscuration a less biased $R_{BLR}$ proxy should be adopted. We estimate
$f$ for Seyfert 1 and 2 using two obscuration-unbiased $M_{BH}$ measurements, i.e. the stellar
velocity dispersion and a BH mass prescription based on near-infrared and X-ray, and find that the
virial factors do not depend on redshift or obscuration, but for some broad lines show a mild anti-correlation
with $M_{BH}$. Our results show the critical impact obscuration can have on BLR characterization
and the importance of the near-infrared and X-rays for a less biased view of the BLR.

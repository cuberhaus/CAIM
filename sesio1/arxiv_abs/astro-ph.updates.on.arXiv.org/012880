Context: The far-infrared (FIR) and sub-millimeter (submm) emissivity of the Milky Way (MW) cirrus
is an important benchmark for dust grain models. Dust masses in other galaxies are generally derived
from the FIR/submm using the emission properties of these MW-calibrated models. Aims: We seek to
derive the FIR/submm emissivity in nine nearby spiral galaxies to check its compatibility with
MW cirrus measurements. Methods: We obtained values of the emissivity at 70 to 500 um, using maps
of dust emission from the Herschel satellite and of gas surface density from the THINGS and HERACLES
surveys on a scale generally corresponding to 440 pc. We studied the variation of the emissivity
with the surface brightness ratio I(250um)/I(500um), a proxy for the intensity of the interstellar
radiation field heating the dust. Results: We find that the average value of the emissivity agrees
with MW estimates for pixels sharing the same color as the cirrus, namely, for I(250um)/I(500um)
= 4.5. For I(250um)/I(500um) > 5, the measured emissivity is instead up to a factor ~2 lower than predicted
from MW dust models heated by stronger radiation fields. Regions with higher I(250um)/I(500um)
are preferentially closer to the galactic center and have a higher overall (stellar+gas) surface
density and molecular fraction. The results do not depend strongly on the adopted CO-to-molecular
conversion factor and do not appear to be affected by the mixing of heating conditions. Conclusions:
Our results confirm the validity of MW dust models at low density, but are at odds with predictions
for grain evolution in higher density environments. If the lower-than-expected emissivity at
high I(250um)/I(500um) is the result of intrinsic variations in the dust properties, it would imply
an underestimation of the dust mass surface density of up to a factor ~2 when using current dust models.

During their lifetime, galaxy clusters grow through the accretion of matter from the filaments
of the large scale structure and from mergers with other clusters. These mergers release a large
amount of energy into the intracluster medium (ICM) through merger shocks and turbulence. These
phenomena are associated with the formation of radio sources known as radio relics and radio halos,
respectively. Radio relics and halos are unique proxies to study the complex properties of these
dynamically active regions of clusters and in general the micro physics of the ICM. Abell 3667 is
a spectacular examples of a merging system hosting a large pair of radio relics. Due to its proximity
(z=0.0553) and large mass, the system enables the study of these sources to a uniquely high level
of detail. We observed Abell 3667 with MeerKAT as part of the MeerKAT Galaxy Cluster Legacy Survey.
We used these data to study the large scale emission of the cluster, including its polarisation and
spectral properties. We present the most detailed view of the radio relic system in Abell 3667 to
date, with a resolution reaching 3 kpc. The relics are filled with a network of filaments with different
spectral and polarisation properties that are likely associated with multiple regions of particle
acceleration and local enhancements of the magnetic field. Conversely, the magnetic field in the
space between filaments has strengths close to that expected in unperturbed regions at the same
cluster-centric distance. Comparisons with MHD simulations supports the idea of filaments as
multiple acceleration sites. Our observations also confirm the presence of an elongated radio
halo, developed in the wake of the bullet-like sub-cluster that merged from the South-East. Finally,
we associate the process of magnetic draping to a thin polarised radio source surrounding the remnant
of the bullet's cool core.

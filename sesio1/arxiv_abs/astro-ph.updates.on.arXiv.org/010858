Little is known about the chemistry of isocyanates (compounds with the functional group R-N=C=O)
in the interstellar medium, as only four of them have been detected so far: isocyanate radical (NCO),
isocyanic acid (HNCO), N-protonated isocyanic acid (H$_2$NCO$^+$) and methyl isocyanate (CH$_3$NCO).
The molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027, located in the Galactic Centre, represents an excellent candidate
to search for new isocyanates since it exhibits high abundances of the simplest ones, HNCO and CH$_3$NCO.
After CH$_3$NCO, the next complex isocyanates are ethyl isocyanate (C$_2$H$_5$NCO) and vinyl
isocyanate (C$_2$H$_3$NCO). Their detection in the ISM would enhance our understanding of the
formation of these compounds in space. We have detected C$_2$H$_5$NCO and H$_2$NCO$^+$ towards
G+0.693-0.027 (the former for the first time in the interstellar medium) with molecular abundances
of (4.7$-$7.3)$\times$10$^{-11}$ and (1.0$-$1.5)$\times$10$^{-11}$, respectively. A ratio
CH$_3$NCO / C$_2$H$_5$NCO = 8$\pm$1 is obtained; therefore the relative abundance determined
for HNCO:CH$_3$NCO:C$_2$H$_5$NCO is 1:1/55:1/447, which implies a decrease by more than one order
of magnitude going progressively from HNCO to CH$_3$NCO and to C$_2$H$_5$NCO. This is similar to
what has been found for e.g. alcohols and thiols and suggests that C$_2$H$_5$NCO is likely formed
on the surface of dust grains. In addition, we have obtained column density ratios of HNCO / NCO > 269,
HNCO / H$_2$NCO$^+$ $\sim$ 2100 and C$_2$H$_3$NCO / C$_2$H$_5$NCO~<~4. A comparison of the Methyl~/~Ethyl
ratios for isocyanates (-NCO), alcohols (-OH), formiates (HCOO-), nitriles (-CN) and thiols (-SH)
is performed and shows that ethyl-derivatives may be formed more efficiently for the N-bearing
molecules than for the O- and S-bearing molecules.

Neutron stars are the densest known objects in the universe and an ideal laboratory for the strange
physics of super-condensed matter. Theoretical studies in connection with recent observational
data of isolated neutron stars, as well as binary neutron stars systems, offer an excellent opportunity
to provide robust solutions on the dense nuclear problem. In the present work, we review recent studies
concerning the applications of various theoretical nuclear models on a few recent observations
of binary neutron stars or neutron-star--black-hole systems. In particular, using a simple and
well-established model, we parametrize the stiffness of the equation of state with the help of the
speed of sound. Moreover, in comparison to the recent observations of two events by LIGO/VIRGO collaboration,
GW170817 and GW190425, we suggest possible robust constraints. We also concentrate our theoretical
study on the resent observation of a compact object with mass~$\sim 2.59_{-0.09}^{+0.08}~M_{\odot}$
(GW190814 event), as a component of a system where the main companion was a black hole with mass $\sim
23~M_{\odot}$. There is scientific debate concerning the identification of the low mass component,
as it falls into the neutron-star--black-hole mass gap. This is an important issue since understanding
the nature of GW190814 event will offer rich information concerning the upper limit of the speed
of sound in dense matter and the possible phase transition into other degrees of freedom. We systematically
study the tidal deformability of a possible high-mass candidate existing as an individual star
or as a component in a binary neutron star system. Finally, we provide some applications of equations
of state of hot, dense nuclear matter in hot neutron stars, protoneutron stars, and binary neutron
star merger remnants.

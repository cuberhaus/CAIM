Assessing in a simple manner the stability of disc galaxies against bar formation is a considerable
challenge, especially for semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. Thus far, the standard approach
to address this has been the analytical criterion originally proposed by Efstathiou, Lake, and
Negroponte (ELN-criterion), although several works have questioned its reliability. Here we
assess the ELN-criterion performance by making use of z=0 barred and unbarred disc galaxy samples
extracted from TNG100 and TNG50 cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We first study the evolution
of these two populations, finding that barred galaxies generally assemble earlier, are more stellar
dominated in the central region and their discs are more massive and compact than those of unbarred
galaxies. We then apply the ELN-criterion to the two populations, finding that it is capable of correctly
identifying 75% and 80% of the barred and unbarred galaxies, respectively. We find that barred galaxies
not correctly identified by the criterion are galaxies with generally more extended discs, higher
spin values and with bars assembled at later times with respect to the average of the barred sample.
We also find an indication that the bars in these galaxies developed during the interaction with
a close neighbor (external trigger) rather than being the consequence of the secular growth of the
disc. On the other hand, we find that the unbarred galaxies that the ELN-criterion misclassifies
as barred, have stellar discs similar to those of barred galaxies but are less stellar dominated
in the central region, possibly because of their late formation time. Taken all together, our results
indicate that the ELN-criterion can robustly describe the stability of most disc galaxies secularly
evolving, whereas additional environmental criteria should be possibly considered to account
for interaction-induced bar formation.

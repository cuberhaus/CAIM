The recent Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations of type III radio bursts show that the effects of
finite background magnetic field can be an important factor in the interpretation of data. In the
present paper, the effects of background magnetic field on the plasma emission process, which is
believed to be the main emission mechanism for solar coronal and interplanetary type III radio bursts,
are investigated by means of the particle-in-cell simulation method. The effects of ambient magnetic
field are systematically surveyed by varying the ratio of plasma frequency to electron gyro-frequency.
The present study shows that for a sufficiently strong ambient magnetic field, the wave-particle
interaction processes lead to a highly field-aligned longitudinal mode excitation and anisotropic
electron velocity distribution function, accompanied by a significantly enhanced plasma emission
at the second harmonic plasma frequency. For such a case, the polarization of the harmonic emission
is almost entirely in the sense of extraordinary mode. On the other hand, for moderate strengths
of the ambient magnetic field, the interpretation of the simulation result is less than clear. The
underlying nonlinear mode coupling processes indicate that to properly understand and interpret
the simulation results require sophisticated analyses involving interactions among magnetized
plasma normal modes including the two transverse modes of the magneto-active plasma, namely, extraordinary
and ordinary modes, as well as electron-cyclotron-whistler, plasma oscillation, and upper-hybrid
modes. At present, a nonlinear theory suitable for quantitatively analyzing such complex mode-coupling
processes in magnetized plasmas is incomplete, which calls for further theoretical research,
but the present simulation results could provide a guide for future theoretical efforts.

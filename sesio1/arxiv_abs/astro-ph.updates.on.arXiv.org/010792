The Planck satellite has identified more than 2000 protocluster candidates with extreme star formation
rates (SFRs). Here, we present the spectroscopic identification of a Planck-selected protocluster
located in the Cosmos field, PHz G237.01+42.50 (G237). G237 contains a galaxy overdensity of 31
spectroscopically identified galaxies at z~2.16 (significant at 5.4 sigma) in a 10'x11' region.
The overdensity contains two substructures or protoclusters at <z>~2.16 and 2.195 with estimated
halo masses at z=0 of ~(5-6)x10^14 Msun. The overdensity total SFR, ~4000 Msun/yr, is higher than
predicted by simulations but much smaller than the SFR derived from the Planck data. The analysis
of the Herschel data, in combination with the available ancillary data, shows that such a difference
is due to an effect of source alignment along the line of sight that produces a 5 sigma overdensity
of red Herschel sources in the field. We analyze the members' UV spectra and UV-far-infrared spectral
energy distributions to derive their SFR, stellar mass, and metallicity. Galaxy members include
blue star-forming galaxies and AGN with SFRs and stellar masses consistent with the main sequence.
AGN, identified through optical spectroscopy or X-ray data, represent a significant fraction
(20+/-10%) of all members of the protocluster at z=2.16, and they are powerful enough to produce
radiative feedback. The core of this protocluster, besides being denser, includes members that
are, on average, more massive and star-forming and contains a larger fraction of AGN and Herschel-detected
galaxies than the full sample, suggesting an environmental effect on galaxy growth. A comparison
between G237 and other protoclusters in the literature at similar redshifts reveals some common
traits and differences that reflect both observational biases and a diversity in intrinsic properties
that is not yet fully understood.

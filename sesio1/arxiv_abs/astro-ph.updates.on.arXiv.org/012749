The third data release by the Gaia mission of the European Space (DR3) is the first release to provide
the community with a large sample of observations for more than 150 thousand Solar System objects,
including asteroids and natural planetary satellites. The release contains astrometry (over
23 million epochs) and photometry, along with average reflectance spectra of 60518 asteroids and
osculating elements. We present an overview of the procedures that have been implemented over several
years of development and tests to process Solar System data at the level of accuracy that Gaia can
reach. We illustrate the data properties and potential with some practical examples. In order to
allow the users of DR3 to best exploit the data, we explain the assumptions and approaches followed
in the implementation of the data processing pipeline for Solar System processing, and their effects
in terms of data filtering, optimisation, and performances. We then test the data quality by analysing
post-fit residuals to adjusted orbits, the capacity of detecting subtle dynamical effects (wobbling
due to satellites or shape and Yarkovsky acceleration), and to reproduce known properties of asteroid
photometry (phase curves and rotational light curves). The DR3 astrometric accuracy is a clear
improvement over the data published in DR2, which concerned a very limited sample of asteroids.
The performance of the data reduction is met, and is illustrated by the capacity of detecting milliarcsecond-level
wobbling of the asteroid photocentre that is due to satellite or shape effects and contributes to
Yarkovsky effect measurements. The third data release can in terms of data completeness and accuracy
be considered the first full-scale realisation of the Solar System survey by Gaia.

Major mergers between galaxy clusters can produce large turbulent and bulk flow velocities in the
intra-cluster medium and thus imprint diagnostic features in X-ray spectral emission lines from
heavy ions. As demonstrated by Hitomi in observations of the Perseus cluster, measurements of gas
velocities in clusters from high-resolution X-ray spectra will be achievable with upcoming X-ray
calorimeters like those on board XRISM, Athena, or a Lynx like mission. We investigate this possibility
for interesting locations across a major cluster merger from a hydrodynamical simulation, via
X-ray synthetic spectra with a few eV energy resolution. We observe the system from directions perpendicular
to the plane of the merger and along the merger axis. In these extreme geometrical configurations,
we find clear non-Gaussian shapes of the iron He-like K_alpha line at 6.7keV. The velocity dispersion
predicted from the simulations can be retrieved for the brightest 100ks pointings with XRISM Resolve,
despite some discrepancy related to the complex non-Gaussian line shapes. Measurements in faint
regions require however high S/N and the larger collecting area of the Athena X-IFU calorimeter
is thus needed. With the latter, we also investigate the gas temperature and velocity gradient across
the merger bow shock edge, from 20"-wide annuli extracted from a single 1Ms X-IFU pointing. We find
best-fit temperature and velocity dispersion values that are consistent with predictions from
the simulations within 1-sigma, but the uncertainties on the inferred velocity dispersion are
too large to place any stringent constraints on the shallow gradient downstream of the shock. We
also present simulated images of the thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effects, using the
above viewing configurations, and compare the results at angular resolutions appropriate for
future observatories such as CMB-S4 and AtLAST.

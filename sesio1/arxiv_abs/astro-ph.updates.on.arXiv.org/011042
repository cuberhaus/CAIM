The advent of high-resolution spectroscopy as a method for exoplanet atmospheric characterization
has expanded our capability to study non-transiting planets, increasing the number of planets
accessible for observation. Many of the most favorable targets for atmospheric characterization
are hot Jupiters, where we expect large spatial variation in physical conditions such as temperature,
wind speed, and cloud coverage, making viewing geometry important. Three-dimensional models
have generally simulated observational properties of hot Jupiters assuming edge-on viewing,
which neglects planets without near edge-on orbits. As the first investigation of how orbital inclination
manifests in high-resolution emission spectra, we use a General Circulation Model to simulate
the atmospheric structure of Upsilon Andromedae b, a non-transiting hot Jupiter. In order to accurately
capture scattering from clouds, we implement a generalized two-stream radiative transfer routine
for inhomogeneous multiple scattering atmospheres. We compare models with and without clouds,
as cloud coverage intensifies spatial variations. Cloud coverage increases both the net Doppler
shifts and the variation of the continuum flux amplitude over the course of the planet's orbit. As
orbital inclination decreases, four key features also decrease in both the clear and cloudy models:
1) the average continuum flux level, 2) the amplitude of the variation in continuum with orbital
phase, 3) net Doppler shifts of spectral lines, and 4) Doppler broadening in the spectra. Models
capable of treating inhomogeneous cloud coverage and different viewing geometries are critical
in understanding high-resolution emission spectra, enabling an additional avenue to investigate
these extreme atmospheres.

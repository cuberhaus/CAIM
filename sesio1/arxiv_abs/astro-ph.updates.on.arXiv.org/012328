Context: Open clusters are ideal laboratories to investigate a variety of astrophysical topics,
from the properties of the Galactic disc to stellar evolution models. For this purpose, we need to
know their chemical composition in detail. Unfortunately, the number of systems with chemical
abundances determined from high resolution spectroscopy remains small. Aims: Our aim is to increase
the number of open clusters with radial velocities and chemical abundances determined from high
resolution spectroscopy by sampling a few stars in clusters not studied previously. Methods: We
obtained high resolution spectra with the FIES spectrograph at NOT for 41 stars belonging to 20 open
clusters. These stars have high astrometric membership probabilities, determined from the Gaia
second data release. Results: We derived radial velocities for all the observed stars, which were
used to confirm their membership to the corresponding clusters. For Gulliver\,37 we cannot be sure
the observed star is a real member. We derived atmospheric parameters for the 32 stars considered
real cluster members. We discarded five stars because they have very low gravity or atmospheric
parameters were not properly constrained due to low signal-to-noise ratio spectra. Therefore,
detailed chemical abundances were determined for 28 stars belonging to 17 clusters. For most of
them, this is the first chemical analysis available in the literature. Finally, we compared the
clusters in our sample to a large population of well studied clusters. The studied systems follow
the trends, both chemical and kinematical, described by the majority of open clusters. Worth noticing
that the three most metal-poor studied clusters (NGC\,1027, NGC\,1750 and Trumpler 2) are enhanced
in Si but not in the other alpha-elements studied (Mg, Ca and Ti).

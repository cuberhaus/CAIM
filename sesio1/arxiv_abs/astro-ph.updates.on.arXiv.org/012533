The chromosphere is a partially ionized layer of the solar atmosphere, the transition between the
photosphere where the gas is almost neutral and the fully ionized corona. As the collisional coupling
between neutral and charged particles decreases in the upper part of the chromosphere, the hydrodynamical
timescales may become comparable to the collisional timescale, and a two-fluid model is needed.
In this paper we describe the implementation and validation of a two-fluid model which simultaneously
evolves charges and neutrals, coupled by collisions. The two-fluid equations are implemented
in the fully open-source MPI-AMRVAC code. In the photosphere and the lower part of the solar atmosphere,
where collisions between charged and neutral particles are very frequent, an explicit time-marching
would be too restrictive, since for stability the timestep needs to be proportional to the inverse
of the collision frequency. This is overcome by evaluating the collisional terms implicitly using
an explicit-implicit (IMEX) scheme. The cases presented cover very different collisional regimes
and our results are fully consistent with related literature findings. If collisional time and
length scales are smaller than the hydrodynamical scales usually considered in the solar chromosphere,
density structures seen in the neutral and charged fluids are similar, with the effect of elastic
collisions between charges and neutrals being similar to diffusivity. Otherwise, density structures
are different and the decoupling in velocity between the two species increases. The use of IMEX schemes
efficiently avoids the small timestep constraints of fully explicit implementations in strongly
collisional regimes. Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) greatly decreases the computational cost,
compared to uniform grid runs at the same effective resolution.

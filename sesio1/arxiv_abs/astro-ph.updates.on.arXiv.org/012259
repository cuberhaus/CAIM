Some recent literature has claimed there to be an evolution in galaxies' dust temperatures towards
warmer (or colder) spectral energy distributions (SEDs) between low and high redshift. These conclusions
are driven by both theoretical models and empirical measurement. Such claims sometimes contradict
one another and are prone to biases in samples or SED fitting techniques. What has made direct comparisons
difficult is that there is no uniform approach to fitting galaxies' infrared/millimeter SEDs.
Here we aim to standardize the measurement of galaxies' dust temperatures with a python-based SED
fitting procedure, MCIRSED. We draw on reference datasets observed by IRAS, Herschel, and Scuba-2
to test for redshift evolution out to $z\sim2$. We anchor our work to the L$_{IR}$-$\lambda_{peak}$
plane, where there is an empirically observed anti-correlation between IR luminosity and rest-frame
peak wavelength (an observational proxy for luminosity-weighted dust temperature) such that
$\lambda_{peak}=\lambda_{t}({L_{IR}}/{L_{t}})^{\eta}$ where $\eta=-0.09\pm0.01$, L$_{t}=10^{12}$
L$_{\odot}$, and $\lambda_{t}=92\pm2\mu$m. We find no evidence for redshift evolution of galaxies'
temperatures, or $\lambda_{peak}$, at fixed L$_{IR}$ from $0<z<2$ with >99.99% confidence. Our
finding does not preclude evolution in dust temperatures at fixed stellar mass, which is expected
from a non-evolving L$_{IR}$-$\lambda_{peak}$ relation and a strongly evolving SFR-M$_\star$
relation. The breadth of dust temperatures at a given L$_{IR}$ is likely driven by variation in galaxies'
dust geometries and sizes and does not evolve. Testing for L$_{IR}$-$\lambda_{peak}$ evolution
toward higher redshift ($z\sim5-6$) requires better sampling of galaxies' dust SEDs near their
peaks (observed $\sim$200-600$\mu$m) with $<$1 mJy sensitivity. This poses a significant challenge
to current instrumentation.

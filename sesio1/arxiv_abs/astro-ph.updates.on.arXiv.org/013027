One of the main complications for the interpretation of reflectance spectra of airless planetary
bodies is surface alteration by space weathering caused by irradiation by solar wind and micrometeoroid
particles. We aim to evaluate the damage to the samples from H and laser irradiation and relate it
to the observed alteration in the spectra. We used olivine (OL) and pyroxene (OPX) pellets irradiated
by 5 keV H ions and individual fs laser pulses and measured their visible (VIS) and near-infrared
(NIR) spectra. We observed the pellets with scanning and transmission electron microscopy. We
studied structural, mineralogical, and chemical modifications in the samples and connected them
to changes in the reflectance spectra. In both minerals, H irradiation induces partially amorphous
sub-surface layers containing small vesicles. In OL pellets, these vesicles are more tightly packed
than in OPX ones. Related spectral change is mainly in the VIS spectral slope. Changes due to laser
irradiation are mostly dependent on material's melting temperature. Only the laser-irradiated
OL contains nanophase Fe particles, which induce detectable spectral slope change throughout
the measured spectral range. Our results suggest that spectral changes at VIS-NIR wavelengths
are mainly dependent on thickness of (partially) amorphous sub-surface layers. Amorphisation
smooths microroughness, increasing the contribution of volume scattering and absorption over
surface scattering. Soon after exposure to the space environment, the appearance of partially
amorphous sub-surface layers results in rapid changes in the VIS spectral slope. In later stages
(onset of micrometeoroid bombardment), we expect an emergence of nanoparticles to also mildly
affect the NIR spectral slope. An increase in dimensions of amorphous layers and vesicles in the
more space-weathered material will only cause band-depth variation and darkening.

A significant fraction of the most massive stars move through space with a high velocity. One of the
possible physical explanations is that a supernova in a compact binary system results in a high recoil
velocity of the system. If the system remains bound, it can be subsequently observed as a spectroscopic
binary (SB1), a high-mass X-ray binary, a compact binary, and finally a gravitational-wave event.
If such a system is traced back to its parent cluster, binary evolution models can be tested in great
detail. The Gaia proper motions and parallaxes are used to demonstrate that the high-mass X-ray
binary HD153919/4U 1700-37 originates from NGC6231, the nucleus of the OB association Sco OB1.
The O supergiant and its compact companion, of which the physical nature (a neutron star or a black
hole) is unknown, move with a space velocity of 63 km/s with respect to NGC6231. The kinematical age
of the system is 2.2 Myr. The parallaxes and accurate proper motions in Gaia DR2 were used to perform
a membership analysis of NGC 6231. The distance to NGC6231 is 1.63 kpc. Isochrone fitting results
in an age of 4.7 Myr. With the identification of NGC6231 as the parent cluster, the upper limit on the
age of the progenitor of 4U1700-37 at the moment of the supernova explosion is 3.0 Myr. With these
constraints, the evolutionary history of the system can be reconstructed with an initial mass of
the progenitor of the compact object >60 Msun. Given its current high space velocity and the derived
evolutionary history, the compact object in the system is more likely to have received a large natal
kick, which suggests that it is more likely a neutron star than a black hole. HD153919/4U1700-37
might be a prototype in the Milky Way for the progenitor of gravitational wave events such as GW190412

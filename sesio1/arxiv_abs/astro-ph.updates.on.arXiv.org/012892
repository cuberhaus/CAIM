We present a study of the intra-cluster population of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXB) residing in
globular clusters (GC) in the central 1 $deg^2$ of the Fornax galaxy cluster. Differently from previous
studies, which were restricted to the innermost regions of individual galaxies, this work is aimed
at comparing the properties of the intra-cluster population of GC-LMXBs with those of the host galaxy.
We use VLT Survey Telescope (VST) and Chandra observations. We identify 168 LMXBs residing in GCs
and divide it into host-galaxy and intra-cluster objects based on their distance from the nearest
galaxy in terms of effective radius. We found 82 intra-cluster GC-LMXBs and 86 objects that are hosted
in galaxies. We perform a Gaussian mixture model to divide the population into red and blue GCs. As
has been found for the innermost regions of galaxies, LMXBs tend to form in red and bright GCs in intra-cluster
space as well. We find, however, that the likelihood of a red GC to host an LMXB decreases with galactocentric
distance, but it remains approximately constant for the blue GC population. Investigating the
X-ray properties of the LMXBs residing in GCs, we find a difference in the X-ray luminosity function
between the intra-cluster and host-galaxy sample: both follow a power-law down to $\sim 8.5\times
10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$, which is consistent with field LMXBs for the intra-cluster sample, while
the latter agree with previous estimates for LMXBs in GCs. We detect a tentative difference in the
hardness ratio of two populations, where the intra-cluster GC-LMXBs appear to have harder spectra
than the host-galaxy objects. We find the same trend when we compare red and blue GC-LMXBs: the spectra
of the blue sample are harder spectra than those of the red sample. This result could suggest a relation
between the spectral properties of LMXBs and the host GC colour and therefore its metallicity.

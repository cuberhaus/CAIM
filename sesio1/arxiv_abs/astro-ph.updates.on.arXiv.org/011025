GWs from BNS associated with SGRBs have drawn considerable attention due to their prospect in cosmology.
For such events, the sky locations of sources can be pinpointed with techniques such as identifying
the host galaxies. However, the cosmological applications of these events still suffer from the
problem of degeneracy between luminosity distance and inclination angle. To address this issue,
a technique was proposed in previous study, i.e., using the property of SGRBs. Based on the observations,
we assume that the cosine of inclination follows a Gaussian distribution, which may act as a prior
in the Bayes analysis to break the degeneracy. This paper investigates the effects of different
Gaussian priors and detector configurations on distance measurement and cosmological research.
We first derive a simplified Fisher information matrix for demonstration, and then conduct quantitative
analyses via simulation. By varying the number of third-generation detectors and the scale of prior,
we generate four catalogs of 1000 events. It is shown that, in the same detecting period, a network
of detectors can recognize more and farther events than a single detector. Besides, adopting tighter
prior and employing multiple detectors both decrease the error of luminosity distance. Also considered
is the performance of a widely adopted formula in the error budget, which turns out to be a conservative
choice in each case. As for cosmological applications, for LCDM model, 500, 200, 600, and 300 events
are required for the four configurations to achieve 1% H_0 accuracy. With all 1000 events in each
catalog, H_0 and Omega_m can be constrained to 0.66%, 0.37%, 0.76%, 0.49%, and 0.010, 0.006, 0.013,
0.010, respectively. The results of the Gaussian process also show that the GW standard siren can
serve as a probe of high-redshift universe.

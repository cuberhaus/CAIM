The orbital International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL), launched in 2002, continues
its successful work in observing the sky at energies above 20 keV. The growing INTEGRAL data archive
allows one to conduct a hard X-ray all-sky survey including a number of deep extragalactic fields
and the deepest ever hard X-ray survey of the Galaxy. Taking advantage of the data gathered over 17
years with the IBIS coded-mask telescope on board INTEGRAL, we conducted a survey of hard X-ray sources
in the 17-60 keV band, providing flux information in different energy bands up to 290 keV. The catalog
of sources includes 929 objects, 890 of which exceed a detection threshold of 4.5 sigma and the rest
are detected at 4.0-4.5 sigma and belong to known cataloged INTEGRAL sources and sources from the
on-going all-sky survey by the BAT telescope of the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. Among the identified
sources with known or suspected nature, 376 are associated with Galaxy and Magellanic clouds, including
145 low-mass X-ray binaries, 115 high-mass X-ray binaries, 79 cataclysmic variables, and 37 of
other types; and 440 are extragalactic, including 429 active galactic nuclei (AGNs), 2 ultra-luminous
sources (ULXs), supernova remnant AT2018cow and 8 galaxy clusters. 113 sources from the catalog
remain unclassified. 46 objects are detected in the hard X-ray band for the first time. The cumulative
LogN-LogS distribution of non-blazar AGNs, based on 356 sources detected at S/N>4.5 sigma, is measured
down to flux 2E-12 erg/s/cm^2 and can be described by a power law with a slope of 1.44 +/- 0.09 and a normalization
of 8E-3 sources per deg^2 at fluxes >1E-11 erg/s/cm^2. The LogN-LogS distribution of unclassified
sources indicates that the majority of them are of extragalactic origin.

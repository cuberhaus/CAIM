We analyzed the combined 142 years sunspot-group data from Greenwich Photoheliograpic Results
(GPR) and Debrecen Photoheliographic Data (DPD) and determined the yearly mean residual rotation
rate and the meridional velocity of sunspot groups in different 5-degree latitude intervals. The
residual rotation rate is found to be -120 m/s to 80 m/s. In a large number of solar cycles the rotation
is to some extent weaker during maxima than that of during minima. There exist alternate bands of
equatorward and poleward merdional motions. The equatorward motion is dominant mostly around
the maxima of solar cycles with velocity 8-12 m/s, whereas the poleward motion is dominant mostly
around the minima but with a relatively weak velocity, only 4-6 m/s. This analysis suggests the existence
of equatorward migrating alternate bands of slower and faster than average rotation within the
activity belt and no clear equatorward or poleward migrating bands of meridional motions. A statistically
significant anticorrelation exists between the meridional motion and residual rotation. The
corresponding linear-least-squares best-fit is found to be reasonably good (slope, -0.028 + or
- 0.008, is about 3.5 times larger than its standard deviation). The significant negative value
of the slope indicates the existence of a strong angular momentum transport toward equator. The
slope leads sunspot number (SN) by about 4 and 9 years. The Morlet wavelet spectrum of the slope suggests
the existence of approximate 11-year periodicity in the slope almost throughout the data window,
but it was very weak during 1920-1940.Overall the results suggest there exits a strong relationship
between the slope and amount of activity during a solar cycle. However, no relationship is found
between the slope and strength of activity on a long-time scale (longer than 11-year period).

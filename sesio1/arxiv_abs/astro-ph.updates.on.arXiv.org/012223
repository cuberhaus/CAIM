We report the first detection of CO emission lines at high spectral resolution in the day-side infrared
thermal spectrum of an exoplanet. These emission lines, found in the atmosphere of the ultra hot
Jupiter WASP-33 b, provide unambiguous evidence of its thermal inversion layer. Using spectra
from the MMT Exoplanet Atmosphere Survey (MEASURE, $R\sim15,000$), covering pre- and post-eclipse
orbital phases ($0.33<\phi<0.73$), we performed a cross-correlation analysis with 1D PHOENIX
model atmospheres to detect CO at S/N=7.9 at $v_{sys}=0.15^{+0.64}_{-0.65}$ km/s and $K_{p}=229.5^{+1.1}_{-1.0}$
km/s. However, using the framework of Cross-Correlation-to-log-Likelihood mapping, we further
find that the spectral line depths, as probed by the scaling parameter, change with phase: the line
contrast is larger after the eclipse than before. We then use the general circulation model SPARC/MITgcm
post-processed by the 3D gCMCRT radiative transfer code and interpret this variation as due to an
eastward-shifted hot spot. Before the eclipse, when the hot spot is facing Earth, the thermal profiles
are shallower, leading to a smaller line depth despite greater overall flux. After the eclipse,
the western part of the day-side is facing Earth, where the thermal profiles are much steeper, leading
to larger line depth despite less overall flux. We thus demonstrate that even relatively moderate
resolution spectra can be used to understand the 3D nature of close-in exoplanets, if assessed within
the log-likelihood framework, and that resolution can be traded for photon collecting power when
the induced Doppler-shift is sufficiently large. We highlight that CO in ultra hot Jupiters is a
good probe of their thermal structure and corresponding dynamics, and does not suffer from stellar
activity unlike some atomic species, such as iron, that also appear in the hot host star spectrum.

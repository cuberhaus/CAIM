We show that measuring the velocity components of hypervelocity stars (HVSs) can discriminate
between modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) and Newtonian gravity. HVSs are ejected from the Galactic
center on radial trajectories with a null tangential velocity component in the reference frame
of the Galaxy. They acquire tangential components due to the nonspherical components of the Galactic
gravitational potential. Axisymmetric potentials only affect the latitudinal components, $v_\theta$,
and non-null azimuthal components, $v_\phi$, originate from non-axisymmetric matter distributions.
For HVSs with sufficiently high ejection speed, $v_\phi$ is proportionate to the deviation of the
gravitational potential from axial symmetry. The ejection velocity threshold is $\sim$ 750 km/s
for 4 $M_{\odot}$ stars and increases with decreasing HVS mass. We determine the upper limit of $v_\phi$
as a function of the galactocentric distance for these high-speed HVSs if QUMOND, the quasi-linear
formulation of MOND, is the correct theory of gravity and either the triaxial Galactic bulge or a
nonspherical hot gaseous halo is the primary source of $v_\phi$. In Newtonian gravity, the HVSs
within 60 kpc of the Galactic center may easily have $v_\phi$ values higher than the QUMOND upper
limit if the dark matter (DM) halo is triaxial or if the DM halo and the baryonic components are axisymmetric
but their two axes of symmetry are misaligned. Therefore, even a limited sample of high-speed HVSs
could distinguish between QUMOND and the DM model. This test is currently limited by (i) the lack
of a proper procedure to assess the HVS nature of a star in the model to be constrained; and (ii) the
present uncertainties on $v_\phi$, which are a factor of $\sim 10$ too large. A proper procedure
to assess the HVS nature of the stars and astrometric measurements with microarcsecond precision
would make this test feasible.

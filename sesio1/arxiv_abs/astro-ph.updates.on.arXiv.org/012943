We present new [O III] 88 ${\rm \mu}$m observations of five bright $z \sim 7$ Lyman-break galaxies
spectroscopically confirmed by ALMA through the [C II] 158 ${\rm \mu}$m line, unlike recent [O III]
detections where Lyman-${\rm \alpha}$ was used. This nearly doubles the sample of Epoch of Reionisation
galaxies with robust ($5 \sigma$) detections of [C II] and [O III]. We perform a multi-wavelength
comparison with new deep HST images of the rest-frame UV, whose compact morphology aligns well with
[O III] tracing ionised gas. By contrast, we find more spatially extended [C II] emission likely
produced in neutral gas, as indicated by a [N II] 205 ${\rm \mu}$m non-detection in one source. We
find a positive correlation between the equivalent width of the optical [O III] and H${\rm \beta}$
lines and the [O III]/[C II] ratio, as seen in local metal-poor dwarf galaxies. Cloudy models of a
nebula of typical density harbouring a young stellar population with a high ionisation parameter
appear to adequately reproduce the far-infrared lines. Surprisingly, however, our models fail
to reproduce the strength of [O III] 88 ${\rm \mu}$m, unless we assume an ${\rm \alpha}$/Fe enhancement
and a near-solar nebular oxygen abundance. On spatially resolved scales, we find [O III]/[C II]
shows a tentative anti-correlation with infrared excess, $L_{\rm IR}/L_{\rm UV}$, also seen on
global scales in the local Universe. Finally, we introduce the far-infrared spectral energy distribution
fitting code MERCURIUS to show that dust-continuum measurements of one source appear to favour
a low dust temperature coupled with a high dust mass. This implies a high stellar metallicity yield
and may point towards the need of dust production or grain-growth mechanisms beyond supernovae.

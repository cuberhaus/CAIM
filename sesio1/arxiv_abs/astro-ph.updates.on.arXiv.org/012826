Using NOEMA and ALMA 3mm line scans, we measure spectroscopic redshifts of six new dusty galaxies
at 3.5<z<4.2 by solidly detecting [CI](1-0) and CO transitions. The sample was selected from the
COSMOS and GOODS-North super-deblended catalogs with FIR photometric redshifts >6, based on template
IR spectrum energy distribution (SED) from known submillimeter galaxies at z=4--6. Dust SED analyses
explain the photo-z overestimate from seemingly cold dust temperatures (Td) and steep Rayleigh-Jeans
(RJ) slopes, providing additional examples of cold dusty galaxies impacted by the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) as found in Jin et al. (2019). We thus study the general properties of the enlarged
sample of 10 ``cold" dusty galaxies over 3.5<z<6. We conclude that these galaxies are deceivingly
cold at the surface but actually warm in their starbursting cores. Several lines of evidence support
this scenario: (1) The high infrared surface density and cold Td from optically thin models appear
to violate the Stefan-Boltzmann law; (2) the gas masses derived from optically thin dust masses
are inconsistent with estimates from dynamics and CI luminosities; (3) the implied high star formation
efficiencies would conflict with cold Td; (4) high FIR optical depth is implied even using the lower,
optically-thick dust masses. This work confirms the existence of a substantial population of deceivingly
cold, compact dusty starburst galaxies at z>~4, together with the severe impact of the CMB on their
RJ observables, paving the way for the diagnostics of optically thick dust in the early universe.
Conventional gas mass estimates based on RJ dust continuum luminosities implicitly assume an optically
thin case, overestimating gas masses by a factor of 2--3 on average in compact dusty star-forming
galaxies.

We report on the population properties of 76 compact binary mergers detected with gravitational
waves below a false alarm rate of 1 per year through GWTC-3. The catalog contains three classes of
binary mergers: BBH, BNS, and NSBH mergers. We infer the BNS merger rate to be between 13 $\rm{Gpc^{-3}
yr^{-1}}$ and 1900 $\rm{Gpc^{-3} yr^{-1}}$ and the NSBH merger rate to be between 7.4 $\rm{Gpc^{-3}\,
yr^{-1}}$ and 320 $\rm{Gpc^{-3} yr^{-1}}$ , assuming a constant rate density versus comoving volume
and taking the union of 90% credible intervals for methods used in this work. Accounting for the BBH
merger rate to evolve with redshift, we find the BBH merger rate to be between 17.3 $\rm{Gpc^{-3}\,
yr^{-1}}$ and 45 $\rm{Gpc^{-3}\, yr^{-1}}$ at a fiducial redshift (z=0.2). We obtain a broad neutron
star mass distribution extending from $1.2^{+0.1}_{-0.2} M_\odot$ to $2.0^{+0.3}_{-0.2} M_\odot$.
We can confidently identify a rapid decrease in merger rate versus component mass between neutron
star-like masses and black-hole-like masses, but there is no evidence that the merger rate increases
again before 10 $M_\odot$. We also find the BBH mass distribution has localized over- and under-densities
relative to a power law distribution. While we continue to find the mass distribution of a binary's
more massive component strongly decreases as a function of primary mass, we observe no evidence
of a strongly suppressed merger rate above $\sim 60 M_\odot$. The rate of BBH mergers is observed
to increase with redshift at a rate proportional to $(1+z)^{\kappa}$ with $\kappa = 2.7^{+1.8}_{-1.9}$
for $z\lesssim 1$. Observed black hole spins are small, with half of spin magnitudes below $\chi_i
\simeq 0.26$. We observe evidence of negative aligned spins in the population, and an increase in
spin magnitude for systems with more unequal mass ratio.

Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) is often described by dispersion relations of the form $E_i^2=m_i^2+p_i^2+\delta_{i,n}
E^{2+n}$ with delta different based on particle type $i$, with energy $E$, momentum $p$ and rest
mass $m$. Kinematics and energy thresholds of interactions are modified once the LIV terms become
comparable to the squared masses of the particles involved. Thus, the strongest constraints on
the LIV coefficients $\delta_{i,n}$ tend to come from the highest energies. At sufficiently high
energies, photons produced by cosmic ray interactions as they propagate through the Universe could
be subluminal and unattenuated over cosmological distances. Cosmic ray interactions can also
be modified and lead to detectable fingerprints in the energy spectrum and mass composition observed
on Earth. The data collected at the Pierre Auger Observatory are therefore possibly sensitive to
both the electromagnetic and hadronic sectors of LIV. In this article, we explore these two sectors
by comparing the energy spectrum and the composition of cosmic rays and the upper limits on the photon
flux from the Pierre Auger Observatory with simulations including LIV. Constraints on LIV parameters
depend strongly on the mass composition of cosmic rays at the highest energies. For the electromagnetic
sector, while no constraints can be obtained in the absence of protons beyond $10^{19}$ eV, we obtain
$\delta_{\gamma,0} > -10^{-21}$, $\delta_{\gamma,1} > -10^{-40}$ eV$^{-1}$ and $\delta_{\gamma,2}
> -10^{-58}$ eV$^{-2}$ in the case of a subdominant proton component up to $10^{20}$ eV. For the hadronic
sector, we study the best description of the data as a function of LIV coefficients and we derive constraints
in the hadronic sector such as $\delta_{\mathrm{had},0} < 10^{-19}$, $\delta_{\mathrm{had},1}
< 10^{-38}$ eV$^{-1}$ and $\delta_{\mathrm{had},2}< 10^{-57}$ eV$^{-2}$ at 5$\sigma$ CL.

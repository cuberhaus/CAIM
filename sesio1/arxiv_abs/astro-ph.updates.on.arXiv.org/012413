Some of the accreting black holes exhibit much stronger variability patterns than the usual stochastic
variations. Radiation pressure instability is one of the proposed mechanisms which could account
for this effect. We aim to model luminosity changes for objects with black hole mass of 10, 10$^5$,
and 10$^7$ solar masses, using the time-dependent evolution of an accretion disk unstable due to
the dominant radiation pressure. We use a 1-dimensional, vertically integrated time-dependent
numerical scheme which models simultaneous evolution of the disk and corona, coupled by the vertical
mass exchange. We also discuss the possibility of presence of an inner optically thin flow, namely
the Advection-Dominated Accretion Flow (ADAF). We found that the outburst character strongly
depends on the magnetic field and the outer radius of the disk if this radius is smaller (due to TDE
phenomenon) than the size of the instability zone in a stationary disk with infinite radius. For
microquasars, the dependence on the magnetic field is monotonic, and the period decreases with
the field strength. For larger black hole masses, the dependence is non-monotonic, and initial
rise of the period is later replaced with the relatively rapid decrease as the magnetic field continues
to rise. Still stronger magnetic field stabilizes the disk. Our computations confirm that the radiation
pressure instability model can account for heartbeat states in microquasars. Rapid variability
detected in IMBH in the form of Quasi-Periodic Ejection can be consistent with the model but only
if combined with TDE phenomenon. Yearly repeating variability in Changing Look AGN also requires,
in our model, small outer radius either due to the recent TDE or due to the presence of the gap in the
disk related to the presence of a secondary black hole.

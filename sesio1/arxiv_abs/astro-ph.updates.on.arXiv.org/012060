The geometry of electrodes is one of the most important factors in determining the performance of
orthogonal-strip detectors. The aim of this work is to study the performance of a 5 mm thick cross-strip
CdZnTe detector with different electrode widths. Our study consists of two main parts, simulations
and experiments. We utilized four different anode sizes ranging from 0.1 mm to 0.6 mm. The anodes
were interspersed with steering electrodes with varying sizes from 0.3 mm to 0.85 mm. The maximum
gap size between the anodes and steering electrode strips was set to 0.3 mm, while the minimum gap
size was 0.125 mm. The performance of the detector was investigated in terms of the steering electrode
bias voltage, the energy resolution, and the charge sharing effect. For simulations, we developed
a C++ based simulation program for charge transport inside the CdZnTe detector and charge collection
at the electrodes. For photon interactions we used GEANT4 toolkit and for electric field and weighting
potential simulations we used COMSOL software. The results demonstrated that -50 V is the optimal
steering electrode bias for our detector when -500 V was applied to the cathodes and that the energy
resolution performance drops with increasing steering electrode width. Also, the charge sharing
effect becomes more dominant for larger steering electrode sizes. The experimental result are
further compared with the simulations. The results are in a good agreement and the comparison validates
our simulation model. Although, our simulation framework has need of better estimation for the
intrinsic noise of CdZnTe. These results suggest that an optimization study between electrode
widths and steering electrode bias is required to obtain the best performance in orthogonal-strip
CdZnTe detectors.

Lava worlds belong to a class of short orbital period planets reaching dayside temperatures high
enough to melt their silicate crust. Theory predicts that the resulting lava oceans outgas their
volatile components, attaining equilibrium with the overlying vapour. This creates a tenuous,
silicate-rich atmosphere that may be confined to the permanent dayside of the planet. The launch
of JWST will provide the much needed sensitivity and spectral coverage to characterise these worlds.
In this paper, we assess the observability of characterisable spectral features by self-consistently
modelling silicate atmospheres for all the currently confirmed targets having sufficient substellar
temperatures (> 1500 K). To achieve this we use outgassed equilibrium chemistry and radiative transfer
methods to compute temperature-pressure profiles, atmospheric chemical compositions and emission
spectra. We explore varying melt compositions, free of highly-volatile elements, accounting
for possible atmospheric evolution. Our models include a large number of neutral and ionic species,
as well as all up-to-date opacities. The results indicate that SiO and SiO2 infrared features are
the best, unique identifiers of silicate atmospheres, detectable using MIRI instrument of JWST.
Detection of these two species in emission would allow for strong constraints on atmospheric thermal
structure and possibly the composition of the melt. We also propose that certain species, e.g.,
TiO, may be directly tied to different classes of melts, possibly revealing surface and interior
dynamics. Currently, there are nearly a dozen confirmed lava planets ideal for characterisation
of silicate atmospheres using JWST, with two of these already accepted for the initial General Observers
program.

A recent hydrodynamic model, "radiation-driven fountain model" (Wada et al. 2016), presented
a dynamical picture that active galactic nuclei (AGNs) tori sustain their geometrical thickness
by gas circulation around AGNs, and previous papers confirmed that this picture is consistent with
multi-wavelength observations of nearby Seyfert galaxies. Recent near-infrared observations
implied that CO rovibrational absorption lines ($\Delta J=\pm1$, $v=0-1$, $\lambda \sim 4.7$
$\mathrm{\mu m}$) could probe physical properties of the inside tori. However, the origin of the
CO absorption lines has been under debate. In this paper, we investigate the origin of the absorption
lines and conditions for detecting them by performing line radiative transfer calculations based
on the radiation-driven fountain model. We find that CO rovibrational absorption lines are detected
at inclination angles $\theta_\mathrm{obs} = 50-80$ $^{\circ}$. At the inclination angle $\theta_\mathrm{obs}
= 77$ $^{\circ}$, we observe multi-velocity components: inflow ($v_\mathrm{LOS}=30$ $\mathrm{kms^{-1}}$),
systemic ($v_\mathrm{LOS}=0 \, \mathrm{kms^{-1}}$), and outflows ($v_\mathrm{LOS}=-75,\,
-95,$ and $-105$ $\mathrm{kms^{-1}}$). The inflow and outflow components ($v_\mathrm{LOS}=
30$ and $-95$ $\mathrm{kms^{-1}}$) are collisionally excited at the excitation temperature of
$186$ and $380$ K up to $J=12$ and $4$, respectively. The inflow and outflow components originate
from the accreting gas on the equatorial plane at $1.5$ pc from the AGN center and the outflowing gas
driven by AGN radiation pressure at $1.0$ pc, respectively. These results suggest that CO rovibrational
absorption lines can provide us with the velocities and kinetic temperatures of the inflow and outflow
in the inner a-few-pc regions of AGN tori, and the observations can probe the gas circulation inside
the tori.

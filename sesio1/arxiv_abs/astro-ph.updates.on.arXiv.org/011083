Hot Jupiters are very good targets for transmission spectroscopy analysis. Their atmospheres
have a large scale height implying a high signal to noise ratio. As these planets orbit close to their
stars, they often present strong thermal and chemical hetereogeneities between the day and the
night side of their atmosphere. For the hottest ones, the thermal dissociation of several species
occurs in their atmospheres which leads to a stronger chemical dichotomy between the two hemispheres.
It has already been shown that the current retrieval algorithms, which are using 1D forward models,
find biased molecular abundances in ultra hot Jupiters. Here, we quantify the effective temperature
domain over which these biases are present. We use a set of 12 simulations of typical Hot Jupiters
from Teq = 1000 K to Teq = 2100 K performed with the Substellar and Planetary Atmospheric Radiation
and Circulation global climate model and generate transmission spectra that fully account for
the 3D structure of the atmosphere with Pytmosph3R. These spectra are then analyzed using the 1D
TauREx retrieval code. We find that for JWST-like data, accounting for non-isothermal vertical
temperature profiles is required over the whole temperature range. We further find that 1D retrieval
codes start to estimate wrong parameter values for planets with equilibrium temperatures greater
than 1400 K if there are absorbers in the visible able to create a hot stratosphere. The high temperatures
at low pressures indeed entail a thermal dissociation of species which creates a strong chemical
day-night dichotomy. As a by-product, we demonstrate that when using synthetic observations to
assess the detectability of a given feature or process using a Bayesian framework, it is valid to
use non-randomized input data, as long as the anticipated observational uncertainties are correctly
taken into account.

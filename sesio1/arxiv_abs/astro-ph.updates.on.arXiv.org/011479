We investigate the evolution of dust and gas in the vicinity of local pressure enhancements (pressure
bumps) in a protoplanetary disc (PPD) with turbulence due to the Vertical Shear Instability (VSI).
We perform global 2D axisymmetric and 3D simulations of dust and gas for a range of values for Z (ratio
of dust-to-gas (d/g) surface mass densities or metallicity), particle Stokes numbers tau, and
pressure bump amplitude A. Dust feedback onto the gas is included. For the first time we demonstrate
in global 3D simulations the collection of dust in long-lived vortices induced by the VSI. Without
a pressure bump and for Z~0.01 and tau~0.01 we find that such vortices reach d/g density ratios slightly
below unity in the discs mid-plane, while for Z>0.05 long-lived vortices are largely absent. In
presence of a pressure bump, for Z~0.01 & tau~0.01 a dusty vortex forms reaching d/g ratios of a few
times unity, such that the SI is expected to develop, before it eventually shears out into a turbulent
dust ring. For Z~0.03 this occurs for tau~0.005, with a weaker, more short-lived vortex, while for
larger tau only a turbulent dust ring forms. For Z>0.03 we find that the dust ring becomes increasingly
axisymmetric for increasing tau and d/g ratios reach ~1 for tau>0.005. Furthermore, the disc's
vertical mass flow profile is strongly affected by dust for Z>0.03, such that gas is transported
inward near the mid-plane and outward at larger heights, i.e. the reversed situation compared to
simulations with zero or small amounts of dust. Viscous $\alpha$-values drop moderately as 0.001-0.0001
for increasing Z=0-0.05. Our results suggest that the VSI can play an active role in planetesimal
formation through the formation of vortices for plausible values of Z and tau. Also it may provide
a natural explanation for the presence/absence of asymmetries of observed dust rings in PPDs, depending
on the value of Z.

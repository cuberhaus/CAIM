At ~50 Mpc, the Hydra I cluster of galaxies is among the closest cluster in the z=0 Universe, and an
ideal environment to study dwarf galaxy properties in a cluster environment. We exploit deep imaging
data of the Hydra I cluster to construct a new photometric catalog of dwarf galaxies in the cluster
core, which is then used to derive properties of the Hydra I cluster dwarf galaxies population as
well as to compare with other clusters. Moreover, we investigate the dependency of dwarf galaxy
properties on their surrounding environment. The new Hydra I dwarf catalog contains 317 galaxies
with luminosity between -18.5<$M_r$<-11.5 mag, a semi-major axis larger than ~200 pc (a=0.84 arcsec),
of which 202 are new detections, previously unknown dwarf galaxies in the Hydra I central region.
We estimate that our detection efficiency reaches 50% at the limiting magnitude $M_r$=-11.5 mag,
and at the mean effective surface brightness $\overline{\mu}_{e,r}$=26.5 mag/$arcsec^2$. We
present the standard scaling relations for dwarf galaxies and compare them with other nearby clusters.
We find that there are no observational differences for dwarfs scaling relations in clusters of
different sizes. We study the spatial distribution of galaxies, finding evidence for the presence
of substructures within half the virial radius. We also find that mid- and high-luminosity dwarfs
($M_r$<-14.5 mag) become on average redder toward the cluster center, and that they have a mild increase
in $R_e$ with increasing clustercentric distance, similar to what is observed for the Fornax cluster.
No clear clustercentric trends are reported with surface brightness and S\'ersic index. Considering
galaxies in the same magnitude-bins, we find that for high and mid-luminosity dwarfs ($M_r$<-13.5
mag) the g-r color is redder for the brighter surface brightness and higher S\'ersic n index objects.

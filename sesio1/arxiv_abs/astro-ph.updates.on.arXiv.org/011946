During star formation, the dense gas undergoes significant chemical evolution leading to the emergence
of a rich variety of molecules associated with hot cores and hot corinos. The physical and chemical
conditions are poorly constrained; the early phases of emerging hot cores in particular represent
an unexplored territory. We provide here a full molecular inventory of a massive protostellar core
that is proposed to be a precursor of a hot core. We performed an unbiased spectral survey towards
the hot core precursor associated with clump G328.2551-0.5321 between 159GHz and 374GHz. To identify
the spectral lines, we used rotational diagrams and radiative transfer modelling assuming LTE.
We detected 39 species and 26 isotopologues, and were able to distinguish a warm and compact inner
region, a colder more extended envelope, and the kinematic signatures of the accretion shocks that
have previously been observed with ALMA. We associate most of the emission of the small molecules
with the cold gas, while the molecular emission of the warm gas is enriched by complex organic molecules
(COMs). We find a high abundance of S-bearing molecules in the cold gas phase suggesting a low sulphur
depletion, with a factor of > 1%. We identify nine COMs in the warm gas, four in the cold gas, and four
towards the accretion shocks. The high abundances of S-bearing species originating from the undisturbed
gas may suggest a contribution from shocked gas at the outflow cavity walls. The molecular composition
of the warm gas is similar to that of both hot cores and hot corinos, but the molecular abundances are
closer to the values found towards hot corinos than to values found towards hot cores. Considering
the compactness of the warm region and its moderate temperature, we suggest that thermal desorption
has not been completed towards this object yet, representing an early phase of the emergence of hot
cores.

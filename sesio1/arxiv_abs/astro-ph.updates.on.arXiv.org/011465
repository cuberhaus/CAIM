We present a non-parametric Lagrangian biasing model and fit the ratio of the halo and mass densities
at the field level using the mass-weighted halo field in the AbacusSummit simulations at $z=0.5$.
Unlike the perturbative halo bias model widely used in interpreting the observed large-scale structure
traced by galaxies, we find a non-negative halo-to-mass ratio that increases monotonically with
the linear overdensity $\delta_1$ in the initial Lagrangian space. The bias expansion, however,
does not guarantee non-negativity of the halo counts, and may give rising halo number counts at negative
overdensities. The shape of the halo-to-mass ratio is unlikely to be described by a polynomial of
$\delta_1$ and other quantities. Especially for massive halos with $6\times10^{12}\ h^{-1}\
M_\odot$, the halo-to-mass ratio starts soaring up at $\delta_1>0$, substantially different
from the predictions of the bias expansion. We show that for the halo masses we consider ($M>3\times10^{11}\
h^{-1}\ M_\odot$) a non-parametric halo-to-mass ratio as a function of $\delta_1$ and its local
derivative $\nabla^2\delta_1$ can recover the halo power spectra to sub-percent level for wavenumbers
$k=0.01-0.1\ h\ {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ given a proper smoothing scale to filter the initial density field,
even though we do not fit the power spectrum directly. However, there is mild dependence of the recovery
of the halo power spectrum on the smoothing scale and other input parameters. At $k<0.01\ h\ {\rm
Mpc}^{-1}$ and for massive halos with $M>6\times10^{12}\ h^{-1}\ M_\odot$, our non-parametric
model leads to a few percent overestimation of the halo power spectrum, indicating the need for larger
or multiple smoothing scales. The halo-to-mass ratios obtained qualitatively agree with intuitions
from extended Press-Schechter theory. We compare our framework to the bias expansion and discuss
possible extensions.

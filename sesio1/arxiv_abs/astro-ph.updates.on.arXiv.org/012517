The VISTA Variables in the Via L\'actea Extended Survey (VVVX) allows probing previously unexplored
regions of the inner Milky Way (MW). We are looking for new candidate globular clusters (GCs), with
the aim of completing the census of the MW GC system. We searched and characterised new GCs, using
a combination of the near-IR VVVX survey and 2MASS datasets, and the optical Gaia EDR3 photometry
and its precise proper motions (PMs). We report the discovery of a new Galactic GC, named Garro 02,
situated at RA=18:05:51.1, Dec=-17:42:02 and l=12.042 deg, b=+1.656 deg. Performing a PM-decontamination
procedure, we built a final catalogue with all cluster members, on which we performed a photometric
analysis. We calculated a reddening of $E(J-K_s)=1.07\pm 0.06$ mag and extinction of $A_{Ks}=0.79\pm
0.04$ mag in the near-IR; while $E(BP-RP)=2.40\pm 0.01$ mag and $A_{G}=4.80\pm 0.02$ mag in optical
passbands. Its heliocentric distance is $D=5.6\pm 0.8$ kpc, which places Garro 02 at a Galactocentric
distance of $R_G=2.9$ kpc and Z=0.006 kpc above the Galactic plane. We estimated the metallicity
and age by comparison with known GCs and by fitting PARSEC isochrones, finding [Fe/H]$=-1.30\pm
0.2$ dex and age=$12\pm 2$ Gyr. We derived the mean cluster PM of $(\mu_{\alpha}^{\ast}, \mu_{\delta})
= (-6.07\pm 0.62, -6.15\pm 0.75)$ mas yr$^{-1}$. We calculated the cluster luminosity in the near-IR
of $M_{Ks}=-7.52\pm 1.23$ mag, which is equivalent to $M_{V}=-5.44$ mag. The core and tidal radii
from the radial density profile are $r_c =1.25\pm 0.27$ arcmin (2.07 pc) and $r_t = 7.13\pm 3.83$
arcmin (11.82 pc), respectively. We confirm Garro 02 as a new genuine Galactic GC, located in the
MW bulge. It is a low-luminosity, metal-poor, and old GC, and it is a lucky survivor of the strong dynamical
processes that occurred during the MW's entire life.

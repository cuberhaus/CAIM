The possibility of identifying co-natal stars that have dispersed into the Galactic disc based
on chemistry only is called strong chemical tagging. Its feasibility has been debated for a long
time, with the promise of reconstructing the detailed star-formation history of a large fraction
of stars in the Galactic disc. We investigate the feasibility of strong chemical tagging using known
member stars of open clusters. We analysed the largest sample of cluster members that have been homogeneously
characterised with high-resolution differential abundances for 16 different elements. We also
investigated the possibility of finding the known clusters in the APOGEE DR16 red clump sample with
18 chemical species. For both purposes, we used a clustering algorithm and an unsupervised dimensionality
reduction technique to blindly search for groups of stars in chemical space. Even if the internal
coherence of the stellar abundances in the same cluster is high, typically 0.03 dex, the overlap
in the chemical signatures of the clusters is large. In the sample with the highest precision and
no field stars, we only recover 9 out of the 31 analysed clusters at a 40% threshold of homogeneity
and precision. This ratio slightly increases when we only use clusters with 7 or more members. In
the APOGEE sample, field stars are present along with four populated clusters. In this case, only
one of the open clusters was moderately recovered. In our best-case scenario, more than 70% of the
groups of stars are in fact statistical groups that contain stars belonging to different real clusters.
This indicates that the chances of recovering the majority of birth clusters dissolved in the field
are slim, even with the most advanced clustering techniques. We show that different stellar birth
sites can have overlapping chemical signatures [abridged]

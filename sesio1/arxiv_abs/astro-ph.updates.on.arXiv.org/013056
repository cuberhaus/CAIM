Abell 1033 is a merging galaxy cluster of moderate mass (M500 = 3.2e14 Msun) which hosts a broad variety
of diffuse radio sources linked to different astrophysical phenomena. The most peculiar one is
an ultra-steep spectrum elongated feature which is the prototype of the category of gently re-energized
tails (GReET). In addition, the cluster hosts sources previously classified as a radio phoenix
and a radio halo. In this work, we aim to improve the understanding of the cosmic ray acceleration
mechanisms in galaxy clusters in a frequency and mass range poorly explored so far. To investigate
the ultra-steep synchrotron emission in the cluster, we perform a full calibration of a LOFAR observation
centered at 54 MHz. We analyze this observation together with re-calibrated data of the LOFAR Two-meter
Sky Survey at 144 MHz and an archival GMRT observation at 323 MHz. We perform a spectral study of the
radio galaxy tail connected to the GReET to test if the current interpretation of the source is in
agreement with observational evidence below 100 MHz. Additionally, we study the radio halo at different
frequencies. We report an extreme spectral curvature for the GReET, the spectral index flattens
from $\alpha_{144}^{323} = -4$ to $\alpha_{54}^{144} = -2$. This indicates the presence of a cut-off
in the electron energy spectrum. At the cluster center, we detect the radio halo at 54, 144 and at lower
significance at 323 MHz. We categorize it as an ultra-steep spectrum radio halo with a spectral index
$\alpha = -1.65 \pm 0.17$. Additionally, it is found to be significantly above the radio power-to-cluster
mass correlations reported in the literature. Furthermore, the synchrotron spectrum of the halo
is found to further steepen between 144 and 323 MHz, in agreement with the presence of a break in the
electron spectrum, which is a prediction of homogeneous re-acceleration models.

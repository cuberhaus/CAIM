Modeling of strong gravitational lenses is a necessity for further applications in astrophysics
and cosmology. Especially with the large number of detections in current and upcoming surveys such
as the Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), it is timely to investigate in automated and fast
analysis techniques beyond the traditional and time consuming Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling
methods. Building upon our convolutional neural network (CNN) presented in Schuldt et al. (2021b),
we present here another CNN, specifically a residual neural network (ResNet), that predicts the
five mass parameters of a Singular Isothermal Ellipsoid (SIE) profile (lens center $x$ and $y$,
ellipticity $e_x$ and $e_y$, Einstein radius $\theta_E$) and the external shear ($\gamma_{ext,1}$,
$\gamma_{ext,2}$) from ground-based imaging data. In contrast to our CNN, this ResNet further
predicts a 1$\sigma$ uncertainty for each parameter. To train our network, we use our improved pipeline
from Schuldt et al. (2021b) to simulate lens images using real images of galaxies from the Hyper Suprime-Cam
Survey (HSC) and from the Hubble Ultra Deep Field as lens galaxies and background sources, respectively.
We find overall very good recoveries for the SIE parameters, while differences remain in predicting
the external shear. From our tests, most likely the low image resolution is the limiting factor for
predicting the external shear. Given the run time of milli-seconds per system, our network is perfectly
suited to predict the next appearing image and time delays of lensed transients in time. Therefore,
we also present the performance of the network on these quantities in comparison to our simulations.
Our ResNet is able to predict the SIE and shear parameter values in fractions of a second on a single
CPU such that we are able to process efficiently the huge amount of expected galaxy-scale lenses
in the near future.

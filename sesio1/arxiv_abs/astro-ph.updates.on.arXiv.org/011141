The Deep Space Network is NASA's international array of antennas that support interplanetary spacecraft
missions. A track is a block of multi-dimensional time series from the beginning to end of DSN communication
with the target spacecraft, containing thousands of monitor data items lasting several hours at
a frequency of 0.2-1Hz. Monitor data on each track reports on the performance of specific spacecraft
operations and the DSN itself. DSN is receiving signals from 32 spacecraft across the solar system.
DSN has pressure to reduce costs while maintaining the quality of support for DSN mission users.
DSN Link Control Operators need to simultaneously monitor multiple tracks and identify anomalies
in real time. DSN has seen that as the number of missions increases, the data that needs to be processed
increases over time. In this project, we look at the last 8 years of data for analysis. Any anomaly
in the track indicates a problem with either the spacecraft, DSN equipment, or weather conditions.
DSN operators typically write Discrepancy Reports for further analysis. It is recognized that
it would be quite helpful to identify 10 similar historical tracks out of the huge database to quickly
find and match anomalies. This tool has three functions: (1) identification of the top 10 similar
historical tracks, (2) detection of anomalies compared to the reference normal track, and (3) comparison
of statistical differences between two given tracks. The requirements for these features were
confirmed by survey responses from 21 DSN operators and engineers. The preliminary machine learning
model has shown promising performance (AUC=0.92). We plan to increase the number of data sets and
perform additional testing to improve performance further before its planned integration into
the track visualizer interface to assist DSN field operators and engineers.

[abridged] We present new scattered light and millimeter observations of the protoplanetary disk
around LkH$\alpha\,330$, using SPHERE/VLT and ALMA respectively. The scattered-light SPHERE
observations reveal an asymmetric ring at around 45\,au distance from the star in addition to two
spiral arms with similar radial launching points at around 90\,au. The millimeter observations
from ALMA (resolution of 0.06''$\times$0.04'') show mainly an asymmetric ring located at 110\,au
distance from the star. In addition to this asymmetry, there are two faint symmetric rings at 60\,au
and 200\,au. The $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O lines seem to be less abundant in the inner disk
(these observations have a resolution of 0.16''$\times$0.11''). The $^{13}$CO peaks at a location
similar to the inner ring observed with SPHERE, suggesting that this line is optically thick and
traces variations of disk temperature instead of gas surface density variations, while the C$^{18}$O
peaks slightly further away at around 60\,au. We compare our observations with hydrodynamical
simulations that include gas and dust evolution, and conclude that a 10\,$M_{\rm{Jup}}$ mass planet
at 60\,au and in an eccentric orbit ($e=0.1$) can qualitatively explain most of the observed structures.
A planet in a circular orbit leads to a much narrower concentration in the millimeter emission, while
a planet in a more eccentric orbit leads to a very eccentric cavity as well. In addition, the outer
spiral arm launched by the planet changes its pitch angle along the spiral due to the eccentricity
and when it interacts with the vortex, potentially appearing in observations as two distinct spirals.
Our observations and models show that LkH$\alpha\,330$, is an exciting target to search for (eccentric-)
planets while they are still embedded in their parental disk, making it an excellent candidate for
studies on planet-disk interaction.

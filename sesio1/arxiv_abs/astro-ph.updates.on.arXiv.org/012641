Powerful outflows are thought to play a critical role in galaxy evolution and black hole growth.
We present the first large-scale systematic study of ionised outflows in paired galaxies and post-mergers
compared to a robust control sample of isolated galaxies. We isolate the impact of the merger environment
to determine if outflow properties depend on merger stage. Our sample contains $\sim$4,000 paired
galaxies and $\sim$250 post-mergers in the local universe ($0.02 \leq z \leq 0.2$) from the SDSS
DR 7 matched in stellar mass, redshift, local density of galaxies, and [OIII] $\lambda$5007 luminosity
to a control sample of isolated galaxies. By fitting the [OIII] $\lambda$5007 line, we find ionised
outflows in $\sim$15 per cent of our entire sample. Outflows are much rarer in star-forming galaxies
compared to AGN, and outflow incidence and velocity increase with [OIII] $\lambda$5007 luminosity.
Outflow incidence is significantly elevated in the optical+mid-infrared selected AGN compared
to purely optical AGN; over 60 per cent show outflows at the highest luminosities ($L_{\mathrm{[OIII]
\lambda5007}}$ $\gtrsim$ 10$^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$), suggesting mid-infrared AGN selection favours
galaxies with powerful outflows, at least for higher [OIII] $\lambda$5007 luminosities. However,
we find no statistically significant difference in outflow incidence, velocity, and luminosity
in mergers compared to isolated galaxies, and there is no dependence on merger stage. Therefore,
while interactions are predicted to drive gas inflows and subsequently trigger nuclear star formation
and accretion activity, when the power source of the outflow is controlled for, the merging environment
has no further impact on the large-scale ionised outflows as traced by [OIII] $\lambda5007$.

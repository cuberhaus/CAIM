Cross-correlations between Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature and polarization
anisotropies and $\mu$-spectral distortions have been considered to measure (squeezed) primordial
scalar bispectra in a range of scales inaccessible to primary CMB bispectra. In this work we address
whether it is possible to constrain tensor non-Gaussianities with these cross-correlations.
We find that only primordial tensor bispectra with statistical anisotropies leave distinct signatures,
while isotropic tensor bispectra leave either vanishing or highly suppressed signatures. We discuss
how the angular dependence of squeezed bispectra in terms of the short and long momenta determine
the non-zero cross-correlations. We also discuss how these non-vanishing configurations are
affected by the way in which primordial bispectra transform under parity. By employing the so-called
BipoSH formalism to capture the observational effects of statistical anisotropies, we make Fisher-forecasts
to assess the detection prospects from $\mu T$, $\mu E$ and $\mu B$ cross-correlations. Observing
statistical anisotropies in squeezed $\langle \gamma \gamma \gamma\rangle$ and $\langle \gamma
\gamma \zeta\rangle$ bispectra is going to be challenging as the imprint of tensor perturbations
on $\mu$-distortions is subdominant to scalar perturbations, therefore requiring a large, independent
amplification of the effect of tensor perturbations in the $\mu$-epoch. In absence of such a mechanism,
statistical anisotropies in squeezed $\langle \zeta \zeta \gamma\rangle$ bispectrum are the
most relevant sources of $\mu T$, $\mu E$ and $\mu B$ cross-correlations. In particular, we point
out that in anisotropic inflationary models where $\langle \zeta \zeta \zeta \rangle$ leaves potentially
observable signatures in $\mu T$ and $\mu E$, the detection prospects of $\langle \zeta \zeta \gamma\rangle$
from $\mu B$ are enhanced.

The observed atmospheric spectrum of exoplanets and brown dwarfs depends critically on the presence
and distribution of atmospheric condensates. The Ackerman & Marley (2001) methodology for predicting
the vertical distribution of condensate particles is widely used to study cloudy atmospheres and
has recently been implemented in an open-source python package virga. The model relies upon input
parameter $f_{\text{sed}}$, the sedimentation efficiency, which until now has been held constant.
The relative simplicity of this model renders it useful for retrieval studies due to its rapidly
attainable solutions. However, comparisons with more complex microphysical models such as CARMA
have highlighted inconsistencies between the two approaches, namely that the cloud parameters
needed for radiative transfer produced by virga are dissimilar to those produced by CARMA. To address
these discrepancies, we have extended the original Ackerman and Marley methodology in virga to
allow for non-constant $f_{\text{sed}}$ values, in particular those that vary with altitude.
We discuss one such parameterization and compare the cloud mass mixing ratio produced by virga with
constant and variable $f_{\text{sed}}$ profiles to that produced by CARMA. We find that the variable
$f_{\text{sed}}$ formulation better captures the profile produced by CARMA with heterogeneous
nucleation, yet performs comparatively to constant $f_{\text{sed}}$ for homogeneous nucleation.
In general, virga has the capacity to handle any $f_{\text{sed}}$ with an explicit anti-derivative,
permitting a plethora of alternative cloud profiles that are otherwise unattainable by constant
$f_{\text{sed}}$ values. The ensuing flexibility has the potential to better agree with increasingly
complex models and observed data.

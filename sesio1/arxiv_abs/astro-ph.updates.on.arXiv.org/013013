One of the novelties of the Gaia-DR3 with respect to the previous data releases is the publication
of the multiband light curves of about 1 million AGN. The goal of this work was the creation of a catalogue
of variable AGN, whose selection was based on Gaia data only. We first present the implementation
of the methods to estimate the variability parameters into a specific object study module for AGN.
Then we describe the selection procedure that led to the definition of the high-purity variable
AGN sample and analyse the properties of the selected sources. We started from a sample of millions
of sources, which were identified as AGN candidates by 11 different classifiers based on variability
processing. Because the focus was on the variability properties, we first defined some pre-requisites
in terms of number of data points and mandatory variability parameters. Then a series of filters
was applied using only Gaia data and the Gaia Celestial Reference Frame 3 (Gaia-CRF3) sample as a
reference.The resulting Gaia AGN variable sample, named GLEAN, contains about 872000 objects,
more than 21000 of which are new identifications. We checked the presence of contaminants by cross-matching
the selected sources with a variety of galaxies and stellar catalogues. The completeness of GLEAN
with respect to the variable AGN in the last Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasar catalogue is about 47%,
while that based on the variable AGN of the Gaia-CRF3 sample is around 51%. From both a comparison
with other AGN catalogues and an investigation of possible contaminants, we conclude that purity
can be expected to be above 95%. Multiwavelength properties of these sources are investigated.
In particular, we estimate that about 4% of them are radio-loud. We finally explore the possibility
to evaluate the time lags between the flux variations of the multiple images of strongly lensed quasars,
and show one case.

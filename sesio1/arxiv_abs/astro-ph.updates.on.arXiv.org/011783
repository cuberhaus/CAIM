The characterization of exoplanets, their formation, evolution and chemical changes is tightly
linked to the knowledge of their host stars. In particular stellar X-rays and UV emission have strong
impact on the dynamical and chemical evolution of planetary atmospheres. We analyzed 25 XMM-Newton
observations encompassing about eight years and totaling to about 958 ks in order to study the X-ray
emission of HD 189733 A. We find that the corona of HD 189733 A has an average temperature of 0.4 keV
and only during flares the mean temperature increases to 0.9 keV. Except for flares, there is no significant
change in the flux and hardness of the coronal emission on a time scale of several months to years,
from this we conclude that there is no detectable activity cycle on such a time scale. We identified
the flares and built their energy distribution. The number of flares observed around the phases
of the planetary eclipses is not statistically different from the number of flares during transit
phases. However, we do find a hint of a difference in the flare-energy distributions as the flares
observed around the planetary eclipses tend to be more energetic than the flares observed around
the primary transits of the planet. The distribution of the number of flares per day is modeled with
a power law, and it results steeper than the one observed in the Sun and in other Main Sequence stars.
The steepness hints a significant fraction of undetected micro-flares. Altogether, the plasma
temperatures below 1 keV observed during the flares and the slightly larger fraction of energetic
flares seen at the secondary transits highlight a peculiarity of the corona of HD 189733 A and point
to an origin of its X-ray emission partly due to star-planet interaction. However, more observational
and modeling efforts are required to confirm or disprove this scenario.

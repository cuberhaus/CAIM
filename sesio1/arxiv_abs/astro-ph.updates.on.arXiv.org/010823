We present and publicly release (https://www.gclasshst.com) the first spatially resolved H$\alpha$
maps of star-forming cluster galaxies at $z\sim1$, made possible with the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3)
G141 grism on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Using a similar but updated method to 3D-HST in the
field environment, we stack the H$\alpha$ maps in bins of stellar mass, measure the half-light radius
of the H$\alpha$ distribution and compare it to the stellar continuum. The ratio of the H$\alpha$
to stellar continuum half-light radius, $R[\mathrm{H}\alpha/\mathrm{C}]=\frac{R_{\mathrm{eff,
H}\alpha}}{R_{\mathrm{eff, Cont}}}$, is smaller in the clusters by $(6\pm9)\%$, but statistically
consistent within $1\sigma$ uncertainties. A negligible difference in $R[\mathrm{H}\alpha/\mathrm{C}]$
with environment is surprising, given the higher quenched fractions in the clusters relative to
the field. We postulate that the combination of high quenched fractions and no change in $R[\mathrm{H}\alpha/\mathrm{C}]$
with environment can be reconciled if environmental quenching proceeds rapidly. We investigate
this hypothesis by performing similar analysis on the spectroscopically-confirmed recently
quenched cluster galaxies. 87% have H$\alpha$ detections, with star formation rates $8\pm1$ times
lower than star-forming cluster galaxies of similar stellar mass. Importantly, these galaxies
have a $R[\mathrm{H}\alpha/\mathrm{C}]$ that is $(81\pm8)\%$ smaller than coeval star-forming
field galaxies at fixed stellar mass. This suggests the environmental quenching process occurred
outside-in. We conclude that disk truncation due to ram-pressure stripping is occurring in cluster
galaxies at $z\sim1$, but more rapidly and/or efficiently than in $z\lesssim0.5$ clusters, such
that the effects on $R[\mathrm{H}\alpha/\mathrm{C}]$ become observable just after the cluster
galaxy has recently quenched.

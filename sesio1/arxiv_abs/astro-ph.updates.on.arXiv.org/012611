This paper is part of a study of the apsidal motion in close eccentric massive binary systems, which
aims to constrain the internal structure of the stars. We focus on the binary CPD-41{\deg}7742 and
revisit HD152218. Independent studies of CPD-41{\deg}7742 in the past showed large discrepancies
in the longitude of periastron of the orbit, hinting at the presence of apsidal motion. We perform
a consistent analysis of all observational data, explicitly accounting for the apsidal motion.
We use spectroscopic and photometric observations of CPD-41{\deg}7742 to infer values for the
fundamental stellar and binary parameters. We apply a disentangling method to the spectra to simultaneously
derive the RVs at the times of observation and reconstruct the individual stellar spectra. These
are analysed by means of CMFGEN to determine the stellar properties. We determine the apsidal motion
rate in two ways: We complement our RVs with those reported in the literature and we use the phase shifts
between the primary and secondary eclipses. The light curves are analysed by means of Nightfall
to constrain the orbital inclination and stellar masses. Stellar structure and evolution models
are constructed with Cles. Different prescriptions for the mixing are adopted. Photometric data
of HD152218 are analysed and stellar evolution models are built. The binary CPD-41{\deg}7742 displays
apsidal motion at a rate of 15.38+0.42-0.51{\deg} yr-1. Our analysis of the observational data
of CPD-41{\deg}7742 explicitly accounting for the apsidal motion allows us to explain the discrepancy
in periastron longitudes. The age estimates are in good agreement with estimates obtained for other
massive binaries in NGC 6231. This study confirms the need for enhanced mixing in the stellar evolution
models to reproduce the observational stellar properties; this points towards larger convective
cores than usually considered.

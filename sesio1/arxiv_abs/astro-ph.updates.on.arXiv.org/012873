We report a one-second-cadence wide-field survey for M-dwarf flares using the Tomo-e Gozen camera
mounted on the Kiso Schmidt telescope. We detect 22 flares from M3-M5 dwarfs with rise times and amplitudes
ranging from $5\, \mathrm{sec} \lesssim t_\mathrm{rise} \lesssim 100\,\mathrm{sec}$ and $0.5
\lesssim \Delta F/F_{\star} \lesssim 20$, respectively. The flare light curves mostly show steeper
rises and shallower decays than those obtained from the Kepler one-minute cadence data and tend
to have flat peak structures. Assuming a blackbody spectrum with temperatures of $9,000-15,000\,\mathrm{K}$,
the peak luminosities and bolometric energies are estimated to be $10^{29}\,\mathrm{erg\,sec^{-1}}
\lesssim L_\mathrm{peak} \lesssim 10^{31}\,\mathrm{erg\,sec^{-1}}$ and $10^{31}\,\mathrm{erg}
\lesssim E_{\rm bol} \lesssim 10^{34}\,\mathrm{erg}$, which constitutes the bright end of fast
optical flares for M dwarfs. We confirm that more than 90\% of the host stars of the detected flares
are magnetically active based on their H$\alpha$ emission line intensities obtained by LAMOST.
The estimated occurrence rate of the detected flares is $\sim 0.7$ per day per an active star, indicating
they are common in magnetically active M dwarfs. We argue that the flare light curves can be explained
by the chromospheric compression model; the rise time is broadly consistent with the Alfv\'en transit
time of a magnetic loop with a length scale of $l_\mathrm{loop} \sim 10^4\,\mathrm{km}$ and a field
strength of $1,000\,\mathrm{G}$, while the decay time is likely determined by the radiative cooling
of the compressed chromosphere down to near the photosphere with a temperature of $\gtrsim 10,000\,\mathrm{K}$.
These flares from M dwarfs could be a major contamination source for a future search of fast optical
transients of unknown types.

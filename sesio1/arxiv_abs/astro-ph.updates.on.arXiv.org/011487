Here we study the MonR2 star forming region, which has a rich network of filaments joining in a star
cluster forming hub, aiming at understanding the hub structure and to examine the mass fraction
residing in the hub and in the filaments, which is a key factor that influences massive star formation.
We conducted a multi-scale, multi-component analysis of the Herschel column density maps (resolution
of 18.2" or $\sim$0.07 pc at 830 pc) of the region using a newly developed algorithm "getsf" to identify
the structural components, namely, extended cloud, filaments, and sources. We find that cascades
of lower column density filaments coalesce to form higher density filaments eventually merging
inside the hub (0.8 pc radius). As opposed to the previous view of the hub as a massive clump with $\sim$1
pc radius, we find it to be a network of short high-density filaments. The total mass reservoir in
the MonR2 HFS (5 pc $\times$ 5 pc) is split between filaments (54%), extended cloud (37%) and sources
(9%). The M/L of filaments increase from $\sim$ 10 Msun/pc at 1.5pc from the hub to $\sim$ 100 Msun/pc
at its centre, while the number of filaments per annulus of 0.2pc width decreases from 20 to 2 in the
same range. The observed radial column density structure of the HFS (filament component only) displays
a power-law dependence of $N_{\mathrm{H}_2} \propto r^{-2.17}$ up to a radius of $\sim$2.5 pc from
the central hub, resembling a global collapse of the HFS. We present a scenario where the HFS can be
supported by magnetic fields which interact, merge and reorganize themselves as the filaments
coalesce. In the new view of the hub as a network of high-density filaments, we suggest that only the
stars located in the network can benefit from the longitudinal flows of gas to become massive, which
may explain the reason for the formation of many low-mass stars in cluster centres.

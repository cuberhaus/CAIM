The goal of this paper is to investigate the optimal parameters space for using the reloaded Rossiter-McLaughlin
technique to detect differential rotation (DR) and centre-to-limb convective variations. We
simulated a star-planet system with and without convective effects to map the optimal regions of
the parameter space for retrieving the injected differential rotation. Our simulations explored
all possible ranges of projected obliquity (spin-orbit angle), stellar inclination, and impact
parameter, as well as differences in instrumental configuration, stellar magnitude, and exposure
time. We find that DR is more easily retrieved at low-impact parameters, corresponding to system
configurations in which the transiting planet crosses the largest number of stellar latitudes.
The main hot-spots for detection (i.e. areas in which DR detectability is high) are $120^{\rm{o}}<|\lambda|<180^{\rm{o}}$
for $i_*<90^{\rm{o}}$ and $|\lambda|<60^{\rm{o}}$ for $i_*>90^{\rm{o}}$ on average, and they
tend to shrink as the impact parameter increases. Additionally, in contrast to the crucial impact
of brightness, we identify that exposure time has a negligible impact on the difficulty of detecting
DR as the increase in signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) at longer exposure times is counteracted by the
degraded sampling rate. We determine that an ESPRESSO-like setup of instrumental configuration
and sensitivity might retrieve DR up to $V = 12$, compared to $V = 10$ for HARPS. We reach no clear conclusion
about limb-dependent convective effects and the possible confusion with DR; preliminary results
suggest, however, that under certain circumstances, while it seems that one effect could be mistaken
for the other, the accuracy of the fit (in particular of $\alpha$) does not hold up under additional
scrutiny.

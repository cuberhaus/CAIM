The magnetic activity of the Sun changes with the solar cycle. Similar cycles are found in other stars
as well, but their details are not known to a similar degree. Characterising stellar magnetic cycles
is important for the understanding of the stellar and solar dynamos that are driving the magnetic
activity. We present spectropolarimetric observations of five young, solar-type stars, and compare
them to previous observations, with the aim to identify and characterise stellar equivalents of
the solar cycle. We use Zeeman-Doppler imaging (ZDI) to map the surface magnetic field and brightness
of our targets. The magnetic field is decomposed into spherical harmonic expansions, from which
we report the strengths of the axisymmetric vs. non-axisymmetric, and poloidal vs. toroidal components,
and compare them to the Rossby numbers of the stars. We present five new ZDI-maps of young, solar-type
stars from Dec 2017. Of special interest is the case of V1358 Ori, that has gone through a polarity
reversal between our observations and earlier ones. A less evident polarity reversal might also
have occurred in HD 35296. There is a preference for more axisymmetric field, and possibly more toroidal
field, for the more active stars with lower Rossby number, but a larger sample should be studied to
draw any strong conclusions from this. For most of the individual stars, the amounts of toroidal
and poloidal field have stayed on similar levels as in earlier observations. We find evidence for
a magnetic polarity reversal having occurred in V1358 Ori. \c{hi}1 Ori could be an interesting target
for future observations, with a possible short magnetic cycle of a few years. The correlation between
the brightness maps and the magnetic field is mostly poor, which could indicate the presence of small-scale
magnetic features of different polarities, that cancel each other out, and are not resolved in our
maps.

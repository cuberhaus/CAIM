Studies of nearby spiral galaxies in radio and X-ray wavelengths reveal the structure and energy
balance of the magnetic fields and the hot interstellar medium (ISM). In some spiral galaxies, large-scale
ordered magnetic fields have been found between the spiral stellar arms (the so-called magnetic
arms). One of the considered explanations of their origin is magnetic reconnection, which according
to theoretical studies can efficiently heat the low-density ISM. We present, for the first time,
high-resolution C-band (5GHz) radio maps of the nearby face-on spiral galaxy M101 to study the magnetic
fields and verify the existence of the magnetic arms. The analysis of the archival XMM-Newton X-ray
data is performed to search for signatures of gas heating by magnetic reconnection effects in the
disk and the halo of this galaxy. We combine the Very Large Array (VLA) and Effelsberg radio maps of
M101 to restore the large-scale emission lost in the interferometric observations. From the obtained
maps, we derive magnetic field strengths and energy densities, and compare them with the properties
of the hot gas found with the spectral analysis of the X-ray data. Most of the X-ray emission likely
comes from the hot gas in the halo of M101. Its temperature is highest above the massive stellar arm
and an inter-arm region with enhanced polarised radio emission, as well as in the inter-arm area
where neither Halpha nor HI emission is visible. In regions outside of the spiral arms lower strengths,
energy densities and higher orders of the magnetic fields were observed. Although M101 does not
possess well-defined magnetic arms, a rudimentary magnetic arm was identified in one of the inter-arm
regions. We found weak signatures of additional heating of the ISM there, as well as in the galactic
halo, which could be explained by the action of magnetic reconnection.

We investigate the exoplanet candidate TOI-1422b, which was discovered by the TESS space telescope
around the high proper-motion G2V star TOI-1422 ($V=10.6$ mag), 155pc away, with the primary goal
of confirming its planetary nature and characterising its properties. We monitored TOI-1422 with
the HARPS-N spectrograph for 1.5 years to precisely quantify its radial velocity variation. The
radial velocity measurements are analyzed jointly with TESS photometry and we also check for blended
companions through high-spatial resolution images using the AstraLux instrument. We estimate
that the parent star has a radius and a mass of $R^*=1.019_{-0.013}^{+0.014} R_{\odot}$, $M^*=0.981_{-0.065}^{+0.062}
M_{\odot}$, respectively. Our analysis confirms the planetary nature of TOI-1422b and also suggests
the presence of a Neptune-mass planet on a more distant orbit, the candidate TOI-1422c, which is
not detected in TESS light curves. The inner planet, TOI-1422b, orbits on a period $P_{\rm b}=12.9972\pm0.0006$
days and has an equilibrium temperature $T_{\rm eq, b}=867\pm17$ K. With a radius of $R_{\rm b}=3.96^{+0.13}_{-0.11}
R_{\oplus}$, a mass of $M_{\rm b}=9.0^{+2.3}_{-2.0} M_{\oplus}$ and, consequently, a density
of $\rho_{\rm b}=0.795^{+0.290}_{-0.235}$ g cm$^{-3}$, it can be considered a warm Neptune-size
planet. Compared to other exoplanets of similar mass range, TOI-1422b is among the most inflated
ones and we expect this planet to have an extensive gaseous envelope that surrounds a core with a mass
fraction around $10\%-25\%$ of the total mass of the planet. The outer non-transiting planet candidate,
TOI-1422c, has an orbital period of $P_{\rm c}=29.29^{+0.21}_{-0.20}$ days, a minimum mass, $M_{\rm
c}\sin{i}$, of $11.1^{+2.6}_{-2.3} M_{\oplus}$, an equilibrium temperature of $T_{\rm eq, c}=661\pm13$
K and, therefore, if confirmed, it could be considered as another warm Neptune.

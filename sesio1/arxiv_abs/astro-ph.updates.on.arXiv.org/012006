Context. A crucial step in the numerical investigation of small-scale dynamos in the solar atmosphere
consists of an accurate determination of the magnetic Prandtl number, Prm, stemming from radiative
magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. Aims. The aims are to provide a reliable methodology
for estimating the effective Reynolds and magnetic Reynolds numbers, Re and Rem, and their ratio
Prm=Rem/Re (the magnetic Prandlt number), that characterise MHD simulations and to categorise
small-scale dynamo simulations in terms of these dimensionless parameters. Methods. The methodology
proposed for computing Re and Rem is based on the method of projection on proper elements and it relies
on a post-processing step carried out using higher order accurate numerical operators than the
ones in the simulation code. A number of radiative MHD simulations with different effective viscosities
and plasma resistivities were carried out with the CO5BOLD code, and the resulting growth rate of
the magnetic energy and saturated magnetic field strengths were characterised in terms of Re and
Rem. Results. Overall, the proposed methodology provides a solid estimate of the dissipation coefficients
affecting the momentum and induction equations of MHD simulation codes, and consequently also
a reliable evaluation of the magnetic Prandtl number characterising the numerical results. Additionally,
it is found that small-scale dynamos are active and can amplify a small seed magnetic field up to significant
values in CO5BOLD simulations with a grid spacing smaller than h=12 km, even at Prm=0.65. However,
it is also evident that it is difficult to categorise dynamo simulations in terms of Prm alone, because
it is not only important to estimate the amplitude of the dissipation coefficients, but also at which
scales energy dissipation takes place.

Mega-constellations in Low Earth Orbit have the potential to revolutionise worldwide internet
access. The concomitant potential of these mega-constellations to impact space sustainability,
however, has prompted concern from space actors as well as provoking concern in the ground-based
astronomy community. Increasing the knowledge of the orbital state of satellites in mega-constellations
improves space situations awareness, reducing the need for collision avoidance manoeuvres and
allowing astronomers to prepare better observational mitigation strategies. In this paper, we
create a model of Phase 1 of Starlink, one of the more well-studied megaconstellations, and investigate
the potential of cooperative localisation using time-ofarrival measurements from the optical
inter-satellite links in the constellation. To this end, we study the performance of any unbiased
estimator for localisation, by calculating the instantaneous Cram$\acute{\text{e}}$r-Rao
bound for two situations; one in which inter-satellite measurements and measurements from ground
stations were considered, and one in which only relative navigation from inter-satellite measurements
were considered. Our results show that localisation determined from a combination of inter-satellite
measurements and ground stations can have at best an an average RMSE of approximately 10.15 metres
over the majority of a satellite's orbit. Relative localisation using only inter-satellite measurements
has a slightly poorer performance with an average RMSE of 10.68 metres. The results show that both
anchored and anchorless inter-satellite cooperative localisation are dependent on the constellation's
geometry and the characteristics of the inter-satellite links, both of which could inform the use
of relative navigation in large satellite constellations in future.

The production and distribution of metals in the diffuse intergalactic medium (IGM) have implications
for galaxy formation models and the baryon (re)cycling process. The relative abundance of metals
in high versus low-ionization states has also been argued to be sensitive to the Universe's reionization
history. However, measurements of the background metallicity of the IGM at z~4 are sparse and in
poor agreement with one another, and reduced sensitivity in the near-IR renders detecting individual
metal absorbers nearly impossible. We present a new clustering-based technique that enables the
detection of these weak IGM absorbers by statistically averaging over all spectral pixels, here
applied to the C IV forest. We simulate the z=4.5 IGM with different models of inhomogeneous metal
distributions and investigate its two-point correlation function (2PCF) using mock skewers of
the C IV forest. The 2PCF demonstrates a clear peak at the doublet separation of the C IV line. The peak
amplitude scales quadratically with metallicity, while enrichment morphology affects both the
shape and amplitude of the 2PCF. The effect of enrichment topology can also be framed in terms of the
metal mass- and volume-filling factors, and we show their trends as a function of the enrichment
topology. For models consistent with the distribution of metals at z~3, we find that we can constrain
[C/H] to within 0.2 dex, log$\,M_{\rm{min}}$ to within 0.4 dex, and $R$ to within 15%. We show that
strong absorbers arising from the circumgalactic medium of galaxies can be easily identified and
masked, allowing one to recover the underlying IGM signal. The auto-correlation of the metal-line
forest presents a new and compelling avenue to simultaneously constrain IGM metallicity and enrichment
topology with high precision at z>4, thereby pushing such measurements into the Epoch of Reionization.

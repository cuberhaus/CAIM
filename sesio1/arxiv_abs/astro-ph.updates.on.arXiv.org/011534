[Abridged] Aims. The lowest-mass galaxies, ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, promise unparalleled
constraints on how feedback regulates galaxy formation, and on the small-scale matter power spectrum.
Their inner dark-matter densities can also be used to constrain dark-matter models. In this paper,
we present 201 new stellar line-of-sight velocities from the MUSE-Faint survey for the (ultra-)faint
dwarf galaxies Antlia B, Leo T, Hydra II, and Grus 1. Combining these with literature data, we obtain
the tightest constraints to date on their dark-matter halo masses and inner dark-matter densities.
Methods. We use the Jeans equations implemented in CJAM to model the density profiles and constrain
the presence of dark-matter cores and solitons (a prediction of fuzzy dark-matter models). Further
modelling is done with GravSphere to test the influence of the choice of modelling tool. We calculate
masses, concentrations, and circular velocities from the profiles, include results for Eridanus
2 from our previous work, and compare these properties to theoretical scaling relations, deriving
constraints on tidal stripping in the process. Results. We find that dark-matter cores as large
as those of more massive dwarf galaxies are ruled out for our galaxies (core radius $r_\mathrm{c}
< 66$-$95\,\mathrm{pc}$ at the 68% confidence level). We constrain the soliton radii to $r_\mathrm{sol}
< 13$-$112\,\mathrm{pc}$ (68% confidence level). We find that the galaxies are consistent with
not having been significantly tidally stripped within their half-light radii. The virial masses
and concentrations are sensitive to the choice of dynamical modelling tool: GravSphere produces
results consistent with $M_{200} \sim 10^9\,M_\odot$, as expected from models in which ultra-faint
dwarf galaxies are re-ionization fossils, while CJAM prefers haloes that are less massive.

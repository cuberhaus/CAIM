In this work, we extend the catalog of low-surface brightness (LSB) galaxies, including Ultra-Diffuse
Galaxy (UDG) candidates, within $\approx 0.4R_{vir}$ of the Hydra I cluster of galaxies, based
on deep images from the VST Early-type GAlaxy Survey (VEGAS). The new galaxies are found by applying
an automatic detection tool and carrying out additional visual inspections of $g$ and $r$ band images.
This led to the detection of 11 UDGs and 8 more LSB galaxies. For all of them, the cluster membership
has been assessed using the color-magnitude relation derived for early-type giant and dwarf galaxies
in Hydra I. The UDGs and new LSB galaxies found in Hydra I span a wide range of central surface brightness
($22.7 \lesssim \mu_{0,g} \lesssim 26.5$ mag/arcsec$^2$), effective radius ($0.6 \lesssim R_e
\lesssim 4.0$ kpc) and color ($0.4 \leq g-r \leq 0.9$ mag), and have stellar masses in the range $\sim
5\times 10^6 - 2\times 10^8$M$_{\odot}$. The 2D projected distribution of both galaxy types is
similar to the spatial distribution of dwarf galaxies, with over-densities in the cluster core
and north of the cluster centre. They have similar color distribution and comparable stellar masses
to the red dwarf galaxies. Based on photometric selection, we identify a total of 9 globular cluster
candidates associated to the UDGs and 4 to the LSB galaxies, with the highest number of candidates
in an individual UDG being three. We find that there are no relevant differences between dwarfs,
LSB galaxies and UDGs: the structural parameters (that is surface brightness, size, colors, n-index)
and GCs content of the three classes have similar properties and trends. This finding is consistent
with UDGs being the extreme LSB tail of the size-luminosity distribution of dwarfs in this environment.

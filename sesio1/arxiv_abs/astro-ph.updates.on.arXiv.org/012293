Heating from active galactic nuclei (AGN) is thought to stabilize cool-core clusters, limiting
star formation and cooling flows. We employ radiative magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations
to model light AGN jet feedback with different accretion modes (Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton and cold
accretion) in an idealised Perseus-like cluster. Independent of the probed accretion model, accretion
efficiency, jet density and resolution, the cluster self-regulates with central entropies and
cooling times consistent with observed cool-core clusters in this non-cosmological setting.
We find that increased jet efficiencies lead to more intermittent jet powers and enhanced star formation
rates. Our fiducial low-density jets can easily be deflected by orbiting cold gaseous filaments,
which redistributes angular momentum and leads to more extended cold gas distributions and isotropic
bubble distributions. In comparison to our fiducial low momentum-density jets, high momentum-density
jet heats less efficiently and enables the formation of a persistent cold-gas disc perpendicular
to the jet that is centrally confined. Cavity luminosities measured from our simulations generally
reflect the cooling luminosities of the intracluster medium (ICM) and correspond to averaged jet
powers that are relatively insensitive to short periods of low-luminosity jet injection. Cold
gas structures in our MHD simulations with low momentum-density jets generally show a variety of
morphologies ranging from discy to very extended filamentary structures. In particular, magnetic
fields are crucial to inhibit the formation of unrealistically massive cold gas discs by redistributing
angular momentum between the hot and cold phases and by fostering the formation of elongated cold
filaments that are supported by magnetic pressure.

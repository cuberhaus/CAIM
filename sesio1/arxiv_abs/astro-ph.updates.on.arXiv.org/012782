The physics of early stellar evolution (e.g. accretion processes) is often not properly included
in the calculations of pre-main-sequence models, leading to insufficient model grids and hence
systematic errors in the results. We aim to investigate current and improved approaches for the
asteroseismic modelling of pre-main-sequence delta Scuti stars. We calculated an extensive grid
of pre-main-sequence models including the early accretion phase and used the resulting equilibrium
models as input to calculate theoretical frequency spectra. These spectra were used to investigate
different approaches in modelling echelle diagrams to find the most reliable methods. By applying
Petersen diagrams, we present a simple algorithm to extract echelle diagrams from observed pulsation
frequencies. We show that model grids with insufficient input physics and imperfect modelling
approaches lead to underestimated uncertainties and systematic errors in the extracted stellar
parameters. Our re-discussion of HD 139614 leads to different stellar parameters than the ones
derived by Murphy et al. (2021). We performed a model comparison between this previous investigation
and our results by applying the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria. While the results with
regard to our 10-d model are inconclusive, they show (very) strong evidence of a 6-d model with fixed
accretion parameters (leading to almost identical stellar parameters to those of the 10-d model)
to be preferred over the model applied by Murphy et al. (2021). In general, our modelling approach
can provide narrow constraints on the stellar parameters (\Delta R ~ 0.05 R_\odot, \Delta log g <~
0.01, and \Delta M_\star ~ 0.1 M_\odot). The extensively tested modelling approaches and automatic
extraction of echelle diagrams should allow us to study many more pre-main-sequence delta Scuti
stars in the future and lead to reliable stellar parameters.

Measurements of the one-point probability distribution function and higher-order moments (variance,
skewness, and kurtosis) of the high-redshift 21 cm fluctuations are among the most direct statistical
probes of the non-Gaussian nature of structure formation and evolution during reionization. However,
contamination from astrophysical foregrounds and instrument systematics pose significant challenges
in measuring these statistics in real observations. In this work, we use forward modelling to investigate
the feasibility of measuring 21 cm one-point statistics through a foreground avoidance strategy.
Leveraging the well-known characteristic of foreground contamination in which it occupies a wedge-shape
region in k-space, we apply a foreground wedge-cut filter that removes the contaminated modes from
a mock data set based on the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) instrument, and measure
the one-point statistics from the image-space representation of the remaining non-contaminated
modes. We experiment with wedge-cutting over different frequency bandwidths and varying degrees
of removal that correspond to different assumptions on the extent of the foreground sources on the
sky and leakage from the Fourier Transform window function. We find that the centre of the band is
the least biased from wedge-cutting while the edges of the band are unusable due to being highly down-weighted
by the window function. Based on this finding, we introduce a rolling filter method that allows reconstruction
of an optimal wedge-cut 21~cm intensity map over the full bandwidth using outputs from wedge-cutting
over multiple sub-bands. We perform Monte Carlo simulations to show that HERA should be able to measure
the rise in skewness and kurtosis near the end of reionization with the rolling wedge-cut method
if foreground leakage from the Fourier transform window function can be controlled.

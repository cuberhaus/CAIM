The Gaia-ESO Survey (GES) is a large public spectroscopic survey that has collected, over a period
of 6 years, spectra of ~ 10^5 stars. This survey provides not only the reduced spectra, but also the
stellar parameters and abundances resulting from the analysis of the spectra. The GES dataflow
is organised in 19 working groups. Working group 13 (WG13) is responsible for the spectral analysis
of the hottest stars (O, B and A type, with a formal cut-off of Teff > 7000 K) that were observed as part
of GES. We present the procedures and techniques that have been applied to the reduced spectra, in
order to determine the stellar parameters and abundances of these stars. The procedure used is similar
to that of other working groups in GES. A number of groups (called `Nodes') each independently analyse
the spectra, using their state-of-the-art techniques and codes. Specific for the analysis in WG13
is the large temperature range that is covered (Teff = 7000 - 50,000 K), requiring the use of different
analysis codes. Most Nodes can therefore only handle part of the data. Quality checks are applied
to the results of these Nodes by comparing them to benchmark stars, and by comparing them one to another.
For each star the Node values are then homogenised into a single result: the recommended parameters
and abundances. Eight Nodes each analysed (part of) the data. In total 17,693 spectra of 6462 stars
were analysed, most of them in 37 open star clusters. The homogenisation led to stellar parameters
for 5584 stars. Abundances were determined for a more limited number of stars. Elements studied
are He, C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Al, Si and Sc. Abundances for at least one of those elements were determined
for 292 stars. The hot-star data analysed here, as well as the Gaia-ESO Survey data in general, will
be of considerable use in future studies of stellar evolution and open clusters.

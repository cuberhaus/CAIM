We constrain cosmological and galaxy-bias parameters using the combination of galaxy clustering
and galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements from the Dark Energy Survey Year-3 data. We describe our
modeling framework, and choice of scales analyzed, validating their robustness to theoretical
uncertainties in small-scale clustering by analyzing simulated data. Using a linear galaxy bias
model and redMaGiC galaxy sample, we obtain constraints on the matter density to be $\Omega_{\rm
m} = 0.325^{+0.033}_{-0.034}$. We also implement a non-linear galaxy bias model to probe smaller
scales that includes parameterization based on hybrid perturbation theory and find that it leads
to a 17% gain in cosmological constraining power. We perform robustness tests of our methodology
pipeline and demonstrate the stability of the constraints to changes in the theoretical model.
Using the redMaGiC galaxy sample as foreground lens galaxies, we find the galaxy clustering and
galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements to exhibit significant signals akin to de-correlation between
galaxies and mass on large scales, which is not expected in any current models. This likely systematic
measurement error biases our constraints on galaxy bias and the $S_8$ parameter. We find that a scale-,
redshift- and sky-area-independent phenomenological de-correlation parameter can effectively
capture the impact of this systematic error. We trace the source of this de-correlation to a color-dependent
photometric issue and minimize its impact on our result by changing the selection criteria of redMaGiC
galaxies. Using this new sample, our constraints on the $S_8$ parameter are consistent with previous
studies, and we find a small shift in the $\Omega_{\rm m}$ constraints compared to the fiducial redMaGiC
sample. We constrain the mean host halo mass of the redMaGiC galaxies in this new sample to be approximately
$1.6 \times 10^{13} M_{\odot}/h$.

A growing number of transient X-ray obscuration events in type I AGN suggest that our line-of-sight
to the central engine is not always free. Multiple X-ray obscuration events have been reported in
the nearby Seyfert 1.5 galaxy NGC 3227 from 2000 to 2016. In late 2019, another X-ray obscuration
event was identified with Swift. Two coordinated target-of-opportunity observations with XMM-Newton,
NuSTAR, and HST/COS were triggered in Nov. and Dec. 2019 to study this obscuration event. For each
observation, we analyze the time-averaged X-ray spectra. We perform photoionization modeling
with the SPEX code, which allows us to constrain the intrinsic continuum simultaneously with various
photoionized absorption and emission components. Similar to previous transient X-ray obscuration
events in NGC 3227, the one caught in late 2019 is short-lived (less than five months). If the obscurer
has only one photoionized component, the two X-ray observations in late 2019 cannot be explained
by the same obscurer that responds to the varying ionizing continuum. Due to the unknown geometry
of the obscurer, its number density and distance to the black hole cannot be well constrained. The
inferred distance covers at least two orders of magnitude, from the BLR to the dusty torus. Unlike
some other X-ray obscuration events in Seyfert galaxies like NGC 5548 and NGC 3783, no prominent
blueshifted broad absorption troughs were found in the 2019 HST/COS spectra of NGC 3227 when compared
with archival UV spectra. This might be explained if the X-ray obscurer does not intercept our line
of sight to (a significant portion of) the UV emitting region. It is not straightforward to understand
the variety of the observational differences in the X-ray obscuration events observed so far. Future
observations with high-quality data are needed to unveil the nature of the X-ray obscuration events.

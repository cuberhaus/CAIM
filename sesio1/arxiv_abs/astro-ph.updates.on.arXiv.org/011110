In response to ESA Voyage 2050 announcement of opportunity, we propose an ambitious L-class mission
to explore one of the most exciting bodies in the Solar System, Saturn largest moon Titan. Titan,
a "world with two oceans", is an organic-rich body with interior-surface-atmosphere interactions
that are comparable in complexity to the Earth. Titan is also one of the few places in the Solar System
with habitability potential. Titan remarkable nature was only partly revealed by the Cassini-Huygens
mission and still holds mysteries requiring a complete exploration using a variety of vehicles
and instruments. The proposed mission concept POSEIDON (Titan POlar Scout/orbitEr and In situ
lake lander DrONe explorer) would perform joint orbital and in situ investigations of Titan. It
is designed to build on and exceed the scope and scientific/technological accomplishments of Cassini-Huygens,
exploring Titan in ways that were not previously possible, in particular through full close-up
and in situ coverage over long periods of time. In the proposed mission architecture, POSEIDON consists
of two major elements: a spacecraft with a large set of instruments that would orbit Titan, preferably
in a low-eccentricity polar orbit, and a suite of in situ investigation components, i.e. a lake lander,
a "heavy" drone (possibly amphibious) and/or a fleet of mini-drones, dedicated to the exploration
of the polar regions. The ideal arrival time at Titan would be slightly before the next northern Spring
equinox (2039), as equinoxes are the most active periods to monitor still largely unknown atmospheric
and surface seasonal changes. The exploration of Titan northern latitudes with an orbiter and in
situ element(s) would be highly complementary with the upcoming NASA New Frontiers Dragonfly mission
that will provide in situ exploration of Titan equatorial regions in the mid-2030s.

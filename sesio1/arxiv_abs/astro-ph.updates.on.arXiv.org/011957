We studied the line emission from CH3CN and its deuterated isotopologue CH$_2$DCN towards the prototypical
Class I object SVS13-A, where the deuteration of a large number of species has already been reported.
Our goal is to measure the CH$_3$CN deuteration in a Class I protostar, for the first time, in order
to constrain the CH$_3$CN formation pathways and the chemical evolution from the early prestellar
core and Class 0 to the evolved Class I stages. We imaged CH2DCN towards SVS13-A using the IRAM NOEMA
interferometer at 3mm in the context of the Large Program SOLIS (with a spatial resolution of 1.8"x1.2").
The NOEMA images have been complemented by the CH$_3$CN and CH$_2$DCN spectra collected by the IRAM-30m
Large Program ASAI, that provided an unbiased spectral survey at 3mm, 2mm, and 1.3mm. The observed
line emission has been analysed using LTE and non-LTE LVG approaches. The NOEMA/SOLIS images of
CH2DCN show that this species emits in an unresolved area centered towards the SVS13-A continuum
emission peak, suggesting that methyl cyanide and its isotopologues are associated with the hot
corino of SVS13-A, previously imaged via other iCOMs. In addition, we detected 41 and 11 ASAI transitions
of CH$_3$CN and CH2DCN, respectively, which cover upper level energies (Eup) from 13 to 442 K and
from 18 K to 200 K, respectively. The derived [CH2DCN]/[CH3CN] ratio is $\sim$9\%. This value is
consistent with those measured towards prestellar cores and a factor 2-3 higher than those measured
in Class 0 protostars. Contrarily to what expected for other molecular species, the CH3CN deuteration
does not show a decrease in SVS13-A with respect to measurements in younger prestellar cores and
Class 0 protostars. Finally, we discuss why our new results suggest that CH3CN was likely synthesised
via gas-phase reactions and frozen onto the dust grain mantles during the cold prestellar phase.

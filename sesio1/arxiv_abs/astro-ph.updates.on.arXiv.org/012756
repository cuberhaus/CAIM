Finding reliable indicators of Lyman continuum (LyC) photon leakage from galaxies is essential
in order to infer their escape fraction in the epoch of reionisation, where direct measurements
of LyC flux are impossible. To this end, here we investigate whether strong C IV $\lambda \lambda
1548,1550$ emission in the rest-frame UV spectra of galaxies traces conditions ripe for ample production
and escape of LyC photons. We compile a sample of 19 star-forming galaxies in the redshift range $z=3.1-4.6$
from the VANDELS survey that exhibit strong C IV emission, producing a stacked spectrum where all
major rest-UV emission lines are clearly detected. Best-fitting spectral energy distribution
models containing both stellar and nebular emission suggest the need for low stellar metallicities
($Z=0.1-0.2\,Z_\odot$), young stellar ages ($\log(\rm{age/yr}) = 6.1-6.5$), a high ionisation
parameter ($\log U = -2$) and little to no dust attenuation ($E(B-V)=0.00-0.01$). However, these
models are unable to fully reproduce the observed C IV and He II line strengths. We find that the Ly$\alpha$
line in the stacked spectrum is strong and peaks close to the systemic velocity, features that are
indicative of significant LyC photon leakage along the line-of-sight. The covering fractions
of low-ionisation interstellar absorption lines are also low implying LyC escape fraction in the
range $\approx 0.05-0.30$, with signatures of outflowing gas. Finally, C IV/C III] ratios of >0.75
for a subset of individual galaxies with reliable detections of both lines are also consistent with
physical conditions that enable significant LyC leakage. Overall, we report that multiple spectroscopic
indicators of LyC leakage are present in the stacked spectrum of strong C IV emitting galaxies, potentially
making C IV an important tracer of LyC photon escape at $z>6$.

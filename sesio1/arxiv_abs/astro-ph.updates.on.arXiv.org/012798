This paper introduces a new Planck Catalog of Polarized and Variable Compact Sources (PCCS-PV)
comprising 153 sources, the majority of which are extragalactic. The data include both the total
flux density and linear polarization measured by Planck with frequency coverage from 30 to 353 GHz,
and temporal spacing ranging from days to years. We classify most sources as beamed, extragalactic
radio sources; the catalog also includes several radio galaxies, Seyfert galaxies, and Galactic
and Magellanic Cloud sources, including H IIi regions and planetary nebulae. An advanced extraction
method applied directly to the multifrequency Planck time-ordered data, rather than the mission
sky maps, was developed to allow an assessment of the variability of polarized sources. Our analysis
of the time-ordered data from the Planck mission, tod2flux, allowed us to catalog the time-varying
emission and polarization properties for these sources at the full range of polarized frequencies
employed by Planck, 30 to 353 GHz. PCCS-PV provides the time- and frequency-dependent, polarized
flux densities for all 153 sources. To illustrate some potential applications of the PCCS- PV, we
conducted preliminary comparisons of our measurements of selected sources with published data
from other astronomical instruments. In summary, we find general agreement between the Planck
and the Institut de Radioastronomie Millim\'etrique (IRAM) polarization measurements as well
as with the Mets\"ahovi 37 GHz values at closely similar epochs. These combined measurements also
show the value of PCCS-PV results and the PCCS2 catalog for filling in missing spectral (or temporal)
coverage and helping to define the spectral energy distributions of extragalactic sources. In
turn, these results provide useful clues as to the physical properties of the sources.

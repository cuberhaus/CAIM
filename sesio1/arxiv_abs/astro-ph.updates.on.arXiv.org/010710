Located $\sim100$ pc from the dynamic center of the Milky Way, the molecular cloud Sagittarius B2
(Sgr B2) is the most massive such object in the Galactic Center region. In X-rays, Sgr B2 shows a prominent
neutral Fe K$\alpha$ line at 6.4 keV and continuum emission beyond 10 keV, indicating high-energy,
non-thermal processes in the cloud. The Sgr B2 complex is an X-ray reflection nebula whose total
emissions have continued to decrease since the year 2001 as it reprocesses what are likely one or
more past energetic outbursts from the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A*. The X-ray reflection
model explains the observed time-variability of the Fe K$\alpha$ and hard X-ray emissions, and
it provides a window into the luminous evolutionary history of our nearest supermassive black hole.
In light of evidence of elevated cosmic particle populations in the Galactic Center, recent interest
has also focused on X-rays from Sgr B2 as a probe of low-energy (sub-GeV) cosmic particles. In contrast
to the time-varying X-ray reflection, in this case we can assume that the X-ray flux contribution
from interactions of low-energy cosmic particles is constant in time, such that upper limits on
low-energy cosmic particle populations may be obtained using the lowest flux levels observed from
the cloud. Here, we present the most recent and correspondingly dimmest NuSTAR and XMM-Newton observations
of Sgr B2, from 2018. These reveal small-scale variations within lower density portions of the Sgr
B2 complex, including brightening features, yet still enable the best upper limits on X-rays from
low-energy cosmic particles in Sgr B2. We also present Fe K$\alpha$ fluxes from cloud regions of
different densities, facilitating comparison with models of ambient low-energy cosmic particle
interactions throughout the cloud.

Aims. The aim of our study is to obtain the near-ultraviolet to visible (NUV-VIS, 0.35 - 0.95 micron)
reflectance spectra of primitive asteroids with a focus on members of the Themis and Polana-Eulalia
complex families. This characterization allows us to discuss the origin of two recent sample return
mission target asteroids, (162173) Ryugu and (101955) Bennu. Methods. We obtain low-resolution
visible spectra of target asteroids down to 0.35 micron using the telescopes located at the Roque
de los Muchachos Observatory and revisit spectroscopic data that have already been published.
We study the characteristics of the NUV-VIS reflectance spectra of primitive asteroids, focusing
on data of the Themis family and the Polana-Eulalia family complex. Finally, we compare the NUV characteristics
of these families with (162173) Ryugu and (101955) Bennu. In this work, we also study systematic
effects due to the use of the five commonly used stars in Landolt's catalog as solar analogs to obtain
the asteroid reflectance in the NUV wavelength range. We compare the spectra of five G-stars in Landolt's
catalog with the spectrum of the well-studied solar analog Hyades 64, also observed on the same nights.
Results. We find that many widely used Landolt's G-type stars are not solar analogs in the NUV wavelength
spectral region and thus are not suitable for obtaining the reflectance spectra of asteroids. We
also find that, even though the Themis family and the Polana-Eulalia family complex show a similar
blueness at visible wavelengths, the NUV absorption of the Themis family is much deeper than that
of the Polana-Eulalia family complex. We did not find significant differences between the New Polana
and Eulalia families in terms of the NUV-VIS slope. (162173) Ryugu's and (101955) Bennu's spectral
characteristics in the NUV-VIS overlap with those of the Polana-Eulalia family complex which implies
that it.

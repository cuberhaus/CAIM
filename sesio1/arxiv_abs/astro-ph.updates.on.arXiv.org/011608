Molecular maser lines are signposts of high-mass star formation, probing excitation and kinematics
of very compact regions in the close environment of young stellar objects and providing useful targets
for trigonometric parallax measurements. Only a few NH$_{3}$ (9,6) masers were known so far, and
their origin is still poorly understood. Here we aim to find new NH$_{3}$ (9,6) masers to provide
a better observational basis to study their role in high-mass star-forming regions. We carried
out NH$_{3}$ (9,6) observations toward Cepheus A and G34.26$+$0.15 with the Effelsberg-100 m telescope
and the Karl G. Janksy Very Large Array. We discovered new NH$_{3}$ (9,6) masers in Cep A and G34.26$+$0.25,
which increases the number of high-mass star-forming regions hosting NH$_{3}$ (9,6) masers from
five to seven. Long term monitoring (20 months) at Effelsberg shows that the intensity of the (9,6)
maser in G34.26$+$0.25 is decreasing, while the Cep A maser remains stable. Compared to the Effelsberg
data and assuming linear variations between the epochs of observation, the JVLA data indicate no
missing flux. This suggests that the NH$_3$ (9,6) emission arises from single compact emission
regions that are not resolved by the interferometric measurements. As JVLA imaging shows, the NH$_{3}$
(9,6) emission in Cep A originates from a sub-arcsecond sized region, slightly to the west of the
peak position of the 1.36\,cm continuum object, HW2. In G34.26$+$0.25, three NH$_{3}$ (9,6) maser
spots are observed: one is close to the head of the cometary ultracompact \h2 region C and the other
two are emitted from a compact region to the west of the hypercompact \h2 region A. The newly found
(9,6) masers appear to be related to outflows. Higher angular resolution of JVLA and VLBI observations
are needed to provide more accurate positions and constraints for pumping scenarios.

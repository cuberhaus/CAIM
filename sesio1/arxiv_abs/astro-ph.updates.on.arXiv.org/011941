The Rare-RI Ring (R3) is a recently commissioned cyclotron-like storage ring mass spectrometer
dedicated to mass measurements of exotic nuclei far from stability at Radioactive Isotope Beam
Factory (RIBF) in RIKEN. The first application of mass measurement using the R3 mass spectrometer
at RIBF is reported. Rare isotopes produced at RIBF, $^{127}$Sn, $^{126}$In, $^{125}$Cd, $^{124}$Ag,
$^{123}$Pd, were injected in R3. Masses of $^{126}$In, $^{125}$Cd, and $^{123}$Pd were measured
whereby the mass uncertainty of $^{123}$Pd was improved. This is the first reported measurement
with a new storage ring mass spectrometery technique realized at a heavy-ion cyclotron and employing
individual injection of the pre-identified rare nuclei. The latter is essential for the future
mass measurements of the rarest isotopes produced at RIBF. The impact of the new $^{123}$Pd result
on the solar $r$-process abundances in a neutron star merger event is investigated by performing
reaction network calculations of 20 trajectories with varying electron fraction $Y_e$. It is found
that the neutron capture cross section on $^{123}$Pd increases by a factor of 2.2 and $\beta$-delayed
neutron emission probability, $P_\mathrm{1n}$, of $^{123}$Rh increases by 14\%. The neutron
capture cross section on $^{122}$Pd decreases by a factor of 2.6 leading to pileup of material at
$A=122$, thus reproducing the trend of the solar $r$-process abundances. The trend of the two-neutron
separation energies (S$_\mathrm{2n}$) was investigated for the Pd isotopic chain. The new mass
measurement with improved uncertainty excludes large changes of the S$_\mathrm{2n}$ value at
$N=77$. Such large increase of the S$_\mathrm{2n}$ values before $N=82$ was proposed as an alternative
to the quenching of the $N=82$ shell gap to reproduce $r$-process abundances in the mass region of
$A=112-124$.

If humanity is ever to consider substantial, long-term colonization of Mars, the resources needed
are going to be extensive. For a long-term human presence on Mars to be established, serious thought
would need to be given to terraforming the planet. One major requirement for such terraforming is
having the protection of a planetary magnetic field which Mars currently does not have. In this article
we explore comprehensively for the first time, the practical and engineering challenges that affect
the feasibility of creating an artificial magnetic field capable of encompassing Mars. This includes
the concerns that define the design, where to locate the magnetic field generator and possible construction
strategies. The rationale here is not to justify the need for a planetary magnetosphere but to put
figures on the practicalities so as to be able to weigh the pros and cons of the different engineering
approaches. The optimum solution proposed is completely novel, although inspired by natural situations
and fusion plasma techniques. The solution with the lowest power, assembly and mass is to create
an artificial charged particle ring (similar in form to a "radiation belt"), around the planet possibly
formed by ejecting matter from one of the moons of Mars (in fashion similar to that that forms the Io-Jupiter
plasma torus), but using electromagnetic and plasma waves to drive a net current in the ring(s) that
results in an overall magnetic field. With a new era of space exploration underway, this is the time
to start thinking about these new and bold future concepts and to begin filling strategic knowledge
gaps. Furthermore, the principles explored here are also applicable to smaller scale objects like
manned spacecraft, space stations or moon bases, which would benefit from the creation of protective
mini-magnetospheres.

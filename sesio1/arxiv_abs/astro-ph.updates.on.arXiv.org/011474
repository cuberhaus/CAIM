Making the most of the rapidly increasing population of gravitational-wave detections of black
hole (BH) and neutron star (NS) mergers requires comparing observations with population synthesis
predictions. In this work we investigate the combined impact from the key uncertainties in population
synthesis modelling of the isolated binary evolution channel: the physical processes in massive
binary-star evolution and the star formation history as a function of metallicity, $Z$, and redshift
$z, \mathcal{S}(Z,z)$. Considering these uncertainties we create 560 different publicly available
model realizations and calculate the rate and distribution characteristics of detectable BHBH,
BHNS, and NSNS mergers. We find that our stellar evolution and $\mathcal{S}(Z,z)$ variations can
impact the predicted intrinsic and detectable merger rates by factors $10^2$-$10^4$. We find that
BHBH rates are dominantly impacted by $\mathcal{S}(Z,z)$ variations, NSNS rates by stellar evolution
variations and BHNS rates by both. We then consider the combined impact from all uncertainties considered
in this work on the detectable mass distribution shapes (chirp mass, individual masses and mass
ratio). We find that the BHNS mass distributions are predominantly impacted by massive binary-star
evolution changes. For BHBH and NSNS we find that both uncertainties are important. We also find
that the shape of the delay time and birth metallicity distributions are typically dominated by
the choice of $\mathcal{S}(Z,z)$ for BHBH, BHNS and NSNS. We identify several examples of robust
features in the mass distributions predicted by all 560 models, such that we expect more than 95%
of BHBH detections to contain a BH $\gtrsim 8\,\rm{M}_{\odot}$ and have mass ratios $\lesssim 4$.
Our work demonstrates that it is essential to consider a wide range of allowed models to study double
compact object merger rates and properties.

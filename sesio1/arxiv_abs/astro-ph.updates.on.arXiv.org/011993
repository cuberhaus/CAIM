We present a review of the observations of the solar F-corona from space with a special emphasis of
the 25 years of continuous monitoring achieved by the LASCO-C2 and C3 coronagraphs. Our work includes
images obtained by the navigation cameras of the Clementine spacecraft, the SECCHI/HI-1A heliospheric
imager onboard STEREO-A, and the Wide Field Imager for Solar Probe onboard the Parker Solar Probe.
The connection to the zodiacal light is considered based on ground- and space-based observations,
prominently from the past Helios, IRAS, COBE, and IRAKI missions. The characteristic radiance
profiles along the equatorial and polar directions follow power laws in the 5{\deg}-50{\deg} range
of elongation, with constant power exponents of -2.33 and -2.55. Both profiles connect extremely
well to the corresponding standard profiles of the zodiacal light. The LASCO equatorial profile
exhibits a shoulder implying a 17% decrease of the radiance within 10Rsun that may be explained by
the disappearance of organic materials within 0.3 AU. LASCO detected for the first time a secular
variation of the F-corona, an increase at a rate of 0.46% per year of the integrated radiance in the
LASCO-C3 FoV. This is likely the first observational evidence of the role of collisions in the inner
zodiacal cloud. A composite of C2 and C3 images produced the LASCO reference map of the radiance of
the F-corona from 2 to 30Rsun and, by combining with ground-based measurements, the LASCO extended
map from 1 to 6 Rsun. The plane of symmetry of the inner zodiacal cloud is strongly warped, its inclination
increasing towards the planes of the inner planets and ultimately the solar equator. In contrast,
its longitude of ascending node is found to be constant and equal to 87.6{\deg}. LASCO did not detect
any small scale structures such as putative rings occasionally reported during solar eclipses.

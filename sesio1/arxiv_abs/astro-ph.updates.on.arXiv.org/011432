We present here a re-calibration of the photometric systems used in the Pantheon+ sample of Type
Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) including those used for the SH0ES distance-ladder measurement of H$_0$.
We utilize the large and uniform sky coverage of the public Pan-STARRS stellar photometry catalog
to cross-calibrate against tertiary standards released by individual SN Ia surveys. The most significant
updates over the `SuperCal' cross-calibration used for the previous Pantheon and SH0ES analyses
are: 1) expansion of the number of photometric systems (now 25) and filters (now 105), 2) solving
for all filter offsets in all systems simultaneously in order to produce a calibration uncertainty
covariance matrix that can be used in cosmological-model constraints, and 3) accounting for the
change in the fundamental flux calibration of the HST CALSPEC standards from previous versions
on the order of $1.5\%$ over a $\Delta \lambda$ of 4000~\AA. The re-calibration of samples used for
light-curve fitting has historically been decoupled from the retraining of the light-curve model.
Here, we are able to retrain the SALT2 model using this new calibration and find the change in the model
coupled with the change to the calibration of the light-curves themselves causes a net distance
modulus change ($d\mu/dz$) of 0.04 mag over the redshift range $0<z<1$. We introduce a new formalism
to determine the systematic impact on cosmological inference by propagating the covariance in
fitted calibration offsets through retraining simultaneously with light-curve fitting and find
a total calibration uncertainty impact of $\sigma_w=0.013$, which is roughly half the size of the
sample statistical uncertainty. Similarly, we find a systematic SN calibration contribution
to the SH0ES H$_0$ uncertainty is less than 0.2~km/s/Mpc, suggesting that SN Ia calibration cannot
resolve the current level of the `Hubble Tension'.

Cross-correlating cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing and galaxy clustering has been shown
to greatly improve the constraints on the local primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) parameter $f_{\rm
NL}$ by reducing sample variance and also parameter degeneracies. To model the full use of the 3D
information of galaxy clustering, we forecast $f_{\rm NL}$ measurements using the decomposition
in the spherical Fourier-Bessel (SFB) basis, which can be naturally cross-correlated with 2D CMB
lensing in spherical harmonics. In the meantime, such a decomposition would also enable us to constrain
the growth rate of structure, a probe of gravity, through the redshift-space distortion (RSD).
As a comparison, we also consider the tomographic spherical harmonic (TSH) analysis of galaxy samples
with different bin sizes. Assuming galaxy samples that mimic a few future surveys, we perform Fisher
forecasts using linear modes for $f_{\rm NL}$ and the growth rate exponent $\gamma$, marginalized
over standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmological parameters and two nuisance
parameters that account for clustering bias and magnification bias. Compared to TSH analysis using
only one bin, SFB analysis could improve $\sigma(f_{\rm NL})$ by factors 3 to 12 thanks to large radial
modes. With future wide-field and high-redshift photometric surveys like the LSST, the constraint
$\sigma(f_{\rm NL}) < 1$ could be achieved using linear angular multipoles up to $\ell_{\rm min}\simeq
20$. Compared to using galaxy auto-power spectra only, joint analyses with CMB lensing could improve
$\sigma(\gamma)$ by factors 2 to 5 by reducing degeneracies with other parameters, especially
the clustering bias. For future spectroscopic surveys like the DESI or $\textit{Euclid}$, using
linear scales, $\gamma$ could be constrained to $3\,\%$ precision assuming the GR fiducial value.

The recent discovery of the binary black hole (BBH) merger event GW190521, between two black holes
(BHs) of $\approx100M_\odot$, and as well as other massive BBH merger events involving BHs within
the pair-instability supernova (PSN) mass gap have sparked widespread debate on the origin of such
extreme gravitational-wave (GW) events. In this study, I investigate whether dynamical interactions
in young massive clusters (YMCs) serves as a viable scenario for assembling PSN-gap BBH mergers.
To that end, I explore a grid of 40 new evolutionary models of a representative YMC of initial mass
$M_{\rm cl}=7.5\times10^4M_\odot$ ($N\approx1.28\times10^5$) and size $r_h=2$ pc, with all
BH progenitor stars being initially in primordial binaries. All cluster models are evolved with
the direct, relativistic N-body code NBODY7 incorporating up to date remnant formation, BH natal
spin, and general-relativistic (GR) merger recoil schemes. The BBH mergers from these model cluster
computations agree well with the masses and effective spin parameters of the GW events in the latest
GW transient catalogue (GWTC). In particular, GW190521-like, i.e., $\approx200M_\odot$, low
aligned spin events are produced via dynamical merger among BHs derived from star-star merger products.
GW190403-like, i.e., PSN-gap, highly asymmetric and aligned events result from mergers involving
BHs that are spun up via matter accretion or binary interaction. The present YMC models yield a present
day, intrinsic merger rate density of $0-3.8\times10^{-2}{{\rm~yr}^{-1}{\rm Gpc}^{-3}}$ for
GW190521-type events. They produce GW190403-like events at a rate within $0-1.6\times10^{-1}{{\rm~yr}^{-1}{\rm
Gpc}^{-3}}$ and their total BBH-merger yield within the PSN gap is $0-8.4\times10^{-1}{{\rm~yr}^{-1}{\rm
Gpc}^{-3}}$.

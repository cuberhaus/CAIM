The origin of the cold gas in central galaxies in groups is still a matter of debate. We present Multi-Unit
Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) observations of 18 optically selected local Brightest Group Galaxies
(BGGs) to study the kinematics and distribution of the optical emission-line gas. MUSE observations
reveal a distribution of gas morphologies including ten complex networks of filaments extending
up to 10 kpc to two compact (<3 kpc) and five extended (>5 kpc) disk-dominated structures. Some rotating
disks show rings and elongated structures arising from the central disk. The kinematics of the stellar
component is mainly rotation-dominated, which is very different from the disturbed kinematics
and distribution found in the filamentary sources. The ionized gas is kinematically decoupled
from the stellar component for most systems, suggesting an external origin for the gas. We also find
that the Halpha luminosity correlates with the cold molecular mass. By exploring the thermodynamical
properties of the hot atmospheres, we find that the filamentary sources and compact disks are found
in systems with small central entropy values and tcool/teddy ratios. This suggests that, like for
Brightest Cluster Galaxies in cool core clusters, the ionized gas are likely formed from hot halo
gas condensations, consistently with the Chaotic Cold Accretion simulations (as shown via the
C-ratio, Tat, and k-plot). We note that gaseous rotating disks are more frequent than in BCGs. An
explanation for the origin of the gas in those objects is a contribution to gas fueling by mergers
or group satellites, as qualitatively hinted by some sources of the present sample. Nonetheless,
we discuss the possibility that some extended disks could also be a transition stage in an evolutionary
sequence including filaments, extended disks and compact disks, as described by hot gas condensation
models of cooling flows.

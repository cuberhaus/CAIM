One of the central challenges to establishing the role of mergers in galaxy evolution is the selection
of pure and complete merger samples in observations. In particular, while large and reasonably
pure interacting galaxy pair samples can be obtained with relative ease via spectroscopic criteria,
automated selection of post-coalescence merger remnants is restricted to the physical characteristics
of remnants alone. Furthermore, such selection has predominantly focused on imaging data -- whereas
kinematic data may offer a complimentary basis for identifying merger remnants. Therefore, we
examine the theoretical utility of both the morphological and kinematic features of merger remnants
in distinguishing galaxy merger remnants from other galaxies. Deep classification models are
calibrated and evaluated using idealized synthetic images and line-of-sight stellar velocity
maps of a heterogeneous population of galaxies and merger remnants from the TNG100 cosmological
hydrodynamical simulation. We show that even idealized stellar kinematic data has limited utility
compared to imaging and under-performs by $2.1\%\pm0.5\%$ in completeness and $4.7\%\pm0.4\%$
in purity for our fiducial model architecture. Combining imaging and stellar kinematics offers
a small boost in completeness (by $1.8\%\pm0.4\%$, compared to $92.7\%\pm0.2\%$ from imaging
alone) but no change in purity ($0.1\%\pm0.3\%$ improvement compared to $92.7\%\pm0.2\%$, evaluated
with equal numbers of merger remnant and non-remnant control galaxies). Classification accuracy
of all models is particularly sensitive to physical companions at separations $\lesssim40$ kpc
and to time-since-coalescence. Taken together, our results show that the stellar kinematic data
has little to offer in compliment to imaging for merger remnant identification in a heterogeneous
galaxy population.

About a hundred tidal disruption events (TDEs) have been observed and they exhibit a wide range of
emission properties both at peak and over their lifetimes. Some TDEs peak predominantly at X-ray
energies while others radiate chiefly at UV and optical wavelengths. While the peak luminosities
across TDEs show distinct properties, the evolutionary behavior can also vary between TDEs with
similar peak emission properties. At late time, some optical TDEs rebrighten in X-rays, while others
maintain strong UV/optical emission components. In this Letter, we conduct three-dimensional
general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulations of TDE accretion disks at varying
accretion rates ranging from a few to a few tens of the Eddington accretion rate. We make use of Monte
Carlo radiative transfer simulations to calculate the reprocessed spectra at various inclinations
and at different evolutionary stages. We confirm the unified model proposed by Dai et al. (2018),
which predicts that the observed emission largely depends on the viewing angle of the observer with
respect to the disk orientation (X-ray strong when viewed face-on and UV/optically strong when
viewed disk-on). What is more, we find that disks with higher accretion rates have elevated wind
and disk densities, which increases the reprocessing of the high-energy radiation and thus generally
augments the optical-to-X-ray flux ratio along a particular viewing angle. This implies that at
later times, as the accretion level declines, we expect the funnel to effectively open up and allow
more X-rays to leak out along intermediate viewing angles. Such dynamical model for TDEs can provide
a natural explanation for the diversity in the emission properties observed in TDEs at peak and along
their temporal evolution.

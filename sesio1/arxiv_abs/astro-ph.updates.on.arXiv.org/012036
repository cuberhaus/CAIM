K2-141 b is a transiting, small (1.5 Re) ultra-short-period (USP) planet discovered by Kepler orbiting
a K-dwarf host star every 6.7 hours. The planet's high surface temperature makes it an excellent
target for thermal emission observations. Here we present 65 hours of continuous photometric observations
of K2-141 b collected with Spitzer's IRAC Channel 2 at 4.5 micron spanning 10 full orbits of the planet.
We measure an infrared eclipse depth of 143 +/- 39 ppm and a peak to trough amplitude variation of 121
+/- 43 ppm. The best fit model to the Spitzer data shows no significant thermal hotspot offset, in
contrast to the previously observed offset for the well-studied USP planet 55 Cnc e. We also jointly
analyze the new Spitzer observations with the photometry collected by Kepler during two separate
K2 campaigns. We model the planetary emission with a range of toy models that include a reflective
and a thermal contribution. With a two-temperature model, we measure a dayside temperature of 2049
+/- 361 K and a night-side temperature that is consistent with zero (Tp,n < 1712 K at 2 sigma). Models
with a steep dayside temperature gradient provide a better fit to the data than a uniform dayside
temperature (DeltaBIC = 22.2). We also find evidence for a non-zero geometric albedo Ag = 0.28 +/-
0.07. We also compare the data to a physically motivated, pseudo-2D rock vapor model and a 1D turbulent
boundary layer model. Both models fit the data well. Notably, we find that the optical eclipse depth
can be explained by thermal emission from a hot inversion layer, rather than reflected light. A thermal
inversion may also be responsible for the deep optical eclipse observed for another USP, Kepler-10
b. Finally, we significantly improve the ephemerides for K2-141 b and c, which will facilitate further
follow-up observations of this interesting system with state-of-the-art observatories like
JWST.

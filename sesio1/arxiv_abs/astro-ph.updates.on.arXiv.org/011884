Context: The radial variations of the stellar populations properties within passive galaxies
at high redshift contain information about their assembly mechanisms, based on which galaxy formation
and evolution scenarios may be distinguished. Aims: The aim of this work is to give constraints on
massive galaxy formation scenarios through one of the first analyses of age and metallicity gradients
of the stellar populations in a sample of passive galaxies at $z > 1.6$ based on spectroscopic data
from the Hubble Space Telescope. Methods: We combined G$141$ deep slitless spectroscopic data
and F$160$W photometric data of the spectroscopically passive galaxies at $1.6< z < 2.4$ with $H_{160}
< 22.0$ in the field of view of the cluster JKCS $041$. We extracted spectra from different zones of
the galaxies, and we analysed them by fitting them with a library of synthetic templates of stellar
population models to obtain estimates of the age and metallicity gradients. Results: We obtained
reliable measurements of age and metallicity parameters in different spatial zones of $\text{four}$
galaxies. We performed spatially resolved measurements in individual high-redshift galaxies
without the need of peculiar situations (i.e. gravitational lensing) for the first time. All four
galaxies exhibit negative metallicity gradients. Their amplitude, similar to that measured in
galaxies in the local Universe, suggests that the stellar populations of passive galaxies from
$z \sim 2$ to $z = 0$ are not redistributed. Conclusions: Although the sample we analysed is small,
the results we obtained suggest that the main mechanism that determines the spatial distribution
of the stellar population properties within passive galaxies is constrained in the first $3$ Gyr
of the Universe. This is consistent with the revised monolithic scenario.

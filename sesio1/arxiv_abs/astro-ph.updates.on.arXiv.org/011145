Context. Protoplanetary disks around young stars often contain substructures like rings, gaps,
and spirals that could be caused by interactions between the disk and forming planets. Aims. We aim
to study the young (1-3 Myr) star DR Tau in the near-infrared and characterize its disk, which was
previously resolved through sub-millimeter interferometry with ALMA, and to search for possible
sub-stellar companions embedded into it. Methods. We observed DR Tau with VLT/SPHERE both in polarized
light (H broad band) and total intensity (in Y, J, H, and K spectral bands). We also performed L' band
observations with LBTI/LMIRCam on the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). Results. We found two previously
undetected spirals extending north-east and south of the star, respectively. We further detected
an arc-like structure north of the star. Finally a bright, compact and elongated structure was detected
at separation of 303 +/- 10 mas and position angle 21.2 +/- 3.7 degrees, just at the root of the north-east
spiral arm. Since this feature is visible both in polarized light and in total intensity and has a
flat spectrum it is likely caused by stellar light scattered by dust. Conclusions. The two spiral
arms are at different separation from the star, have very different pitch angles, and are separated
by an apparent discontinuity, suggesting they might have a different origin. The very open southern
spiral arm might be caused by infalling material from late encounters with cloudlets into the formation
environment of the star itself. The compact feature could be caused by interaction with a planet
in formation still embedded in its dust envelope and it could be responsible for launching the north-east
spiral. We estimate a mass of the putative embedded object of the order of few M_Jup .

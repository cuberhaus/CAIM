Blandford \& Znajek (1977) suggested that ``physical observers traveling around the hole with
the `frame-dragging-angular-velocity' $\omega$ will see the electric field reverse direction
on the surface $\omega=\Omega_{\rm F}$. Inside \emph{this surface} they see a Poynting flux of
energy going toward the hole." Based on thermodynamics, frame-dragging, and unipolar-induction,
we show that, when $0<\Omega_{\rm F}<\Omega_{\rm H}$, i.e., when the hole is losing energy electromagnetically,
\emph{this surface} (S$_{\rm N}$) always exists, where $\Omega_{\rm F}$ and $\Omega_{\rm H}$
are the field-lines' and the hole's angular velocities, respectively. The `inner domain' inside
S$_{\rm N}$ counter-rotates against the `outer domain,' and the Poynting flux $\vcSEM$ reverses
direction from outward to inward on S$_{\rm N}$, which means that the force-free and freezing-in
conditions `break down' on \emph{this surface}, severing current- and stream-lines when the magnetic
field-lines thread S$_{\rm N}$. Therefore, \emph{this surface} is the `magneto-centrifugal
divider' of the force-free magnetosphere into the two domains. Furthermore, we argue that a pair
of surface batteries with each EMF oppositely-directed are existent on both sides of S$_{\rm N}$.
The voltage drop between the two EMFs proportional to $\Omega_{\rm H}$ will result in a steady particle
source on S$_{\rm N}$, widening S$_{\rm N}$ to a `zero-angular-momentum' gap circulating the hole
with $\omega_{\rm N}=\Omega_{\rm F}$. In this `frame-dragged' magnetosphere, the \emph{in}going
flux of \emph{negative} angular momentum in the counter-rotating inner domain couples with the
`gravito-electric-potential gradient' $\omega$, to yield the outward flux of spin-down energy
$\mbox{\boldmath $S$}_{\rm SD}$ `extracted' from the hole. The overall energy flux is always outward,
except vanishing on S$_{\rm N}$.

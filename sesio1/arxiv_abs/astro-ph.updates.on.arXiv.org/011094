The eROSITA Final Equatorial-Depth Survey (eFEDS) executed during the performance verification
phase of the Spectrum- Roentgen-Gamma (SRG)/eROSITA telescope was completed in November 2019.
One of the science goals of this survey is to demonstrate the ability of eROSITA to detect samples
of clusters and groups at the final depth of the eROSITA All-Sky Survey. Due to the sizeable point-spread
function of eROSITA, high redshift clusters of galaxies or compact nearby groups hosting bright
active galactic nuclei (AGN) can be misclassified as point sources by the source detection algorithms.
A total of 357 galaxy clusters and groups were identified based on their red sequence in the eFEDS
point source catalog. In this work, we examine the multi-wavelength properties of these clusters
and groups to understand the potential biases in our selection process and the completeness of the
extent-selected sample. We find that the majority of the clusters and groups in the point source
sample are indeed under-luminous and compact compared to the extent-selected sample. Their faint
X-ray emission, well under the flux limit of the extent-selected eFEDS clusters, and their compact
X-ray emission are likely to be the main reason behind this misclassification. In the sample, we
confirm that 11% of the sources host AGN in their brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs). By studying
their X-ray, optical, and infrared, and radio properties, we establish a method to identify the
most extraordinary clusters and groups that host AGNs in their BCGs. We test this method through
the SDSS optical spectroscopy successfully on the current point source catalog and find four low
mass clusters and groups with active radio-loud AGNs. The method we developed will be used to identify
high redshift clusters and AGN dominated groups and low mass clusters misclassified in the future
eROSITA All-Sky Survey point source catalogs.

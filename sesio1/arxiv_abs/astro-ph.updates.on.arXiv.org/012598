(Abridged) Exoplanetary research has provided us with exciting discoveries of planets around
very low mass (VLM) stars (e.g., TRAPPIST-1 and Proxima Centauri). However, current theoretical
models strive to explain planet formation in these conditions and do not predict the development
of giant planets. Recent high-resolution observations from ALMA of the disk around CIDA 1, a VLM
star in Taurus, show substructures hinting at the presence of a massive planet. We aim to reproduce
the dust ring of CIDA 1, observed in the dust continuum emission in ALMA Band 7 (0.9 mm) and Band 4 (2.1
mm), along with its $^{12}$CO (J=3-2) and $^{13}$CO (J=3-2) channel maps, assuming the structures
are shaped by the interaction of the disk with a massive planet. We seek to retrieve the mass and position
of the putative planet. We model the protoplanetary disk with a set of hydrodynamical simulations,
varying the mass and locations of the embedded planet. We compute the dust and gas emission using
radiative transfer simulations, and, finally, we obtain the synthetic observations treating
the images as the actual ALMA observations. Our models indicate that a planet with a minimum mass
of $\sim1.4\,\text{M}_\text{Jup}$ orbiting at a distance of $\sim 9-10$ au can explain the morphology
and location of the observed dust ring at Band 7 and Band 4. We can reproduce the low spectral index
($\sim 2$) observed where the dust ring is detected. Our synthetic images reproduce the morphology
of the $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO observed channel maps where the cloud absorption allowed a detection.
Applying an empirical relation between planet mass and gap width in the dust, we predict a maximum
planet mass of $\sim4 - 8\,\text{M}_\text{Jup}$. Our results suggest the presence of a massive
planet orbiting CIDA 1, thus challenging our understanding of planet formation around VLM stars.

Brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) are very massive elliptical galaxies found at the centers of
clusters. Their study gives clues on the formation and evolution of the clusters in which they are
embedded. We analysed here in a homogeneous way the properties of a sample of more than one thousand
BCGs in the redshift range 0.15 < z < 0.7, based on images from the Canada France Hawaii Telescope Legacy
Survey. Based on the cluster catalogue of 1371 clusters by Sarron et al. (2018), we applied our automatic
BCG detection algorithm and identified successfully 70% of the BCGs in our sample. We analysed their
2D photometric properties with GALFIT. We also compared the position angles of the BCG major axes
with those of the overall cluster to which they belong. We found no evolution of the BCG properties
with redshift up to z = 0.7, in agreement with previous results by Chu et al. (2021), who analysed an
order of magnitude smaller sample, but reaching a redshift z = 1.8. The Kormendy relation for BCGs
is tight and consistent with that of normal elliptical galaxies and BCGs measured by other authors.
The position angles of the BCGs and of the cluster to which they belong agree within 30 degrees for
55% of the objects with well defined position angles. The study of this very large sample of more than
one thousand BCGs shows that they were mainly formed before z = 0.7, as we find no significant growth
for the luminosities and sizes of central galaxies. We discuss the importance of the intracluster
light in the interpretation of these results. We highlight the role of image depth in the modelisation
of the luminosity profiles of BCGs, and give evidence for the presence of an inner structure which
can only be resolved on deep surveys with limiting apparent magnitude at 80% completeness m80 > 26
mag/arcsec2.

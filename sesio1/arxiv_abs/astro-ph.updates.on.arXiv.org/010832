For ExAO instruments for the Giant Segmented Mirror Telescopes (GSMTs), alternative architectures
of WFS are under consideration because there is a tradeoff between detector size, speed, and noise
that reduces the performance of GSMT-ExAO wavefront control. One option under consideration for
a GSMT-ExAO wavefront sensor is a three-sided PWFS (3PWFS). The 3PWFS creates three copies of the
telescope pupil for wavefront sensing, compared to the conventional four-sided PWFS (4PWFS) which
uses four pupils. The 3PWFS uses fewer detector pixels than the 4PWFS and should therefore be less
sensitive to read noise. Here we develop a mathematical formalism based on the diffraction theory
description of the Foucault knife edge test that predicts the intensity pattern after the PWFS.
Our formalism allows us to calculate the intensity in the pupil images formed by the PWFS in the presence
of phase errors corresponding to arbitrary Fourier modes. We then use the Object Oriented MATLAB
Adaptive Optics toolbox (OOMAO) to simulate an end-to-end model of an adaptive optics system using
a PWFS with modulation and compare the performance of the 3PWFS to the 4PWFS. In the case of a low read
noise detector, the Strehl ratios of the 3PWFS and 4PWFS are within 0.01. When we included higher
read noise in the simulation, we found a Strehl ratio gain of 0.036 for the 3PWFS using Raw Intensity
over the 4PWFS using Slopes Maps at a stellar magnitude of 10. At the same magnitude, the 4PWFS RI also
outperformed the 4PWFS SM, but the gain was only 0.012 Strehl. This is significant because 4PWFS
using Slopes Maps is how the PWFS is conventionally used for AO wavefront sensing. We have found that
the 3PWFS is a viable wavefront sensor that can fully reconstruct a wavefront and produce a stable
closed-loop with correction comparable to that of a 4PWFS, with modestly better performance for
high read-noise detectors.

Extragalactic globular clusters (GCs) are key objects for studying the formation and evolution
of galaxies. The arrival of wide-field surveys such as the Javalambre Photometric Local Universe
Survey (J-PLUS) offers new possibilities for the study of GCs. Nevertheless, GCs are not detected
a priori by the data reduction pipeline of J-PLUS and, due to its pixel scale, the standard techniques
of GCs detection are challenged. To fill this gap, we develop a semi-automatic pipeline to detect
GCs in J-PLUS that can also be adapted to similar surveys. As a case study, we use data from the S0 galaxy
NGC 1023 and we also study the stellar population content of GC candidates in the galaxy. To detect
GCs, our methodology is based on Source Extractor and does not require a previous filtering or modelling
of the host galaxy. We study colors and perform spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis on our
final GC candidate catalog to obtain stellar population parameters. In NGC 1023, GCFinder identifies
523 GC candidates. We observe evidence of color bimodality in a few broad-band colors but not on narrow-band
colors. The SED analysis reveals a clear metallicity bimodality and we observe that narrow-band
filters are very useful to constrain metallicities. We also identified a broad age-metallicity
relation as well as a wide metallicity distribution that are evidence that NGC 1023 experienced
accretion events in the past. It is the first time this kind of study is performed with J-PLUS data.
By detecting GC candidates in wide-field images without modeling the light of the galaxy, GCFinder
becomes considerably faster, at a marginal loss of centrally-located GC candidates of about 7 percent.
As GCFinder is entirely based on Source Extractor, it could be easily incorporated into automated
software handling wide-field surveys.

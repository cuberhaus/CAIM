Gaseous flows inside and outside galaxies are the key to understand galaxy evolution, as they regulate
their star-formation activity across cosmic time. We study the ISM kinematics of 330 CIII] or HeII
emitters, using far-UV absorption lines detected in the VANDELS spectra. These galaxies span a
broad range of stellar masses from 10$^8$ to 10$^{11}$ M$_\odot$, and SFRs from 1 to 500 M$_\odot$/yr,
in the redshift range between 2 and 5. We find that the bulk ISM velocity v$_{ism}$ is globally in outflow,
with a v$_{ism}$ of -60 $\pm$ 10 km/s for low ionization gas traced by SiII 1260 Angstrom, CII 1334,
SiII 1526, and AlII 1670, and v$_{ism}$ of -160 $\pm$ 30 and -170 $\pm$ 30 km/s for higher ionization
gas traced respectively by AlIII 1854-1862 and SiIV 1393-1402. Interestingly, BPASS models are
able to better reproduce the stellar continuum around the SiIV doublet than other stellar population
templates. We also find that 34% of our sample has signatures of inflows (v$_{ism}>0$), almost double
than the fraction reported at lower redshifts. Comparing v$_{ism}$ to the host galaxies properties,
we find no significant correlations with the stellar mass and SFR, and a marginally significant
dependence (at $\sim 2\sigma$) on morphology related parameters, with slightly higher velocities
found in galaxies with smaller size (probed by the equivalent radius), higher concentration and
higher SFR surface density. The outflows are consistent with models of accelerating, momentum-driven
winds, and density decreasing with radius. Our moderately lower v$_{ism}$ compared to similar
studies at lower redshifts suggest that inflows and internal turbulence might play an increased
role at z>2. We estimate mass outflow rates comparable to the SFRs of the galaxies, and an average
escape velocity of 625 km/s, suggesting that most of the ISM will remain bound to the galaxy halo.

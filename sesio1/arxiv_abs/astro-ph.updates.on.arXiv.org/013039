We explore the possibility that primordial black holes (PBHs), formed early in the history of the
Universe, contain electric charge down to the present day. We find that PBHs should hold a non-zero
charge at their formation, sourced by both Poisson fluctuations and collisions of charged particles
in the early universe. Although initial charges could be of either sign and are thought to be subject
to fast discharge processes, we show that dipolar magnetic fields from rotating black holes can
deviate them, avoiding their accretion or emission to infinity, regardless of the PBH mass. Moreover,
we find that charged, maximally rotating PBHs produce magnetic fields able to cancel the Schwinger
effect for all masses, and the Hawking emission for PBHs with $M>1\,\mbox{kg}$. These mechanisms
could allow PBHs to maintain their charge for extended periods. At late times, we conclude that the
plasma within virialised dark matter haloes can endow PBHs with a net average negative charge. We
report resulting charges $Q/M \sim -10^{-32}\,C/\mbox{kg}$ and $Q/M \sim -10^{-22}\,C/\mbox{kg}$
for two current windows where PBHs can make up all of the dark matter; being respectively $M\sim 10^{20}\,\mbox{kg}$
and $M\sim 10^{30}\,\mbox{kg}$. The charge of PBHs in haloes lies below the Schwinger limit for
discharge, which would effectively make PBH dark matter slightly non-neutral to the present day.
Altogether, the initial PBH charge, possible shielding against discharge, and late time negative
charge accretion, show that PBHs of all masses could hold a net charge, with values about two to ten
orders of magnitude lower than the maximal bound imposed by subextremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om
(RN) PBHs, and even the extremal charge for Planck mass PBHs. The latter are of particular interest,
as they could constitute charged stable relics, composing the entirety of dark matter in the Universe.

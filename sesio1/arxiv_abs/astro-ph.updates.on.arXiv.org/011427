We present the KODIAQ-Z survey aimed to characterize the cool, photoionized gas at 2.2<z<3.6 in
202 HI-selected absorbers with 14.6<log N(HI)<20, i.e., the gaseous interface between galaxies
and the intergalactic medium (IGM). We find that the 14.6<log N(HI)<20 gas at 2.2<z<3.6 can be metal-rich
gas (-1.6<[X/H]<-0.2) as seen in damped Ly-alpha absorbers (DLAs); it can also be very metal-poor
([X/H]<-2.4) or even pristine gas ([X/H]<-3.8) not observed in DLAs, but commonly observed in the
IGM. For 16<log N(HI)<20 absorbers, the frequency of pristine absorbers is about 1%-10%, while
for 14.6<log N(HI)<16 absorbers it is 10%-20%, similar to the diffuse IGM. Supersolar gas is extremely
rare (<1%) in this gas. The factor of several thousand spread from the lowest to highest metallicities
and large metallicity variations (a factor of a few to >100) between absorbers separated by less
than 500 km/s imply that the metals are poorly mixed in 14.6<log N(HI)<20 gas. We show that these photoionized
absorbers contribute to about 10% of the cosmic baryons and 30% of the cosmic metals at 2.2<z<3.6.
We find the mean metallicity increases with N(HI), consistent with what is found in z<1 gas. The metallicity
of gas in this column density regime has increased by a factor ~8 from 2.2<z<3.6 to z<1, but the contribution
of the 14.6<log N(HI)<19 absorbers to the total metal budget of the universe at z<1 is half that at
2.2<z<3.6, indicating a substantial shift in the reservoirs of metals between these two epochs.
We compare the KODIAQ-Z results to FOGGIE cosmological zoom simulations. The simulations show
an evolution of [X/H] with N(HI) similar to our observational results. Very metal-poor absorbers
with [X/H]<-2.4 at z~2-3 in these simulations are excellent tracers of inflows, while higher metallicity
absorbers are a mixture of inflows and outflows.

We introduce a family of equations of state (EoS) for hybrid neutron star (NS) matter that is obtained
by a two-zone parabolic interpolation between a soft hadronic EoS at low densities and a set of stiff
quark matter EoS at high densities within a finite region of chemical potentials $\mu_H < \mu < \mu_Q$.
Fixing the hadronic EoS as the APR one and choosing the color-superconducting, nonlocal NJL model
with two free parameters for the quark phase, we perform Bayesian analyses with this two-parameter
family of hybrid EoS. Using three different sets of observational constraints that include the
mass of PSR J0740+6620, the tidal deformability for GW170817, and the mass-radius relation for
PSR J0030+0451 from NICER as obligatory (set 1), while set 2 uses the possible upper limit on the maximum
mass from GW170817 as an additional constraint and set 3 instead of the possibility that the lighter
object in the asymmetric binary merger GW190814 is a neutron star. We confirm that in any case, the
quark matter phase has to be color superconducting with the dimensionless diquark coupling approximately
fulfilling the Fierz relation $\eta_D=0.75$ and the most probable solutions exhibiting a proportionality
between $\eta_D$ and $\eta_V$, the coupling of the repulsive vector interaction that is required
for a sufficiently large maximum mass. We used the Bayesian analysis to investigate with the method
of fictitious measurements the consequences of anticipating different radii for the massive $2~M_\odot$
PSR J0740+6220 for the most likely equation of state. With the actual outcome of the NICER radius
measurement on PSR J0740+6220 we could conclude that for the most likely hybrid star EoS would not
support a maximum mass as large as $2.5~M_\odot$ so that the event GW190814 was a binary black hole
merger.

Within our international program to obtain accurate physical properties of trans-Neptunian objects
(TNOs) we predicted a stellar occultation by the TNO (38628) Huya of the star Gaia DR2 4352760586390566400
(mG = 11.5 mag.) for March 18, 2019. After an extensive observational campaign, we updated the prediction
and it turned out to be favorable to central Europe. Therefore, we mobilized half a hundred professional
and amateur astronomers, and the occultation was finally detected from 21 telescopes located at
18 sites. This makes the Huya event one of the best ever observed stellar occultation by a TNO in terms
of the number of chords. We determine accurate size, shape, and geometric albedo, and we also provide
constraints on the density and other internal properties of this TNO. The 21 positive detections
of the occultation by Huya allowed us to obtain well-separated chords which permitted us to fit an
ellipse for the limb of the body at the moment of the occultation (i.e., the instantaneous limb) with
kilometric accuracy. The projected semi-major and minor axes of the best ellipse fit obtained using
the occultation data are (a', b') = (217.6 $\pm$ 3.5 km, 194.1 $\pm$ 6.1 km) with a position angle of
the minor axis P' = 55.2 $\pm$ 9.1 degrees. From this fit, the projected area-equivalent diameter
is 411.0 $\pm$ 7.3 km. This diameter is compatible with the equivalent diameter for Huya obtained
from radiometric techniques (D = 406 $\pm$ 16 km). From this instantaneous limb, we obtained the
geometric albedo for Huya (p$\rm_V$ = 0.079 $\pm$ 0.004) and we explored possible 3D shapes and constraints
to the mass density for this TNO. We did not detect the satellite of Huya through this occultation,
but the presence of rings or debris around Huya is constrained using the occultation data. We also
derived an upper limit for a putative Pluto-like global atmosphere of about p$_{\rm surf}$ = 10 nbar.

There are now strong indications that white dwarf (WD) stars with masses well below the Chandrasekhar
limit (MCh ~ 1.4 Msun) contribute a significant fraction of SN Ia progenitors. The relative fraction
of stable iron-group elements synthesized in the explosion has been suggested as a possible discriminant
between MCh and sub-MCh events. In particular, it is thought that the higher-density ejecta of MCh
WDs, which favours the synthesis of stable isotopes of nickel, results in prominent [Ni II] lines
in late-time spectra. We study the explosive nucleosynthesis of stable nickel in SNe Ia resulting
from MCh and sub-MCh progenitors, and explore the potential for lines of [Ni II] at 7378 A and 1.94
microns in late-time spectra to serve as a diagnostic of the exploding WD mass, using nonlocal thermodynamic
equilibrium radiative-transfer simulations with the CMFGEN code. We find that the radiative proton-capture
reaction 57Co(p,gamma)58Ni is the dominant production mode for 58Ni in both MCh and sub-MCh models,
while the alpha-capture reaction on 54Fe has a negligible impact on the final 58Ni yield. More importantly,
we demonstrate that the lack of [Ni II] lines in late-time spectra of sub-MCh events is not always
due to an under-abundance of stable Ni, but results from the higher ionization of Ni in the inner ejecta.
Conversely, the strong [Ni II] lines predicted in our 1D MCh models are completely suppressed when
56Ni is sufficiently mixed with the innermost layers rich in stable iron-group elements. [Ni II]
lines in late-time SN Ia spectra have a complex dependency on the abundance of stable Ni, which limits
their use alone in distinguishing between MCh and sub-MCh progenitors. However, we argue that a
low-luminosity SN Ia displaying strong [Ni II] lines would most likely result from a Chandrasekhar-mass
progenitor. [Abridged]

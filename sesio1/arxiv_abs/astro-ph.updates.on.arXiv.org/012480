The X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU) is the high resolution X-ray spectrometer of ESA's Athena
X-ray observatory. It will deliver X-ray data in the 0.2-12 keV band with an unprecedented spectral
resolution of 2.5 eV up to 7 keV. During the observation of very bright X-ray sources, the X-IFU detectors
will receive high photon rates. The count rate capability of the X-IFU will be improved by using the
defocusing option, which will enable the observations of extremely bright sources with fluxes
up to $\simeq 1$ Crab. In the defocused mode, the point spread function (PSF) of the telescope will
be spread over a large number of pixels. In this case, each pixel receives a small fraction of the overall
flux. Due to the energy dependence of the PSF, this mode will generate energy dependent artefacts
increasing with count rate if not analysed properly. To account for the degradation of the energy
resolution with pulse separation in a pixel, a grading scheme (here four grades) will be defined
to affect the proper energy response to each event. This will create selection effects preventing
the use of the nominal Auxiliary Response File (ARF) for all events. We present a new method for the
reconstruction of the spectra obtained from observations performed with a PSF that varies as a function
of energy. We apply our method to the case of the X-IFU spectra obtained during the defocused observations.
We use the end-to-end SIXTE simulator to model defocused X-IFU observations. Then we estimate new
ARF for each of the grades by calculating the effective area at the level of each pixel. Our method
allows us to successfully reconstruct the spectra of bright sources when employed in the defocused
mode, without any bias. Finally, we address how various sources of uncertainty related to our knowledge
of the PSF as a function of energy affect our results.

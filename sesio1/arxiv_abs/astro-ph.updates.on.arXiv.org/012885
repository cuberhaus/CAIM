Relatively little is understood about the atmospheric composition of temperate to warm exoplanets
(equilibrium temperature $T_{\rm eq}<$ 1000 K), as many of them are found to have uncharacteristically
flat transmission spectra. Their flattened spectra are likely due to atmospheric opacity sources
such as planet-wide photochemical hazes and condensation clouds. We compile the transmission
spectra of 25 warm exoplanets previously observed by the Hubble Space Telescope and quantify the
haziness of each exoplanet using a normalized amplitude of the water absorption feature ($A_{\rm
H}$). By examining the relationships between $A_{\rm H}$ and various planetary and stellar forcing
parameters, we endeavor to find correlations of haziness associated with planetary properties.
We adopt new statistical correlation tests that are more suitable for the small, non-normally distributed
warm exoplanet sample. Our analysis shows that none of the parameters hold statistically significant
correlation with $A_{\rm H}$ ($p \le 0.01$) with the addition of new exoplanet data, including the
previously identified linear trends between $A_{\rm H}$ and $T_{\rm{eq}}$ or hydrogen-helium
envelope mass fraction (f$_{\rm{HHe}}$). This suggests that haziness in warm exoplanets is not
simply controlled by any single planetary/stellar parameter. Among all the parameters we investigated,
planet gravity ($g_{\rm p}$), atmospheric scale height ($H$), planet density ($\rho_{\rm p}$),
orbital eccentricity ($e$), and age of the star ($t_{\rm age}$) hold tentative correlations with
$A_{\rm H}$. Specifically, lower $H$, higher $g_{\rm p}$, $\rho_{\rm p}$, $e$, or $t_{\rm age}$
may lead to clearer atmospheres. We still need more observations and laboratory experiments to
fully understand the complex physics and chemistry involved in creating hazy warm exoplanets.

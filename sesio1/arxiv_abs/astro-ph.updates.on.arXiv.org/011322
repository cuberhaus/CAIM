Neutrinos are copiously emitted by neutron star mergers, due to the high temperatures reached by
dense matter during the merger and its aftermath. Neutrinos influence the merger dynamics and shape
the properties of the ejecta, including the resulting $r$-process nucleosynthesis and kilonova
emission. In this work, we analyze neutrino emission from a large sample of merger radiation hydrodynamics
simulations in Numerical Relativity, covering a broad range of initial masses, nuclear equation
of state and viscosity treatments. We extract neutrino luminosities and mean energies, and compute
quantities of interest such as the peak values, peak broadnesses, time averages and decrease time
scales. We provide a systematic description of such quantities, including their dependence on
the initial parameters of the system. We find that for equal-mass systems the total neutrino luminosity
(several $10^{53}{\rm erg~s^{-1}}$) decreases for increasing reduced tidal deformability,
as a consequence of the less violent merger dynamics. Similarly, tidal disruption in asymmetric
mergers leads to systematically smaller luminosities. Peak luminosities can be twice as large
as the average ones. Electron antineutrino luminosities dominate (initially by a factor of 2-3)
over electron neutrino ones, while electron neutrinos and heavy flavour neutrinos have similar
luminosities. Mean energies are nearly constant in time and independent on the binary parameters.
Their values reflect the different decoupling temperature inside the merger remnant. Despite
present uncertainties in neutrino modelling, our results provide a broad and physically grounded
characterization of neutrino emission, and they can serve as a reference point to develop more sophisticated
neutrino transport schemes.

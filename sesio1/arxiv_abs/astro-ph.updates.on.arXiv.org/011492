The calibration and validation of scientific analysis in simulations is a fundamental tool to ensure
unbiased and robust results in observational cosmology. In particular, mock galaxy catalogs are
a crucial resource to achieve these goals in the measurement of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO)
in the clustering of galaxies. Here we present a set of 1952 galaxy mock catalogs designed to mimic
the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3 BAO sample over its full photometric redshift range $0.6<z_{\rm
photo}<1.1$. The mocks are based upon 488 ICE-COLA fast $N$-body simulations of full-sky light
cones and were created by populating halos with galaxies, using a hybrid halo occupation distribution
- halo abundance matching model. This model has ten free parameters, which were determined, for
the first time, using an automatic likelihood minimization procedure. We also introduced a novel
technique to assign photometric redshift for simulated galaxies, following a two-dimensional
probability distribution with VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey (VIPERS) data. The
calibration was designed to match the observed abundance of galaxies as a function of photometric
redshift, the distribution of photometric redshift errors, and the clustering amplitude on scales
smaller than those used for BAO measurements. An exhaustive analysis was done to ensure that the
mocks reproduce the input properties. Finally, mocks were tested by comparing the angular correlation
function $w(\theta)$, angular power spectrum $C_\ell$, and projected clustering $\xi_p(r_\perp)$
to theoretical predictions and data. The impact of volume replication in the estimate of the covariance
is also investigated. The success in accurately reproducing the photometric redshift uncertainties
and the galaxy clustering as a function of redshift render this mock creation pipeline as a benchmark
for future analyses of photometric galaxy surveys.

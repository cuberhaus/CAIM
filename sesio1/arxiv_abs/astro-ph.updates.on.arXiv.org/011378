The nebular recombination line H$\alpha$ is widely used as a star-formation rate (SFR) indicator
in the local and high-redshift Universe. We present a detailed H$\alpha$ radiative transfer study
of high-resolution isolated Milky-Way and Large Magellanic Cloud simulations that include radiative
transfer, non-equilibrium thermochemistry, and dust evolution. We focus on the spatial morphology
and temporal variability of the H$\alpha$ emission, and its connection to the underlying gas and
star formation properties. The H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ radial and vertical surface brightness
profiles are in excellent agreement with observations of nearby galaxies. We find that the fraction
of H$\alpha$ emission from collisional excitation amounts to $f_{\rm col}\sim5-10\%$, only weakly
dependent on radius and vertical height, and that scattering boosts the H$\alpha$ luminosity by
$\sim40\%$. The dust correction via the Balmer decrement works well (intrinsic H$\alpha$ emission
recoverable within $25\%$), though the dust attenuation law depends on the amount of attenuation
itself both on spatially resolved and integrated scales. Important for the understanding of the
H$\alpha$-SFR connection is the dust and helium absorption of ionizing radiation (Lyman continuum
[LyC] photons), which are about $f_{\rm abs}\approx28\%$ and $f_{\rm He}\approx9\%$, respectively.
Together with an escape fraction of $f_{\rm esc}\approx6\%$, this reduces the available budget
for hydrogen line emission by nearly half ($f_{\rm H}\approx57\%$). We discuss the impact of the
diffuse ionized gas, showing - among other things - that the extraplanar H$\alpha$ emission is powered
by LyC photons escaping the disc. Future applications of this framework to cosmological (zoom-in)
simulations will assist in the interpretation of spectroscopy of high-redshift galaxies with
the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope.

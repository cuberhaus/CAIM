We conduct simulations of the inner regions of protoplanetary disks (PPDs) to investigate the effects
of protostellar magnetic fields on their long-term evolution. We use an inner boundary model that
incorporates the influence of a stellar magnetic field. The position of the inner disk is dependent
on the mass accretion rate as well as the magnetic field strength. We use this model to study the response
of a magnetically truncated inner disk to an episodic accretion event. Additionally, we vary the
protostellar magnetic field strength and investigate the consequences of the magnetic field on
the long-term behavior of PPDs. We use the fully implicit 1+1D TAPIR code which solves the axisymmetric
hydrodynamic equations self-consistently. Our model allows us to investigate disk dynamics close
to the star and to conduct long-term evolution simulations simultaneously and includes the radial
radiation transport in the stationary diffusion limit. We include stellar magnetic torques, the
influence of a pressure gradient, and a variable inner disk radius in the TAPIR code to describe the
innermost disk region in a more self-consistent manner and can show that this approach alters the
disk dynamics considerably compared to a simplified diffusive evolution equation, especially
during outbursts. The influences of a prescribed stellar magnetic field, local pressure gradients,
and a variable inner disk radius result in a more consistent description of the gas dynamics in the
innermost regions of PPDs. Combining magnetic torques acting on the innermost disk regions with
the long-term evolution of PPDs yields previously unseen results, whereby the whole disk structure
is affected over its entire lifetime. Additionally, we want to emphasize that a combination of our
1+1D model with more sophisticated multi-dimensional codes could improve the understanding of
PPDs even further.

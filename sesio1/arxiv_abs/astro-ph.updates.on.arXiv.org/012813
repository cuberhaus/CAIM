The solar corona is host to a continuous flow of propagating disturbances (PD). These are continuous
and ubiquitous across broad regions of the corona, including the quiet Sun. The aim of this paper
is to present an improved, efficient method to create velocity vector field maps, based on the direction
and magnitude of the PD as observed in time series of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images. The method
is presented here for use with the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)/Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO) EUV channels, and takes as input \app2 hours of images at the highest 12s cadence. Data from
a region near disk center is extracted, and a process called time normalization applied to the co-aligned
data. Following noise reduction using \atrous\ decomposition, the PD are effectively revealed.
A modified Lucas Kanade algorithm is then used to map the velocity field. The method described here
runs comfortably on a desktop computer in a few minutes, and offers an order of magnitude improvement
in efficiency compared to a previous implementation. Applied to a region of the quiet Sun, we find
that the velocity field describes a mosaic of cells of coherent outwardly-diverging PD flows, of
typical size 50 to 100\arcsec\ (36 to 72Mm). The flows originate from points and narrow corridors
in the cell centres, and end in the narrow boundaries between cells. Visual comparison with ultraviolet
AIA images shows that the flow sources are correlated with the bright photospheric supergranular
network boundaries. Assuming that the PD follow the local magnetic field, the velocity flow field
is a proxy for the plane-of-sky distribution of the coronal magnetic field, and therefore the maps
offer a unique insight into the topology of the corona. These are particularly valuable for quiet
Sun regions where the appearance of structures in EUV images is hard to interpret.

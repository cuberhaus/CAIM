We evaluate the consistency between lensing and clustering probes of large-scale structure based
on measurements of projected galaxy clustering from BOSS combined with overlapping galaxy-galaxy
lensing from three surveys: DES Y3, HSC Y1, and KiDS-1000. An intra-lensing-survey study finds
good agreement between these lensing data. We model the observations using the Dark Emulator and
fit the data at two fixed cosmologies: Planck, with $S_8=0.83$, and a Lensing cosmology with $S_8=0.76$.
For a joint analysis limited to scales with $R>5.25h^{-1}$Mpc, we find that both cosmologies provide
an acceptable fit to the data. Full utilisation of the small-scale clustering and lensing measurements
is hindered by uncertainty in the impact of baryon feedback and assembly bias, which we account for
with a reasoned theoretical error budget. We incorporate a systematic scaling parameter for each
redshift bin, $A$, that decouples the lensing and clustering to capture any inconsistency. When
a wide range of scales ($0.15<R<60h^{-1}$Mpc) are incorporated, we find different results for
the consistency of clustering and lensing between the two cosmologies. Limiting the analysis to
the bins for which the impact of the selection of the lens sample is expected to be minimal, for the
low-$S_8$ Lensing cosmology, the measurements are consistent with $A$=1; $A=0.91\pm0.04$ using
DES+KiDS and $A=0.97\pm0.06$ using HSC. For the Planck cosmology case, we find a discrepancy: $A=0.79\pm0.03$
using DES+KiDS and $A=0.84\pm0.05$ using HSC. We demonstrate that a kSZ-based estimate for baryonic
effects alleviates some of the discrepancy in the Planck cosmology. This analysis demonstrates
the statistical power of these small-scale measurements, but also indicates that caution is still
warranted given current uncertainties in modelling baryonic effects, assembly bias, and selection
effects in the foreground sample.

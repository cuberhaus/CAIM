The baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) peak, seen in the cosmic matter distribution at redshifts
up to ~3.5, reflects the continued expansion of the sonic horizon first identified in temperature
anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background. The BAO peak position can now be measured to better
than ~1% accuracy using galaxies, and ~1.4-1.6% precision with Ly-alpha forrests and the clustering
of quasars. In conjunction with the Alcock-Paczy\'nski (AP) effect, which arises from the changing
ratio of angular to spatial/redshift size of (presumed) spherically-symmetric source distributions
with distance, the BAO measurement is viewed as one of the most powerful tools to use in assessing
the geometry of the Universe. In this paper, we employ five BAO peak measurements from the final release
of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV, at average redshifts <z>=0.38, 0.51, 0.70, 1.48 and 2.33, to carry
out a direct head-to-head comparison of the standard model, Lambda-CDM, and one of its principal
competitors, known as the R_h=ct universe. For completeness, we complement the AP diagnostic with
a volume-averaged distance probe that assumes a constant comoving distance scale r_d. Both probes
are free of uncertain parameters, such as the Hubble constant, and are therefore ideally suited
for this kind of model selection. We find that R_h=ct is favored by these measurements over the standard
model based solely on the AP effect, with a likelihood ~75% versus ~25%, while Planck-Lambda-CDM
is favored over R_h=ct based solely on the volume-averaged distance probe, with a likelihood ~80%
versus ~20%. A joint analysis using both probes produces an inconclusive outcome, yielding comparable
likelihoods to both models. We are therefore not able to confirm with this work that the BAO data,
on their own, support an accelerating Universe.

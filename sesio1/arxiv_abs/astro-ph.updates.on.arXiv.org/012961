Over the last few years, the detection of gravitational waves from binary neutron star systems has
rekindled our hopes for a deeper understanding of the unknown nature of ultra dense matter. In particular,
gravitational wave constraints on the tidal deformability of a neutron star can be translated into
constraints on several neutron star properties using a set of universal relations. Apart from binary
neutron star mergers, supernova explosions are also important candidates for the detection of
multimessenger signals. Such observations may allow us to impose significant constraints on the
binding energy of neutron stars. The purpose of the present study is twofold. Firstly, we investigate
the agreement of finite temperature equations of state with established universal relations.
Secondly, we examine the possible existence of a universal relation between the binding energy
and the dimensionless tidal deformability, which are the bulk properties connected to the most
promising sources for multimessenger signals. We find that hot equations of state are not always
compatible with accepted universal relations. Therefore, the use of such expressions for probing
general relativity or imposing constraints on the structure of neutron stars would be inconclusive
(when thermal effects are present). Additionally, we show that the binding energy and the dimensionless
tidal deformability exhibit a universal trend at least for moderate neutron star masses. The latter
allows us to set bounds on the binding energy of a 1.4 $M_\odot$ neutron star using data from the GW170817
event. Finally, we provide a relation between the compactness, the binding energy and the dimensionless
tidal deformability of a neutron star, that is not only independent on the employed equation of state
but also holds when thermal effects are present.

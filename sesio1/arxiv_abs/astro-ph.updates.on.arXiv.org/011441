The aim of this study is to measure the vertical distribution of HCN on Titan's stratosphere using
ground-based submm observations acquired quasi-simultaneously with the Herschel ones. This
allows us to perform a consistency check between space and ground-based observations and to build
a reference mean HCN vertical profile in Titan's stratosphere. Using APEX and IRAM 30-m, we obtained
the spectral emission of HCN (4-3) and (3-2) lines. We applied a line-by-line radiative transfer
code to calculate the synthetic spectra of HCN, and a retrieval algorithm based on optimal estimation
to retrieve the temperature and HCN distributions. Our derived HCN abundance profiles are consistent
with an increase from 40 ppb at ~100 km to 4 ppm at ~200 km, which is an altitude region where the HCN signatures
are sensitive. We also demonstrate that the retrieved HCN distribution is sensitive to the data
information. Comparisons between our results and the values from Herschel show similar abundance
distributions, with maximum differences of 2.5 ppm ranging between 100 and 300 km. These comparisons
also allow us to inter-validate both data sets and indicate reliable and consistent measurements.
The inferred abundances are also consistent with the distribution in previous observational studies,
with the profiles from ALMA, Cassini/CIRS, and SMA (the latest ones below ~230 km). Our HCN profile
is also comparable to photochemical models by Krasnopolsky (2014) and Vuitton et al. (2019) below
230 km and consistent with that of Loison et al. (2015) above 250 km. However, it appears to show large
differences with respect to the estimates by Loison et al. (2015), Dobrijevic & Loison (2018), and
Lora et al. (2018) below 170 km, and by Dobrijevic & Loison (2018) and Lora et al. (2018) above 400 km,
although they are similar in shape. We conclude that these particular photochemical models need
improvement.

An upper limit on the mass of a black hole set by the pair-instability supernovae (PISN) process can
be useful in inferring the redshift of the gravitational wave (GW) sources by lifting the degeneracy
between mass and redshift. However, for this technique to work, it is essential that the PISN mass-scale
is redshift independent or at least has a predictable redshift dependence. We show that the observed
PISN mass-scale is likely to exhibit a strong redshift dependence due to a non-zero value of the delay
time between the formation of a star and the merging of two black holes. This will lead to a merger of
black holes formed at a different cosmic time, over which the stellar metallicity of the parent star
can vary significantly. As a result, the observed PISN mass scale inferred from GW sources will be
redshift dependent. Due to the unknown form of the delay-time distribution, the redshift dependence
of the PISN mass cut-off of the binary black holes (BBHs) cannot be well characterized and will exhibit
a large variation with the change in redshift. As a result, the use of a fixed PISN mass scale to infer
the redshift of the BBHs from the observed masses will be systematically biased. Though this uncertainty
is not severe for the third observation run conducted by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration, in
the future this uncertainty will cause a systematic error in the redshift inferred from PISN mass
scale. The corresponding systematic error will be a bottleneck in achieving a few percent precision
measurements of the cosmological parameters using this method in the future. The origin of the redshift
dependence of the mass distribution of BBHs proposed in this analysis will also be useful for understanding
the population of GW sources inferred using both well-detected events and the stochastic GW background.

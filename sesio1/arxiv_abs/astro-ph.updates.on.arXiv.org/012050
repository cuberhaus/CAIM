We present Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 photometric and grism observations of the
candidate ultra-high-redshift (z>7) radio galaxy, GLEAM J0917-0012. This radio source was selected
due to the curvature in its 70-230 MHz, low-frequency Murchison Widefield Array radio spectrum
and its faintness in K-band. Follow-up spectroscopic observations of this source with the VLA and
ALMA were inconclusive as to its redshift. Our F105W and F0986M imaging observations detect the
host of GLEAM J0917-0012 and a companion galaxy, ~one arcsec away. The G102 grism observations reveal
a single weak line in each of the spectra of the host and the companion. To help identify these lines
we utilised several photometric redshift techniques including template fitting to the grism spectra,
fitting the UV-to-radio photometry with galaxy templates plus a synchrotron model, fitting of
the UV-to-near-infrared photometry with EAZY, and fitting the radio data alone with RAiSERed.
For the host of GLEAM J0917-0012 we find a line at 1.12 micron and the UV-to-radio spectral energy
distribution fitting favours solutions at z~2 or z~8. While this fitting shows a weak preference
for the lower redshift solution, the models from the higher redshift solution are more consistent
with the strength of the spectral line. The redshift constraint by RAiSERed of z>6.5 also supports
the interpretation that this line could be Lyman-alpha at z=8.21; however EAZY favours the z~2 solution.
We discuss the implications of both solutions. For the companion galaxy we find a line at 0.98 micron
and the spectral energy distribution fitting favours solutions at z<3 implying that the line could
be the [OII]3727 doublet at z=1.63 (although the EAZY solution is z~2.6+/-0.5). Further observations
are still required to unambiguously determine the redshift of this intriguing candidate ultra-high-redshift
radio galaxy (abridged).

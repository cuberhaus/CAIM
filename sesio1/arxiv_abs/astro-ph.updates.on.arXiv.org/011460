Context. Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data and analysis tools improved a lot after the last analysis
on Kes 79 (Auchettl et al. 2014) whose age is 4.4-6.7 kyr. Recent multi-wavelength studies on this
mid-aged supernova remnant (SNR) revealed more physical properties of it, e.g., the age, the size,
the shock-cloud interaction. Aims. In this work, we analyse the 11.5-year Fermi-LAT data to investigate
the -ray features in this region. Then, we explore several models to infer their origins. Methods.
We use the >5 GeV Fermi-LAT data to better distinguish sub-features in the SNR region, and then extend
the energy down to 100 MeV to investigate the spectrum of the entire SNR region. We explored hadronic
models with leaked cosmic-rays (CRs) from the shock-cloud collision, and also examine the leptonic
contribution from pulsars in/around this region. Results. In our work, our result shows a more significant
detection ($\sim$34.8$\sigma$) with 4FGL J1852.4+0037e. And it also shows a low peak energy E$_{break}
\sim $ 0.5 GeV with the spectrum down to 100 MeV with BPL model fit. In $\ge$5 GeV, we detect two extend
sources, Src-N located to the north of the SNR and Src-S to the south of the SNR. They have different
spectral shapes. Conclusions. Our hadronic model with leaked CRs from the SNR Kes 79 after the shock-cloud
collision can predominantly reproduce the GeV emission at a northeast part of Src-S with typical
values of parameters. Three known pulsars inside Src-S release a total power that is too low to account
for the $\gamma$-ray emission. On the other hand, we found that the SNR cannot provide enough CRs
reaching clouds at Src-N to explain the local GeV spectrum, and we propose that the Src-N emission
may be dominated by a putative pulsar-wind-nebula powered by PSR J1853+0056.

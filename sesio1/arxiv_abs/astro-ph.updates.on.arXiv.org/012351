Solar flares create adverse space weather impacting space and Earth-based technologies. However,
the difficulty of forecasting flares, and by extension severe space weather, is accentuated by
the lack of any unique flare trigger or a single physical pathway. Studies indicate that multiple
physical properties contribute to active region flare potential, compounding the challenge.
Recent developments in Machine Learning (ML) have enabled analysis of higher dimensional data
leading to increasingly better flare forecasting techniques. However, consensus on high-performing
flare predictors remains elusive. In the most comprehensive study till date, we conduct a comparative
analysis of four popular ML techniques (K-Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, Random Forest
Classifier, and Support Vector Machine) by training these on magnetic parameters obtained from
the Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) during the
entirety of solar cycle 24. We demonstrate that Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine
algorithms perform extremely well in forecasting active region flaring potential. The logistic
regression algorithm returns the highest true skill score of $0.967 \pm 0.018$, possibly the highest
classification performance achieved with any parametric study alone. From a comparative assessment,
we establish that the magnetic properties like total current helicity, total vertical current
density, total unsigned flux, R\_value, and total absolute twist are the top-performing flare
indicators. We also introduce and analyze two new performance metrics, namely, Severe and Clear
Space Weather indicators. Our analysis constrains the most successful ML algorithms and identifies
physical parameters that contribute most to active region flare productivity.

Extreme temperature contrasts between the day and nightside of ultra-hot Jupiters result in significantly
asymmetric atmospheres, with a large expansion occurring over a small range of longitude around
the terminator. Over the course of a transit, WASP-76b rotates by about 30 degree, changing the observable
part of the atmosphere and invoking variations in the appearance of its constituents. As recently
reported, this results in time-variable effects in the neutral iron signal, which are amplified
by its possible condensation on the nightside. Here, we study the presence of molecular signals
during a transit of WASP-76b observed with the CARMENES spectrograph and compare the contributions
from this planet's morning and evening terminators. The results are somewhat puzzling, with formal
detections of water vapor (5.5$\sigma$) and hydrogen cyanide (5.2$\sigma$) but at significantly
different positions in the K$_p$-V$_{sys}$ diagram, with a blueshift of -14.3 $\pm$ 2.6 km/s and
a redshift of $+$20.8 $^{+7.8}_{-3.9}$ km/s respectively, and a higher K$_p$ than expected. The
H$_2$O signal also appears stronger later on in the transit, in contrast to that of HCN, which seems
stronger early on. We tentatively explain this by silicate clouds forming and raining out on the
nightside, partially removing oxygen from the upper atmosphere. For C/O values between 0.7 and
1, this leads to the formation of HCN at the morning limb. At the evening terminator, with the sequestered
oxygen being returned to the gas phase due to evaporation, these C/O values lead to formation of H$_2$O
instead of HCN. If confirmed, these results indicate that individual molecules trace different
parts of the atmosphere, as well as nightside condensation, allowing spatial characterization.
As these results are based on a single transit, we advocate that more data are needed to confirm them
and further explore these scenarios.

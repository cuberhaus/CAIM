Around $10^5$ strongly lensed galaxies are expected to be discovered with Euclid and the LSST. Utilising
these large samples to study the inner structure of lens galaxies requires source redshifts, to
turn lens models into mass measurements. However, obtaining spectroscopic source redshifts for
large lens samples is prohibitive with the capacity of spectroscopic facilities. Alternatively,
we study the possibility of obtaining source photometric redshifts (photo-zs) for large lens samples.
Our strategy consists of deblending the source and lens light by simultaneously modelling the lens
and background source in all available photometric bands, and feeding the derived source colours
to a template-fitting photo-z algorithm. We describe the lens and source light with a Sersic profile,
and the lens mass with a Singular Isothermal Ellipsoid. We test our approach on a simulated and a real
sample of lenses, both in broad-band photometry of the Hyper Suprime-Cam survey. We identify the
deviations of the lens light from a Sersic profile and the contrast between the lens and source image
as the main drivers of the source colour measurement error. We split the real sample based on the ratio
$\Lambda$ of the lens to source surface brightness measured at the image locations. In the $\Lambda<1$
regime, the photo-z outlier fraction is $20\%$, and the accuracy of photo-z estimation is limited
by the performance of template-fitting process. In the opposite regime, the photo-z outlier fraction
is $75\%$, and the errors from the source colour measurements dominate the photo-z uncertainty.
Measuring source photo-zs for lenses with $\Lambda<1$ poses no particular challenges, compared
to isolated galaxies. For systems with significant lens light contamination, however, improving
the description of the surface brightness distribution of the lens is required: a single Sersic
model is not sufficiently accurate.

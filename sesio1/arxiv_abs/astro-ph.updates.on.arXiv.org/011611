The Orion molecular cloud complex harbours the nearest GMCs and site of high-mass star formation.
Its YSO populations are thoroughly characterized. The region is therefore a prime target for the
study of star formation. Here, we verify the performance of the SuperCAM 64 pixel heterodyne array
on APEX. We give a descriptive overview of a set of wide-field CO(3-2) spectral cubes obtained towards
the Orion GMC complex, aimed at characterizing the dynamics and structure of the extended molecular
gas in diverse regions of the clouds, ranging from very active sites of clustered star formation
in Orion B to comparatively quiet regions in southern Orion A. We present a 2.7 square degree (130pc$^2$)
mapping survey in the CO(3-2) transition, obtained using SuperCAM on APEX at an angular resolution
of 19'' (7600AU or 0.037pc at a distance of 400pc), covering L1622, NGC2071, NGC2068, OriB9, NGC2024,
and NGC2023 in Orion B, and the southern part of the L1641 cloud in Orion A. We describe CO integrated
emission and line moment maps and position-velocity diagrams and discuss a few sub-regions in some
detail. Evidence for expanding bubbles is seen with lines splitting into double components, most
prominently in NGC2024, where we argue that the bulk of the molecular gas is in the foreground of the
HII region. High CO(3-2)/CO(1-0) line ratios reveal warm CO along the western edge of Orion B in the
NGC2023/NGC2024 region facing the IC434 HII region. Multiple, well separated radial velocity
components seen in L1641-S suggest that it consists of a sequence of clouds at increasingly larger
distances. We find a small, spherical cloud - the 'Cow Nebula' globule - north of NGC2071. We trace
high velocity line wings for the NGC2071-IR outflow and the NGC2024 CO jet. The protostellar dust
core FIR4 (rather than FIR5) is the true driving source of the NGC2024 monopolar outflow.

High-precision photometric data from space missions have improved our understanding of stellar
granulation. These observations have shown with precision the stochastic brightness fluctuations
of stars across the HR diagram, allowing us to better understand how stellar surface convection
reacts to a change in stellar parameters. These fluctuations need to be understood and quantified
in order to improve the detection and characterization of exoplanets. In this work, we provide new
scaling relations of two characteristic properties of the brightness fluctuations time series,
the standard deviation ($\sigma$) and the auto-correlation time ($\tau\rm_{eff}$). This was
done by using long time series of 3D stellar atmosphere models at different metallicities and across
the HR diagram, generated with a 3D radiative hydrodynamical code: the STAGGER code. We compared
our synthetic granulation properties with the values of a large sample of Kepler stars, and analyzed
selected stars with accurate stellar parameters from the Kepler LEGACY sample. Our 3D models showed
that $\sigma\propto\nu\rm_{max}^{-0.567\pm0.012}$ and $\tau\rm_{eff}\propto\nu\rm_{max}^{-0.997\pm0.018}$
for stars at solar metallicity. We showed that both $\sigma$ and $\tau\rm_{eff}$ decrease with
metallicity, although the metallicity dependence is more significant on $\sigma$. Unlike previous
studies, we found very good agreement between $\sigma$ from Kepler targets and the 3D models at $\log{g}\leq3.5$,
and a good correlation between the stars and models with $\log{g}\geq3.5$. For $\tau\rm_{eff}$,
we found that the 3D models reproduced well the Kepler LEGACY star values. Overall, this study shows
that 3D stellar atmosphere models reproduce the granulation properties of stars across the HR diagram.

The joint abundance-kinematic-age measurements of stars provide the means to link the chemical
to the environmental and structural evolution of the Galaxy. An ensemble of nucleosynthetic channels
can be leveraged to build a comprehensive chemical account. Using GALAH DR3, we study the element
abundances of [Fe/H], [$\alpha$/Fe], [Ba/Fe], and [Eu/Fe] of $\sim$50,000 red giant stars, as
tracers of the enrichment by supernovae Ia, supernovae II, asymptotic giant branch stars, neutron-star
mergers and/or collapsars. We characterise the abundance-age profiles for [Ba/Fe] and [Eu/Fe]
in small [$\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H] cells, which serve as an effective reference-frame of supernovae
contributions. We find that age-abundance relations vary across the [$\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane.
Within cells, we find negative age-[Ba/Fe] relations and flat age-[Eu/Fe] relations. Across cells,
we see the slope of the age-[Ba/Fe] relations evolve smoothly and the [Eu/Fe] relations vary in amplitude.
We subsequently model our empirical findings in a theoretical setting using the flexible Chempy
Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) code using [Fe/H], [Mg/Fe], [Ba/Fe], and age, bringing us closer
to the one-zone GCE model concept. We find that within a one-zone framework, an ensemble of environmental
parameters vary to explain the data. Using present day orbits from \textit{Gaia} EDR3 measurements
we infer that the environmental parameters, that set the chemical abundance distributions, vary
systematically across birth location and time in the disc. Under our modelling assumptions, the
data are consistent with a small gradient in the high mass end of the initial mass function (IMF) across
the disc, where the IMF is more top heavy towards the inner disc and more bottom heavy in the outer disc.

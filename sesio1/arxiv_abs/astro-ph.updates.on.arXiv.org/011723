Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) are more nearly standard candles when measured in the near-infrared (NIR)
than in the optical. With this motivation, from 2012-2017 we embarked on the RAISIN program with
the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to obtain rest-frame NIR light curves for a cosmologically distant
sample of 37 SN Ia ($0.2<z<0.7$) discovered by Pan-STARRS and the Dark Energy Survey. By comparing
higher-$z$ HST data with 43 SN Ia at $z<0.1$ observed in the NIR by the Carnegie Supernova Project,
we construct a Hubble diagram exclusively from NIR observations to pursue a unique avenue to constrain
the dark energy equation of state parameter, $w$. We analyze the dependence of the full set of Hubble
residuals on the SN Ia host galaxy mass and find Hubble residual steps of size $\sim$0.08-0.12 mag
with 2- to 3-$\sigma$ significance depending on the method and step location used. Combining our
NIR sample with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) constraints, we find $1+w=-0.04\pm0.12$ (statistical$+$systematic
errors). The largest systematic errors are the redshift-dependent SN selection biases and the
properties of the NIR mass step. We also use these data to measure ${\rm H}_0=75.4\pm 2.4~{\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$
from stars with geometric distance calibration in the hosts of 8 SNe Ia observed in the NIR versus
${\rm H}_0=65.9\pm3.4~{\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$ using an inverse distance ladder approach
tied to Planck. Using optical data we find $1+w=-0.01\pm0.09$ and with optical and NIR data combined,
we find $1+w=0.03\pm0.08$; these shifts of up to $\sim$0.07 in $w$ could point to inconsistency
in the optical versus NIR SN models. There will be many opportunities to improve this NIR measurement
and better understand systematic uncertainties through larger low-$z$ samples, new light-curve
models, calibration improvements, and eventually building high-$z$ samples from the Roman Space
Telescope.

We report the discovery of MAGAZ3NE J095924+022537, a spectroscopically-confirmed protocluster
at $z = 3.3665^{+0.0009}_{-0.0012}$ around a spectroscopically-confirmed $UVJ$-quiescent
ultra-massive galaxy (UMG; $M_{\star}=2.34^{+0.23}_{-0.34}\times10^{11} {\rm M}_\odot$)
in the COSMOS UltraVISTA field. We present a total of 38 protocluster members (14 spectroscopic
and 24 photometric), including the UMG. Notably, and in marked contrast to protoclusters previously
reported at this epoch which have been found to contain predominantly star-forming members, we
measure an elevated fraction of quiescent galaxies relative to the coeval field ($73.3^{+26.7}_{-16.9}\%$
versus $11.6^{+7.1}_{-4.9}\%$ for galaxies with stellar mass $M_{\star} \geq 10^{11} {\rm M}_\odot$).
This high quenched fraction provides a striking and important counterexample to the seeming ubiquitousness
of star-forming galaxies in protoclusters at $z>2$ and suggests, rather, that protoclusters exist
in a diversity of evolutionary states in the early Universe. We discuss the possibility that we might
be observing either "early mass quenching" or non-classical "environmental quenching." We also
present the discovery of MAGAZ3NE J100028+023349, a second spectroscopically-confirmed protocluster,
at a very similar redshift of $z = 3.3801^{+0.0213}_{-0.0281}$. We present a total of 20 protocluster
members, 12 of which are photometric and 8 spectroscopic including a post-starburst UMG ($M_{\star}=2.95^{+0.21}_{-0.20}\times10^{11}
{\rm M}_\odot$). Protoclusters MAGAZ3NE J0959 and MAGAZ3NE J1000 are separated by 18 arcminutes
on the sky (35 comoving Mpc), in good agreement with predictions from simulations for the size of
"Coma"-type cluster progenitors at this epoch. It is highly likely that the two UMGs are the progenitors
of Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs) seen in massive virialized clusters at lower redshift.

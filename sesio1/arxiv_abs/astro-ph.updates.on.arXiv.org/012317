Making use of the publicly available 1D photoionization hydrodynamics code ATES we set out to investigate
the combined effects of planetary gravitational potential energy ($\phi_p\equiv GM_p/R_p$)
and stellar X-ray and Extreme Ultraviolet (XUV) irradiation ($F_{\rm XUV}$) on the evaporation
efficiency ($\eta$) of moderately-to-highly irradiated gaseous planets, from sub-Neptunes
through hot Jupiters. We show that the (known) existence of a threshold potential above which energy-limited
escape (i.e., $\eta\simeq 1$) is unattainable can be inferred analytically. For $\log \phi_p\gtrsim
\log \phi_p^{\rm thr}\approx [12.9-13.2]$ (in cgs units), most of the energy absorption occurs
where the average kinetic energy acquired by the ions through photo-electron collisions is insufficient
for escape. This causes the evaporation efficiency to plummet with increasing $\phi_p$,. Whether
or not planets with $\phi_p\lesssim \phi_p^{\rm thr}$ exhibit energy-limited outflows is regulated
primarily by the stellar irradiation level. Specifically, for low-gravity planets, above $F_{\rm
XUV}\simeq 10^{4-5}$ erg cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ Ly$\alpha$ losses overtake adiabatic and advective
cooling and the evaporation efficiency of low-gravity planets drops below the energy-limited
approximation, albeit remaining largely independent of $\phi_p$Further, we show that whereas
$\eta$ increases as $F_{\rm XUV}$ increases for planets above $\phi^{\rm thr}_p$, the opposite
is true for low-gravity planets. This behavior can be understood by examining the relative fractional
contributions of advective and radiative losses as a function of atmospheric temperature. This
novel framework enables a reliable, physically motivated prediction of the expected evaporation
efficiency for a given planetary system; an analytical approximation of the best-fitting $\eta$
is given in the appendix.

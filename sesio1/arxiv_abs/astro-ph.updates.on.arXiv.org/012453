In the framework of studies of the CMB polarization and its Galactic foregrounds, the angular power
spectra of thermal dust polarization maps have revealed an intriguing E/B asymmetry and a positive
TE correlation. In interpretation studies of these observations, magnetized ISM dust clouds have
been treated as filamentary structures only; however, sheet-like shapes are also supported by
observational and theoretical evidence. In this work, we study the influence of cloud shape and
its connection to the local magnetic field on angular power spectra of thermal dust polarization
maps. We simulate realistic filament-like and sheet-like interstellar clouds, and generate synthetic
maps of their thermal dust polarized emission using the software $Asterion$. We compute their polarization
power spectra in multipole range $\ell \in [100,500]$ and quantify the E/B power asymmetry through
the $R_{EB}$ ratio, and the correlation coefficient $r^{TE}$ between T and E modes. We quantify
the dependence of $R_{EB}$ and $r^{TE}$ values on the offset angle (between longest cloud axis and
magnetic field) and inclination angle (between line-of-sight and magnetic field) for both cloud
shapes embedded either in a regular or a turbulent magnetic field. We find that both cloud shapes
cover the same regions of the ($R_{EB}$, $r^{TE}$) parameter space. The dependence on inclination
and offset angles are similar for both shapes although sheet-like structures generally show larger
scatter. In addition to the known dependence on the offset angle, we find a strong dependence of $R_{EB}$
and $r^{TE}$ on the inclination angle. The fact that filament-like and sheet-like structures may
lead to polarization power spectra with similar ($R_{EB}$, $r^{TE}$) values complicates their
interpretation. In future analyses, this degeneracy should be accounted for as well as the connection
to the magnetic field geometry.

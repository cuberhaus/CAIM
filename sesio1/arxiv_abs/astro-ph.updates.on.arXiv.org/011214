Considering the relatively high precision that will be reached by future observatories, it has
recently become clear that one dimensional (1D) atmospheric models, in which the atmospheric temperature
and composition of a planet are considered to vary only in the vertical, will be unable to represent
exoplanetary transmission spectra with a sufficient accuracy. This is particularly true for warm
to (ultra-) hot exoplanets because the atmosphere is unable to redistribute all the energy deposited
on the dayside, creating a strong thermal and often compositional dichotomy on the planet. This
situation is exacerbated by transmission spectroscopy, which probes the terminator region. This
is the most heterogeneous region of the atmosphere. However, if being able to compute transmission
spectra from 3D atmospheric structures (from a global climate model, e.g.) is necessary to predict
realistic observables, it is too computationally expensive to be used in a data inversion framework.
For this reason, there is a need for a medium-complexity 2D approach that captures the most salient
features of the 3D model in a sufficiently fast implementation. With this in mind, we present a new
open-source documented version of Pytmosph3R that handles the computation of transmission spectra
for atmospheres with up to three spatial dimensions and can account for time variability. Taking
the example of an ultra hot Jupiter, we illustrate how the changing orientation of the planet during
the transit can allow us to probe the horizontal variations in the atmosphere. We further implement
our algorithm in TauREx to allow the community to perform 2D retrievals. We describe our extensive
cross-validation benchmarks and discuss the accuracy and numerical performance of each model.

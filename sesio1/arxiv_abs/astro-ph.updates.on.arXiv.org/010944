The interior of a neutron star is expected to exhibit different states of matter. In particular,
complex non-spherical configurations known as `pasta' phases may exist at the highest densities
in the inner crust, potentially having an impact on different neutron-star phenomena. We study
the properties of the pasta phase and the uncertainties in the pasta observables which are due to
our incomplete knowledge of the nuclear energy functional. To this aim, we employed a compressible
liquid-drop model approach with surface parameters optimised either on experimental nuclear
masses or theoretical calculations. To assess the model uncertainties, we performed a Bayesian
analysis by largely varying the model parameters using uniform priors, and generating posterior
distributions with filters accounting for both our present low-density nuclear physics knowledge
and high-density neutron-star physics constraints. Our results show that the nuclear physics
constraints, such as the neutron-matter equation of state at very low density and the experimental
mass measurements, are crucial in determining the crustal and pasta observables. Accounting for
all constraints, we demonstrate that the presence of pasta phases is robustly predicted in an important
fraction of the inner crust. We estimate the relative crustal thickness associated with pasta phases
as $R_{\rm pasta}/R_{\rm crust}=0.128\pm 0.047$ and the relative moment of inertia as $I_{\rm
pasta}/I_{\rm crust}=0.480\pm 0.137$. Our findings indicate that the surface and curvature parameters
are more influential than the bulk parameters for the description of pasta observables. We also
show that using a surface tension that is inconsistent with the bulk functional leads to an underestimation
of both the average values and the uncertainties in the pasta properties, thus highlighting the
importance of a consistent calculation of the nuclear functional.

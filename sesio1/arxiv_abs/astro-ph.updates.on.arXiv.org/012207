We present homogeneous abundance analysis of over 20 elements for 385 very metal-poor (VMP) stars
based on the LAMOST survey and follow-up observations with the Subaru Telescope. It is the largest
high-resolution VMP sample (including 363 new objects) studied by a single program, and the first
attempt to accurately determine evolutionary stages for such a large sample based on Gaia parallaxes.
The sample covers a wide metallicity range from [Fe/H]=-1.7 down to [Fe/H]=-4.3, including over
110 objects with [Fe/H]<-3.0. The expanded coverage in evolutionary status makes it possible to
define abundance trends respectively for giants and turn-off stars. The newly obtained abundance
data confirm most abundance trends found by previous studies, but also provide useful update and
new sample of outliers. The Li plateau is seen in -2.5 < [Fe/H] <-1.7 in our sample, whereas the average
Li abundance is clearly lower at lower metallicity. Mg, Si, and Ca are overabundant with respect
to Fe, showing decreasing trend with increasing metallicity. Comparisons with chemical evolution
models indicate that the over-abundance of Ti, Sc, and Co are not well reproduced by current theoretical
predictions. Correlations are seen between Sc and alpha-elements, while Zn shows a detectable
correlation only with Ti but not with other alpha-elements. The fraction of carbon-enhanced stars
([C/Fe]> 0.7) is in the range of 20-30% for turn-off stars depending on the treatment of objects for
which C abundance is not determined, which is much higher than that in giants (~8%). Twelve Mg-poor
stars ([Mg/Fe] < 0.0) have been identified in a wide metallicity range from [Fe/H] =-3.8 through
-1.7. Twelve Eu-rich stars ([Eu/Fe]> 1.0) have been discovered in -3.4 <[Fe/H]< -2.0, enlarging
the sample of r-process-enhanced stars with relatively high metallicity.

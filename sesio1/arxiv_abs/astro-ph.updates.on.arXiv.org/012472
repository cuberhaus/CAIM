The Jesuit missions in South America were an important and unique advance in Christian evangelisation
on the continent until the expulsion of the Order in 1767. Although the history and cultural aspects
of these missions and their most iconic buildings have been extensively studied, the archaeoastronomy
of the Guaran\'i peoples of the Province of Paraquaria (Province of Paraguay) has only been recently
considered, with the existing studies focusing primarily on the orientation of their churches.
The paper presented here, which is the first archaeoastronomical study of the Jesuit missions of
Chiquitos in eastern Bolivia, is an attempt to continue and complement the previous archaeoastronomical
studies of the region. The methodologies employed involved the analysis of the Jesuit churches
that currently exist in this region, namely, the on-site measurements of the orientations of eight
churches currently standing and the ruins of a ninth church of which only a free-standing bell tower
and parts of the side walls remain preserved. The orientation measurements of a tenth church, which
we were unable to visit, were determined via the use of satellite maps. The landscape surrounding
these churches was then examined in detail and furthermore, a detailed cultural and historical
study of the characteristics of the villages where the churches are located was carried out. Our
results show that, unlike the churches of the Province of Paraquaria where meridian orientations
in the north-south direction stand out, half of the studied churches have shown potential canonical
orientations that seem to be aligned to solar phenomena, with three exhibiting precise equinoctial
orientation. We propose reasons for these orientations, including the possible relevance of illumination
effects on significant internal elements within the churches - effects that were generally sought
in Baroque church architecture.

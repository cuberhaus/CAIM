Global hydrodynamic simulations of internal solar dynamics have focused on replicating the conditions
for solar-like differential rotation and meridional circulation using the results of helioseismic
inversions as a constraint. Inferences of meridional circulation, however, have provided controversial
results showing the possibility of one, two, or multiple cells along the radius. To resolve this
controversy and develop a more robust understanding of global flow regimes in the solar interior,
we apply a "forward-modeling" approach to the analysis of helioseismic signatures of meridional
circulation profiles obtained from numerical simulations. We employ the global acoustic modeling
code GALE to simulate the propagation of acoustic waves through regimes of mean mass flows generated
by global hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic models: EULAG, the Pencil Code, and the Rayleigh
code. These models are used to create synthetic dopplergram data products, used as inputs for local
time-distance helioseismology techniques. Helioseismic travel-time signals from solutions
obtained through global numerical simulations are compared directly with inferences from solar
observations, in order to set additional constraints on global model parameters in a direct way.
We show that even though these models are able to replicate solar-like differential rotation, the
resulting rotationally-constrained convection develops a multi-cell global meridional circulation
profile that is measurably inconsistent with local time-distance inferences of solar observations.
However, we find that the development of rotationally-unconstrained convection close to the model
surface is able to maintain solar-like differential rotation, while having a significant impact
on the helioseismic travel-time signal, replicating solar observations within one standard deviation
of the error due to noise.

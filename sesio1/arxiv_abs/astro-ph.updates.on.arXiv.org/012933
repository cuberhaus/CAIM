Intrinsic alignment (IA) modelling and photometric redshift estimation are two of the main sources
of systematic uncertainty in weak lensing surveys. We investigate the impact of redshift errors
and their interplay with different IA models. Generally, errors on the mean $\delta_z$ and on the
width $\sigma_z$ of the redshift bins can both lead to biases in cosmological constraints. We find
that such biases can, however, only be partially resolved by marginalizing over $\delta_z$ and
$\sigma_z$. For Stage-III surveys, $\delta_z$ and $\sigma_z$ cannot be well constrained due to
limited statistics. The resulting biases are thus sensitive to prior volume effects. For Stage-IV
surveys, we observe that marginalizing over the redshift parameters has an impact and reduces the
bias. We derive requirements on the uncertainty of $\sigma_z$ and $\delta_z$ for both Stage-III
and Stage-IV surveys. We assume that the redshift systematic errors on $S_8$ should be less than
half of the statistical errors, and the median bias should be smaller than $0.25\sigma$. We find
that the uncertainty on $\delta_z$ has to be $\lesssim0.025$ for the NLA IA model with a Stage-III
survey. For $\sigma_z$, the requirement is met even for large uncertainties $\leq0.3$. For the
TATT IA model, the uncertainty on $\delta_z$ has to be $\lesssim0.02$ and the uncertainty on $\sigma_z$
has to be $\lesssim0.2$. For Stage-IV surveys, the uncertainty on $\delta_z$ has to be $\lesssim0.005$
and the uncertainty on $\sigma_z$ should be $\lesssim0.1$, with no significant dependence on the
IA model. This required high precision will be a challenge for the redshift calibration of these
future surveys. Finally, we investigate whether the interplay between redshift systematics and
IA modelling can explain the $S_8$-tension between cosmic shear results and CMB measurements.
We find that this is unlikely to explain the current $S_8$-tension.

Interferometric observations of the Sun with ALMA provide valuable diagnostic tools for studying
the small-scale dynamics of the solar atmosphere. Estimations of the observability of the small-scale
dynamics as a function of spatial resolution for regions with different characteristic magnetic
field topology facilitate a more robust analysis of ALMA observations of the Sun. A 3D model of the
solar atmosphere from the MHD code Bifrost was used to produce high-cadence observables at mm and
submm wavelengths. The synthetic observables for receiver bands 3-10 were degraded to the angular
resolution corresponding to ALMA observations with different configurations of the interferometric
array from the most compact C1, to the more extended C7. The observability of the small-scale dynamics
was analyzed in each case. The analysis was thus also performed for predicting the potential of future
capabilities. The minimum resolution required to study the typical small spatial scales in the
solar chromosphere depends on the characteristic properties of the target region. Here, a range
from quiet Sun to enhanced network loops is considered. Limited spatial resolution affects the
observable signatures of dynamic small-scale brightening events in the form of reduced brightness
temperature amplitudes, potentially leaving them undetectable, and even shifts in the times at
which the peaks occur of up to tens of seconds. Conversion factors between the observable brightness
amplitude and the original amplitude in the fully resolved simulation are provided that can be applied
to observational data in principle, but are subject to wavelength-dependent uncertainties. Predictions
of the typical appearance at the different combinations of receiver band, array configuration,
and properties of the target region are conducted.

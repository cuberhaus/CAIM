Context. Excess microwave emission commonly known as `anomalous microwave emission' (AME) is
now routinely detected in the Milky Way. Although its link with the rotation of interstellar (carbonaceous)
nano-grains seems to be relatively well established at cloud scales, large-scale observations
show a lack of correlation between the different tracers of nano-carbons and AME, which has led the
community to question the viability of this link. Aims. Using ancillary data and spinning dust models
for nano-carbons and nano-silicates, we explore the extent to which the out of Galactic Plane AME
could come from one carrier or the other. Methods. Contrary to previous large-scale studies, our
method is not built on comparing the correlations of the different dust tracers with each other,
but rather on comparing the poor correlations predicted by the models with the correlations actually
observed. This is based on as realistic as possible estimates of the gas ionisation state and grain
charge as a function of the local radiation field and gas density. Results. First, nano-carbon dust
can explain all the observations for medium properties in agreement with the latest findings about
the separation of cold and warm neutral medium in the diffuse ISM. The dispersion in the observations
can be accounted for with little variations in the dust size distribution, abundance or electric
dipole moment. Second, whatever the properties and the abundance of the nano-silicate dust considered,
spinning nano-silicates are excluded as being the sole source of the AME. Third, the best agreement
with the observations is obtained if the emission of spinning nano-carbons alone is taken into account.
However, a marginal participation of nano-silicates to the AME production cannot be excluded as
long as their abundance does not exceed $Y_{\rm Si} \sim 1\%$.

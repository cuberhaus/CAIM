We aim to analyze the chemical evolution of the Small Magellanic Cloud adding 12 additional clusters
to our existing sample having accurate and homogeneously derived metallicities. We are particularly
interested in seeing if there is any correlation between age and metallicity for the different structural
components to which the clusters belong. Spectroscopic metallicities of red giant stars are derived
from the measurement of the equivalent width of the near-IR calcium triplet lines. Cluster membership
analysis was carried out using criteria that include radial velocities, metallicities, proper
motions and distance from the cluster center. The mean cluster radial velocity and metallicity
were determined with a typical error of 2.1 km/s and 0.03 dex, respectively. We added this information
to that available in the literature for other clusters studied with the same method, compiling a
final sample of 48 clusters with metallicities homogeneously determined. Clusters of the final
sample are distributed in an area of ~ 70 deg^2 and cover an age range from 0.4 Gyr to 10.5 Gyr. The metallicity
distribution of our new cluster sample shows a lower probability of being bimodal than suggested
in previous studies. The separate chemical analysis of clusters in the six components (Main Body,
Counter-Bridge, West Halo, Wing/Bridge, Northern Bridge and Southern Bridge) shows that only
clusters belonging to the Northern Bridge appear to trace a V-Shape, showing a clear inversion of
the metallicity gradient in the outer regions. There is a suggestion of a metallicity gradient in
the West Halo, similar to that previously found for field stars. It presents, however, a very large
uncertainty. Also, clusters belonging to the West Halo, Wing/Bridge and Southern Bridge exhibit
a well-defined age-metallicity relation with relatively little scatter in abundance at fixed
age compared to other regions.

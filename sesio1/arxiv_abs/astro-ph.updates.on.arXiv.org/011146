The detection of the gravitational wave counterpart GRB 170817A, underluminous compared to the
cosmological GRB population by a factor of 10,000, motivates significant effort in detecting and
localizing a dim, nearby, and slightly off-axis population of short GRBs. Swift/BAT is the most
sensitive GRB detector in operation, and the only one that regularly localizes GRBs to arcminute
precision, critical to rapid followup studies. However, the utility of BAT in targeted sub-threshold
searches had been historically curtailed by the unavailability of the necessary raw data for analysis.
The new availability of time-tagged event (TTE) data from the GUANO system (arXiv:2005.01751),
motivates renewed focus on developing sensitive targeted search analysis techniques to maximally
exploit these data. While computationally cheap, we show that the typical coded-mask deconvolution
imaging is limited in its sensitivity due to several factors. We formalize a maximum likelihood
framework for the analysis of BAT data wherein signals are forward modelled through the full instrument
response, and -- coupled with the development of new response models -- demonstrate its superior
sensitivity to typical imaging via archival comparisons, injection campaigns, and, after implementing
as a targeted search, a large number of low-latency GRB discoveries and confirmed arcminute localizations
to date. We also demonstrate independent localization of some out-of-FOV GRBs for the first time.
NITRATES's increased sensitivity boosts the discovery rate of GRB 170817A-like events in BAT by
a factor of at least $3-4$x, along with enabling joint analyses and searches with other GRB, GW, neutrino,
and FRB instruments. We provide public access to the response functions and search pipeline code.

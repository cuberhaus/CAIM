Here we present evolutionary models for a set of massive stars, introducing a new prescription for
the mass-loss rate obtained from hydrodynamical calculations in which the wind velocity profile,
$v(r)$, and the line-acceleration, $g_\text{line}$, are obtained in a self consistently way.
Replacing mass-loss rates at the Main Sequence stage from the standard Vink's formula by our new
recipe, we generate a new set of evolutionary tracks for $M_\text{ZAMS}=25,40,70$ and $120\,M_\odot$
and metallicities $Z=0.014$ (Galactic), $Z=0.006$ (LMC), and $Z=0.002$ (SMC). Our new derived
formula for mass-loss rate predicts a dependence $\dot M\propto Z^a$, where $a$ is not longer constant
but dependent on the stellar mass: ranging from $a\sim0.53$ when $M_*\sim120\;M_\odot$, to $a\sim1.02$
when $M_*\sim25\;M_\odot$. We found that models adopting the new recipe for $\dot M$ retain more
mass during their evolution, which is expressed in larger radii and consequently more luminous
tracks over the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. These differences are more prominent for the cases
of $M_\text{ZAMS}=70$ and 120 $M_\odot$ at solar metallicity, where we found self-consistent
tracks are $\sim0.1$ dex brighter and keep extra mass up to 20 $M_\odot$, compared with the classical
models using the previous formulation for mass-loss rate. Moreover, we observed remarkable differences
for the evolution of the radionuclide isotope $^{26}$Al in the core and the surface of the star. Since
$\dot M_\text{sc}$ are weaker than the commonly adopted values for evolutionary tracks, self-consistent
tracks predict a later modification in the abundance number of $^{26}$Al in the stellar winds. This
new behaviour could provide useful information about the real contribution of this isotope from
massive stars to the Galactic interstellar medium.

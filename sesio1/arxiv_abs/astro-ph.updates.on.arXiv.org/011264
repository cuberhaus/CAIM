Direct observations of young stellar objects are important to test established theories of planet
formation. PDS 70 is one of the few cases where robust evidence favours the presence of two planetary
mass companions inside the gap of the transition disk. Those planets are believed to be going through
the last stages of accretion from the protoplanetary disk, a process likely mediated by a circumplanetary
disk (CPD). We aim to develop a three dimensional radiative transfer model for the dust component
of the PDS 70 system which reproduces the system's global features observed at two different wavelengths:
855 $\mu\, \mathrm{m}$ with ALMA and 1.25 $\mu\, \mathrm{m}$ with VLT/SPHERE. We use this model
to investigate the physical properties of the planetary companion PDS 70 c and its potential circumplanetary
disk. We select initial values for the physical properties of the planet and CPD through appropriate
assumptions about the nature and evolutionary stage of the object. We modify iteratively the properties
of the protoplanetary disk until the predictions retrieved from the model are consistent with both
data sets. We provide a model that jointly explains the global features of the PDS 70 system seen in
submillimeter and polarised-scattered light. Our model suggests that spatial segregation of
dust grains is present in the protoplanetary disk. The submillimeter modelling of the PDS 70 c source
favours the presence of an optically thick CPD and places an upper limit to its dust mass of 0.7 $M_\oplus$.
Furthermore, analysis of the thermal structure of the CPD demonstrates that the planet luminosity
is the dominant heating mechanism of dust grains inside 0.6 au from the planet while heating by stellar
photons dominates at larger planetocentric distances.

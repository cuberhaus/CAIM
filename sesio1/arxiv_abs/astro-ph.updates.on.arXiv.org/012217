Infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) are cold, dense regions of the interstellar medium (ISM) that are likely
to represent the initial conditions for massive star formation. It is thus important to study the
physical and chemical conditions of IRDCs to provide constraints and inputs for theoretical models
of these processes. We aim to determine the astrochemical conditions, especially cosmic ray ionisation
rate (CRIR) and chemical age, in different regions of the massive IRDC G28.37+00.07 by comparing
observed abundances of multiple molecules and molecular ions with the predictions of astrochemical
models. We have computed a series of single-zone astrochemical models with a gas-grain network
that systematically explores the parameter space of density, temperature, CRIR, and visual extinction.
We have also investigated the effects of choices of CO ice binding energy and temperatures achieved
in transient heating of grains when struck by cosmic rays. We selected 10 positions across the IRDC
that are known to have a variety of star formation activity. We utilised mid-infrared (MIR) extinction
maps and sub-mm emission maps to measure the mass surface densities of these regions, needed for
abundance and volume density estimates. The sub-mm emission maps were also used to measure temperatures.
We then used IRAM-30m observations of various tracers to estimate column densities and thus abundances.
Using estimates of the abundances of CO, HCO$^+$ and N$_2$H$^+$ we find consistency with astrochemical
models that have relatively low CRIRs of $\zeta \sim10^{-18}$ to $\sim10^{-17}\:{\rm s}^{-1}$,
with no evidence for systematic variation with the level of star formation activity. Astrochemical
ages are found to be < 1 Myr. We discuss potential sources of systematic uncertainties in these results
and the overall implications for IRDC evolutionary history and astrochemical models.(abridged

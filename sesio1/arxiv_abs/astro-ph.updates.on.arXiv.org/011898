The role of feedback in the self-regulation of star formation is a fundamental question in astrophysics.
The Orion Nebula is the nearest site of ongoing and recent massive star formation. It is a unique laboratory
for the study of stellar feedback. Recent SOFIA [CII] 158 $\mu$m observations revealed an expanding
bubble, the Veil shell, being powered by stellar winds and ionization feedback. We have identified
a protrusion-like substructure in the Northwest portion of the Orion Veil Shell that may indicate
additional feedback mechanisms that are highly directional. Our goal is to investigate the origin
of the protrusion by quantifying its possible driving mechanisms. We use the [CII] 158 $\mu$m map
of the Orion Nebula obtained with the upGREAT instrument onboard SOFIA. The spectral and spatial
resolution of the observations are 0.3 km/s and 16 arcsec, respectively. We consider three possible
origins for this protrusion: Fossil outflow cavities created by jets/outflows during the protostellar
accretion phase, pre-existing clumpiness in the OMC-1 core, and the stellar wind during the main
sequence phase. Based on the energetics and the morphology, we conclude that the northwestern part
of the pre-existing cloud was locally perturbed by outflows ejected from massive protostars in
the Trapezium cluster. This suggests that the protrusion of the Veil is the result of mechanical
rather than radiative feedback. Furthermore, we argue that the location of the protrusion is a suitable
place to break the Orion Veil owing to the photo-ablation from the walls of the protrusion. We conclude
that the outflows of massive protostars can influence the morphology of the future \hii\,region
and even cause breakages in the ionization front. Specifically, the interaction of stellar winds
of main-sequence stars with the molecular core pre-processed by the protostellar jet is important.

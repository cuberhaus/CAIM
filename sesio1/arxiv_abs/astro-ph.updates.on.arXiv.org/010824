The kinematic morphology-density relation of galaxies is normally attributed to a changing distribution
of galaxy stellar masses with the local environment. However, earlier studies were largely focused
on slow rotators; the dynamical properties of the overall population in relation to environment
have received less attention. We use the SAMI Galaxy Survey to investigate the dynamical properties
of $\sim$1800 early and late-type galaxies with $\log(M_*/M_{\odot})>9.5$ as a function of mean
environmental overdensity ($\Sigma_{5}$) and their rank within a group or cluster. By classifying
galaxies into fast and slow rotators, at fixed stellar mass above $\log(M_*/M_{\odot})>10.5$,
we detect a higher fraction ($\sim3.4\sigma$) of slow rotators for group and cluster centrals and
satellites as compared to isolated-central galaxies. Focusing on the fast-rotator population,
we also detect a significant correlation between galaxy kinematics and their stellar mass as well
as the environment they are in. Specifically, by using inclination-corrected or intrinsic $\lambda_{R_e}$
values, we find that, at fixed mass, satellite galaxies on average have the lowest $\lambda_{\,R_e,intr}$,
isolated-central galaxies have the highest $\lambda_{\,R_e,intr}$, and group and cluster centrals
lie in between. Similarly, galaxies in high-density environments have lower mean $\lambda_{\,R_e,intr}$
values as compared to galaxies at low environmental density. However, at fixed $\Sigma_{5}$, the
mean $\lambda_{\,R_e,intr}$ differences for low and high-mass galaxies are of similar magnitude
as when varying $\Sigma_{5}$ {($\Delta \lambda_{\,R_e,intr} \sim 0.05$. Our results demonstrate
that after stellar mass, environment plays a significant role in the creation of slow rotators,
while for fast rotators we also detect an independent, albeit smaller, impact of mass and environment
on their kinematic properties.

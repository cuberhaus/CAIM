We present the theoretical framework and numerical methods we have implemented to solve the problem
of the generation and transfer of polarized radiation in spectral lines out of local thermodynamical
equilibrium, while accounting for scattering polarization, partial frequency redistribution,
J-state interference, and hyperfine structure. The resulting radiative transfer code allows
modeling the impact of magnetic fields of arbitrary strength and orientation through the Hanle,
incomplete Paschen-Back, and magneto-optical effects. We also evaluate the suitability of a series
of approximations for modeling the scattering polarization in the wings of strong resonance lines
that would be particularly useful for the numerically intensive case of three-dimensional radiative
transfer. We examine the suitability of the considered approximation using our radiative transfer
code to model the Stokes profiles of the Mg II h & k lines and of the H I Lyman alpha line in magnetized
one-dimensional models of the solar atmosphere. Neglecting Doppler redistribution in the scattering
processes that are unperturbed by elastic collisions produces a negligible error in the scattering
polarization wings of the Mg II resonance lines and a minor one in the Lyman alpha wings, although
it is unsuitable to model the cores of these lines. For both lines, the scattering processes that
are perturbed by elastic collisions give a significant contribution only to the intensity component
of the emissivity. Neglecting collisional as well as Doppler redistribution represents a rough
but suitable approximation for the wings of the Mg II resonance lines, but a very poor one for the Lyman
alpha wings. The magnetic sensitivity in the scattering polarization wings of the considered lines
can be modeled by accounting for the magnetic field only in the eta I and rho V coefficients of the Stokes-vector
transfer equation.

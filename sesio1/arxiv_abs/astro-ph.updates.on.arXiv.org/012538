We present a new upgraded version of the MOCCA code for the study of dynamical evolution of globular
clusters and its first application to the study of evolution of multiple stellar populations. We
explore a range of initial conditions spanning different structural parameters for the first (FG)
and second population (SG) and we analyze their effect on the binary dynamics and survival. The set
of simulations shown here represents the first phase of the new MOCCA-SURVEY-2 project which will
be further extended. Here, we focus our attention on the number ratio of FG and SG binaries, its variation
with the distance from the cluster center, and the way their abundances are affected by various cluster
initial properties. We find that SG stars more abundant in clusters that were initially tidally
filling. Conversely, FG stars stay more abundant in clusters that were initially tidally underfilling.
We also find that the ratio between binary fractions is not affected by the way we calculate these
fractions (e.g. with the use of all binaries, only main-sequence binaries or observational binaries,
i.e. main-sequence stars > 0.4 MSun, mass ratios > 0.5). We find also that the evolution of mixing
between populations presents the same features even if we take into account all single stars too.
This implies that the main-sequence stars themselves are a very good proxy for probing entire populations
of FG and SG in star clusters. We also discuss how our findings relate to the observations of Milky
Way GCs. We show that with MOCCA models we are able to reproduce the observed range of SG fractions
for any Milky Way GC for which we know this fraction. We show how the SG fractions depend on the initial
conditions. We provide also an explanation what could be the initial conditions of star clusters,
which at the Hubble time, have more numerous FG, and which more numerous SG stars.

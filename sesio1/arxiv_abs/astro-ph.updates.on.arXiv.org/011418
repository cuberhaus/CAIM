We present a model to track the orbital evolution of "unresolved subhaloes" (USHs) in cosmological
simulations. USHs are subhaloes that are no longer distinguished by halo finders as self-bound
overdensities within their larger host system due to limited mass resolution. These subhaloes
would host "orphan galaxies" in semi-analytic models of galaxy formation and evolution (SAMs).
Predicting the evolution of the phase-space components of USHs is crucial for the adequate modelling
of environmental processes, interactions and mergers implemented in SAMs that affect the baryonic
properties of orphan satellites. Our model takes into account dynamical friction drag, mass loss
by tidal stripping and merger with the host halo, involving three free parameters. To calibrate
this model, we consider two DM-only simulations of different mass resolution (MultiDark simulations).
The simulation with higher-mass resolution ({\sc smdpl}; $ m_{\rm DM} = 9.6 \times 10^7 ~ h^{-1}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$)
provides information about subhaloes that are not resolved in the lower-mass resolution one ({\sc
mdpl2}; $ m_{\rm DM} = 1.5 \times 10^9 ~ h^{-1}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$); the orbit of those USHs is
tracked by our model. We use as constraining functions the subhalo mass function (SHMF) and the two-point
correlation function (2PCF) obtained from {\sc smdpl}, being the latter a novel aspect of our approach.
While the SHMF fails to put tight constraints on the efficiency of dynamical friction and the merger
condition, the addition of clustering information helps to specify the parameters of the model
related to the spatial distribution of subhaloes. Our model allows to achieve good convergence
between the results of simulations of different mass resolution, with a precision better than 10
per cent for both SHMF and 2PCF.

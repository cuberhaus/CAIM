We present the results of an intensive six-month optical continuum reverberation mapping campaign
of the Seyfert 1 galaxy PG 2130+099 at redshift z=0.063. The ground-based photometric monitoring
was conducted on a daily basis with the robotic 46cm telescope of the Wise observatory located in
Israel. Specially designed narrowband filters were used to observe the central engine of the active
galactic nucleus (AGN), avoiding line contamination from the broad-line region (BLR). We aim to
measure inter-band continuum time lags across the optical range and determine the size-wavelength
relation for this system. We used two methods, the traditional point-spread function (PSF) photometry
and the recently developed proper image subtraction technique, to independently perform the extraction
of the continuum light curves. The inter-band time lags are measured with several methods, including
the interpolated cross-correlation function, the z-transformed discrete correlation function,
a von Neumann estimator, JAVELIN (in spectroscopic mode), and MICA. PG 2130+099 displays correlated
variability across the optical range, and we successfully detect significant time lags of up to
3 days between the multiband light curves. Using the flux variation gradient (FVG) method, we determined
the AGN's host-galaxy-subtracted rest-frame 5100{\AA} luminosity at the time of our monitoring
campaign with an uncertainty of 18%. While a continuum reprocessing model can fit the data reasonably
well, our derived disk sizes are a factor of 2-6 larger than the theoretical disk sizes predicted
from the AGN luminosity estimate of PG 2130+099. This result is in agreement with previous studies
of AGN/quasars and suggests that the standard Shakura-Sunyaev disk theory has limitations in describing
AGN accretion disks.

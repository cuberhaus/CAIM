Context: The Helmi streams are kinematic substructures whose progenitor is likely a dwarf galaxy.
Although 20 years have past since their discovery, it is still unclear whether their members are
chemically distinguishable from other halo stars in the Milky Way. Aim: We aim to precisely characterize
the chemical properties of the Helmi streams. Methods: We analysed high-resolution, high-signal-to-noise
ratio spectra for eleven Helmi streams' stars through a line-by-line abundance analysis. We compared
the derived abundances to homogenized literature abundances of the other halo stars, including
those belonging to other kinematic substructures, such as Gaia-Enceladus and Sequoia. Results:
Compared to typical halo stars, the Helmi streams' members clearly show low values of [X/Fe] in elements
produced by massive stars, such as Na and $\alpha$-elements. This tendency is seen down to metallicities
of at least $[\mathrm{Fe/H}]\sim -2.2$, suggesting type~Ia supernovae already started to contribute
to the chemical evolution at this metallicity. We found that the [$\alpha$/Fe] ratio does not evolve
much with metallicity, making the Helmi streams' stars less distinguishable from Gaia-Enceladus
stars at $[\mathrm{Fe/H}]\gtrsim -1.5$. The almost constant but low value of [$\alpha$/Fe] might
be indicative of quiescent star formation with low efficiency at the beginning and bursty star formation
at later times. We also found extremely low values of [Y/Fe] at low metallicity, providing further
support that light neutron capture-elements are deficient in Helmi streams. While Zn is deficient
at low metallicity, it shows a large spread at high metallicity. The origin of the extremely low Y
abundances and Zn variations remain unclear. Conclusion: The Helmi streams' stars are distinguishable
from the majority of the halo stars if homogeneously derived abundances are compared.

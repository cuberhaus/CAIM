The Pluto-Charon (PC) pair is usually thought of as a binary in the dual synchronous state, which
is the endpoint of its tidal evolution. The discovery of the small circumbinary moons, Styx, Nix,
Kerberos, and Hydra, placed close to the mean motions resonances (MMRs) 3/1, 4/1, 5/1, and 6/1 with
Charon, respectively, reveals a complex dynamical architecture of the system. Several formation
mechanisms for the PC system have been proposed. Our goal is to analyse the past and current orbital
dynamics of the satellite system. We study the past and current dynamics of the PC system through
a large set of numerical integrations of the exact equations of motion, accounting for the gravitational
interactions of the PC binary with the small moons and the tidal evolution, modelled by the constant
time lag approach. We construct the stability maps in a pseudo-Jacobian coordinate system. In addition,
considering a more realistic model, which accounts for the zonal harmonic $J_2$ of the Pluto's oblateness
and the accreting mass of Charon, we investigate the tidal evolution of the whole system. Our results
show that, in the chosen reference frame, the current orbits of all satellites are nearly circular,
nearly planar and nearly resonant with Charon that can be seen as an indicator of the convergent dissipative
migration experimented by the system in the past. We verify that, under the assumption that Charon
completes its formation during the tidal expansion, the moons can safely cross the main MMRs, without
their motions being strongly excited and consequently ejected. In the more realistic scenario
proposed here, the small moons survive the tidal expansion of the PC binary, without having to invoke
the hypothesis of the resonant transport. Our results point out that the possibility to find additional
small moons in the PC system cannot be ruled out.

In this paper we analyze new observations from ALMA and VLA, at a high angular resolution corresponding
to 5 - 8 au, of the protoplanetary disk around HD 163296 to determine the dust spatial distribution
and grain properties. We fit the spectral energy distribution as a function of the radius at five
wavelengths from 0.9 to 9\,mm, using a simple power law and a physical model based on an analytic description
of radiative transfer that includes isothermal scattering. We considered eight dust populations
and compared the models' performance using Bayesian evidence. Our analysis shows that the moderately
high optical depth ($\tau$>1) at $\lambda \leq$ 1.3 mm in the dust rings artificially lower the millimeter
spectral index, which should therefore not be considered as a reliable direct proxy of the dust properties
and especially the grain size. We find that the outer disk is composed of small grains on the order
of 200 $\mu$m with no significant difference between rings at 66 and 100 au and the adjacent gaps,
while in the innermost 30 au, larger grains ($\geq$mm) could be present. We show that the assumptions
on the dust composition have a strong impact on the derived surface densities and grain size. In particular,
increasing the porosity of the grains to 80\% results in a total dust mass about five times higher
with respect to grains with 25\% porosity. Finally, we find that the derived opacities as a function
of frequency deviate from a simple power law and that grains with a lower porosity seem to better reproduce
the observations of HD163296. While we do not find evidence of differential trapping in the rings
of HD163296, our overall results are consistent with the postulated presence of giant planets affecting
the dust temperature structure and surface density, and possibly originating a second-generation
dust population of small grains.

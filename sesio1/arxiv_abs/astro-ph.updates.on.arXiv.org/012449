The detection of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the light curves of active galactic nuclei
(AGNs) can provide insights on the physics of the super-massive black-holes (SMBHs) powering these
systems, and could represent a signature of the existence of SMBH binaries, setting fundamental
constraints on SMBH evolution in the Universe. Identification of long term QPOs, with periods of
the order of months to years, is particularly challenging and can only be achieved via all-sky monitoring
instruments that can provide unbiased, continuous light-curves of astrophysical objects. The
Fermi-LAT satellite, thanks to its monitoring observing strategy, is an ideal instrument to reach
such a goal, and we aim to identify QPOs in the $\gamma$-ray light-curves of the brightest AGNs within
the Fermi-LAT catalog. We analyze the light curves of the thirty-five brightest Fermi-LAT AGNs,
including data from the beginning of the Fermi mission (August 2008) to April 2020, and energies
from 100 MeV to 300 GeV. Two time binnings are investigated, 7 and 30 days. The search for quasi-periodic
features is then performed using the continuous wavelet transform. The significance of the result
is tested via Monte Carlo simulations of artificial light curves with the same power spectral density
and probability distribution function as the original light curves. We identify thirty quasars
with candidate QPOs. We confirm several QPO candidates discussed in the literature: PKS 2247-131,
B2 1520+31, PKS 0426-380, PKS 0537-441, S5 0716+714, Mrk 421, PKS 1424-418, PG 1553+113, Mrk 501
and PKS 2155-304. The most significant QPO (> 4$\sigma$ in the global wavelet spectrum, with a period
of about 1100 days) is observed in the quasar S5 1044+71, and is reported here for the first time.

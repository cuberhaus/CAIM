Clusters of galaxies evolve and accrete mass, mostly from small galaxy systems. Our aim is to study
the velocity field of the galaxy cluster Abell 780, which is known for the powerful radio source Hydra
A at its center and where a spectacular X-ray tail associated with the galaxy LEDA 87445 has been discovered.
Our analysis is based on the new spectroscopic data for hundreds of galaxies obtained with the Italian
Telescopio Nazionale {\em Galileo} and the Very Large Telescope. We have constructed a redshift
catalog of 623 galaxies and selected a sample of 126 cluster members. We analyze the internal structure
of the cluster using a number of techniques. We estimate the mean redshift z=0.0545, the line-of-sight
velocity dispersion sigmav about 800 km/s, and the dynamical mass M200 about 5.4 10E14 solar masses.
The global properties of Abell 780 are typical of relaxed clusters. On a smaller scale, we can detect
the presence of a galaxy group associated with LEDA 87445 in projected phase space. The mean velocity
and position of the center of the group agree well with the velocity and position of LEDA 87445. We
estimate the following parameters of the collision. The group is characterized by a higher velocity
relative to the main system. It is infalling at a rest frame velocity of Vrf=+870 km/s and lies at a
projected distance D=1.1 Mpc to the south, slightly southeast of the cluster center. The mass ratio
between the group and the cluster is about 1:5. We also find evidence of an asymmetry in the velocity
distribution of galaxies in the inner cluster region, which might be related to a small low-velocity
group detected as a substructure at Vrf=-750 km/s. We conclude that A780, although dynamically
relaxed at first sight, contains small substructures that may have some impact on the energetics
of the core region.

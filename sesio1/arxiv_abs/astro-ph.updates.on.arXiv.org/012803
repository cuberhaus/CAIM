Through a homogeneous analysis of spectroscopic literature data of red giant stars, we determine
the radial metallicity profiles of 30 dwarf galaxies in the Local Group. We explore correlations
between the calculated metallicity gradients and stellar mass, star formation history and environment,
delivering the largest compilation to date of this type. The dwarf galaxies in our sample mostly
show metallicity profiles decreasing with radius, with some exhibiting rather steep profiles.
The derived metallicity gradients as a function of the half-light radius, $\nabla_{\rm [Fe/H]}
(R/R_e)$, show no statistical differences when compared with the galaxies' morphological type,
nor with their distance from the Milky Way or M31. No correlations are found with either stellar mass
or star formation timescales. In particular, we do not find the linear relationship between $\nabla_{\rm
[Fe/H]} (R/R_e)$ and the galaxies' median age $t_{50}$, as instead shown in the literature for a
set of simulated systems. The presence of high angular momentum in some of our galaxies does not seem
to have an impact on the gradient values. The strongest gradients in our sample are observed in systems
that are likely to have experienced a past merger event. By excluding them, the analysed dwarf galaxies
show mild gradients ($\sim -0.1$ dex $R_e^{-1}$) with little scatter between them, regardless
of their stellar mass, dynamical state, and star formation history. These results are in good agreement
with different sets of simulations presented in the literature and analysed using the same method
as for the observed sample. The interplay between the multitude of factors that could drive the formation
of metallicity gradients in dwarf galaxies likely combine in complex ways to produce in general
comparable values.

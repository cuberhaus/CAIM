The star NGC2004#115 in the LMC, originally classified as an (SB1) Be spectroscopic binary, bears
some morphological resemblance to the Galactic systems LB-1 and HR 6819, both of which are proposed
as either Be+black hole (BH) or Be+stripped He-star systems. Two data-sets (ESO/VLT and SALT) of
multi-epoch optical spectra of NGC 2004#115, separated by baseline of $\sim$20 years, lead us conclude
it is a triple system hosting an inner binary with a period of 2.92 d, eccentricity $\sim$0.0 and mass
function $\sim$0.07 $M_\odot$. The inner binary harbours a B-type star (the primary) with projected
rotational velocity of 10km/s, and luminosity $\log L/L_\odot$=3.87, contributing $\sim$60%
of the V-band light to the system. The secondary is not detected, while the tertiary, which contributes
40% of the light, is tentatively identified as a less luminous B-type star with high projected rotational
velocity. No ellipsoidal light variability is detected, with stringent limits being set by MACHO
and Gaia data. Assuming the primary to be a main sequence star yields a mass of 8.6$ M_\odot$, while
the additional assumption of synchronous rotation constrains the inclination to be almost pole-on
with i~9 degrees, implying the secondary is a BH with a mass of $\sim$25 $M_\odot$. A low mass stripped
star with similar luminosity is ruled out as a potential solution as its mass implies a Roche radius
that is substantially smaller than the stellar radius. The outer period likely exceeds 120 days
and, while the disk-like emission is variable (it is almost absent in the SALT dataset), it may be
associated with the inner binary rather than the rapidly rotating tertiary. XMM-Newton provides
an upper limit of 5x$10^{33}$ ergs/s on the X-ray flux, consistent with, though not constraining
of, the system hosting a quiescent B+BH binary. A number of caveats to this scenario are discussed
in the paper.

The recent launch of JWST has enabled the exciting prospect of detecting the first generation of
metal-free, Population III (Pop. III) stars. Determining the emission line signatures that robustly
signify the presence of Pop. III stars against other possible contaminants represents a key challenge
for interpreting JWST data. To this end, we run high-resolution (sub-pc) cosmological radiation
hydrodynamics simulations of the region around a dwarf galaxy at $z\geq10$ to predict the emission
line signatures of the Pop. III/Pop. II transition. We show that the absence of metal emission lines
is a poor diagnostic of Pop. III stars because metal-enriched galaxies in our simulation can maintain
low [OIII] 5007${\rm \r{A}}$ emission that may be undetectable due to sensitivity limits. Combining
spectral hardness probes (e.g. HeII 1640${\rm \r{A}}$/H$\alpha$) with metallicity diagnostics
is more likely to probe the presence of metal-free stars, although contamination from Wolf-Rayet
stars, X-ray binaries, or black holes may be important. The hard emission from Pop. III galaxies
fades fast due to the short stellar lifetimes of massive Pop. III stars, which could further inhibit
detection. Similarly, Pop. III stars may be detectable after they evolve off the main-sequence
due to the cooling radiation from nebular gas or a supernova remnant; however, these signatures
are also short-lived (i.e. few Myr), and contaminants such as flickering black holes might confuse
this diagnostic. While JWST will provide a unique opportunity to spectroscopically probe the nature
of the earliest galaxies, both the short timescales associated with pristine systems and ambiguities
in interpreting key diagnostic emission lines may hinder progress. Special care will be needed
before claiming the discovery of systems with pure Pop. III stars.

We exploit the unprecedented depth of integral field data from the KMOS Ultra-deep Rotational Velocity
Survey (KURVS) to analyse the strong (H$\alpha$) and forbidden ([NII], [SII]) emission line ratios
in 22 main-sequence galaxies at $z\approx1.5$. Using the [NII]/H$\alpha$ emission-line ratio
we confirm the presence of the stellar mass $-$ gas-phase metallicity relation at this epoch, with
galaxies exhibiting on average 0.13$\pm$0.04 dex lower gas-phase metallicity (12+log(O/H)$_{\rm
M13}$=8.40$\pm$0.03) for a given stellar mass ($\log_{10}$($M_{\rm *}$[$M_{\odot}$]=10.1$\pm$0.1)
than local main-sequence galaxies. We determine the galaxy-integrated [SII] doublet ratio, with
a median value of [SII]$\lambda$6716/$\lambda$6731=1.26$\pm$0.14 equivalent to an electron
density of log$_{10}$($n_{\rm e}$[cm$^{-3}$])=1.95$\pm$0.12. Utilising CANDELS $HST$ multi-band
imaging we define the pixel surface-mass and star-formation rate density in each galaxy and spatially
resolve the fundamental metallicity relation at $z\approx1.5$, finding an evolution of 0.05$\pm$0.01
dex compared to the local relation. We quantify the intrinsic gas-phase metallicity gradient within
the galaxies using the [NII]/H$\alpha$ calibration, finding a median annuli-based gradient of
$\Delta$Z/$\Delta$R=$-$0.015$\pm$0.005 dex kpc$^{-1}$. Finally we examine the azimuthal variations
in gas-phase metallicity, which show a negative correlation with the galaxy integrated star-formation
rate surface density ($r_{\rm s}$=$-$0.40, $p_{\rm s}$=0.07) but no connection to the galaxies
kinematic or morphological properties nor radial variations in stellar mass surface density or
star formation rate surface density. This suggests both the radial and azimuthal variations in
interstellar medium properties are connected to the galaxy integrated density of recent star formation.

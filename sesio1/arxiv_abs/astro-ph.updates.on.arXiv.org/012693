The effect of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) on their host galaxies -- in particular their levels of
star formation -- remains one of the key outstanding questions of galaxy evolution. Successful
cosmological models of galaxy evolution require a fraction of energy released by an AGN to be redistributed
into the interstellar medium to reproduce the observed stellar mass and luminosity function and
to prevent the formation of over-massive galaxies. Observations have confirmed that the radio-AGN
population is energetically capable of heating and redistributing gas at all phases, however,
direct evidence of AGN enhancing or quenching star formation remains rare. With modern, deep radio
surveys and large integral field spectroscopy (IFS) surveys, we can detect fainter synchrotron
emission from AGN jets and accurately probe the star-forming properties of galaxies, respectively.
In this paper, we combine data from the LOw Frequency ARray Two-meter Sky Survey with data from one
of the largest optical IFS surveys, Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory to probe
the star-forming properties of 307 local (z $<$ 0.15) galaxies that host radio-detected AGN (RDAGN).
We compare our results to a robust control sample of non-active galaxies that each match the stellar
mass, redshift, visual morphology, and inclination of a RDAGN host. We find that RDAGN and control
galaxies have broad SFR distributions, typically lie below the star-forming main-sequence, and
have negative stellar light-weighted age gradients. These results indicate that AGN selected
based on their current activity are not responsible for suppressing their host galaxies' star formation.
Rather, our results support the maintenance mode role that radio AGN are expected to have in the local
Universe.

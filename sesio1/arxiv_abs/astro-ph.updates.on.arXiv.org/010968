In recent years, significant growth in the amount of data available to astronomers has opened up
the possibility to uncover fundamental correlations, linking the dust component of a galaxy to
its star formation rate (SFR). In this paper, we re-examine these correlations, investigating
the origin of the observed scatter, and the ability of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to explore
such relations in the early Universe. We defined a sample of about 800 normal star-forming galaxies
with photometries in the range of 0.15 < $\lambda$ < 500 microns and analysed them with different
spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting methods. With the SEDs extracted, we investigated
the detection rate at different redshifts with the MId-Infrared instruments (MIRI) onboard the
JWST. Dust luminosity (L$_d$) and SFR show a strong correlation, but for SFR < 2 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$,
the correlation scatter increases dramatically. We show that selection based on the fraction of
ultraviolet (UV) emission absorbed by dust, that is, the UV extinction, greatly reduces the data
dispersion. Reproducing the sensitivity of the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey
(CEERS) and classifying galaxies according to their SFR and stellar mass (M$_\ast$), we investigated
the MIRI detection rate as a function of the physical properties of the galaxies. Fifty percent of
the objects with SFR $\sim$ 1 M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ at $z$ = 6 are detected with F770, which decreases
to 20% at $z$ = 8. For such galaxies, only 5% of the subsample will be detected at 5$\sigma$ with F770
and F1000 at $z$ = 8, and only 10% with F770, F1000, and F1280 at $z$ = 6. The link between dust and star
formation is complex, and many aspects remain to be fully understood. In this context, the JWST will
revolutionise the field, allowing investigation of the dust--star interplay well within the epoch
of reionisation.

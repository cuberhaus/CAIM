The relationship between bipolar magnetic regions (BMRs) and their sunspots is an important property
of the solar magnetic field, but it is not well constrained. One consequence is that it is a challenge
for surface flux transport models (SFTMs) based on sunspot observations to determine the details
of BMR emergence, which they require as input, from such data. We aimed to establish the relationship
between the amount of magnetic flux in newly emerged BMRs and the area of the enclosed sunspots. Earlier
attempts to constrain BMR magnetic flux were hindered by the fact that there is no proper database
of the magnetic and physical properties of newly emerged BMRs currently available. We made use of
the empirical model of the relationship between the disc-integrated facular and network magnetic
flux and the total surface coverage by sunspots reported in a recent study. The structure of the model
is such that it enabled us to establish, from these disc-integrated quantities, an empirical relationship
between the magnetic flux and sunspot area of individual newly emerged BMRs, circumventing the
lack of any proper BMR database. Applying the constraint on BMR magnetic flux derived here to an established
SFTM retained its ability to replicate various independent datasets and the correlation between
the model output polar field at the end of each cycle and the observed strength of the following cycle.
The SFTM output indicates that facular and network magnetic flux rises with increasing sunspot
magnetic flux at a slowing rate such that it appears to gradually saturate, analogous to earlier
studies. The activity dependence of the ratio of facular and network flux to sunspot flux is consistent
with the findings of recent studies: although the Sun is faculae-dominated, it is only marginally
so as facular and network brightening and sunspot darkening appear to be closely balanced.

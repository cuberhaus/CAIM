The importance of alternative methods to measure the Hubble constant such as time-delay cosmography
is highlighted by the recent Hubble tension. It is paramount to thoroughly investigate and rule
out systematic biases in all measurement methods before we can accept new physics as the source of
this tension. In this study, we perform a check for systematic biases in the lens modelling procedure
of time-delay cosmography by comparing independent and blind time-delay predictions of the system
WGD 2038$-$4008 from two teams using two different software programs: Glee and lenstronomy. The
predicted time delays from both teams incorporate the stellar kinematics of the deflector and the
external convergence from line-of-sight structures. The unblinded time-delay predictions from
the two teams agree within $1.2\sigma$ implying that once the time delay is measured the inferred
Hubble constant will also be mutually consistent. However, there is a $\sim$4$\sigma$ discrepancy
between the power-law model slope and external shear, which is a significant discrepancy at the
level of lens models before incorporating the stellar kinematics and the external convergence.
We identify the difference in the reconstructed point spread function (PSF) to be the source of this
discrepancy. If the same reconstructed PSF is used by both teams, then we achieve excellent agreement
within $\sim$0.6$\sigma$, indicating that potential systematics stemming from source reconstruction
algorithms and investigator choices are well under control. We recommend future studies to supersample
the PSF as needed and marginalize over multiple algorithms/realizations for the PSF reconstruction
to mitigate the systematic associated with the PSF. A future study will measure the time delays of
the system WGD 2038$-$4008 and infer the Hubble constant based on our mass models.

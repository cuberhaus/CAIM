As in Gonzalez-Nuevo et al. 2017 and Bonavera et al. 2019, the high-z sub-millimetre galaxies can
be used as background sample for gravitational lensing studies thanks to their magnification bias.
In particular, as in Bonavera et al. 2020 the magnification bias can be exploited in order to constrain
the free parameters of a Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) model and some of the main cosmological
parameters. In this work the magnification bias has been evaluated as cosmological tool in a tomographic
set up. The cross-correlation function (CCF) data have been used to jointly constrain the astrophysical
parameters $M_{min}$, $M_{1}$ and $\alpha$ in each one of the selected redshift bins and the $\Omega_{M}$,
$\sigma_{8}$, and $H_0$ cosmological ones ($\Lambda$CDM). Moreover, we explore the possible
time evolution of the dark energy density introducing also the $\omega_0, \omega_a$ parameters
in the joint analysis ($\omega_0$CDM and $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM). The CCF has been measured between
a foreground spectroscopic sample of GAMA galaxies that has been divided into four redshift bins
(0.1-0.2, 0.2-0.3, 0.3-0.5 and 0.5-0.8) and a sample of H-ATLAS galaxies with photometric redshifts
>1.2. The CCF is modelled using a description that depends on HOD and cosmological parameters that
are estimated with MCMC in different cases. For the $\Lambds$CDM model, the analysis yields a maximum
posterior value at 0.26 with $[0.17,0.41]$ 68\% C.I. for $\Omega_M$ and at 0.87 with $[0.75,1]$
68\% C.I. for $\sigma_8$. With our current results $H_0$ is not yet constrained. With the $\omega_0$CDM
model, the constraints on $\Omega_M$ and $\sigma_8$ are similar, but we found a maximum posterior
value for $\omega_0$ at -1 with $[-1.56, -0.47]$ 68\% C.I. In the $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM model,
the results are -1.09 with $[-1.72, -0.66]$ 68\% C.I. for $\omega_0$ and -0.19 with $[-1.88, 1.48]$
68\% C.I. for $\omega_a$.

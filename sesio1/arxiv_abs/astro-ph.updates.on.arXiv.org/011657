In the context of cosmic microwave background polarization studies and the characterization of
the Galactic foregrounds, the power spectrum analysis of the thermal dust polarization sky has
led to intriguing evidence of an E/B asymmetry and a positive TE correlation. In this work, we produce
synthesized dust polarization maps from a set of global magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations
of Milky-Way-sized galaxies, and analyze their power spectra at intermediate angular scales (angular
multipoles $\ell \in \left[60 ,\, 140\right]$). We study the role of the initial configuration
of the large-scale magnetic field, its strength, and the feedback on the power spectrum characteristics.
Using full-galaxy MHD simulations, we were able to estimate the variance induced by the peculiar
location of the observer in the galaxy. We find that the polarization power spectra sensitively
depend on the observer's location, impeding a distinction between different simulation setups.
There is a clear statistical difference between the power spectra measured from within the spiral
arms and those measured from the inter-arm regions. Also, power spectra from within supernova-driven
bubbles share common characteristics, regardless of the underlying model. However, no correlation
was found between the properties of the polarization power spectra and the local (with respect to
the observer) mean values of physical quantities such as the density and the strength of the magnetic
field. Finally, we find indications that the global strength of the magnetic field may play a role
in shaping the power spectrum characteristics; as the global magnetic field strength increases,
the E/B asymmetry and the TE correlation increase, whereas the viewpoint-induced variance decreases.
However, we find no direct correlation with the strength of the local magnetic field that permeates
the mapped region of the interstellar medium.

Context:Optical interferometry is at a key development stage. ESO's VLTI has established a stable,
robust infrastructure for long-baseline interferometry for general astronomical observers.
The present second-generation instruments offer a wide wavelength coverage and improved performance.
Their sensitivity and measurement accuracy lead to data and images of high reliability. Aims:We
have developed MATISSE, the Multi AperTure mid-Infrared SpectroScopic Experiment, to access
high resolution imaging in a wide spectral domain and explore topics such: stellar activity and
mass loss; planet formation and evolution in the gas and dust disks around young stars; accretion
processes around super massive black holes in AGN. Methods:The instrument is a spectro-interferometric
imager covering three atmospheric bands (L,M,N) from 2.8 to 13.0 mu, combining four optical beams
from the VLTI's telscopes. Its concept, related observing procedure, data reduction and calibration
approach are the product of 30 years of instrumental research. The instrument utilizes a multi-axial
beam combination that delivers spectrally dispersed fringes. The signal provides the following
quantities at several spectral resolutions: photometric flux, coherent fluxes, visibilities,
closure phases, wavelength differential visibilities and phases, and aperture-synthesis imaging.
Results:We provide an overview of the physical principle of the instrument and its functionalities,
the characteristics of the delivered signal, a description of the observing modes and of their performance
limits. An ensemble of data and reconstructed images are illustrating the first acquired key observations.
Conclusion:The instrument has been in operation at Cerro Paranal, ESO, Chile since 2018, and has
been open for science use by the international community since April 2019. The first scientific
results are being published now.

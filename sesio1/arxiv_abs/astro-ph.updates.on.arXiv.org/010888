This paper introduces the quadrant polarization parameters $Q_{000}$, $Q_{090}$, $Q_{180}$,
$Q_{270}$ for Stokes $Q$ and $U_{045}$, $U_{135}$, $U_{225}$, $U_{315}$ for Stokes $U$ for the
characterization of the azimuthal dependence of the scattering polarization of spatially resolved
circumstellar disks illuminated by the central star. These parameters are based on the natural
Stokes $Q$ and $U$ quadrant pattern produced by circumstellar scattering. They provide a simple
test of the deviations of the disk geometry from axisymmetry and can be used to constrain the scattering
phase function for optically thin disks without detailed model fitting of disk images. The parameters
are easy to derive from observations and model calculations and are therefore well suited to systematic
studies of the dust scattering in circumstellar disks. It is shown for models of optically thin and
rotationally symmetric debris disks that the quadrant parameters normalized to the integrated
azimuthal polarization or quadrant ratios like $Q_{000}/Q_{180}$ depend only on the disk inclination
$i$ and the polarized scattering phase function of the dust, and they do not depend on the radial distribution
of the scattering emissivity. Because $i$ is usually well known for resolved disk, we can derive
the shape of the phase function for the sampled scattering angle range. This finding also applies
to models with vertical extensions as observed for debris disks. Diagnostic diagrams are calculated
for normalized quadrant parameters and quadrant ratios for the determination of the asymmetry
parameter $g$ of the polarized Henyey-Greenstein scattering phase function. We apply these diagrams
to measurements of HR 4796A, and find that a phase function with only one parameter does not reproduce
the data well, but find a better solution with a three-parameter phase function.

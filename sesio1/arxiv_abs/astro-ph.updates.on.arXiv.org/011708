We revisit the structure of conformal gravity in the presence of a c-number, conformally coupled,
long range, macroscopic scalar field. And in the static, spherically symmetric case discuss two
classes of exact exterior solutions, in one of which the scalar field has a constant value and in the
other, which is due to Brihaye and Verbin, it has a radial dependence. In light of these two solutions
Horne and then Hobson and Lasenby raised the concern that the fitting of conformal gravity to galactic
rotation curves had been misapplied and thus called the successful fitting of the conformal theory
into question. We show that the analysis of Brihaye and Verbin is not actually general, but is nonetheless
valid in the particular case that they studied. For the analyses of Horne and of Hobson and Lasenby
we show that this macroscopic scalar field is not related to the mass generation that is required
in a conformal theory. Rather, not just in conformal gravity, but also in standard Einstein gravity,
the presence of such a long range scalar field would lead to test particles whose masses would be of
the same order as the masses of the galaxies around which they orbit. Since particle masses are not
at all of this form, such macroscopic fields cannot be responsible for mass generation; and the existence
of any such mass-generating scalar fields can be excluded, consistent with there actually being
no known massless scalar particles in nature. Instead, mass generation has to be due to c-number
vacuum expectation values of q-number fields. Such expectation values are microscopic not macroscopic
and only vary within particle interiors, giving particles an extended, baglike structure, as needed
for localization in a conformal theory. And being purely internal they have no effect on galactic
orbits, to thus leave the good conformal gravity fitting to galactic rotation curves intact.

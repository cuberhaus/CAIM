This paper investigates the various spherically symmetric wormhole solutions in the presence
of tidal forces and applies numerous methods, such as test particle orbital dynamics, ray-tracing
and microlensing. We make the theoretical predictions on the test particle orbital motion around
the tidal wormholes with the use of normalized by $\mathcal{L}^2$ effective potential. In order
to obtain the ray-tracing images (of both geometrically thin and thick accretion disks, relativistic
jets), we properly modify the open source $\texttt{GYOTO}$ code with python interface. We applied
this techniques to probe the accretion flows nearby the Schwarzschild-like and charged Reissner-N\"ordstrom
(RS) wormholes (we assumed both charged RS wormhole and special case with the vanishing electromagnetic
charge, namely Damour-Solodukhin (DS) wormhole). It was shown that the photon sphere for Schwarzschild-like
wormhole presents for both thin and thick accretion disks and even for the vanishing tidal forces.
Moreover, it was observed that $r_{\mathrm{ph}}\to\infty$ as $\alpha\to\infty$, which constraints
$\alpha$ parameter to be sufficiently small and positive in order to respect the EHT observations.
On the other hand, for the case of RS wormhole, photon sphere radius shrinks as $\Lambda\to\infty$,
as it was predicted by the effective potential. In addition to the accretion disks, we as well probe
the relativistic jets around two wormhole solutions of our consideration. Finally, with the help
of star bulb microlensing, we approximate the radius of the wormhole shadow and as we found out, for
Schild WH, $R_{\mathrm{Sh}}\approx r_0$ for ZTF and grows linearly with $\alpha$. On the contrary,
shadow radius for charged wormholes slowly decreases with the growing trend of DS parameter $\Lambda$.

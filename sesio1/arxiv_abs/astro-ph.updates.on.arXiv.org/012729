The repeating fast radio burst (FRB) source FRB 20200120E is exceptional because of its proximity
($d=3.6$ Mpc) and association with a globular cluster. Here we report $60$ bursts detected with
the 100-m Effelsberg telescope at 1.4 GHz. We observe large variations in the burst rate, and report
the first FRB 20200120E `burst storm', where the source suddenly became active and 53 bursts occurred
within only 40 minutes. We find no strict periodicity in the burst arrival times during the storm,
nor any evidence for periodicity in the source's activity between observations. The burst storm
shows a steep burst energy distribution (power-law index $\alpha = 2.39\pm0.12$) and a bi-modal
wait-time distribution, with log-normal means of 0.94$^{+0.07}_{-0.06}$ s and 23.61$^{+3.06}_{-2.71}$
s. We attribute these peaks in the wait-time distribution to a characteristic event timescale and
pseudo-Poisson burst rate, respectively. The secondary wait-time peak at $\sim1$ s is $\sim50\times$
longer than the $\sim30$ ms timescale seen for both FRB 20121102A and FRB 20201124A -- potentially
indicating a larger emission region, or slower burst propagation through this region. At the same
time, FRB 20200120E shows, on average, order-of-magnitude lower burst durations and luminosities
compared with FRB 20121102A and FRB 20201124A. Lastly, in contrast to FRB 20121102A, which has observed
dispersion measure (DM) variations of $\Delta{\rm DM} >1$ pc cm$^{-3}$ on month-to-year timescales,
we determine that the DM of FRB 20200120E has remained stable ($\Delta{\rm DM} <0.15$ pc cm$^{-3}$)
between measurements separated by $>10$ months. Overall, the observational characteristics
of FRB 20200120E deviate quantitatively from other active repeaters, but it is unclear whether
it is qualitatively a different type of source.

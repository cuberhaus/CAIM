Coronal loops are the basic building block of the upper solar atmosphere. Comprehending how these
are energized, structured, and evolve is key to understanding stellar coronae. Here we investigate
how the energy to heat the loop is generated by photospheric magneto-convection, transported into
the upper atmosphere, and how the internal structure of a coronal loop forms. In a 3D magnetohydrodynamics
(MHD) model, we study an isolated coronal loop rooted with both footpoints in a shallow layer within
the convection zone using the MURaM code. To resolve its internal structure, we limited the computational
domain to a rectangular box containing a single coronal loop as a straightened magnetic flux tube.
Field-aligned heat conduction, gray radiative transfer in the photosphere and chromosphere,
and optically thin radiative losses in the corona were taken into account. The footpoints were allowed
to interact self-consistently with the granulation surrounding them. The loop is heated by a Poynting
flux that is self-consistently generated through small-scale motions within individual magnetic
concentrations in the photosphere. Turbulence develops in the upper layers of the atmosphere as
a response to the footpoint motions. We see little sign of heating by large-scale braiding of magnetic
flux tubes from different photospheric concentrations at a given footpoint. The synthesized emission,
as it would be observed by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly or the X-ray Telescope, reveals transient
bright strands that form in response to the heating events. Overall, our model roughly reproduces
the properties and evolution of the plasma as observed within coronal loops. With this model we can
build a coherent picture of how the energy flux to heat the upper atmosphere is generated near the
solar surface and how this process drives and governs the heating and dynamics of a coronal loop.

The chemical makeup of a star provides the fossil information of the environment where it formed.
Under this premise, it should be possible to use chemical abundances to tag stars that formed within
the same stellar association. This idea - known as chemical tagging - has not produced the expected
results, especially within the thin disk where open stellar clusters have chemical patterns that
are difficult to disentangle. The ultimate goal of this study is to probe the feasibility of chemical
tagging within the thin disk population using high-quality data from a controlled sample of stars.
We also aim at improving the existing techniques of chemical tagging and giving guidance on different
strategies of clustering analysis in the elemental abundance space. Here we develop the first blind
search of open clusters' members through clustering analysis in the elemental abundance space
using the OPTICS algorithm applied to data from the Gaia-ESO survey. First, we evaluate different
strategies of analysis, determining which ones are more performing. Second, we apply these methods
to a data set including both field stars and open clusters attempting a blind recover of as many open
clusters as possible. We show how specific strategies of data analysis can improve the final results.
Specifically, we demonstrate that open clusters can be more efficaciously recovered with the Manhattan
metric and on a space whose dimensions are carefully selected. Using these (and other) prescriptions
we are able to recover open clusters hidden in our data set and find new members of these stellar associations.
Our results indicate that there are chances of recovering open clusters' members via clustering
analysis in the elemental abundance space. Presumably, the performances of chemical tagging will
further increase with higher quality data and more sophisticated clustering algorithms.

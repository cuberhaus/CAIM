By assembling the largest sample to date of X-ray emitting EW-type binaries (EWXs), we carried out
correlation analyses for the X-ray luminosity log$L_{\textrm{X}}$, and X-ray activity level
log($L_{\textrm{X}}$/$L_{\textrm{bol}}$) versus the orbital period $P$ and effective temperature
$T_{\rm eff}$. We find strong $P$-log$L_{\textrm{X}}$ and $P$-log($L_{\textrm{X}}$/$L_{\textrm{bol}}$)
correlations for EWXs with $P$ < 0.44 days and we provide the linear parametrizations for these relations,
on the basis of which the orbital period can be treated as a good predictor for log$L_{\textrm{X}}$
and log($L_{\textrm{X}}$/$L_{\textrm{bol}}$). The aforementioned binary stellar parameters
are all correlated with log$L_{\textrm{X}}$, while only $T_{\rm eff}$ exhibits a strong correlation
with log($L_{\textrm{X}}$/$L_{\textrm{bol}}$). Then, EWXs with higher temperature show lower
X-ray activity level, which could indicate the thinning of the convective area related to the magnetic
dynamo mechanism. The total X-ray luminosity of an EWX is essentially consistent with that of an
X-ray saturated main sequence star with the same mass as its primary, which may imply that the primary
star dominates the X-ray emission. The monotonically decreasing $P$-log($L_{\textrm{X}}$/$L_{\textrm{bol}}$)
relation and the short orbital periods indicate that EWXs could all be in the X-ray saturated state,
and they may inherit the changing trend of the saturated X-ray luminosities along with the mass shown
by single stars. For EWXs, the orbital period, mass, and effective temperature increase in concordance.
We demonstrate that the period $P=0.44$ days corresponds to the primary mass of $\sim1.1 \rm M_\odot$,
beyond which the saturated X-ray luminosity of single stars will not continue to increase with mass.
This explains the break in the positive $P$-log$L_{\textrm{X}}$ relation for EWXs with $P>0.44$
days.

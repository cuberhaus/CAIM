We study the relationship between the morphology and star formation history (SFH) of 361 quiescent
galaxies (QGs) at redshift $\langle z_{obs}\rangle\approx 2$, with stellar mass $\log M_*\ge10.3$,
selected with the UVJ technique. Taking advantage of panchromatic photometry covering the rest-frame
UV-to-NIR spectral range ($\approx40$ bands), we reconstruct the non-parametric SFH of the galaxies
with the fully Bayesian SED fitting code Prospector. We find that the half-light radius $R_e$, observed
at $z_{obs}$, depends on the formation redshift of the galaxies, $z_{form}$, and that this relationship
depends on stellar mass. At $\log M_*<11$, the relationship is consistent with $R_e\propto(1+z_{form})^{-1}$,
in line with the expectation that the galaxies' central density depends on the cosmic density at
the time of their formation, i.e. the "progenitor effect". At $\log M_*>11$, the relationship between
$R_e$ and $z_{form}$ flattens, suggesting that mergers become increasingly important for the
size growth of more massive galaxies after they quenched. We also find that the relationship between
$z_{form}$ and galaxy compactness similarly depends on stellar mass. While no clear trend is observed
for QGs with $\log M_*>11$, lower-mass QGs that formed earlier, i.e. with larger $z_{form}$, have
larger central stellar mass surface densities, both within the $R_e$ ($\Sigma_e$) and central
1 kpc ($\Sigma_{1kpc}$), and also larger $M_{1kpc}/M_*$, the fractional mass within the central
1 kpc. These trends between $z_{form}$ and compactness, however, essentially disappear, if the
progenitor effect is removed by normalizing the stellar density with the cosmic density at $z_{form}$.
Our findings highlight the importance of reconstructing the SFH of galaxies before attempting
to infer their intrinsic structural evolution.

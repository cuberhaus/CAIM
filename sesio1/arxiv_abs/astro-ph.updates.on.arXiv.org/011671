[Abridged] The interstellar medium is observed to be organised in filamentary structures, as well
as neutral (HI) and ionized (HII) bubbles. The expanding nature of these bubbles makes them shape
their surroundings and possibly play a role in the formation and evolution of interstellar filaments.
We present APEX $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O(2-1) observations of the NGC 6334 molecular cloud. We investigate
the gas velocity structure along and across the 50 pc-long cloud and towards 75 identified velocity-coherent-filaments
(VCFs). We measure a wealth of velocity gradients along the VCFs. We derive the column density and
velocity power spectra of the VCFs. These power spectra are well represented with power laws showing
similar slopes for both quantities (with a mean of about -2), albeit some differ by up to a factor of
two. The position velocity diagrams perpendicular to three VCFs show the V-shaped velocity pattern,
corresponding to a bent structure in velocity space with the filament at the tip of the V surrounded
by an extended structure connected to it with a velocity gradient. This velocity structure is qualitatively
similar to that resulting from numerical simulations of filament formation from large-scale compression
from propagating shock fronts. In addition, the radial profiles perpendicular to these VCFs hint
to small-scale internal impacts from neighbouring HII bubbles. The observed opposite curvature
in velocity space towards the VCFs points to various origins of large-scale external compressions
from propagating HI bubbles. This suggests the plausible importance of multiple HI compressions,
separated in space and time, in the formation and evolution of molecular clouds and their star formation
history. These latter atomic compressions due to past and distant star formation events are complemented
by the impact of HII bubbles from present time and local star formation activity.

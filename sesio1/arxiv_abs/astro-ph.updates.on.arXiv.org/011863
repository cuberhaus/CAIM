Statistical theory for self-gravitating collisionless dark matter flow is not fully developed
because of 1) intrinsic complexity involving constant divergence flow on small scale and irrotational
flow on large scale; 2) lack of self-closed description for peculiar velocity; and 3) mathematically
challenging. To better understand dark matter flow, kinematic and dynamic relations among different
statistical measures of velocity must be developed for different types of flow. In this paper, a
compact derivation is presented to formulate general kinematic relations on any order for incompressible,
constant divergence, and irrotational flow. Results are validated by N-body simulation. Dynamic
relations can only be determined from self-closed description of velocity evolution. On large
scale, we found i) third order correlation can be related to density correlation or pairwise velocity;
ii) effective viscosity in adhesion model originates from velocity fluctuations; iii) negative
viscosity is due to inverse energy cascade; iv) velocity correlations follow $\propto a^{(q+2)/2}$
for odd q and $\propto a^{q/2}$ for even q; v) overdensity is proportional to density correlation
on the same scale, $\langle\delta\rangle\propto\langle\delta\delta'\rangle$; vi) (reduced)
velocity dispersion is proportional to density correlation on the same scale; vii) combined kinematic
and dynamic relations determines exponential velocity correlations on large scale. On small scale,
self-closed description for velocity evolution is developed by decomposing velocity into motion
in halo and motion of halo. Vorticity, enstrophy, and energy evolution can all be derived from self-closed
equation for velocity. Dynamic relation is derived to relate third and second order correlations.
Third moment of pairwise velocity is determined by energy production rate $\epsilon_u$ or $\langle(\Delta
u_L)^3\rangle\propto\epsilon_uar$.

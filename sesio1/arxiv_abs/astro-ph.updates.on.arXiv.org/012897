Supermassive stars (SMSs) with masses of $M_\ast \simeq 10^4$--$10^5~{\rm M_\odot}$ are invoked
as possible seeds of high-redshift supermassive black holes, but it remains under debate whether
their protostar indeed acquires sufficient mass via gas accretion overcoming radiative feedback.
We investigate protostellar growth in dynamically heated atomic-cooling haloes (ACHs) found
in recent cosmological simulations, performing three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamical
(RHD) simulations that consider stellar evolution under variable mass accretion. We find that
one of the ACHs feeds the central protostar at rates exceeding a critical value, above which the star
evolves in a cool bloating phase and hardly produces ionizing photons. Consequently, the stellar
mass reaches $M_\ast \gtrsim 10^4~{\rm M_\odot}$ unimpeded by radiative feedback. In the other
ACH, where the mass supply rate is lower, the star spends most of its life as a hot main-sequence star,
emitting intense ionizing radiation. Then, the stellar mass growth is terminated around $500~{\rm
M_\odot}$ by photoevaporation of the circumstellar disk. A series of our RHD simulations provide
a formula of the final stellar mass determined either by stellar feedback or their lifetime as a function
of the mass supply rate from the parent cloud in the absence of stellar radiation. Combining the results
with the statistical properties of SMS-forming clouds in high-redshift quasar progenitor haloes,
we construct a top-heavy mass distribution of primordial stars over $M_\ast \simeq 100$--$10^5~{\rm
M_\odot}$, approximately following a power-law spectrum of $\propto M_\ast^{-1.3}$ with a steeper
decline at $M_\ast \gtrsim 2 \times 10^4~{\rm M_\odot}$. Their massive BH remnants would be further
fed via the dense debris disk, powering "milli-quasars" with a bolometric luminosity of $L_{\rm
bol}~\gtrsim~10^{43}~{\rm erg~s^{-1}}$.

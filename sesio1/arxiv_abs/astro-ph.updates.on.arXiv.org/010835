The X-ray polarization degree of the molecular clouds that surround Sgr A* is expected to be greatly
lowered because the polarized reflection emission is mixed with the unpolarized thermal emission
that pervades the Galactic center region. Hence, this will be a challenging observation for the
upcoming Imaging X-ray Polarimeter Explorer (IXPE). We aim to determine the detectability of four
molecular clouds (MC) of the Sgr A complex (MC2, Bridge B2, Bridge E, and G0.11-0.11) in a realistic
IXPE pointing of the Sgr A field of view. We assess the Minimum Detectable Polarization (MDP) increase
when a MC is off axis. We provide two different strategies to reconstruct the intrinsic cloud polarization
once the data will be available. We use the Monte Carlo tool ixpeobssim to simulate IXPE observations
of the Sgr A MC complex. We use Chandra maps and spectra to model the diffuse emission in the Galactic
center region along with a realistic model of the instrumental and diffuse background. We create
synthetic polarization products of the unpolarized emission. We combine them with a test dataset
from a simulation of a 2 Ms long IXPE observation to retrieve the intrinsic polarization degree of
the MCs. We find that for the MC considered here, the MDP increases by 1-15% with respect to the case
in which a cloud is observed on-axis. We successfully retrieve the intrinsic polarization degree
in the 4.0-8.0 keV band and line-of-sight distance of one of them taken as an example, G0.11-0.11,
by correcting the observed (i.e., for a 2 Ms-long simulation) polarization degree map using either
a synthetic dilution map or a Stokes intensity map of the unpolarized emission. With both methods,
the position of the cloud along the line-of-sight is derived from the reconstructed polarization
degree with an uncertainty of 7 and 4 pc, respectively.

We investigate the feasibility and demonstrate the merits of using Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter
(MOLA) profiles to retrieve seasonal height variations of CO2 snow/ice cap in Mars' polar areas
by applying a co-registration strategy. We present a prototype analysis on the research region
of [85.75{\deg}S, 86.25{\deg}S, 300{\deg}E, 330{\deg}E] that is located on the residual south
polar cap. Our method comprises the recomputation of MOLA footprint coordinates with an updated
Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) ephemeris and a revised Mars rotation model. The reprocessed MOLA dataset
at the South Pole of Mars (poleward of 78{\deg}S) is then self-registered to form a coherent reference
digital terrain model (DTM). We co-register segments of reprocessed MOLA profiles to the self-registered
MOLA reference DTM to obtain the temporal height differences at either footprints or cross-overs.
Subsequently, a two-step Regional Pseudo Cross-over Adjustment (RPCA) procedure is proposed
and applied to post-correct the aforementioned temporal height differences for a temporal systematic
bias and other residual errors. These pseudo cross-overs are formed by profile pairs that do not
necessarily intersect, but are connected through the underlaying DTM. Finally, CO2 snow/ice temporal
height variation is obtained by median-filtering those post-corrected temporal height differences.
The precision of the derived height change time series is ~4.9 cm. The peak-to-peak height variation
is estimated to be ~2 m. In addition, a pronounced "pit" (transient height accumulation) of ~0.5
m in magnitude centered at Ls=210{\deg} in southern spring is observed. The proposed method opens
the possibility to map the seasonal CO2 snow/ice height variations at the entire North and South
polar regions of Mars.

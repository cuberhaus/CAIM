The impact flux over the last 3 Ga in the inner Solar System is commonly assumed to be constant through
time. However, asteroid break-up events in the main belt may have been responsible for cratering
spikes over the last ~2 Ga on the Earth-Moon system. We investigate here the possible variations
of the size frequency distributions of impactors from the record of small craters of 521 martian
impact craters larger than 20 km in diameter. We show that 49 craters (out of the 521) correspond to
the complete crater population of this size formed over the last 600 Ma. Our results on Mars show that
the flux of both small (> 5 m) and large asteroids (> 1 km) are coupled, does not vary between each other
over the last 600 Ma. Existing data sets for large craters on the Earth and the Moon are analyzed and
compared to our results on Mars. On Earth, we infer the formation location of a set of impact craters
thanks to plate tectonic reconstruction and show that a cluster of craters formed during the Ordovician
period, about 470 Ma ago, appears to be a preservation bias. On the Moon, the late increase seen in
the crater age signal can be due to the uncertain calibration method used to date those impacts (i.e.
rock abundance in lunar impact ejecta), and other calibrations are consistent with a constant crater
production rate. We conclude to a coupling of the crater production rate between kilometer-size
craters and down to ~100 m in diameter in the inner Solar System. This is consistent with the traditional
model for delivering asteroids to planet-crossing orbits: the Yarkovsky effect slowly pushes
the large debris from asteroid break-ups towards orbital resonances while smaller debris are grinded
through collisional cascades. This suggests that the influence of past asteroid break-ups in the
cratering rate for D > 100 m is limited or inexistent.

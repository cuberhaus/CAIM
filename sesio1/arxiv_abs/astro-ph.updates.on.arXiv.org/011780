Quasi-periodic X-ray eruptions (QPEs) are a recently discovered phenomenon, the nature of which
remains unclear. Based on their discovery in active galactic nuclei (AGN), explanations related
to an AGN accretion disk, or potentially stellar tidal disruption event (TDE), were put forward.
Following the report of QPEs in apparently passive galaxies, alternatives including highly unequal
mass compact object binaries have been proposed to explain their properties. We perform a systematic
study of the five known QPE host galaxies with the aim of providing new insights into their nature.
We analyse new and archival medium resolution optical spectroscopy of the QPE hosts. We measure
emission (and absorption) line fluxes, their ratios and equivalent widths (EWs), to locate the
QPE hosts on diagnostic diagrams. We also measure the velocity dispersion of the stellar absorption
lines to estimate their black hole masses. All QPE host galaxies show emission lines in their optical
spectra. Based on their ratios and EWs, we find evidence for the presence of an active galactic nucleus
in all sources, including those previously reported as passive. We measure velocity dispersions
between 36 and 90 km/s, implying the presence of low mass (10^5-6.7 solar masses) black holes, consistent
with literature findings. Finally, we find a significant over-representation (2/5 sources, or
a factor of 13 +13 -10.5) of quiescent, Balmer strong (post starburst) galaxies among QPE hosts.
The presence of a narrow line region consistent with an AGN in all QPE host galaxies implies that a
pre-existing accretion flow likely plays an integral part to the QPE phenomenon. The strong over-representation
of quiescent Balmer strong galaxies among QPE hosts can be naturally explained in both the TDE and
interacting extreme mass ratio inspiral hypotheses.

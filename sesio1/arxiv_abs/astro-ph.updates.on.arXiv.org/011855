The eROSITA X-ray telescope on board the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) satellite has started
to detect new X-ray sources over the full sky at an unprecedented rate. Understanding the performance
and selection function of the source detection is important for the subsequent scientific analysis
of the eROSITA catalogs. Through simulations, we test and optimize the eROSITA source detection
procedures, and we characterize the detected catalog quantitatively. Taking the eROSITA Final
Equatorial-Depth Survey (eFEDS) as an example, we ran extensive photon-event simulations based
on our best knowledge of the instrument characteristics, the background spectrum, and the population
of astronomical X-ray sources. We introduce a method of analyzing source detection completeness,
purity, and efficiency based on the origin of each photon. According to the source detection efficiency
measured in the simulation, we chose a two-pronged strategy to build eROSITA X-ray catalogs, creating
a main catalog using only the most sensitive band (0.2-2.3 keV) and an independent hard-band-selected
catalog using multiband detection in a range up to 5 keV. Because our mock data are highly representative
of the real eFEDS data, we used the mock catalogs to measure the completeness and purity of the eFEDS
catalogs as a function of multiple parameters, such as detection likelihood, flux, and luminosity.
These measurements provide a basis for choosing the eFEDS catalog selection thresholds. The mock
catalogs (available with this paper) can be used to construct the selection function of active galactic
nuclei and galaxy clusters. A direct comparison of the output and input mock catalogs also gives
rise to a correction curve that converts the raw point-source flux distribution into the intrinsic
number counts distribution.

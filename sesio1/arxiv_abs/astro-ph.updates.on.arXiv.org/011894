Observations that require large physical instrument dimensions and/or a considerable amount
of cryogens, as it is the case for high spatial resolution far infrared (FIR) astronomy, currently
still face technological limits for their execution from space. Angular resolution and available
observational capabilities are particularly affected. Balloon-based platforms promise to complement
the existing observational capabilities by offering means to deploy comparatively large telescopes
with comparatively little effort, including other advantages such as the possibility to regularly
refill cryogens and to change and/or update instruments. The planned European Stratospheric Balloon
Observatory (ESBO) aims at providing these additional large aperture FIR capabilities, exceeding
the spatial resolution of Herschel, in the long term. The plans focus on reusable platforms performing
regular flights and an operations concept that provides researchers with proposal-based access
to observations. It thereby aims at offering a complement to other airborne, ground-based and space-based
observatories in terms of access to wavelength regions, spatial resolution capability, and photometric
stability. While the FIR capabilities are a main long-term objective, ESBO will offer benefits
in other wavelength regimes along the way. Within the ESBO Design Study (ESBO DS), a prototype platform
carrying a 0.5 m telescope for ultraviolet and visible light observations is being built and a platform
concept for a next-generation FIR telescope is being studied. A flight of the UV/VIS prototype platform
is estimated for 2021. In this paper we will outline the scientific and technical motivation for
a large aperture balloon-based FIR observatory and the ESBO DS approach towards such an infrastructure.
Secondly, we will present the technical motivation, science case, and instrumentation of the 0.5
m UV/VIS platform.

TAROGE-M is a self-triggered radio antenna array atop the 2700 m high Mt. Melbourne in Antarctica,
designed to detect impulsive geomagnetic emission from extensive air showers induced by ultra-high
energy (UHE) particles beyond 0.1 EeV, including cosmic rays (CRs), Earth-skimming tau neutrinos,
and particularly, the "ANITA anomalous events" (AAEs) from near and below the horizon, which origin
remains uncertain and requires more experimental inputs for clarification. The detection concept
of TAROGE-M takes advantage of a high altitude with synoptic view toward the horizon as an efficient
signal collector, and the radio quietness as well as strong and near vertical geomagnetic field
in Antarctica. This approach has a low energy threshold, high duty cycle, and is easy to extend for
quickly enlarging statistics. Here we report experimental results from the first TAROGE-M station
deployed in 2020, corresponding to $25.3$-days of livetime. The station consists of six receiving
antennas operating at 180-450 MHz, and can reconstruct source directions with $\sim0.3^\circ$
angular resolution. To demonstrate its ability to detect UHE air showers, a search for CR signals
in the data was conducted, resulting in seven identified events. These events have a mean reconstructed
energy of $0.95_{-0.31}^{+0.46}$ EeV and zenith angles between $25^\circ-82^\circ$, with both
distributions agreeing with simulations. The estimated CR flux is also consistent with results
of other experiments. The TAROGE-M sensitivity to AAEs is approximated by the tau neutrino exposure
with simulations, suggesting comparable sensitivity as ANITA's at $~1$ EeV energy with a few station-years
of operation. These first results verified the station design and performance in a polar and high-altitude
environment, and are promising for further discovery of tau neutrinos and AAEs after an extension
in the near future.

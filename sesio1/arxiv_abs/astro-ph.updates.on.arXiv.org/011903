The last decade has seen a revolution in our knowledge of the Galaxy thanks to the Gaia and asteroseismic
space missions and the ground-based spectroscopic surveys. To complete this picture, it is necessary
to map the ages of its stellar populations. During recent years, the dependence on time of abundance
ratios involving slow (s) neutron-capture and $\alpha$ elements (called chemical-clocks) has
been used to provide estimates of stellar ages, usually in a limited volume close to the Sun. We aim
to analyse the relations of chemical clocks in the Galactic disc extending the range to R$_{\rm GC}\sim$6-20~kpc.
Using the sixth internal data release of the Gaia-ESO survey, we calibrated several relations between
stellar ages and abundance ratios [s/$\alpha$] using a sample of open clusters, the largest one
so far used with this aim. Thanks to their wide galactocentric coverage, we investigated the radial
variations of the shape of these relations, confirming their non-universality. We estimated our
accuracy and precision in recovering the global ages of open clusters, and the ages of their individual
members. We applied the multi-variate relations with the highest correlation coefficients to
the field star population. We confirm that there is no single age-chemical clock relationship valid
for the whole disc, but that there is a dependence on the galactocentric position, which is related
to the radial variation of the star formation history combined with the non-monotonic dependence
on metallicity of the yields of the s-process elements from low- and intermediate-mass stars. Finally,
the abundance ratios [Ba/$\alpha$] are more sensitive to age than those with [Y/$\alpha$] for young
disc stars, and their slopes vary less with galactocentric distance.

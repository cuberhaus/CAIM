In millimeter/submillimeter wavelength, the studies of the complex molecular emission lines
towards the hot molecular cores demonstrate valuable details about the chemical composition and
massive star formation processes. We present the interferometric detection of rotational molecular
emission lines of complex organic species ethyl cyanide (C$_{2}$H$_{5}$CN) and methyl formate
(CH$_{3}$OCHO) towards the hot molecular core IRAS 18566+0408 using data of Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter
Array (ALMA). We detected a total of three unblended strong rotational emission lines of ethyl cyanide
and eight strong rotational emission lines of methyl formate between the frequency range of 85.64$-$100.42
GHz with ALMA band 3 observation. We applied the rotational diagram method under the Local Thermodynamic
Equilibrium (LTE) conditions to determine the molecular column density ($N$) in cm$^{-2}$ and
rotational temperature ($T_{rot}$) in K. The estimated statistical column density of ethyl cyanide
was $N$(C$_{2}$H$_{5}$CN) = (3.50$\pm$0.68)$\times$10$^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ with rotational temperature
$T_{rot}$ = 150$\pm$2.5 K and methyl formate was $N$(CH$_{3}$OCHO) = (1.55$\pm$0.31)$\times$10$^{16}$
cm$^{-2}$ with rotational temperature $T_{rot}$ = 150$\pm$2.8 K. We also fitted the LTE model spectrum
over the original transitions of detected C$_{2}$H$_{5}$CN and CH$_{3}$OCHO spectral lines using
the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to extract the line parameters. We estimated the fractional
abundance of ethyl cyanide and methyl formate towards IRAS 18566+0408 relative to H$_{2}$ as 1.66$\times$10$^{-9}$
and 7.38$\times$10$^{-9}$ respectively where $N$(H$_{2}$) = 2.1$\times$10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$.
Except C$_{2}$H$_{5}$CN and CH$_{3}$OCHO, we also detected simple organic molecules SO, CH$_{2}$CO,
HC$_{3}$N, H$_{2}$$^{34}$CS, HC$^{13}$CCN, HCC$^{13}$CN, and CH$_{3}$CHO towards IRAS 18566+0408.

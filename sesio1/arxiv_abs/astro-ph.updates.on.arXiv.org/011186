Context: Gas accretion flows transport material from the cloud core onto the protostar. In multiple
protostellar systems, it is not clear if the delivery mechanism is preferential or evenly distributed
among the components. Aims: Gas accretion flows within IRAS16293 is explored out to 6000 AU. Methods:
ALMA Band 3 observations of low-$J$ transitions of HNC, cyanopolyynes (HC$_3$N, HC$_5$N), and
N$_2$H$^+$ are used to probe the cloud core structure at ~100 AU resolution. Additional Band 3 archival
data provide low-$J$ HCN and SiO lines. These data are compared with the corresponding higher-$J$
lines from the PILS Band 7 data for excitation analysis. The HNC/HCN ratio is used as a temperature
tracer. Results: The low-$J$ transitions of HC$_3$N, HC$_5$N, HNC and N$_2$H$^+$ trace extended
and elongated structures from 6000 AU down to ~100 AU, without accompanying dust continuum emission.
Two structures are identified: one traces a flow that is likely accreting toward the most luminous
component of the system IRAS16293 A. Temperatures inferred from the HCN/HNC ratio suggest that
the gas in this flow is cold, between 10 and 30 K. The other structure is part of an UV-irradiated cavity
wall entrained by one of the outflows. The two outflows driven by IRAS16293 A present different molecular
gas distributions. Conclusions: Accretion of cold gas is seen from 6000 AU scales onto IRAS16293
A, but not onto source B, indicates that cloud core material accretion is competitive due to feedback
onto a dominant component in an embedded multiple protostellar system. The preferential delivery
of material could explain the higher luminosity and multiplicity of source A compared to source
B. The results of this work demonstrate that several different molecular species, and multiple
transitions of each species, are needed to confirm and characterize accretion flows in protostellar
cloud cores.

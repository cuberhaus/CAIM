Aims: The goal is to obtain a census of S-bearing species using interferometric images, towards
SVS13-A, a Class I object associated with a hot corino rich in interstellar complex organic molecules.
Methods: We used data at 3mm and 1.4mm obtained with IRAM-NOEMA in the framework of the Large Program
SOLIS. Results: We imaged the spatial distribution of the line emission of 32SO, 34SO, C32}S, C34S,
C33S, OCS, H2C32S, H2C34S, and NS. The low excitation (9 K) 32SO line is tracing the fast collimated
jet driven by the nearby SVS13-B. Conversely, the rest of the lines are confined in the inner SVS13-A
region, where complex organics have been previously imaged. The non-LTE LVG analysis of SO, SO2,
and H2CS indicates a hot corino origin (60-120 au). Temperatures between 50 K and 300 K, and volume
densities larger than 10^5 cm-3 have been derived. The abundances are in the following ranges: 0.3-6
10^-6 (CS), 7 10^-9} - 1 10^-7 (SO), 1-10 10^-7 (SO2), a few 10^-10 (H2CS and OCS), and 10^{-10} - 10^{-9}(NS).
The N(NS)/N(NS^+) ratio is larger than 10, supporting that the NS^+ ion is mainly formed in the extended
envelope. Conclusions: The [H2CS]/[H2CO] ratio increases with time (from Class 0 to Class II objects)
by more than one order of magnitude. This suggests that [S]/[O] changes along the Sun-like star forming
process. The estimate of the [S]/[H] budget in SVS13-A is 2%-17% of the Solar System value (1.8 10^-5),
being consistent with what was previously measured towards Class 0 objects (1%-8%). This supports
that the enrichment of the sulphuretted species with respect to dark clouds keeps constant from
the Class 0 to the Class I stages of low-mass star formation. The present findings stress the importance
of investigating the chemistry of star forming regions using large observational surveys as well
as sampling regions on a Solar System scale.

The X-ray source 4U 1822-371 is an eclipsing low-mass X-ray binary and X-ray pulsar, hosting a NS
that shows periodic pulsations in the X-ray band. The inclination angle of the system is so high that
in principle, it should be hard to observe both the direct thermal emission of the central object
and the reflection component of the spectrum because they are hidden by the outer edge of the accretion
disc. Assuming that the source accretes at the Eddington limit, we analysed non-simultaneous XMM-Newton
and NuSTAR observations and studied the average broadband spectrum, with the aim to investigate
the presence of a reflection component. No such component has been observed before in a high-inclination
source such as 4U 1822-371. We modelled the spectral emission of the source using two different reflection
models, Diskline plus Pexriv and the self-consistent model RfxConv. In our analysis, we find significant
evidence of a reflection component in the spectrum, in addition to two lines associated with neutral
or mildly ionised iron. The continuum spectrum is well fitted by a saturated Comptonisation model
and a thermal black-body component emitted by the accretion disc at a lower temperature. We updated
the ephemeris, adding two new eclipse times to the most recent ephemeris reported in literature.
In our proposed scenario, the source is accreting at the Eddington limit with an intrinsic luminosity
of $10^{38}$ erg/s, while the observed luminosity is two orders of magnitude lower. Despite the
high inclination, we find that a reflection component is required to fit residuals at the Fe line
range and the hard excess observed in the spectrum. The best-fit value of the inner disc radius is
still uncertain and model dependent. More observations are therefore needed to confirm these results,
which can give important information on this enigmatic and peculiar source.

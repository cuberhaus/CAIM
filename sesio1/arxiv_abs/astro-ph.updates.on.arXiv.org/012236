We investigate the properties of 232 optical spectroscopically selected groups from the Galaxy
And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey that overlap the XXL X-ray cluster survey. X-ray aperture flux measurements
combined with GAMA group data provides the largest available sample of optical groups with detailed
galaxy membership information and consistently measured X-ray fluxes and upper limits. 142 of
these groups are divided into three subsets based on the relative strength of X-ray and optical emission,
and we see a trend in galaxy properties between these subsets: X-ray overluminous groups contain
a lower fraction of both blue and star forming galaxies compared with X-ray underluminous systems.
X-ray overluminous groups also have a more dominant central galaxy, with a magnitude gap between
first and second ranked galaxies on average 0.22 mag larger than in underluminous groups. The central
galaxy in overluminous groups also lies closer to the centre of the group. We examine a number of other
structural properties of our groups, such as axis ratio, velocity dispersion, and group crossing
time and find trends with X-ray emission in some of these properties despite the high stochastic
noise from the limited number of group galaxies. We attribute the trends we see to the evolutionary
state of groups, with X-ray overluminous systems being more dynamically evolved than underluminous
groups. The X-ray overluminous groups have had more time to develop a luminous intragroup medium,
quench member galaxies, and build the mass of the central galaxy through mergers compared to underluminous
groups. However, a minority of X-ray underluminous groups have properties that suggest them to
be dynamically mature. The lack of hot gas in these systems cannot be accounted for by high star formation
efficiency, suggesting that high gas entropy resulting from feedback is the likely cause of their
weak X-ray emission.

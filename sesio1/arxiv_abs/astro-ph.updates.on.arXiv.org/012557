We present the first results from the HST Archival Legacy project "SKYSURF." As described in Windhorst
et al. 2022, SKYSURF utilizes the large HST archive to study the diffuse UV, optical, and near-IR
backgrounds and foregrounds in detail. Here we utilize SKYSURF's first sky-surface brightness
measurements to constrain the level of near-IR diffuse Extragalactic Background Light (EBL).
Our sky-surface brightness measurements have been verified to an accuracy of better than 1%, which
when combined with systematic errors associated with HST, results in sky brightness uncertainties
of $\sim$2-4% $\simeq$ 0.005 MJy/sr in each image. We put limits on the amount of diffuse EBL in three
near-IR filters (F125W, F140W, and F160W) by comparing our preliminary sky measurements of $> 30,000$
images to Zodiacal light models, carefully selecting the darkest images to avoid contamination
from stray light. In addition, we investigate the impact that instrumental thermal emission has
on our measurements, finding that it has a limited impact on F125W and F140W measurements, whereas
uncertainties in the exact thermal state of HST results in significant uncertainties in the level
of astrophysical diffuse light in F160W images. When compared to the Kelsall et al. (1998) Zodiacal
model, an isotropic diffuse background of $30$ nW m$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ remains, whereas using the
Wright (1998) Zodiacal model results in no discernible diffuse background. Based primarily on
uncertainties in the foreground model subtraction, we present limits on the amount of diffuse EBL
of 29 nW m$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$, 40 nW m$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$, and 29 nW m$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ for F125W, F140W,
and F160W respectively. While this light is generally isotropic, our modeling at this point does
not distinguish between a cosmological origin or a Solar System origin (such as a dim, diffuse, spherical
cloud of cometary dust).

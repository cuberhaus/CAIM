We use integral field spectroscopy from the PHANGS-MUSE survey, which resolves the ionised interstellar
medium at ${\sim}50$ pc resolution in 19 nearby spiral galaxies, to study the origin of the diffuse
ionised gas (DIG). We examine the physical conditions of the diffuse gas by first removing morphologically-defined
HII regions, and then binning the low-surface brightness areas to achieve significant detections
of the key nebular lines. A toy model for the leakage and propagation of ionising radiation from HII
regions is able to reproduce the observed distribution of H$\alpha$ in the DIG. Leaking radiation
from HII regions also explains the observed decrease of line ratios of low-ionisation species ([SII]/H$\alpha$,
[NII]/H$\alpha$ and [OI]/H$\alpha$) with increasing H$\alpha$ surface brightness ($\Sigma_{H\alpha}$).
Emission from hot low-mass evolved stars, however, is required to explain: (1) the enhanced low-ionisation
line ratios observed in the central regions of some galaxies; (2) the observed trends of a flat or
decreasing [OIII]/H$\beta$ with $\Sigma_{H\alpha}$; and (3) the offset of some DIG regions from
the locus of HII regions in the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagram, extending into the area
of low-ionisation (nuclear) emission-line regions [LI(N)ERs]. Hot low-mass evolved stars make
a small contribution to the energy budget of the DIG (2% of the galaxy-integrated H$\alpha$ emission),
but their harder spectra make them fundamental contributors to [OIII] emission. The DIG might result
from a superposition of two components, an energetically-dominant contribution from young stars
and a more diffuse background of harder ionising photons from old stars. This unified framework
bridges observations of the Milky Way DIG with LI(N)ER-like emission observed in nearby galaxy
bulges.

The probability density function (PDF) of the logarithmic density contrast, $s=\ln (\rho/\rho_0)$,
with gas density $\rho$ and mean density $\rho_0$, for hydrodynamical supersonic turbulence is
well-known to have significant signatures of intermittency that monotonically increase with
the turbulent Mach number, $\M$. By studying the mass- and volume-weighted $s$-PDF for an ensemble
of 16 sub- to trans-Alf\'venic mean-field, supersonic, isothermal turbulence simulations, relevant
to molecular gas in the cool interstellar medium, we show that a more intricate picture emerges for
the intermittency of $s$. Using four independent measures of the intermittency we find hydrodynamical-like
intermittency in the highly magnetised plasma for $\mathcal{M} \lesssim 4$. However, for $\mathcal{M}
\gtrsim 4$, the signatures of intermittency disappear, leaving approximately lognormal $s$-statistics
-- exactly the opposite of hydrodynamical turbulence in the high-$\mathcal{M}$ limit. To understand
the $\mathcal{M} \lesssim 4$ intermittency we use one-dimensional (1D) pencil beams to explore
the dynamics along and across the mean magnetic field, $\mathbf{B}_0$. We discuss kinetic, density
and magnetic field fluctuations from the pencil beams, and identify physical sources of intermittency
as single, strong shocks coupled to fast magnetosonic compressions that form along $\Bo$ and create
large, volume-poor under-densities. These under-densities contribute significantly to the
skewness of the $s$-PDF. We confirm this result independently using 1D fluid shock simulations.
We discuss the Gaussianisation of the $\mathcal{M} \gtrsim 4$ $s$-fields through the lens of two
phenomenologies: the self-similarity of the $s$-field and homogenisation of the dynamical timescales
between the over- and under-dense regions in the compressible gas.

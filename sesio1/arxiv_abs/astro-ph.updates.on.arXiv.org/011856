The light curves of tidally locked hot Jupiters transiting fast-rotating, early-type stars are
a rich source of information about both the planet and star, with full-phase coverage enabling a
detailed atmospheric characterisation of the planet. Although it is possible to determine the
true spin-orbit angle $\Psi$, a notoriously difficult parameter to measure, from any transit asymmetry
resulting from gravity darkening induced by the stellar rotation, the correlations that exist
between the transit parameters have led to large disagreements in published values of $\Psi$ for
some systems. We aimed to study these phenomena in the light curves of the ultra-hot Jupiter MASCARA-1
b. We obtained optical CHEOPS transit and occultation light curves of MASCARA-1 b, and analysed
them jointly with a Spitzer/IRAC 4.5 $\mu$m full-phase curve. When fitting the CHEOPS and Spitzer
transits together, the degeneracies are greatly diminished and return results consistent with
previously published Doppler tomography. Placing priors informed by the tomography achieves
even better precision, allowing a determination of $\Psi=72.1^{+2.5}_{-2.4}$ deg. From the occultations
and phase variations, we derived dayside and nightside temperatures of $3062^{+66}_{-68}$ K and
$1720\pm330$ K, respectively. In addition, we could separately derive geometric albedo $A_g=0.171^{+0.066}_{-0.068}$
and spherical albedo $A_s=0.266^{+0.097}_{-0.100}$ from the CHEOPS data, and Bond albedo $A_B=0.057^{+0.083}_{-0.101}$
from the Spitzer phase curve. Where possible, priors informed by Doppler tomography should be used
when fitting transits of fast-rotating stars, though multi-colour photometry may also unlock
an accurate measurement of $\Psi$. Our approach to modelling the phase variations at different
wavelengths provides a template for how to separate thermal emission from reflected light in spectrally
resolved JWST phase curves.

The interaction of jets in High-Mass X-ray Binaries (HMXBs) with the strong winds driven by the hot
companion star in the vicinity of the compact object is fundamental to understand the jet dynamics,
non-thermal emission and long-term stability. However, the role of the jet magnetic field in this
process is unclear. We study the dynamical role of weak and moderate-to-strong toroidal magnetic
fields during the first hundreds of seconds of jet propagation, focusing on the magnetized flow
dynamics and the mechanisms of energy conversion. We have developed the code L\'ostrego v1.0, a
new 3D RMHD code to simulate astrophysical plasmas in Cartesian coordinates. Using this tool, we
performed the first 3D RMHD numerical simulations of relativistic magnetized jets propagating
through the clumpy stellar wind in a HMXB. The overall morphology and dynamics of weakly magnetized
jet models is similar to previous hydrodynamical simulations, where the jet head generates a strong
shock in the ambient medium and the initial over-pressure with respect to the stellar wind drives
one or more recollimation shocks. In the time scales of our simulations, these jets are ballistic
and seem to be more stable against internal instabilities than jets with the same power in the absence
of fields. However, moderate-to-strong toroidal magnetic fields favour the development of current-driven
instabilities and the disruption of the jet within the binary. A detailed analysis of the energy
distribution in the relativistic outflow and the ambient medium reveals that both magnetic and
internal energies can contribute to the effective acceleration of the jet. We certify that the jet
feedback into the ambient medium is highly dependent on the jet energy distribution at injection,
where hotter, more dilute and/or more magnetized jets are more efficient, as anticipated by feedback
studies in the case of jets in active galaxies.

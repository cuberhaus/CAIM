The detection of Ly$\alpha$ nebulae around $z\gtrsim 6$ quasars provides evidence for extended
gas reservoirs around the first rapidly growing supermassive black holes. Observations of $z >
6$ quasars can be explained by cosmological models provided that the black holes by which they are
powered evolve in rare, massive dark matter haloes. Whether these theoretical models also explain
the observed extended Ly$\alpha$ emission remains an open question. We post-process a suite of
cosmological, radiation-hydrodynamic simulations targeting a quasar host halo at $z>6$ with
the Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer code RASCAS. A combination of recombination radiation from
photo-ionised hydrogen and emission from collisionally excited gas powers Ly$\alpha$ nebulae
with a surface brightness profile in close agreement with observations. We also find that, even
on its own, resonant scattering of the Ly$\alpha$ line associated to the quasar's broad line region
can also generate Ly$\alpha$ emission on $\sim 100 \, \rm kpc$ scales, resulting in comparable agreement
with observed surface brightness profiles. Even if powered by a broad quasar Ly$\alpha$ line, Ly$\alpha$
nebulae can have narrow line-widths $\lesssim 1000 \, \rm km \, s^{-1}$, consistent with observational
constraints. Even if there is no quasar, we find that halo gas cooling produces a faint, extended
Ly$\alpha$ glow. However, to light-up extended Ly$\alpha$ nebulae with properties in line with
observations, our simulations unambiguously require quasar-powered outflows to clear out the
galactic nucleus and allow the Ly$\alpha$ flux to escape and still remain resonant with halo gas.
The close match between observations and simulations with quasar outflows suggests that AGN feedback
already operates before $z \, = \, 6$ and confirms that high-$z$ quasars reside in massive haloes
tracing overdensities.

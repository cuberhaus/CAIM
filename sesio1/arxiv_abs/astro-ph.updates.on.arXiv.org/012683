Companions embedded in the cavities of transitional circumstellar disks have been observed to
exhibit excess luminosity at H$\alpha$, an indication that they are actively accreting. We report
5 years (2013-2018) of monitoring of the position and H$\alpha$ excess luminosity of the embedded,
accreting low-mass stellar companion HD 142527 B from the MagAO/VisAO instrument. We use pyklip,
a python implementation of the Karhounen-Loeve Image Processing algorithm, to detect the companion.
Using pyklip forward modeling, we constrain the relative astrometry to $1-2 \mathrm{mas}$ precision
and achieve sufficient photometric precision ($\pm0.2 \mathrm{mag}, 3\%$ error) to detect changes
in the H$\alpha$ contrast of the companion over time. In order to accurately determine the relative
astrometry of the companion, we conduct an astrometric calibration of the MagAO/VisAO camera against
20 years of Keck/NIRC2 images of the Trapezium cluster. We demonstrate agreement of our VisAO astrometry
with other published positions for HD 142527 B, and use orbitize! to generate a posterior distribution
of orbits fit to the relative astrometry of HD 142527 B. Our data suggest that the companion is close
to periastron passage, on an orbit significantly misinclined with respect to both the wide circumbinary
disk and the recently observed inner disk encircling HD 142527 A. We translate observed H-alpha
contrasts for HD 142527 B into mass accretion rate estimates on the order of $4-9\times10^{-10}
\mathrm{M_\odot}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. Photometric variation in the H-alpha excess of the companion
suggests that the accretion rate onto the companion is variable. This work represents a significant
step towards observing accretion-driven variability onto protoplanets, such as PDS 70 b\&c.

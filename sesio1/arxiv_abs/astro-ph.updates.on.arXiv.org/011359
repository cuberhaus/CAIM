We use ALMA observations of CO(2-1) in 13 massive ($M_{\star}\gtrsim 10^{11} M_{\odot}$) post-starburst
galaxies at $z\sim0.6$ to constrain the molecular gas content in galaxies shortly after they quench
their major star-forming episode. The post-starburst galaxies in this study are selected from
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopic samples (DR14) based on their spectral shapes, as part
of the SQuIGGLE program. Early results showed that two post-starburst galaxies host large H$_2$
reservoirs despite their low inferred star formation rates. Here we expand this analysis to a larger
statistical sample of 13 galaxies. Six of the primary targets (45%) are detected, with $M_{H_2}\gtrsim10^9
M_{\odot}$. Given their high stellar masses, this mass limit corresponds to an average gas fraction
of $\langle f_{H_2} \equiv M_{H_2}/M_{\star} \rangle \sim7\%$, or ${\sim}14\%$ using lower stellar
masses estimates derived from analytic, exponentially declining star formation histories. The
gas fraction correlates with the $D_n4000$ spectral index, suggesting that the cold gas reservoirs
decrease with time since burst, as found in local K+A galaxies. Star formation histories derived
from flexible stellar population synthesis modeling support this empirical finding: galaxies
that quenched $\lesssim 150$ Myr prior to observation host detectable CO(2-1) emission, while
older post-starburst galaxies are undetected. The large $\mathrm{H_2}$ reservoirs and low star
formation rates in the sample imply that the quenching of star formation precedes the disappearance
of the cold gas reservoirs. However, within the following 100-200 Myrs, the SQuIGGLE galaxies require
the additional and efficient heating or removal of cold gas to bring their low star formation rates
in line with standard $\mathrm{H_2}$ scaling relations.

We evaluate the potential for gravitational-wave (GW) detection in the frequency band from 10 nHz
to 1 $\mu$Hz using extremely high-precision astrometry of a small number of stars. In particular,
we argue that non-magnetic, photometrically stable hot white dwarfs (WD) located at $\sim$ kpc
distances may be optimal targets for this approach. Previous studies of astrometric GW detection
have focused on the potential for less precise surveys of large numbers of stars; our work provides
an alternative optimization approach to this problem. Interesting GW sources in this band are expected
at characteristic strains around $h_c \sim 10^{-17} \times \left(\mu\text{Hz}/f_{\text{GW}}\right)$.
The astrometric angular precision required to see these sources is $\Delta \theta \sim h_c$ after
integrating for a time $T \sim 1/f_{\text{GW}}$. We show that jitter in the photometric center of
WD of this type due to starspots is bounded to be small enough to permit this high-precision, small-$N$
approach. We discuss possible noise arising from stellar reflex motion induced by orbiting objects
and show how it can be mitigated. The only plausible technology able to achieve the requisite astrometric
precision is a space-based stellar interferometer. Such a future mission with few-meter-scale
collecting dishes and baselines of $\mathcal{O}(100\text{ km})$ is sufficient to achieve the
target precision. This collector size is broadly in line with the collectors proposed for some formation-flown,
space-based astrometer or optical synthetic-aperture imaging-array concepts proposed for other
science reasons. The proposed baseline is however somewhat larger than the km-scale baselines
discussed for those concepts, but we see no fundamental technical obstacle to utilizing such baselines.
A mission of this type thus also holds the promise of being one of the few ways to access interesting
GW sources in this band.

The advent of space-based photometry missions such as CoRoT, Kepler and TESS has sparkled the development
of asteroseismology and exoplanetology. The advent of PLATO will further strengthen such multi-disciplinary
studies. Testing asteroseismic modelling and its importance for our understanding of planetary
systems is crucial. We carried out a detailed modelling of Kepler-93, an exoplanet host star observed
by Kepler. This star is particularly interesting as it is very similar to the PLATO benchmark target
(G spectral type, ~ 6000K, ~ 1 Msun and ~ 1 Rsun) and provides a real-life testbed for potential procedures
to be used for PLATO. We use global and local minimization techniques for the seismic modelling of
Kepler-93, varying the ingredients of our stellar models. We compute seismic inversions of the
mean density. We use these revised stellar parameters to provide new planetary parameters and simulate
the orbital evolution of the system under the effects of tides and atmospheric evaporation. Our
fundamental parameters for Kepler-93: mean density = 1.654 +/- 0.004 g/cm3, M = 0.907 +/- 0.023 Msun
, R = 0.918 +/- 0.008 Rsun and Age = 6.78 +/- 0.32 Gyr. The uncertainties we report for this benchmark
are within the requirements of PLATO. For the exoplanet Kepler-93b, we find Mp = 4.01 +/- 0.67 Mearth,
Rp = 1.478 +/- 0.014 Rearth and semi-major axis a = 0.0533 +/- 0.0005 AU. According to our simulations,
it seems unlikely that Kepler-93b formed with a mass large enough to be impacted by stellar tides.
For the benchmark of PLATO, detailed asteroseismic modelling procedures will be able to provide
fundamental stellar parameters within the requirements. We illustrate what synergies can be achieved
regarding the orbital evolution and atmospheric evaporation of exoplanets. We note the importance
of the high-quality radial velocity follow-up to constrain the formation scenarii of exoplanets.

We performed a detailed, high-resolution spectroscopic analysis of HE 1005-1439 based on SUBARU/HDS
spectra with an R ~ 50000. Abundances of ten light elements from C through Ni and twelve heavy elements
Sr, Y, Ba, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Eu, Dy, Er, Hf, and Pb were determined. We also performed a parametric-model-based
analysis of the abundances of the heavy elements to understand the origin of the observed abundance
pattern. For the first time, we came across an object with a surface chemical composition that exhibits
contributions from both slow (s) and intermediate (i) neutron-capture nucleosynthesis. The observed
abundance pattern is unique and has never been observed in any CEMP stars. The star is found to be a
CEMP-s star based on the CEMP stars' classification criteria. However, the observed abundance
pattern could not be explained based on theoretical s-process model predictions. On the contrary,
our parametric-model based analysis clearly indicates its surface chemical composition being
influenced by similar contributions from both the s- and i-process. We critically examined the
observed abundances and carefully investigated the formation scenarios involving s-process
and i-process that are available in literature, and we found that none of them could explain the observed
abundances. We note that the variation we see in our radial velocity estimates obtained from several
epochs may indicate the presence of a binary companion. Considering a binary system, we, therefore,
propose a formation scenario for this object involving effective proton ingestion episodes (PIEs)
triggering i-process nucleosynthesis followed by s-process asymptotic giant branch (AGB) nucleosynthesis
with a few third-dredge-up (TDU) episodes in the now extinct companion AGB star. Results obtained
from the parametric-model-based analysis are discussed in light of existing stellar evolutionary
models.

Submillimeter/millimeter observations of dusty star-forming galaxies with the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) have shown that dust continuum emission generally occurs
in compact regions smaller than the stellar distribution. However, it remains to be understood
how systematic these findings are. Studies often lack homogeneity in the sample selection, target
discontinuous areas with inhomogeneous sensitivities, and suffer from modest $uv$ coverage coming
from single array configurations. GOODS-ALMA is a 1.1mm galaxy survey over a continuous area of
72.42arcmin$^2$ at a homogeneous sensitivity. In this version 2.0, we present a new low resolution
dataset and its combination with the previous high resolution dataset from the survey, improving
the $uv$ coverage and sensitivity reaching an average of $\sigma = 68.4\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$. A total
of 88 galaxies are detected in a blind search (compared to 35 in the high resolution dataset alone),
50% at $S/N_{peak} \geq 5$ and 50% at $3.5 \leq S/N_{peak} \leq 5$ aided by priors. Among them, 13 out
of the 88 are optically dark or faint sources ($H$- or $K$-band dropouts). The sample dust continuum
sizes at 1.1mm are generally compact, with a median effective radius of $R_{e} = 0"10 \pm 0"05$ (a
physical size of $R_{e} = 0.73 \pm 0.29$kpc at the redshift of each source). Dust continuum sizes
evolve with redshift and stellar mass resembling the trends of the stellar sizes measured at optical
wavelengths, albeit a lower normalization compared to those of late-type galaxies. We conclude
that for sources with flux densities $S_{1.1mm} > 1$mJy, compact dust continuum emission at 1.1mm
prevails, and sizes as extended as typical star-forming stellar disks are rare. The $S_{1.1mm}
< 1$mJy sources appear slightly more extended at 1.1mm, although they are still generally compact
below the sizes of typical star-forming stellar disks.

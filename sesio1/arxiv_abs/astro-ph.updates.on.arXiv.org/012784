Cosmological probes at any redshift are necessary to reconstruct consistently the cosmic history.
Studying properly the tension on the Hubble constant, $H_0$, obtained by Supernovae Type Ia (SNe
Ia) and the Planck measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation would require complete
samples of distance indicators at any epoch. Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are necessary for the aforementioned
task because of their huge luminosity that allows us to extend the cosmic ladder at very high redshifts.
However, using GRBs alone as standard candles is challenging because their luminosity varies widely.
To this end, we choose a reliable correlation for GRBs with a very small intrinsic scatter: the so-called
fundamental plane correlation for GRB afterglows corrected for selection biases and redshift
evolution. We choose a well-defined sample: the platinum sample, composed of 50 Long GRBs. To further
constrain cosmological parameters, we use Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) given their reliability
as standard rulers. Thus, we have applied GRBs, SNe Ia, and BAOs in a binned analysis in redshifts
so that GRBs' contribution is fully included in the last redshift bin, which reaches $z=5$. We use
the fundamental plane correlation together with SNe Ia and BAOs, to constrain $H_0$ and the density
matter today, $\Omega_{M}$. This methodology allows us to assess the role of GRBs combined with
SNe Ia and BAOs. We have obtained results for $H_0$ and $\Omega_{M}$ using GRBs+ SNe Ia+BAOs with
better precision than the SNe Ia alone for every bin, thus confirming the beneficial role of BAOs
and GRBs added together. In addition, consistent results between GRBs+ SNe Ia +BAOs are obtained
when compared with the SNe Ia +BAOs, showing the importance of GRBs since the distance ladder is extended
up to $z=5$ with a similar precision obtained with other probes without including the GRBs.

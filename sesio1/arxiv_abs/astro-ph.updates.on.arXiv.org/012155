FRB180301 is one of the most actively repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) which has shown polarization
angle changes in its radio burst emission, an indication for their likely origin in the magnetosphere
of a highly-magnetized neutron star. We carried out a multi-wavelength campaign with the FAST radio
telescope and NICER X-ray observatory to investigate any possible X-ray emission temporally coincident
with the bright radio bursts. The observations took place on 2021 March 4, 9 and 19. We detected five
bright radio bursts with FAST, four of which were strictly simultaneous with the NICER observations.
The peak flux-density of the radio bursts ranged between $28-105$ mJy, the burst fluence between
$27-170$ mJy-ms, and the burst durations between $1.7-12.3$ ms. The radio bursts from FRB~180301
exhibited complex time domain structure, and sub-pulses were detected in individual bursts, with
no significant circular polarisation. The linear degree of polarisation in L-band reduced significantly
compared to the 2019 observations. We do not detect any X-ray emission in excess of the background
during the 5ms, 10ms, 100ms, 1sec and 100sec time intervals at/around the radio-burst barycenter-corrected
arrival times, at a $>5\sigma$ confidence level. The $5\sigma$ upper limits on the X-ray a) persistent
flux is $<7.64\times 10^{-12}\, \rm erg\, cm^{-2}\, s^{-1}$ , equivalent to $L_{\rm X}<2.50 \times
10^{45} \rm erg\, s^{-1}$ and b) 5 ms fluence is $<2\times 10^{-11} \rm erg\, cm^{-2}$, at the radio
burst regions. Using the $5$ ms X-ray fluence upper limit, we can estimate the radio efficiency $\eta_{R/X}
\equiv L_{\rm Radio}/L_{\rm X-ray} \gtrsim 10^{-8}$. The derived upper limit on $\eta_{R/X}$
is consistent with both magnetospheric models and synchrotron maser models involving relativistic
shocks.

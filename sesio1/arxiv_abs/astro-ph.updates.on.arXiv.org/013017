(abridged) Spectroscopic observations of high-redshift galaxies slowly reveal the same complexity
of the interstellar medium (ISM) as expected from resolved observations in nearby galaxies. While
providing a wealth of diagnostics, such high-z spectra are often unresolved, and inferring reliable
diagnostics represents a major obstacle. Bright, nearby, unresolved galaxies provide many constraints
to design methods to infer ISM properties, but they have so far been limited to deterministic methods
and/or with simple topological assumptions. Multicomponent ISM models associate a complex enough
distribution of matter and phases with a simple enough topological description to be constrained
with probabilistic frameworks. Our goal is to provide a flexible statistical framework that is
agnostic to the model grid and that considers either a few discrete components defined by their parameter
values and/or statistical distributions of parameters. In this study we present a the MULTIGRIS
framework and use it to model a suite of spectral lines in the star-forming regions of the metal-poor
dwarf galaxy IZw18. We are able to calculate accurate values for the metallicity, number of ionizing
photons, masses of ionized and neutral hydrogen, as well as the dust mass and the dust-to-gas mass
ratio. We find a relatively modest amount of H$_2$ which is predominantly CO-dark and traced by C$^+$
rather than C$^0$. Nevertheless, more than $90$% of the [CII] emission is associated with the neutral
atomic gas. Our models confirm the necessity to consider an X-ray source. Finally, we investigate
the escape fraction of ionizing photons for different energy ranges. While the escape fraction
for the main HII region lies around $50-65$%, we show that most of the soft X-ray photons are able to
escape and may play a role in the ionization and heating of the circumgalactic or intergalactic medium.

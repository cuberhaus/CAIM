Context: As a result of Titan's migration and Saturn's probable capture in secular spin-orbit resonance,
recent works show that Saturn's obliquity could be steadily increasing today and may reach large
values in the next billions of years. Satellites around high-obliquity planets are known to be unstable
near their Laplace radius, but the approximations used so far are invalidated in this regime. Aims:
We aim to investigate the behaviour of a planet and its satellite when the satellite crosses its Laplace
radius while the planet is locked in secular spin-orbit resonance. Methods: We expand on previous
works and revisit the concept of Laplace surface. We use it to build an averaged analytical model
that couples the planetary spin-axis and satellite dynamics. Results: We show that the dynamics
is organised around a critical point, S1, at which the phase-space structure is singular, located
at 90{\deg} obliquity and near the Laplace radius. If the spin-axis precession rate of the planet
is maintained fixed by a resonance while the satellite migrates outwards or inwards, then S1 acts
as an attractor towards which the system is forced to evolve. When it reaches the vicinity of S1, the
entire system breaks down, either because the planet is expelled from the resonance or because the
satellite is ejected or collides into the planet. Conclusions: Provided that Titan's migration
is not halted in the future, Titan and Saturn may reach instability between a few gigayears and several
tens of gigayears from now, depending on Titan's migration rate. The evolution would destabilise
Titan and drive Saturn towards an obliquity of 90{\deg}. Our findings may have important consequences
for Uranus. They also provide a straightforward mechanism for producing transiting exoplanets
with a face-on massive ring, a configuration that is often put forward to explain some super-puff
exoplanets.

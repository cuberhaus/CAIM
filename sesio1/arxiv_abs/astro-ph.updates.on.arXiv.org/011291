Vela X-1 is a runaway X-ray binary system hosting a massive donor star, whose strong stellar wind
creates a bow shock as it interacts with the interstellar medium. This bow shock has previously been
detected in H$\alpha$ and IR, but, similar to all but one bow shock from a massive runaway star (BD+43$^{\rm
o}$3654), has escaped detection in other wavebands. We report on the discovery of $1.3$ GHz radio
emission from the Vela X-1 bow shock with the MeerKAT telescope. The MeerKAT observations reveal
how the radio emission closely traces the H$\alpha$ line emission, both in the bow shock and in the
larger-scale diffuse structures known from existing H$\alpha$ surveys. The Vela X-1 bow shock
is the first stellar-wind-driven radio bow shock detected around an X-ray binary. In the absence
of a radio spectral index measurement, we explore other avenues to constrain the radio emission
mechanism. We find that thermal/free-free emission can account for the radio and H$\alpha$ properties,
for a combination of electron temperature and density consistent with earlier estimates of ISM
density and the shock enhancement. In this explanation, the presence of a local ISM over-density
is essential for the detection of radio emission. Alternatively, we consider a non-thermal/synchrotron
scenario, evaluating the magnetic field and broad-band spectrum of the shock. However, we find
that exceptionally high fractions ($\gtrsim 13$%) of the kinetic wind power would need to be injected
into the relativistic electron population to explain the radio emission. Assuming lower fractions
implies a hybrid scenario, dominated by free-free radio emission. Finally, we speculate about
the detectability of radio bow shocks and whether it requires exceptional ISM or stellar wind properties.

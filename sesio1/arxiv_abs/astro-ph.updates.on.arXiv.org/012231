We study the inner structure of the group-scale lens CASSOWARY 31 (CSWA 31) by adopting both strong
lensing and dynamical modeling. CSWA 31 is a peculiar lens system. The brightest group galaxy (BGG)
is an ultra-massive elliptical galaxy at z = 0.683 with a weighted mean velocity dispersion of $\sigma
= 432 \pm 31$ km s$^{-1}$. It is surrounded by group members and several lensed arcs probing up to ~150
kpc in projection. Our results significantly improve previous analyses of CSWA 31 thanks to the
new HST imaging and MUSE integral-field spectroscopy. From the secure identification of five sets
of multiple images and measurements of the spatially-resolved stellar kinematics of the BGG, we
conduct a detailed analysis of the multi-scale mass distribution using various modeling approaches,
both in the single and multiple lens-plane scenarios. Our best-fit mass models reproduce the positions
of multiple images and provide robust reconstructions for two background galaxies at z = 1.4869
and z = 2.763. The relative contributions from the BGG and group-scale halo are remarkably consistent
in our three reference models, demonstrating the self-consistency between strong lensing analyses
based on image position and extended image modeling. We find that the ultra-massive BGG dominates
the projected total mass profiles within 20 kpc, while the group-scale halo dominates at larger
radii. The total projected mass enclosed within $R_{eff}$ = 27.2 kpc is $1.10_{-0.04}^{+0.02}
\times 10^{13}$ M$_\odot$. We find that CSWA 31 is a peculiar fossil group, strongly dark-matter
dominated towards the central region, and with a projected total mass profile similar to higher-mass
cluster-scale halos. The total mass-density slope within the effective radius is shallower than
isothermal, consistent with previous analyses of early-type galaxies in overdense environments.

Transition disks with small inner dust cavities are interesting targets for the study of disk clearing
mechanisms. Such disks have been identified through a deficit in the infrared part of their SED,
but spatially resolved millimeter imaging is required to confirm the presence of an inner dust cavity.
We use high-resolution ALMA observations of 30 mas resolution in Band 6 continuum and $^{12}$CO
2--1 emission of 10 transition disk candidates in the Lupus star forming region, in order to confirm
the presence of inner dust cavities and infer the responsible mechanism. The continuum data are
analyzed using visibility modeling and the SEDs are compared with radiative transfer models. Out
of the six transition disk candidates selected from their SED, only one disk revealed an inner dust
cavity of 4 au in radius. Three of the other disks are highly inclined, which limits the detectability
of an inner dust cavity but it is also demonstrated to be the possible cause for the infrared deficit
in their SED. The two remaining SED-selected disks are very compact, with dust radii of only $\sim$3
au. From the four candidates selected from low-resolution images, three new transition disks with
large inner cavities $>$20 au are identified, bringing the total number of transition disks with
large cavities in Lupus to 13. SED-selected transition disks with small cavities are biased towards
highly inclined and compact disks, which casts doubt on the use of their occurrence rates in estimating
dispersal timescales of photoevaporation. Using newly derived disk dust masses and radii, we re-evaluate
the size-luminosity and $M_{\rm dust}-M_{\rm star}$ relations. These relations can be understood
if the bright disks are dominated by disks with substructure whereas faint disks are dominated by
drift-dominated disks. (Abridged)

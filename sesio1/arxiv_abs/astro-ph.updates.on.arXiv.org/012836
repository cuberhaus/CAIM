We present APEX, infrared and radio continuum observations of the G345.88-1.10 hub filament system
which is a newly discovered star-forming cloud that hosts an unusually bright bipolar infrared
nebulosity at its centre. At a distance of 2.26$^{+0.30}_{-0.21}$ kpc, G345.88-1.10 exhibits
a network of parsec-long converging filaments. At the junction of these filaments lie four infrared-quiet
fragments. The densest fragment (with M=210 M$_{\odot}$, R$_{\rm{eff}}=0.14$ pc) sits at the
centre of a wide (opening angle of $\sim$ 90$\pm$15$^{o}$) bipolar nebulosity. $^{12}$CO(2-1)
observations show that these infrared-bright nebulosities are spatially associated with a powerful
molecular outflow from the central fragment. Negligible radio continuum and no H30$\alpha$ emission
is detected towards the cavities, seemingly excluding that ionising radiation drives the evolution
of the cavities. Furthermore, radiative transfer simulations are unable to reproduce the observed
combination of a low-luminosity ($\lesssim$ 500 L$_{\odot}$) central source and a surrounding
high-luminosity ($\sim 4000$ L$_{\odot}$) mid-infrared-bright bipolar cavity. This suggests
that radiative heating from a central protostar cannot be responsible for the illumination of the
outflow cavities. To our knowledge, this is the first reported object of this type. The rarity of
objects like G345.88-1.10 is likely related to a very short phase in the massive star and/or cluster
formation process that was so far unidentified. We discuss whether mechanical energy deposition
by one episode or successive episodes of powerful mass accretion in a collapsing hub might explain
the observations. While promising in some aspects, a fully coherent scenario that explains the
presence of a luminous bipolar cavity centred on an infrared-dark fragment remains elusive at this
point.

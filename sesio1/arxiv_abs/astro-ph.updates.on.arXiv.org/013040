The miniJPAS is a 1 deg$^2$ survey that uses the Javalambre-Physics of the Accelerating Universe
Astrophysical Survey (J-PAS) filter system (54 narrow-band filters) with the Pathfinder camera.
We study mJPC2470-1771, the most massive cluster detected in miniJPAS. We study the stellar population
properties of the members, their star formation rates (SFR), star formation histories (SFH), the
emission line galaxy (ELG) population, their spatial distribution, and the effect of the environment
on them, showing the power of J-PAS to study the role of environment in galaxy evolution. We use a spectral
energy distribution (SED) fitting code to derive the stellar population properties of the galaxy
members: stellar mass, extinction, metallicity, colours, ages, SFH (a delayed-$\tau$ model),
and SFRs. Artificial Neural Networks are used for the identification of the ELG population through
the detection of H$\alpha$, [NII], H$\beta$, and [OIII] nebular emission. We use the WHAN and BPT
diagrams to separate them into star-forming galaxies and AGNs. We find that the fraction of red galaxies
increases with the cluster-centric radius. We select 49 ELG, 65.3\% of the them are probably star
forming galaxies, and they are dominated by blue galaxies. 24% are likely to host an AGN (Seyfert
or LINER galaxies). The rest are difficult to classify and are most likely composite galaxies. Our
results are compatible with an scenario where galaxy members were formed roughly at the same epoch,
but blue galaxies have had more recent star formation episodes, and they are quenching from inside-out
of the cluster centre. The spatial distribution of red galaxies and their properties suggest that
they were quenched prior to the cluster accretion or an earlier cluster accretion epoch. AGN feedback
and/or mass might also be intervening in the quenching of these galaxies.

The processes of star formation and feedback, which regulate the cycle of matter between gas and
stars on the scales of giant molecular clouds (GMCs; $\sim$100pc), play a major role in governing
galaxy evolution. Measuring the time-scales of GMC evolution is important to identify and characterise
the specific physical mechanisms that drive this transition. By applying a robust statistical
method to high-resolution CO and narrow-band H$\alpha$ imaging from the PHANGS survey, we systematically
measure the evolutionary timeline from molecular clouds to exposed young stellar regions on GMC
scales, across an unprecedented sample of 54 star-forming main-sequence galaxies. We find that
clouds live for about $1{-}3$ GMC turbulence crossing times ($5{-}30$Myr) and are efficiently
dispersed by stellar feedback within $1{-}5$Myr once the star-forming region becomes partially
exposed, resulting in integrated star formation efficiencies of $1{-}8$%. These ranges reflect
physical galaxy-to-galaxy variation. In order to evaluate whether galactic environment influences
GMC evolution, we correlate our measurements with average properties of the GMCs and their local
galactic environment. We find several strong correlations that can be physically understood,
revealing a quantitative link between galactic-scale environmental properties and the small-scale
GMC evolution. Notably, the measured CO-visible cloud lifetimes become shorter with decreasing
galaxy mass, most likely due to the increasing presence of CO-dark molecular gas in such environment.
Our results represent a first step towards a comprehensive picture of cloud assembly and dispersal,
which will further require extension and refinement with tracers of the atomic gas, dust, and deeply-embedded
stellar populations.

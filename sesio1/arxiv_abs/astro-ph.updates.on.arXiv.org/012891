The ultra-relativistic outflows powering gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) acquire angular structure
through their interaction with external material. They are often characterized by a compact, nearly
uniform narrow core (with half-opening angle $\theta_{c,\{\epsilon,\Gamma\}}$) surrounded
by material with energy per unit solid angle ($\epsilon=\epsilon_c\Theta_{\epsilon}^{-a}$,
where $\Theta_{\{\epsilon,\Gamma\}}=[1+\theta^2/\theta_{c,\{\epsilon,\Gamma\}}^2]^{1/2}$)
and initial specific kinetic energy ($\Gamma_0-1=[\Gamma_c-1]\Theta_\Gamma^{-b}$) declining
as power laws. Multi-wavelength afterglow lightcurves of off-axis jets (with viewing angle $\theta_{\rm
obs} > \theta_c$) offer robust ways to constrain $a$, $b$ and the external density radial profile
($\rho\propto R^{-k}$), even while other burst parameters may remain highly degenerate. We extend
our previous work on such afterglows to include more realistic angular structure profiles derived
from three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of both long and short GRBs (addressing also
jets with shallow angular energy profiles, whose emission exhibits unique evolution). We present
afterglow lightcurves based on our parameterized power-law jet angular profiles for different
viewing angles $\theta_{\rm obs}$ and $k=\{0,1,2\}$. We identify a unique evolutionary power-law
phase of the characteristic synchrotron frequencies ($\nu_m$ and $\nu_c$) that manifests when
the lightcurve is dominated by emission sensitive to the angular structure of the outflow. We calculate
the criterion for obtaining single or double peaked light-curves in the general case when $\theta_{c,\Gamma}\neq\theta_{c,\epsilon}$.
We emphasize how the shape of the lightcurve and the temporal evolution of $\nu_m$ and $\nu_c$ can
be used to constrain the outflow structure and potentially distinguish between magnetic and hydrodynamic
jets.

We wish to measure the cool star rotation period distribution for the Pleiades-age rich open cluster
NGC 2516 and use it to determine whether cluster-to-cluster variations exist in otherwise identical
open clusters. We obtained 42 d-long time-series CCD photometry of NGC 2516 using the Yale 1 m telescope
at CTIO and performed a number of related analyses, including PSF-based time-series photometry.
Our data are complemented with additional information from several photometric datasets, literature
radial velocities, and Gaia DR2 astrometry. All available data are used to construct an integrated
membership list for NGC 2516, containing 844 stars in our 1deg FoV. We derived 308 rotation periods
for late-F to mid-M cluster members from our photometry. We identified an additional 247 periodic
M dwarf stars from a prior study as cluster members, and used these to construct a 555-star rotation
period distribution for NGC 2516. We find a group of slowly rotating M dwarfs (10d<P<23d), forming
a branch in the colour-period diagram which we call the 'extended slow rotator sequence'. This,
and other features of the rotational distribution can also be found in the Pleiades, making the colour-period
diagrams of the two clusters nearly indistinguishable. We demonstrate the existence of a representative
ZAMS rotational distribution and provide a simple colour-independent way to represent it. We perform
a detailed comparison of the NGC 2516 rotation period data with a number of recent rotational evolution
models. Using X-ray data from the literature, we also construct the first rotation-activity diagram
for solar-type stars in NGC 2516. The two clusters NGC 2516 and Pleiades can be considered twins in
terms of stellar rotation and related properties, suggesting that otherwise identical open clusters
also have intrinsically similar cool star rotation and activity distributions. (Abridged)

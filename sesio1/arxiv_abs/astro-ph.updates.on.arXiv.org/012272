We present theoretical mass estimates of $^{26}$Al and $^{60}$Fe throughout the Galaxy, performed
with a numerical chemical evolution model including detailed nucleosynthesis prescriptions
for both stable and radioactive nuclides. We compared the results for several sets of stellar yields
taken from the literature, either for massive, low and intermediate mass stars, nova systems (only
for $^{26}$Al) and supernovae Type Ia, and then computed the total masses of $^{26}$Al and $^{60}$Fe
in the Galaxy. In particular, we have studied the bulge and the disc of the Galaxy in a galactocentric
radius range between 0 and 22 kpc. We have assumed that the bulge (between 0 and 2 kpc) evolved quickly
suffering a strong burst of star formation, while the disc formed more slowly and inside-out, in
agreement with previous works, which reproduced the majority of observational constraints. We
have compared our results with the $^{26}$Al mass observed by the $\gamma$-ray surveys COMPTEL
and INTEGRAL, in order to select the best model. Concerning $^{60}$Fe, for which we do not have any
observed mass value, we have just predicted its mass to provide a theoretical prediction to be confirmed
or disproved by future observations. We have found that low and intermediate mass stars as well as
Type Ia supernovae contribute negligibly to the two isotopes, while massive stars are the dominant
source. The contribution from novae is, however, necessary to reproduce the observed mass of $^{26}$Al,
and this is a new result. Our best model predicts $2.12$ M$_{\odot}$ of $^{26}$Al, in agreement with
observations, while for $^{60}$Fe our best mass estimate is around $\sim 1.05$ M$_{\odot}$. We
have also predicted the present rate of injection of $^{26}$Al and $^{60}$Fe in the Galaxy and compared
it with previous results, and we have predicted a larger present time injection rate along the disc,
relative to previous works.

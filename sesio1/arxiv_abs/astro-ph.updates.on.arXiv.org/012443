Gaia-CRF3 is the celestial reference frame for positions and proper motions in the third release
of data from the Gaia mission, Gaia DR3 (and for the early third release, Gaia EDR3, which contains
identical astrometric results). The reference frame is defined by the positions and proper motions
at epoch 2016.0 for a specific set of extragalactic sources in the (E)DR3 catalogue. We describe
the construction of Gaia-CRF3, and its properties in terms of the distributions in magnitude, colour,
and astrometric quality. Compact extragalactic sources in Gaia DR3 were identified by positional
cross-matching with 17 external catalogues of quasars (QSO) and active galactic nuclei (AGN),
followed by astrometric filtering designed to remove stellar contaminants. Selecting a clean
sample was favoured over including a higher number of extragalactic sources. For the final sample,
the random and systematic errors in the proper motions are analysed, as well as the radio-optical
offsets in position for sources in the third realisation of the International Celestial Reference
Frame (ICRF3). The Gaia-CRF3 comprises about 1.6 million QSO-like sources, of which 1.2 million
have five-parameter astrometric solutions in Gaia DR3 and 0.4 million have six-parameter solutions.
The sources span the magnitude range G = 13 to 21 with a peak density at 20.6 mag, at which the typical
positional uncertainty is about 1 mas. The proper motions show systematic errors on the level of
12 ${\mu}$as yr${}^{-1}$ on angular scales greater than 15 deg. For the 3142 optical counterparts
of ICRF3 sources in the S/X frequency bands, the median offset from the radio positions is about 0.5
mas, but exceeds 4 mas in either coordinate for 127 sources. We outline the future of the Gaia-CRF
in the next Gaia data releases.

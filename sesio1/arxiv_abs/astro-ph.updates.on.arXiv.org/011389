Context. The formation processes of massive stars are still unclear but a picture is emerging involving
accretion disks and molecular outflows in what appears to be a scaled-up version of low-mass star
formation. A census of outflow activity towards massive star-forming clumps in various evolutionary
stages has the potential to shed light on massive star formation (MSF). Aims. We conducted an outflow
survey towards ATLASGAL clumps using SEDIGISM data and aimed to obtain a large sample of clumps exhibiting
outflows in different evolutionary stages. Methods. We identify the high-velocity wings of the
13CO lines toward ATLASGAL clumps by (1) extracting the simultaneously observed 13CO and C18O spectra
from SEDIGISM, and (2) subtracting Gaussian fits to the scaled C18O from the 13CO, line after considering
opacity broadening. Results. We have detected high-velocity gas towards 1192 clumps out of a total
sample of 2052, giving an overall detection rate of 58%. Outflow activity has been detected in the
earliest quiescent clumps (i.e., 70$\mu$m weak), to the most evolved HII region stages i.e., 8$\mu$m
bright with MSF tracers. The detection rate increases as a function of evolution (quiescent=51%,
protostellar=47%, YSO=57%, UCHII regions=76%). Conclusion. Our sample is the largest outflow
sample identified so far. The high-detection rate from this large sample is consistent with previous
results and supports that outflows are a ubiquitous feature of MSF. The lower detection rate in early
evolutionary stages may be due to that outflows in the early stages are weak and difficult to detect.
We obtain a statistically significant sample of outflow clumps for every evolutionary stage, especially
for outflow clumps in the 70$\mu$m dark stage. This suggests that the absence of 70$\mu$m emission
is not a robust indicator of starless/pre-stellar cores.

The XMM Cluster Survey (XCS) have developed a new Python module, X-ray: Generate and Analyse (XGA)
to provide interactive and automated analyses of X-ray emitting sources observed by the XMM-Newton
space telescope. XGA only requires that a set of cleaned, processed, event lists has been created,
and (optionally) that a source detector has generated region lists for the observations. XGA is
centered around the concept of making all available data easily accessible and analysable. The
user provides information (e.g. RA, Dec, redshift) on the source they wish to investigate, and XGA
locates relevant observations and generates required data products. This allows the user to quickly
and easily complete common analyses using all relevant observations, thus being left free to focus
on extracting the maximum scientific gain. XGA is centered around source and sample classes, which
represent different types of X-ray emitting astrophysical objects and have different properties
and methods relevant to that type of object. XGA also contains product classes, which provide interfaces
to X-ray data products or information (such as radial profiles) that have been derived from them,
with built-in methods for fitting, analysis, and visualisation. XGA can fit models to spectra (both
global and annular) with XSPEC, measuring spectral properties such as temperature, photon index,
and luminosity. XGA can also measure radial profiles of density and temperature for galaxy clusters,
allowing the measurement of gas and total mass profiles of galaxy clusters. In the future, we will
add support for X-ray telescopes other than XMM (e.g. Chandra, eROSITA), as well as the ability to
perform multi-mission joint analyses. With the advent of new X-ray observatories such as eROSITA,
XRISM, ATHENA, and Lynx, it is the perfect time for a new, open-source, software package that is open
for anyone to use and scrutinise.

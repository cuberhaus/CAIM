Aims. This study aims to explore the relationship between the physical properties of different
galaxy subclasses and their environment based on the analysis of 31 631 VIMOS Public Extragalactic
Redshift Survey (VIPERS) galaxies observed at 0.5 < z < 0.9. Methods. We use the results of an unsupervised
clustering algorithm to distinguish 11 subclasses of VIPERS galaxies based on the multi-dimensional
feature space defined by rest-frame UV to NIR colours presented in Siudek et al (2018a). We investigate
the relationship between the properties of these subclasses of galaxies and their local environment,
defined as the galaxy density contrast derived from the 5th nearest neighbour technique. Results.
We confirm that the galaxy population-density relation is already in place at z ~ 0.9, with the blue
galaxy fraction decreasing with density, compensated by an increase of the red fraction. On average
red galaxies in the high-density environment are larger by 28% than the ones in low-density environments.
In particular, we find one group of galaxies, subclass C3, whose increase of size with time can be
explained mainly as the result of mergers; for other red subclasses, mergers would not seem to play
a major role (subclass C2) or play a negligible role (subclass C1). The properties of the green galaxies
(subclasses C4-6) depend on whether their stellar mass is above or below a transition mass. Low-mass
green galaxies appear to have grown through secular processes, while in high-mass green galaxies
mass assembly appears to be dominated by mergers. When it comes to blue galaxies, the trend of decreasing
fraction with denser environments seen for the group as a whole (subclasses C7-11) is found to be
driven mostly by one group of galaxies, subclass C10. These are compact low-mass galaxies with high
sSFRs, that are preferentially found in low-density environments.

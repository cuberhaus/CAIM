The second catalogue of Planck Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) sources, hereafter PSZ2, represents the
largest galaxy cluster sample selected by means of their SZ signature in a full-sky survey. Using
telescopes at the Canary Island observatories, we conducted the long-term observational program
128- MULTIPLE-16/15B (hereafter LP15), a large and complete optical follow-up campaign of all
the unidentified PSZ2 sources in the northern sky, with declinations above $-15^\circ$ and no correspondence
in the first Planck catalogue PSZ1. This paper is the third and last in the series of LP15 results,
after Streblyanska et al. (2019) and Aguado-Barahona et al. (2019), and presents all the spectroscopic
observations of the full program. We complement these LP15 spectroscopic results with Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS) archival data and other observations from a previous program (ITP13-08), and
present a catalog of 388 clusters and groups of galaxies including estimates of their velocity dispersion.
The majority of them (356) are the optical counterpart of a PSZ2 source. A subset of 297 of those clusters
is used to construct the $M_{\rm SZ}-M_{\rm dyn}$ scaling relation, based on the estimated SZ mass
from Planck measurements and our dynamical mass estimates. We discuss and correct for different
statistical and physical biases in the estimation of the masses, such as the Eddington bias when
estimating $M_{SZ}$ and the aperture and the number of galaxies used to calculate $M_{dyn}$. The
SZ-to-dynamical mass ratio for those 297 PSZ2 clusters is $(1-B) = 0.80\pm0.04$ (stat) $\pm 0.05$
(sys), with only marginal evidence for a possible mass dependence of this factor. Our value is consistent
with previous results in the literature, but presents a significantly smaller uncertainty due
to the use of the largest sample size for this type of studies.

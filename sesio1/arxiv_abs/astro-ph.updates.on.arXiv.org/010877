We analyzed the surface of Vesta at visible wavelengths, using the data of the Visible and InfraRed
mapping spectrometer (VIR) on board the Dawn spacecraft. We mapped the variations of various spectral
parameters on the entire surface of the asteroid, and also derived a map of the lithology. We took
advantage of the recent corrected VIR visible data to map the radiance factor at 550 nm, three color
composites, two spectral slopes, and a band area parameter relative to the 930 nm crystal field signature
in pyroxene. Using the howardite-eucrite-diogenite (HED) meteorites data as a reference, we derived
the lithology of Vesta using the variations of the 930 nm and 506 nm (spin-forbidden) band centers
observed in the VIR dataset. Our spectral parameters highlight a significant spectral diversity
at the surface of Vesta. This diversity is mainly evidenced by impact craters and illustrates the
heterogeneous subsurface and upper crust of Vesta. Impact craters also participate directly in
this spectral diversity by bringing dark exogenous material to an almost entire hemisphere. Our
derived lithology agrees with previous results obtained using a combination of infrared and visible
data. We therefore demonstrate that it is possible to obtain crucial mineralogical information
from visible wavelengths alone. In addition to the 506 nm band, we identified the 550 nm spin-forbidden
one. As reported by a laboratory study for synthetic pyroxenes, we also do not observe any shift of
the band center of this feature across the surface of Vesta, and thus across different mineralogies,
preventing use of the 550 nm spin-forbidden band for the lithology derivation. Finally, the largest
previously identified olivine rich-spot shows a peculiar behavior in two color composites but
not in the other spectral parameters.

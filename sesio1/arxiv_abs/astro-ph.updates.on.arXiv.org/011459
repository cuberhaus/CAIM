Phosphorus (P) is a crucial element for life given its central role in several biomolecules. P-bearing
molecules have been discovered in different regions of the Milky Way, but not yet towards an extragalactic
environment. We have searched for P-bearing molecules towards the nearby starburst Galaxy NGC
253. Using observations from the ALMA Comprehensive High-resolution Extragalactic Molecular
Inventory (ALCHEMI) project, we used the MADCUBA package to model the emission of P-bearing molecules
assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) conditions. We have also performed a non-LTE analysis
using SpectralRadex. We report the detection of a P-bearing molecule, phosphorus nitride (PN),
for the first time in an extragalactic environment, towards two giant molecular clouds (GMCs) of
NGC 253. The LTE analysis yields total PN beam-averaged column densities $N$=(1.20$\pm$0.09)$\times$10$^{13}$
cm$^{-2}$ and $N$=(6.5$\pm$1.6)$\times$10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$, which translate into abundances
with respect to H$_2$ of $\chi$=(8.0$\pm$1.0)$\times$10$^{-12}$ and $\chi$=(4.4$\pm$1.2)$\times$10$^{-12}$.
We derived a low excitation temperature of $T_{\rm ex}$=(4.4$\pm$1.3) K towards the GMC with the
brightest PN emission, which indicates that PN is sub-thermally excited. The non-LTE analysis
results in column densities consistent with the LTE values. We have also searched for other P-bearing
molecules (PO, PH$_{3}$, CP and CCP), and upper limits were derived. The derived PO/PN ratios are
$<$1.3 and $<$1.7. The abundance ratio between PN and the shock-tracer SiO derived towards NGC 253
follows the same trend previously found towards Galactic sources. Comparison of the observations
with chemical models indicates that the derived molecular abundances of PN in NGC 253 can be explained
by shock-driven chemistry followed by cosmic-ray-driven photochemistry.

The earliest confirmed interstellar object, `Oumuamua, was discovered in the Solar System by Pan-STARRS
in 2017, allowing for a calibration of the abundance of interstellar objects of its size $\sim 100\;$
m. This was followed by the discovery of Borisov, which allowed for a similar calibration of its size
$\sim 0.4 - 1 \mathrm{\; km}$. One would expect a much higher abundance of significantly smaller
interstellar objects, with some of them colliding with Earth frequently enough to be noticeable.
Based on the CNEOS catalog of bolide events, we identify the $\sim 0.45$m meteor detected at 2014-01-08
17:05:34 UTC as originating from an unbound hyperbolic orbit with 99.999\% confidence. The U.S.
Department of Defense has since verified that "the velocity estimate reported to NASA is sufficiently
accurate to indicate an interstellar trajectory." We infer that the meteor had an asymptotic speed
of $v_{\infty} \sim 42.1 \pm 5.5\; \mathrm{km \; s^{-1}}$ outside of the solar system. Its origin
is approximately towards R.A. $49.4 \pm 4.1^{\circ}$ and declination $11.2 \pm 1.8^{\circ}$,
implying that its initial velocity vector was $58\pm6\; \mathrm{km\;s^{-1}}$ away from the velocity
of the Local Standard of Rest (LSR). Its high LSR speed implies a possible origin from the deep interior
of a planetary system or a star in the thick disk of the Milky Way galaxy. The local number density of
its population is $10^{6{^{+0.75}_{-1.5}}} \; \mathrm{AU^{-3}}$ or $9 \times 10^{21{^{+0.75}_{-1.5}}}
\; \mathrm{pc^{-3}}$ (necessitating 0.2 -- 20 Earth masses of material to be ejected per local star).
We show that the detections of CNEOS 2014-01-08, `Oumuamua, and Borisov collectively imply that
the differential size distribution in good agreement with a collisional distribution, with a power-law
slope is $q \sim 3.6 \pm 0.5$, where the quoted uncertainty corresponds to $2 \sigma$.

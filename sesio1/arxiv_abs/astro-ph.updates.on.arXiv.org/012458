We aim to constrain the dust mass and grain sizes in the interaction regions between the stellar winds
and the ISM around asymptotic giant branch stars. By describing the dust in these regions, we aim
to shed light on the role of low mass evolved stars in the origin of dust in galaxies. We use images in
the far-infrared at 70 micron and 160 micron to derive dust temperatures and dust masses in the wind-ISM
interaction regions around a sample of carbon-rich and oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB)
stars. The dust temperature and mass are determined in two ways. First directly from the data using
the ratio of the measured fluxes and assuming opacities for dust with a constant grain size of 0.1
micron. We then perform 3D dust-radiative transfer models spatially constrained by the observations
to consistently calculate the temperature and mass. For the radiative transfer models each model
contains one constant grain size, which is varied between 0.01 micron to 5.0 micron. We find that
the observed dust mass in the wind-ISM interaction regions is consistent with mass accumulated
from the stellar winds. For the carbon-rich sources adding the spatial constraints in the radiative
transfer models results in preferentially larger grain sizes (approx. 2 micron). For the oxygen-rich
sources the spatial constraints result in too high temperatures in the models, making it impossible
to fit the observed far-infrared ratio irrespective of the grain size used, indicating a more complex
interplay of grain properties and the stellar radiation field. The results have implications for
how likely it is for the grains to survive the transition into the ISM, and the properties of dust particles
that later act as seeds for grain growth in the ISM. However, the results for the oxygen-rich sources
show that the derivation of dust properties is not straight forward, requiring more complex modelling

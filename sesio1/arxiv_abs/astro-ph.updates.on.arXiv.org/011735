Recent computations of the interior composition of ultra-massive white dwarfs (WD) have suggested
that some white dwarfs could be composed of neon (Ne)-dominated cores. This result is at variance
with our previous understanding of the chemical structure of massive white dwarfs, where oxygen
is the predominant element. In addition, it is not clear whether some hybrid carbon (C) oxygen (O)-Ne
white dwarfs might form when convective boundary mixing is accounted for during the propagation
of the C-flame, in the C-burning stage. Both Ne-dominated and hybrid CO-Ne core would have measurable
consequences for asteroseismological studies based on evolutionary models. In this work we explore
in detail to which extent differences in the adopted micro- and macro-physics can explain the different
final white dwarf compositions that have been found by different authors. Additionally, we explored
the impact of such differences in the cooling times, crystallization and pulsational properties
of pulsating WDs. We explore the impact of the intensity of convective boundary mixing during the
C-flash, extreme mass-loss rates, and the size of the adopted nuclear networks on the final composition,
age, crystallization and pulsational properties of white dwarfs. Based on the insight coming from
3D hydro-dynamical simulations, we expect that the very slow propagation of the carbon flame will
be altered by turbulent entrainment affecting the inward propagation of the flame. Also, we find
that Ne-dominated chemical profiles of massive WDs recently reported appear in their modeling
due to the overlooking of a key nuclear reaction. We find that the inaccuracies in the chemical composition
of ultra-massive white dwarfs recently reported lead to differences of 10% in the cooling times
and degree of crystallization and about 8% in the period spacing of the models once they reach the
ZZ Ceti instability strip.

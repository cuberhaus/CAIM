The aim of this work is to study the impact of a binary companion on the evolution of two-planet systems
during both the type-II migration phase and their long-term evolution after the dissipation of
the protoplanetary disk. We use the symplectic integrator SyMBA, modified to include a wide binary
companion. We also include the Type-II migration of giant planets during the disk phase with suitable
eccentricity and inclination damping as well as the disk gravitational potential acting on the
planets and the nodal precession of the disk induced by the binary companion. We consider various
inclinations, eccentricities, and separations of the binary companion. Disk migration allows
the formation of planet pairs in mean-motion resonances (MMR) despite the presence of the binary
companion. When the binary separation is wide (1000au), the timescale of the perturbations it raises
on the planets is longer than the disk's lifetime and resonant pairs are routinely formed in the 2:1,
5:2 and 3:1 MMR. Provided the planet-planet interaction timescale is smaller than the binary perturbations
timescale, these systems can remain in resonance long after the disk has dissipated. When the binary
separation is smaller (250au), only planets in the 2:1 resonance tend to remain in a resonant state
and more chaotic evolutions are observed, as well as more ejections. After those ejections, the
remaining planet can become eccentric due to the perturbations from the binary companion and for
strongly inclined binary companions captures in the von Ziepel-Lidov-Kozai resonance can occur,
while in systems with two planets this mechanism is quenched by planet-planet interactions. Our
simulations reveal that the interplay between planet-disk, planet-planet and planet-binary
interactions can lead to the formation of resonant pairs of planets which remain stable over timescales
much longer than the disk's lifetime.

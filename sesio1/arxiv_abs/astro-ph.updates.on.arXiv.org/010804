Aims. The catalog of Stars With ExoplanETs (SWEET-Cat) was originally introduced in 2013. Since
then many more exoplanets have been confirmed, increasing significantly the number of host stars
listed there. A crucial step toward a comprehensive understanding of these new worlds is the precise
and homogeneous characterization of their host stars. Better spectroscopic stellar parameters
along with new results from Gaia eDR3 provide updated and precise parameters for the discovered
planets. A new version of the catalog, whose homogeneity in the derivation of the parameters is key
to unraveling star-planet connections, is available to the community. Methods. We made use of high-resolution
spectra for planet-host stars, either observed by our team or collected through public archives.
The spectroscopic stellar parameters were derived for the spectra following the same homogeneous
process using ARES and MOOG (ARES+MOOG) as for the previous SWEET-Cat releases. We re-derived parameters
for the stars in the catalog using better quality spectra and/or using the most recent versions of
the codes. Moreover, the new SWEET-Cat table can now be more easily combined with the planet properties
listed both at the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia and at the NASA exoplanet archive to perform
statistical analyses of exoplanets. We also made use of the recent GAIA eDR3 parallaxes and respective
photometry to derive consistent and accurate surface gravity values for the host stars. Results.
We increased the number of stars with homogeneous parameters by more than 40\% (from 645 to 928).
We reviewed and updated the metallicity distributions of stars hosting planets with different
mass regimes comparing the low-mass planets (< 30M$_{\oplus}$) with the high-mass planets. The
new data strengthen previous results showing the possible trend in the metallicity-period-mass
diagram for low-mass planets.

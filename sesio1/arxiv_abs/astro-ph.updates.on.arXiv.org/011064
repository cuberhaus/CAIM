We present the results obtained from the full-shape cosmology analysis of the redshift-space power
spectra for 4 galaxy samples of the SDSS-III BOSS DR12 galaxy catalog over $0.2 < z < 0.75$. For the
theoretical template, we use an emulator that was built from an ensemble set of $N$-body simulations,
which enables fast and accurate computation of the redshift-space power spectrum of halos. Combining
with the halo occupation distribution to model the halo-galaxy connection, we can compute the redshift-space
power spectrum of BOSS-like galaxies in the flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. In our cosmology inference,
we use the power spectrum monopole, quadrupole and hexadecapole and include 7 nuisance parameters
to model uncertainties in the halo-galaxy connection for each galaxy sample, but do not use any information
on the abundance of galaxies. We demonstrate a validation of our analysis pipeline using the mock
catalogs of BOSS-like galaxies, generated using different recipes of the halo-galaxy connection
and including the assembly bias effect. Assuming weak priors on cosmological parameters, except
for $\Omega_{\rm b}h^2$ and $n_{\rm s}$, we show that our model well reproduces the BOSS power spectra.
Including the power spectrum information up to $k_{\rm max}=0.25\,h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, we find $\Omega_{\rm
m}=0.300\pm0.011$, $H_0=68.35^{+1.21}_{-1.39}{\rm km\,s}^{-1}{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, and $\sigma_8=0.742^{+0.035}_{-0.036}$,
for the mode and 68\% credible interval, after marginalization over nuisance parameters. We find
little improvement in the cosmological parameters beyond a maximum wavelength $k_{\rm max}\simeq
0.2\,h\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ due to the shot noise domination and marginalization of the halo-galaxy
connection parameters. Our results show a nice agreement with the {\it Planck} CMB results for $\Omega_{\rm
m}$ and $H_0$, but indicate a slight tension for $\sigma_8$.

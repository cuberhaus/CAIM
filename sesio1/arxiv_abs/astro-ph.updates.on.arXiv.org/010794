The early dark energy (EDE) scenario aims to increase the value of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) inferred
from cosmic microwave background (CMB) data over that found in $\Lambda$CDM, via the introduction
of a new form of energy density in the early universe. The EDE component briefly accelerates cosmic
expansion just prior to recombination, which reduces the physical size of the sound horizon imprinted
in the CMB. Previous work has found that non-zero EDE is not preferred by Planck CMB power spectrum
data alone, which yield a 95% confidence level (CL) upper limit $f_{\rm EDE} < 0.087$ on the maximal
fractional contribution of the EDE field to the cosmic energy budget. In this paper, we fit the EDE
model to CMB data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 4. We find that a combination
of ACT, large-scale Planck TT (similar to WMAP), Planck CMB lensing, and BAO data prefers the existence
of EDE at $>99.7$% CL: $f_{\rm EDE} = 0.091^{+0.020}_{-0.036}$, with $H_0 = 70.9^{+1.0}_{-2.0}$
km/s/Mpc (both 68% CL). From a model-selection standpoint, we find that EDE is favored over $\Lambda$CDM
by these data at roughly $3\sigma$ significance. In contrast, a joint analysis of the full Planck
and ACT data yields no evidence for EDE, as previously found for Planck alone. We show that the preference
for EDE in ACT alone is driven by its TE and EE power spectrum data. The tight constraint on EDE from
Planck alone is driven by its high-$\ell$ TT power spectrum data. Understanding whether these differing
constraints are physical in nature, due to systematics, or simply a rare statistical fluctuation
is of high priority. The best-fit EDE models to ACT and Planck exhibit coherent differences across
a wide range of multipoles in TE and EE, indicating that a powerful test of this scenario is anticipated
with near-future data from ACT and other ground-based experiments.

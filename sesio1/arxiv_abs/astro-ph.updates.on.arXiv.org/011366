There is considerable interest in inflationary models with multiple inflaton fields. The inflaton
field $\boldsymbol\phi$ has a corresponding potential function $V$, the details of which, such
as the number of dimensions and shape, are free parameters of the theory. We consider a natural hypothesis
that $V$ ought to be maximally random. We realize this idea by defining $V$ as a Gaussian random field
in some number $N$ of dimensions. Given a model set of parameters that statistically determine the
shape of $V$, we repeatedly evolve $\boldsymbol\phi$ through the end of inflation from various
initial conditions, cataloguing a representative sample of trajectories associated with that
model. In order to impose the anthropic constraint of a universe in which inflation ends and normal
expansion takes over, we impose a minimum with $V=0$ and only consider trajectories that reach that
minimum. We simulate each path evolution stepwise through $\boldsymbol\phi$-space while simultaneously
computing $V$ and its derivatives along the path via a constrained Gaussian random process. When
$N$ is large, this method significantly reduces computational load as compared to methods which
generate the potential landscape all at once. Even so, the covariance matrix $\boldsymbol\Gamma$
of constraints on $V$ can quickly become large and cumbersome. To solve this problem, we present
data compression algorithms to prioritize the necessary information already simulated, then
keep an arbitrarily large portion. With these optimizations, we simulate thousands of trajectories
with various parameter sets, extract tensor and scalar perturbation spectra from each, then assemble
statistical predictions of these quantities through repeated trials. We find that the Gaussian
random potential is a highly versatile inflationary model with a rich volume of parameter space
capable of reproducing modern observations.

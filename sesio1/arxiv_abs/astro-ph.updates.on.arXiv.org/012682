We measure the 3PCF of 300 halo catalogs from the Minerva simulations covering a total volume of $~1000
h^{-3} \mathrm{Gpc}^3$. Each 3PCF measurement includes all possible triangular configurations
with sides between 20 and $130h^{-1}\mathrm{Gpc}$. First, we test different estimates of the covariance
matrix, a crucial aspect of the analysis. We compare the covariance computed numerically from the
limited but accurate benchmark simulations set to the one obtained from $10000$ approximate halo
catalogs generated with the Pinocchio code. We demonstrate that the two numerically-estimated
covariance matrices largely match, confirming the validity of approximate methods based on Lagrangian
Perturbation Theory for generating mocks suitable for covariance estimation. We also compare
the numerical covariance with a theoretical prediction in the Gaussian approximation. We find
a good match between the two for separations above 40 $h^{-1} \mathrm{Gpc}$. We test the 3PCF tree-level
model in Perturbation Theory. The model is adopted in a likelihood analysis aimed at the determination
of bias parameters. We find that, for our sample of halos at redshift $z=1$, the tree-level model
performs well for separations $r \geq 40 \, h^{-1}\mathrm{Gpc}$. Results obtained with this scale
cut are robust against different choices of covariance matrix. We compare to the analogous analysis
of the halo bispectrum already presented in a previous publication, finding a remarkable agreement
between the two statistics. We then test different assumptions to build the model defining a robust
combination of hypotheses that lead to unbiased parameter estimates. Our results confirm the importance
of 3PCF, supplying a solid recipe for its inclusion in likelihood analyses. Moreover, it opens the
path for further improvements, especially in modelling, to extract information from non-linear
regimes

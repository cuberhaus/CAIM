We report the first detection of the phosphorus monoxide ion (PO$^{+}$) in the interstellar medium.
Our unbiased and very sensitive spectral survey towards the G+0.693$-$0.027 molecular cloud covers
four different rotational transitions of this molecule, two of which ($J$=1$-$0 and $J$=2$-$1)
appear free of contamination from other species. The fit performed, assuming Local Thermodynamic
Equilibrium conditions, yields a column density of $N$=(6.0$\pm$0.7)$\times$10$^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$.
The resulting molecular abundance with respect to molecular hydrogen is 4.5$\times$10$^{-12}$.
The column density of PO$^{+}$ normalised by the cosmic abundance of P is larger than those of NO$^{+}$
and SO$^{+}$, normalised by N and S, by factors of 3.6 and 2.3, respectively. The $N$(PO$^{+}$)/$N$(PO)
ratio is 0.12$\pm$0.03, more than one order of magnitude higher than those of $N$(SO$^{+}$)/$N$(SO)
and $N$(NO$^{+}$)/$N$(NO). These results indicate that P is more efficiently ionised in the ISM
than N and S. We have performed new chemical models that confirm that the PO$^+$ abundance is strongly
enhanced in shocked regions with high values of cosmic-ray ionisation rates (10$^{-15}-$10$^{-14}$
s$^{-1}$), as occurs in the G+0.693$-$0.027 molecular cloud. The shocks sputter the interstellar
icy grain mantles, releasing into the gas phase most of their P content, mainly in the form of PH$_3$,
which is converted into atomic P, and then ionised efficiently by cosmic rays, forming P$^+$. Further
reactions with O$_2$ and OH produce PO$^{+}$. The cosmic-ray ionisation of PO might also contribute
significantly, which would explain the high $N$(PO$^{+}$)/$N$(PO) observed. The relatively
high gas-phase abundance of PO$^{+}$ with respect to other P-bearing species stresses the relevance
of this species in the interstellar chemistry of P.

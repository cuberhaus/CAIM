We aim to quantify the relation between the dust-to-gas (DTG) mass ratio and gas-phase metallicity
of $z=$2.1-2.5 luminous galaxies and contrast this high-redshift relation against analogous
constraints at $z=$0. We present a sample of 10 star-forming main-sequence galaxies in the redshift
range $2.1<z<2.5$ with rest-optical emission-line information available from the MOSDEF survey
and with ALMA 1.2 millimeter and CO J$=$3--2 follow-up observations. The galaxies have stellar
masses ranging from $10^{10.3}$ to $10^{10.6}\,\rm{M}_\odot$ and cover a range in star-formation
rate from 35 to 145 $\rm{M}_\odot\,\rm{yr}^{-1}$. We calculate the gas-phase oxygen abundance
of these galaxies from rest-optical nebular emission lines (8.4 < $12 + \log{(\rm{O/H})} < 8.8$,
corresponding to 0.5-1.25 Z$_\odot$). We estimate the dust and H2 masses (using a metallicity dependent
CO-to-H2 conversion factor) of the galaxies from the 1.2 mm and CO J$=$3-2 observations, respectively,
from which we estimate a DTG. We find that the galaxies in this sample follow the earlier observed
trends between CO line luminosity and dust-continuum luminosity from $z=0$ to $z=3$, extending
such trends to fainter galaxies at $2.1<z<2.5$ than observed to date. We find no second-order metallicity
dependence in the CO - dust-continuum luminosity relation for the galaxies presented in this work.
The DTG of main-sequence galaxies at $2.1<z<2.5$ are consistent with an increase in DTG with gas-phase
metallicity. Galaxies at $z=$2.1-2.5 are furthermore consistent with the DTG-metallicity relation
found at $z=$0, providing relevant constraints for galaxy formation models. These results furthermore
imply that the metallicity of galaxies should be taken into account when estimating cold-gas masses
from dust-continuum emission, especially relevant when studying metal-poor low-mass or high-redshift
galaxies. [abridged]

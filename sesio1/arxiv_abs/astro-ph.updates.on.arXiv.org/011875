We study the members of the protocluster around AzTEC3 submillimeter galaxy at z=5.3. We analyzed
the data from the MUSE instrument in an area of 1.4x1.4 arcmin^2 around AzTEC3 and derived information
on the Lya line in emission. We compared the Lya profile of various regions of the environment with
the zELDA radiative transfer model, revealing the neutral gas distribution and kinematics. We
identified 10 Lya emitting sources, including 2 regions with extended emission: one embedding
AzTEC3 and LBG3, a star-forming galaxy located 12 kpc north of the SMG and another toward LBG-1, a
star-forming galaxy located 90 kpc to the southeast. The sources appear distributed in an elongated
configuration of about 70'' in extent. The number of sources confirms the overdensity around AzTEC3.
For the AzTEC3+LBG3 system, the Lya emission appears redshifted and more spatially extended than
the [CII] line emission. Similarly, the Lya line spectrum is broader in velocity than [CII] for LBG1.
In the former spectrum, the Lya emission is elongated to the north of LBG3 and to the south of AzTEC3,
where a faint Lya emitting galaxy is also located. The elongated structures could resemble tidal
features due to the interaction of the two galaxies with AzTEC3. Also, we find a bridge of gas, revealed
by the Lya emission between AzTEC3 and LBG3. The Lya emission toward LBG1 embeds its three components.
The HI kinematics support the idea of a merger of the three components. Given the availability of
CO and [CII] observations from previous campaigns, and our Lya information, we find evidence of
starburst-driven phenomena and interactions around AzTEC-3. The stellar mass of the galaxies
of the overdensity and the Lya luminosity of the HI nebula associated with AzTEC-3 imply a dark matter
halo of 10^12 Msun at z=5.3 that could evolve into a cluster of 2x10^14 Msun at z=0.

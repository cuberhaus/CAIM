Strong gravitational lensing of gravitational waves (GWs) has been forecasted to become detectable
in the upcoming observing runs. However, definitively distinguishing pairs of lensed sources
from random associations is a challenging problem. We investigate the degree to which unlensed
events mimic lensed ones because of the overlap of parameters due to a combination of random coincidence
and errors in parameter estimation. We construct a mock catalog of lensed and unlensed events. We
find that the false alarm probability (FAP) based on coincidental overlaps of the chirp mass, sky
location, and coalescence phase are approximately $11\%$, $1\%$, and $10\%$ per pair, respectively.
Combining all three, the overall FAP per pair is $\sim10^{-4}$. As the number of events, $N$, in the
GW catalogs increases, the number of random pairs of events increases as $\sim N^2$. Meanwhile,
the number of lensed events will increase linearly with $N$, implying that for sufficiently high
$N$, the false alarms will always dominate over the true lensing events. This issue can be compensated
for by placing higher thresholds on the lensing candidates (e.g., selecting a higher signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) threshold), which will lead to better parameter estimation and, thus, lower FAP per
pair -- at the cost of dramatically decreasing the size of the lensing sample (by $\sim 1/\mbox{SNR}^3$).
We show that with our simple overlap criteria for current detectors at design sensitivity, the false
alarms will dominate for realistic lensing rates ($\lesssim10^{-3}$) even when selecting the
highest SNR pairs. These results highlight the necessity to design alternative identification
criteria beyond simple waveform and sky location overlap. Future GW detectors Cosmic Explorer
and Einstein Telescope may provide sufficient improvement in parameter estimation, allowing
for the conclusive detection of strong lensing of GWs.

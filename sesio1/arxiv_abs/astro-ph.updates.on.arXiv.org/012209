We report the discovery of Pegasus IV, an ultra-faint dwarf galaxy found in archival data from the
Dark Energy Camera processed by the DECam Local Volume Exploration Survey. Pegasus IV is a compact,
ultra-faint stellar system ($r_{1/2} = 41^{+8}_{-6}$ pc; $M_V = -4.25 \pm 0.2$ mag) located at a
heliocentric distance of $90^{+4}_{-6}$ kpc. Based on spectra of seven non-variable member stars
observed with Magellan/IMACS, we confidently resolve Pegasus IV's velocity dispersion, measuring
$\sigma_{v} = 3.3^{+1.7}_{-1.1} \text{ km s}^{-1}$ (after excluding three velocity outliers);
this implies a mass-to-light ratio of $M_{1/2}/L_{V,1/2} = 167^{+224}_{-99} M_{\odot}/L_{\odot}$
for the system. From the five stars with the highest signal-to-noise spectra, we also measure a systemic
metallicity of $\rm [Fe/H] = -2.67^{+0.25}_{-0.29}$ dex, making Pegasus IV one of the most metal-poor
ultra-faint dwarfs. We tentatively resolve a non-zero metallicity dispersion for the system.
These measurements provide strong evidence that Pegasus IV is a dark-matter-dominated dwarf galaxy,
rather than a star cluster. We measure Pegasus IV's proper motion using data from Gaia Early Data
Release 3, finding ($\mu_{\alpha*}, \mu_{\delta}) = (0.33\pm 0.07, -0.21 \pm 0.08) \text{ mas
yr}^{-1}$. When combined with our measured systemic velocity, this proper motion suggests that
Pegasus IV is on an elliptical, retrograde orbit, and is currently near its orbital apocenter. Lastly,
we identify three potential RR Lyrae variable stars within Pegasus IV, including one candidate
member located more than ten half-light radii away from the system's centroid. The discovery of
yet another ultra-faint dwarf galaxy strongly suggests that the census of Milky Way satellites
is still incomplete, even within 100 kpc.

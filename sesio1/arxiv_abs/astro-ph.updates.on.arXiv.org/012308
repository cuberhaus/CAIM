The primary difficulty in understanding the sources and processes that powered cosmic reionization
is that it is not possible to directly probe the ionizing Lyman Continuum (LyC) radiation at that
epoch as those photons have been absorbed by the intervening neutral hydrogen in the IGM on their
way to us. It is therefore imperative to build a model to accurately predict LyC emission using other
properties of galaxies in the reionization era. In recent years, studies have shown that the LyC
emission from galaxies may be correlated to their Lya emission. Here, we study this correlation
by analyzing thousands of galaxies at high-z in the SPHINX cosmological simulation. We post-process
these galaxies with the Lya radiative transfer code RASCAS and analyze the Lya - LyC connection.
We find that the Lya and LyC luminosities are strongly correlated with each other, although with
dispersion. There is a positive correlation between Lya and LyC escape fractions in the brightest
Lya emitters (>$10^{41}$ erg/s), similar to the recent observational studies. However, when we
also include fainter Lya emitters (LAEs), the correlation disappears, which suggests that the
observed relationship may be driven by selection effects. We also find that bright LAEs are dominant
contributors to reionization ($> 10^{40}$ erg/s galaxies contribute $> 90\%$ of LyC emission).
Finally, we build predictive models using multivariate linear regression where we use the physical
and the Lya properties of simulated galaxies to predict their intrinsic and escaping LyC luminosities
with a high degree of accuracy. We find that the most important galaxy properties to predict the escaping
LyC luminosity of a galaxy are its escaping Lya luminosity, gas mass, gas metallicity, and SFR. These
models can be very useful to predict LyC emissions from galaxies and can help us identify the sources
of reionization.

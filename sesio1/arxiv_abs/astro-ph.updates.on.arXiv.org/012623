We present the first application of the Cosmoglobe analysis framework by analyzing 9-year $\mathit{WMAP}$
time-ordered observations using similar machinery as BeyondPlanck utilizes for $\mathit{Planck}$
LFI. We analyze only the $\mathit Q$-band (41 GHz) data and report on the low-level analysis process
from uncalibrated time-ordered data to calibrated maps. Most of the existing BeyondPlanck pipeline
may be reused for $\mathit{WMAP}$ analysis with minimal changes to the existing codebase. The main
modification is the implementation of the same preconditioned biconjugate gradient mapmaker
used by the $\mathit{WMAP}$ team. Producing a single $\mathit{WMAP}$ $\mathit Q$1-band sample
requires 22 CPU-hrs, which is slightly more than the cost of a $\mathit{Planck}$ 44 GHz sample of
17 CPU-hrs; this demonstrates that full end-to-end Bayesian processing of the $\mathit{WMAP}$
data is computationally feasible. In general, our recovered maps are very similar to the maps released
by the $\mathit{WMAP}$ team, although with two notable differences. In temperature we find a $\sim2\,\mathrm{\mu
K}$ quadrupole difference that most likely is caused by different gain modeling, while in polarization
we find a distinct $2.5\,\mathrm{\mu K}$ signal that has been previously called poorly-measured
modes by the $\mathit{WMAP}$ team. In the Cosmoglobe processing, this pattern arises from temperature-to-polarization
leakage from the coupling between the CMB Solar dipole, transmission imbalance, and sidelobes.
No traces of this pattern are found in either the frequency map or TOD residual map, suggesting that
the current processing has succeeded in modelling these poorly measured modes within the assumed
parametric model by using $\mathit{Planck}$ information to break the sky-synchronous degeneracies
inherent in the $\mathit{WMAP}$ scanning strategy.

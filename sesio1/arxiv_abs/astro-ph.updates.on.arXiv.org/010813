Light axion-like particles (ALPs) are expected to be abundantly produced in core-collapse supernovae
(CCSNe), resulting in a $\sim$10-second long burst of ALPs. These particles subsequently undergo
conversion into gamma-rays in external magnetic fields to produce a long gamma-ray burst (GRB)
with a characteristic spectrum peaking in the 30--100-MeV energy range. At the same time, CCSNe
are invoked as progenitors of {\it ordinary} long GRBs, rendering it relevant to conduct a comprehensive
search for ALP spectral signatures using the observations of long GRB with the \textit{Fermi} Large
Area Telescope (LAT). We perform a data-driven sensitivity analysis to determine CCSN distances
for which a detection of an ALP signal is possible with the LAT's low-energy (LLE) technique which,
in contrast to the standard LAT analysis, allows for a a larger effective area for energies down to
30~MeV. Assuming an ALP mass $m_a \lesssim 10^{-10}$~eV and ALP-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma}
= 5.3\times 10^{-12}$ GeV$^{-1}$, values considered and deduced in ALP searches from SN1987A,
we find that the distance limit ranges from $\sim\!0.5$ to $\sim\!10$~Mpc, depending on the sky
location and the CCSN progenitor mass. Furthermore, we select a candidate sample of twenty-four
GRBs and carry out a model comparison analysis in which we consider different GRB spectral models
with and without an ALP signal component. We find that the inclusion of an ALP contribution does not
result in any statistically significant improvement of the fits to the data. We discuss the statistical
method used in our analysis and the underlying physical assumptions, the feasibility of setting
upper limits on the ALP-photon coupling, and give an outlook on future telescopes in the context
of ALP searches.

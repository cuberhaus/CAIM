Hayabusa2 collected 5.4 g of samples from the asteroid (162173) Ryugu and brought them back to Earth.
Obtaining multiband images of these samples with the spectral bands comparable to those used for
remote-sensing observations is important for characterizing the collected samples and examining
how representative the sample is compared with spacecraft observations of Ryugu as a whole. In this
study, we constructed a multiband microscopic camera system that enables both visual multispectral
imaging at 390 (ul), 475 (b), 550 (v), 590 (Na), 700 (w), and 850 nm (x), and three-dimensional (3D)
shape reconstruction of individual grain samples based on stereo imaging. The imaging system yields
the images of 4096 x 2160 pixels with the pixel resolution of 1.93 {\mu}m/pix and field of view of 7.9
x 4.2 mm. Our validation measurements demonstrate that our multispectral imaging system, which
observes the samples with the spectral bands comparable to those on the telescopic optical navigation
camera (ONC-T) on Hayabusa2, yields reflectance spectra with a relative error of 3% and a 3D model
with an error of 5%. These results indicate that the multiband imaging system with a 3D shape reconstruction
capability yields accurate spectral and shape data on the returned samples. Using this instrument,
we conducted multispectral measurements of two Ryugu samples (grains in the dishes A3 and C1) acquired
from two locations on the asteroid. The average spectra of the measured Ryugu samples were flat and
consistent with the global averaged spectrum of Ryugu. The 550-nm band (v-band) reflectance of
the returned grains in the dishes was 2.4% on average, higher than that of the global averaged spectrum
of Ryugu observed with ONC-T. This apparent difference could be because the returned grains have
greater specular reflectance.

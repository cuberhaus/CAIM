The Panspermia hypothesis posits that either life's building blocks (molecular Panspermia) or
life itself (organism-based Panspermia) may have been interplanetary transferred to facilitate
the Origins of Life (OoL) on a given planet, complementing several current OoL frameworks. Although
many spaceflight experiments were performed in the past to test for potential terrestrial organisms
as Panspermia seeds, it is uncertain whether such organisms will likely "seed" a new planet even
if they are able to survive spaceflight. Therefore, rather than using organisms, using abiotic
chemicals as seeds has been proposed as part of the molecular Panspermia hypothesis. Here, as an
extension of this hypothesis, we introduce and review the plausibility of a polymeric material-based
Panspermia seed (M-BPS) theoretical concept, where the type of polymeric material that can function
as a M-BPS must be able to: 1) survive spaceflight, and 2) "function", i.e., contingently drive chemical
evolution towards some form of abiogenesis once arriving on a foreign planet. We use polymeric gels
as a model example of a potential M-BPS. Polymeric gels that can be prebiotically synthesized on
one planet (such as polyester gels) could be transferred to another planet via meteoritic transfer,
where upon landing on a liquid bearing planet, can assemble into structures containing cellular-like
characteristics and functionalities. Such features presupposed that these gels can assemble
into compartments through phase separation to accomplish relevant functions such as encapsulation
of primitive metabolic, genetic and catalytic materials, exchange of these materials, motion,
coalescence, and evolution. All of these functions can result in the gels' capability to alter local
geochemical niches on other planets, thereby allowing chemical evolution to lead to OoL events.

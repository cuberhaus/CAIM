In intermediate-temperature (T = 2.5 - 4.5 keV) galaxy clusters, abundance measurements are almost-equally
driven by Fe K and L transitions, at $\sim$ 6.7 keV and 0.9 - 1.3 keV, respectively. While K-shell-derived
measurements are considered reliable, the resolution of the currently available instrumentation,
as well as our current knowledge of the atomic processes, makes the modelling of the L-line complex
challenging, resulting in potential biases for abundance measurements. In this work, we study
systematics related to the modelling of the Fe L-line complex that may influence iron-abundance
measurements in the intermediate-temperature range. To this aim, we select a sample of three bright
galaxy clusters, with long XMM-Newton observations available and temperature in the 2.5 - 4.5 keV
range. We fit spectra extracted from concentric rings with APEC and APEC+APEC models, by alternatively
excluding the L and K bands, and derive the fractional difference of the metal abundances, $\Delta
Z/Z$, as indication of the consistency between K- and L-shell-derived measurements. The $\Delta
Z/Z$ distribution is then studied as a function of the cluster radius, ring temperature and X-ray
flux. The L-induced systematics, measured through an individual fit of each MOS and pn spectrum,
remain constant at a 5 - 6% value in the whole 2.5 - 4.5 keV temperature range. Conversely, a joint fit
of MOS and pn spectra leads to a slight excess of 1 - 2% in the above estimate. No significant dependence
on the ring X-ray flux is highlighted. The measured 5 - 8% value indicates a modest contribution of
the systematics to the derived iron abundances, giving confidence for future measurements. To
date, these findings represent the best-achievable estimate of the systematics in analysis, while
future microcalorimeters will significantly improve our understanding of the atomic processes
underlying the Fe L emissions.

The radio emission from faint extra-galactic sources hugely improves the study of cosmic evolution
of star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and active galactic nuclei (AGN). Here, we study the faint sources
in the ELAIS-N1 field using deep uGMRT observations in the 300--500 MHz frequency range, covering
an area of 1.8 deg$^2$ with a sensitivity of $15 \mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$. Using a host of multi-waveband
data in the infrared and spectroscopy in the optical, we broadly classify the sources as SFGs and
AGN, and study the statistical properties of the radio--infrared relations up to redshift $z =$
2 by $k$-correcting the observed data to rest-frame. We study the redshift variation of the monochromatic
$q$ parameters at 24 and $70\mu$m, $q_{\rm 24\mu m}$ and $q_{\rm 70\mu m}$, respectively, and of
bolometric $q_{\rm TIR}$ after integrating the infrared spectrum between 8 and $1000\mu$m. In
our study $q_{24\mu m}$ is found to increase with $z$ caused by an increase in dust temperature ($T_{\rm
dust}$) of the flux-limited sample at mid-infrared wavelengths. The $q_{\rm 70\mu m}$ and $q_{\rm
TIR}$ are largely unaffected by $T_{\rm dust}$ variation in the sample and show a mild decrease with
$z$ given as $q_{\rm 70\mu m} = (2.34 \pm 0.03)(1+z)^{-0.13 \pm 0.03}$ and $q_{\rm TIR} = (2.60 \pm
0.03)(1+z)^{-0.11 \pm 0.02}$. We observe tight correlations between the radio luminosity at 1.4GHz
($L_{\rm 1.4GHz}$) with monochromatic infrared luminosities at $24\mu$m ($L_{\rm 24\mu m}$)
and at $70\mu$m ($L_{\rm 70\mu m}$), and with bolometric infrared luminosity ($L_{\rm TIR}$) having
scatter less than a factor of 2 for SFGs up to $z=2$. All the radio--infrared relations have significant
non-linear slopes. Such non-linearity could result in the $q$ parameters varying with redshift
making it a complication for using them to study the evolution of the radio--infrared relations.

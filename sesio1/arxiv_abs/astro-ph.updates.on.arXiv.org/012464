Abundance ratios of the nuclear-spin isomers of H$_2$O and NH$_3$ have been measured in about two
dozen comets, with a mean value corresponding to a nuclear-spin temperature of $\sim$ 30 K. The real
meaning of these unequilibrated nuclear-spin abundance ratios is still debated. However, an equilibrated
water ortho-to-para ratio (OPR) of 3 is also commonly observed. The H channel of VIRTIS (VIRTIS-H)
on board Rosetta provided high-resolution 2.5--2.9 $\mu$m spectra of H$_2$O vapour in the coma
of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P), which are suitable for the determination of the OPR
of water in this comet. A large dataset of VIRTIS-H spectra obtained in limb-sounding viewing geometry
was analysed, covering heliocentric distances from 1.24 to 2.73 au and altitudes from a few hundred
metres to $>$ 100 km. The OPR, together with the H$_2$O rotational temperature and column density,
were derived for each spectra. The weak lines of the $\nu_1$, $\nu_1+\nu_3-\nu_1$ and $\nu_2+\nu_3-\nu_2$
bands in the 2.774--2.910 $\mu$m range were used to calculate by how much the strong $\nu_3$ band
centred at 2.67 $\mu$m is attenuated due to optical depth effects, expressed by the attenuation
factor $f_{\rm atten}$. Most OPR determinations are strongly affected by opacity effects, as demonstrated
by the observed anti-correlation between the OPR and the column density, and the correlation between
the OPR and attenuation factor $f_{\rm atten}$. Based on both radiative transfer calculations
and OPR values obtained in low-opacity conditions, we derive an OPR of 2.94 $\pm$ 0.06 for comet 67P.
The water OPR measured in the coma of 67P is consistent with laboratory experiments showing that
water vapour that has thermally desorbed from water ice has a statistical value of 3, regardless
of the past formation process of water ice.

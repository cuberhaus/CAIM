The solar gravitational lens (SGL) offers unique capabilities for high-resolution imaging of
faint, distant objects, such as exoplanets. In the near future, a spacecraft carrying a meter-class
telescope with a solar coronagraph would be placed in the focal region of the SGL. That region begins
at ~547 astronomical units from the Sun and occupies the vicinity of the target-specific primary
optical axis - the line that connects the center of the target and that of the Sun. This axis undergoes
complex motion as the exoplanet orbits its host star, as that star moves with respect to the Sun, and
even as the Sun itself moves with respect to the solar system's barycenter due to the gravitational
pull of planets in our solar system. An image of an extended object is projected by the SGL into an image
plane and moves within that plane, responding to the motion of the optical axis. To sample the image,
a telescope must follow the projection with precise knowledge of its own position with respect to
the image. We consider the dominant motions that determine the position of the focal line as a function
of time. We evaluate the needed navigational capability for the telescope to conduct a multiyear
exoplanet imaging mission. We show that even in a rather conservative case, when an Earth-like exoplanet
is in our stellar neighborhood at $\sim10$ light years, the motion of the image is characterized
by a small total acceleration $\sim 6.1\,\mu {\rm m/s}^2$ that is driven primarily by the orbital
motion of the exoplanet and by the reflex motion of our Sun. We discuss how the amplified light of the
host star allows establishing a local reference frame thus relaxing navigational requirements.
We conclude that the required navigation in the SGL's focal region, although complex, can be accurately
modeled and a $\sim 10$-year imaging mission is achievable with the already available propulsion
technology.

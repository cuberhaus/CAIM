Recent works have shown that the properties of galaxy populations in dark matter halos vary with
large-scale environments. These results suggest a variation in the halo occupation distribution
(HOD) in extreme density environments. To analyse these effects, we identify cosmic voids and future
virialised structures (FVS) in the SDSS-DR12 and estimate the HOD within these superstructures
using group catalogues as dark matter halo proxies. Our goal is to use observational galaxy data
to characterise the HOD within voids and FVS, explore the different properties of these galaxies
populations and compare them with the general results outside these superstructures. Using a galaxy
group catalogue we compute the HOD within both types of superstructures. We also study the dependence
on the results on the main void and FVS properties. We also analysed the mean stellar age of the galaxies
inside these regions. In all cases, we compare the results with those derived from the Field sample.
Inside voids, we find a strong decrease in HOD concerning the Field results. The mean number of satellites
fall to 50%. Inside FVS, the HOD shows a significant increase to the Field, with a 40% excess in the
mean number of satellites. In both regions, the differences with respect to the Field increases
for the extreme values of the density environments. We obtain no signs of variations related to intrinsic
characteristics of voids and FVS. We find that the cumulative distribution of the mean age of stars
of the central galaxy also varies in these regions. Finally, we explore the HOD for the 25% youngest
(oldest) galaxies. We find that for the low-mass groups the youngest galaxies are only present inside
voids. On the other hand, for the high-mass groups the FVS environments show the same increase in
the HOD concerning the Field. We find that cosmic voids lack of oldest galaxies.

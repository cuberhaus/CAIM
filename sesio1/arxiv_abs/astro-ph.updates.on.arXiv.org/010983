Triggering process for prominence instability and consequent CMEs is not fully understood. Prominences
are maintained by the Lorentz force against the gravity, therefore reduction of the prominence
mass due to the coronal rain may cause the change of the force balance and hence destabilisation of
the structures. We aim to study the observational evidence of the influence of coronal rain on the
stability of prominence and subsequent eruption of CMEs. We used the simultaneous observations
from AIA/SDO and SECCHI/STEREO spacecrafts from different angles to follow the dynamics of prominence/filaments
and to study the role of coronal rain in their destabilisation. Three different prominences/filaments
observed during years 2011-2012 were analysed using observations acquired by SDO and STEREO. In
all three cases massive coronal rain from the prominence body led to the destabilisation of prominence
and subsequently to the eruption of CMEs. The upward rising of prominences consisted in the slow
and the fast rise phases. The coronal rain triggered the initial slow rise of prominences, which
led to the final instability (the fast rise phase) after 18-28 hours in all cases. The estimated mass
flux carried by coronal rain blobs showed that the prominences became unstable after 40 \% of mass
loss. We suggest that the initial slow rise phase was triggered by the mass loss of prominence due
to massive coronal rain, while the fast rise phase, i.e. the consequent instability of prominences,
was caused by the torus instability and/or magnetic reconnection with overlying coronal field.
Therefore, the coronal rain triggered the instability of prominences and consequent CMEs. If this
is the case, then the coronal rain can be used to predict the CMEs and hence to improve the space weather
predictions.

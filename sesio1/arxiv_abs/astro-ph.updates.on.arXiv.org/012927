Fractional cosmology has emerged recently, based on the formalism of fractional calculus, which
modifies the standard derivative to one fractional derivative of order $\alpha$. In this mathematical
framework, the Friedmann equations are modified with an additional term, and the standard evolution
of the cosmic species densities depends on the fractional parameter $\alpha$ and the age of the Universe
$t_U$. The hypothesis is that the Universe does not contain a dark energy component, and the late
accelerated expansion can be sourced by the additional term in the new equation governing the cosmic
dynamics. To elucidate that, we estimate stringent constraints on the fractional parameter using
cosmic chronometers, Type Ia supernovae and joint analysis. We obtain $\alpha=2.839^{+0.117}_{-0.193}$
within $1\sigma$ confidence level that can provide a non-standard cosmic acceleration at late
times; consequently, the Universe would be older than the standard estimations. Additionally,
we present a dynamical system and stability analysis to explore the phase-space under the assumption
of different $\alpha$ parameters. One late-time attractor, which is physical for $1\leq\alpha<5/2$,
corresponds to a power-law (decelerated) late-time attractor for $\alpha < 2$. Moreover, an additional
point not present in General Relativity exists, which is physical for $\alpha>1$ and a sink for $\alpha>2$.
This solution is a decelerated power-law if $1<\alpha<2$ and an accelerated power-law solution
if $\alpha > 2$. This last result is consistent with the mean values obtained from the observational
analysis. Therefore, under the fractional calculus, it is possible to obtain modified Friedmann
equations at the background level, which provide a late cosmic acceleration without introducing
a dark energy component. This radical approach could be a new path to tackle problems not resolved
until now in cosmology.

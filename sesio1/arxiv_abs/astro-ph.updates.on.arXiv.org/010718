Sigma Ori E, a massive helium B-type star, shows a high surface rotation and a strong surface magnetic
field potentially challenging the process of wind magnetic braking. The Gaia satellite provides
an accurate distance to that star and confirms its membership to the sigma Ori cluster. We account
for these two key pieces of information to investigate whether single star models can reproduce
the observed properties of sigma Ori E and provide new estimates for its metallicity, mass, and age.
We compute rotating stellar models accounting for wind magnetic braking and magnetic quenching
of the mass loss. We obtain that sigma Ori E is a very young star (age less than 1 Myr) with an initial
mass around 9 Msol, a surface equatorial magnetic field around 7 kG and having a metallicity Z (mass
fraction of heavy elements) around 0.020. No solution is obtained with the present models for a metallicity
Z=0.014. The initial rotation of the models fitting sigma Ori E is not much constrained and can be
anywhere in the range studied in the present work. Because of its very young age, models predict no
observable changes of the surface abundances due to rotational mixing. The simultaneous high surface
rotation and high surface magnetic field of sigma Ori E may simply be a consequence of its young age.
This young age implies that the processes responsible for producing the chemical inhomogeneities
that are observed at its surface should be rapid. Thus for explaining the properties of sigma Ori
E, there is no necessity to invoke a merging event although such a scenario cannot be discarded. Other
stars (HR 5907, HR 7355, HR 345439, HD 2347, CPD -50^{o}3509$) showing similar properties as sigma
Ori E (fast rotation and strong surface magnetic field) may also be very young stars, although determination
of the braking timescales is needed to confirm such a conclusion.

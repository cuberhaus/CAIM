High-resolution spectra are unique indicators of three-dimensional processes in exoplanetary
atmospheres. For instance, in 2020, Ehrenreich et al. reported transmission spectra from the ESPRESSO
spectrograph yielding an anomalously large Doppler blueshift from the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-76b.
Interpretations of these observations invoke toy model depictions of gas-phase iron condensation
in lower-temperature regions of the planet's atmosphere. In this work, we forward model the atmosphere
of WASP-76b with double-gray general circulation models (GCMs) and ray-striking radiative transfer
to diagnose the planet's high-resolution transmission spectrum. We confirm that a physical mechanism
driving strong east-west asymmetries across the terminator must exist to reproduce large Doppler
blueshifts in WASP-76b's transmission spectrum. We identify low atmospheric drag and a deep radiative-convective
boundary as necessary components of our GCM to produce this asymmetry (the latter is consistent
with existing Spitzer phase curves). However, we cannot reproduce either the magnitude or the time-dependence
of the WASP-76b Doppler signature with gas-phase iron condensation alone. Instead, we find that
high-altitude, optically thick clouds composed of $\rm Al_2O_3$, Fe, or $\rm Mg_2SiO_4$ provide
reasonable fits to the Ehrenreich et al. observations -- with marginal contributions from condensation.
This fit is further improved by allowing a small orbital eccentricity ($e \approx 0.01$), consistent
with prior WASP-76b orbital constraints. We additionally validate our forward-modeled spectra
by reproducing lines of nearly all species detected in WASP-76b by Tabernero et al. 2021. Our procedure's
success in diagnosing phase-resolved Doppler shifts demonstrates the benefits of physical, self-consistent,
three-dimensional simulations in modeling high-resolution spectra of exoplanet atmospheres.

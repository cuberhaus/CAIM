The Gl 486 system consists of a very nearby, relatively bright, weakly active M3.5 V star at just 8
pc with a warm transiting rocky planet of about 1.3 R_Terra and 3.0 M_Terra that is ideal for both transmission
and emission spectroscopy and for testing interior models of telluric planets. To prepare for future
studies, we collected light curves of seven new transits observed with the CHEOPS space mission
and new radial velocities obtained with MAROON-X/Gemini North and CARMENES/Calar Alto telescopes,
together with previously published spectroscopic and photometric data from the two spectrographs
and TESS. We also performed interferometric observations with the CHARA Array and new photometric
monitoring with a suite of smaller telescopes. From interferometry, we measure a limb-darkened
disc angular size of the star Gl 486. Together with a corrected Gaia EDR3 parallax, we obtain a stellar
radius. We also measure a stellar rotation period at P_rot ~ 49.9 d, an upper limit to its XUV (5-920
AA) flux with new Hubble/STIS data, and, for the first time, a variety of element abundances (Fe,
Mg, Si, V, Sr, Zr, Rb) and C/O ratio. Besides, we impose restrictive constraints on the presence of
additional components, either stellar or substellar, in the system. With the input stellar parameters
and the radial-velocity and transit data, we determine the radius and mass of the planet Gl 486 b at
R_p = 1.343+/0.063 R_Terra and M_p = 3.00+/-0.13 M_Terra. From the planet parameters and the stellar
element abundances, we infer the most probable models of planet internal structure and composition,
which are consistent with a relatively small metallic core with respect to the Earth, a deep silicate
mantle, and a thin volatile upper layer. With all these ingredients, we outline prospects for Gl
486 b atmospheric studies, especially with forthcoming James Webb Space Telescope observations
(abridged).

The Euclid mission $-$ with its spectroscopic galaxy survey covering a sky area over $15\,000 \ \mathrm{deg}^2$
in the redshift range $0.9<z<1.8\ -$ will provide a sample of tens of thousands of cosmic voids. This
paper explores for the first time the constraining power of the void size function on the properties
of dark energy (DE) from a survey mock catalogue, the official Euclid Flagship simulation. We identify
voids in the Flagship light-cone, which closely matches the features of the upcoming Euclid spectroscopic
data set. We model the void size function considering a state-of-the art methodology: we rely on
the volume conserving (Vdn) model, a modification of the popular Sheth & van de Weygaert model for
void number counts, extended by means of a linear function of the large-scale galaxy bias. We find
an excellent agreement between model predictions and measured mock void number counts. We compute
updated forecasts for the Euclid mission on DE from the void size function and provide reliable void
number estimates to serve as a basis for further forecasts of cosmological applications using voids.
We analyse two different cosmological models for DE: the first described by a constant DE equation
of state parameter, $w$, and the second by a dynamic equation of state with coefficients $w_0$ and
$w_a$. We forecast $1\sigma$ errors on $w$ lower than the $10\%$, and we estimate an expected figure
of merit (FoM) for the dynamical DE scenario $\mathrm{FoM}_{w_0,w_a} = 17$ when considering only
the neutrino mass as additional free parameter of the model. The analysis is based on conservative
assumptions to ensure full robustness, and is a pathfinder for future enhancements of the technique.
Our results showcase the impressive constraining power of the void size function from the Euclid
spectroscopic sample, both as a stand-alone probe, and to be combined with other Euclid cosmological
probes.

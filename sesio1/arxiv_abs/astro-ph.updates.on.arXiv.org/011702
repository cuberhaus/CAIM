The primordial $^4$He abundance (Y$_p$) is one of the key characteristics of Primordial Nucleosynthesis
processes that occurred in the first minutes after the Big Bang. Its value depends on the baryon/photon
ratio $\eta\equiv n_b/n_{\gamma}$, and is also sensitive to the relativistic degrees of freedom
which affect the expansion rate of the Universe at the radiation-dominated era. The most used method
of the determination of Y$_p$ is the study of the metal deficient HII regions located in blue compact
dwarf galaxies (BCDs). In this paper, we discuss in detail various methods of the determination
of HII region metallicity in the context of Y$_p$ analyses. We show that some procedures used in the
methods lead to biases in the metallicity estimates and underestimation of their uncertainties.
We propose a modified method for the metallicity determination, as well as an additional criterion
for selecting objects. We have selected 69 objects (26 objects with high quality spectra from the
HeBCD+NIR database and 43 objects from the SDSS catalog), for which we estimate Y and O/H using the
proposed method. We have estimated Y$_p=0.2470\pm0.0020$ which is one of the most accurate estimates
obtained up to date. Its comparison with the value Y$_p=0.2470\pm0.0002$ obtained as a result of
numerical modelling of Primordial Nucleosynthesis with the value of $\Omega_b$ taken from the
analysis of the CMB anisotropy (Planck mission), is an important tool for studying the self-consistency
of the Standard cosmological model (a possible discrepancy between these estimates could be an
indicator of a new physics). The application of the proposed method allows one to more correctly
estimate Y$_p$ and the slope $d$Y/$d$(O/H). Further analysis of the data from the SDSS catalog can
significantly increase the statistics of objects for the regression analysis, which in turn can
refine the Y$_p$ estimate.

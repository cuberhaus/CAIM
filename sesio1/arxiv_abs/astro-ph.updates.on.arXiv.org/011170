We present a sample of 318, $z < 1.5$ active galactic nuclei (AGNs) selected from optical photometric
variability in three of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) deep fields (E2, C3, and X3) over a total area
of 4.64 deg$^2$. We construct light curves using difference imaging aperture photometry for resolved
sources and non-difference imaging PSF photometry for unresolved sources, respectively, and
characterize the variability significance. Our DES light curves have a mean cadence of 7 days, a
6 year baseline, and a single-epoch imaging depth of up to $g \sim 24.5$. Using spectral energy distribution
fitting, we find 181 out of total 318 variable galaxies are consistent with dwarf galaxies (with
$M_{\ast}<10^{9.5}\ M_\odot$ at a median photometric redshift of 0.9). However, our stellar mass
estimates are subject to strong model degeneracies and contamination from AGN light. We identify
11 dwarf AGN candidates (a subset at a median photometric redshift of 0.4) by their rapid characteristic
timescales ($\sim$ weeks) of optical variability which independently supports the dwarf hypothesis.
We confirm the low-mass AGN nature of one source with a high S/N optical spectrum. We present a catalog
of variability-selected AGNs with optical light curves and supplementary data, such as X-ray properties
and optical spectra, when available. We measure a variable AGN fraction of $\sim 0.008$ between
$M_{\ast}\sim10^7\ M_\odot$ and $\sim10^{11}\ M_\odot$, with no evidence for a stellar mass dependence.
This work demonstrates the feasibility of using optical variability to identify AGNs with lower
black hole masses than other methods in deep fields, which may be more ``pristine'' analogs of supermassive
black hole (SMBH) seeds. Further work is needed to study the variability characteristics of dwarf
AGNs and improve the statistics to robustly distinguish between seeding mechanisms of SMBHs.

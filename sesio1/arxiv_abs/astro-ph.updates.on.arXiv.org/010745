$\beta$-decay properties of nuclei are investigated within the relativistic nuclear energy density
functional framework by varying the temperature and density, conditions relevant to the final
stages of stellar evolution. Both thermal and nuclear pairing effects are taken into account in
the description of nuclear properties and in the finite temperature proton-neutron relativistic
quasiparticle random-phase approximation (FT-PNRQRPA) to calculate the relevant allowed and
first-forbidden transitions in the $\beta$-decay. The temperature and density effects are studied
on the $\beta$-decay half-lives between temperatures $T = 0-1.5$ MeV, and at densities $\rho Y_e
= 10^7$ g/cm${}^3$ and $10^9$ g/cm${}^3$. The relevant Gamow-Teller transitions are also investigated
for Ti, Fe, Cd, and Sn isotopic chains at finite temperatures. We find that the $\beta$-decay half-lives
increase with increasing density $\rho Y_e$, whereas half-lives generally decrease with increasing
temperature. It is shown that the temperature effects decrease the half-lives considerably in
nuclei with longer half-lives at zero temperature, while only slight changes for nuclei with short
half-lives are obtained. We also show the importance of including the de-excitation transitions
in the calculation of the $\beta$-decay half-lives at finite temperatures. Comparing the FT-PNQRPA
results with the shell-model calculations for $pf-$shell nuclei, a reasonable agreement is obtained
for the temperature dependence of $\beta$-decay rates. Finally, large-scale calculations of
$\beta$-decay half-lives are performed at temperatures $T_9(\text{K}) = 5$ and $T_9(\text{K})
= 10$ and densities $\rho Y_e = 10^7$ g/cm${}^3$ and $10^9$ g/cm${}^3$ for even-even nuclei in the
range $8 \leq Z \leq 82$, relevant for astrophysical nucleosynthesis mechanisms.

Ultra-hot jupiters (UHJs) are giant planets on short orbital periods with high equilibrium temperature
(T_eq) values. Their hot, extended atmospheres are perfect laboratories for transmission spectroscopy
studies based on high-resolution spectrographs. In recent years, a variety of atoms and molecules
were found in their atmospheres, using different methods such as cross-correlation or transmission
and emission spectroscopy. Here, we present the studies of six ultra-hot Jupiters: HAT-P-57b,
KELT-7b, KELT-17b, KELT-21b, MASCARA-1b, and WASP-189b, based on high-resolution observations
obtained with HARPS-N and HARPS spectrographs. By applying line and cross-correlation transmission
spectroscopy methods, we searched for the absorption features of a broad range of atomic and molecular
species. We did not detect any absorption features in our sample of UHJs, with the exception of WASP-189b,
for which we detected FeI, FeII, and TiI using cross-correlation. The transmission spectroscopy
of single lines for WASP-189b revealed several absorption features (including Halpha, Hbeta and
Ca H&K), but they remain tentative pending a better modelling of the gravity darkening deformation
of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. The non-detections with regard to the rest of the planets can
be explained via a combination of stellar pulsations and the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, which
mask possible planetary signals for most of the planets, and by the low signal-to-noise ratios (S/N)
of the observations for KELT-21b. Here, we compare our results with the known population of planets
for which atmospheric detections have been reported in the literature. We find that the empirical
frontier between hot and ultra-hot planets, based on the detection of atomic and ionized species
in their atmospheres, can be established as Teq = 2150 K.

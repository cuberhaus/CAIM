Estimating stellar masses and radii is a challenge for most of the stars but their knowledge is critical
for many different astrophysical fields. One of the most extended techniques for estimating these
variables are the so-called empirical relations. In this work we propose a group of state-of-the-art
AI regression models, with the aim of studying their proficiency in estimating stellar masses and
radii. We publicly release the database, the AI models, and an online tool for stellar mass and radius
estimation to the community. We use a sample of 726 MS stars in the literature with accurate M, R, T_eff,
L, log g, and [Fe/H]. We have split our data sample into training and testing sets and then analyzed
the different AI techniques with them. In particular, we have experimentally evaluated the accuracy
of the following models: Linear Reg., Bayesian Reg., Regression Trees, Random Forest, Support-Vector
Reg. (SVR), Neural Networks, kNN, and Stacking. We propose a series of experiments designed to evaluate
the accuracy of the estimations. We have also analyzed the impact of reducing the number of inputs
parameters and compared our results with those from state-of-the-art empirical relations in the
literature. We have found that a Stacking of several regression models is the most suitable technique
for estimating masses and radii. In the case of the mass, Neural Networks also provide precise results,
and for the radius, SVR and Neural Networks work too. When comparing with other state-of-the-art
empirical relations based models, our Stacking improves the accuracy by a factor of two for both
variables. In addition, bias is reduced to one order of magnitude in the case of the stellar mass.
Finally, we have found that using our Stacking and only T_eff and L as input features, the accuracies
obtained are slightly larger than a 5%, with a bias approx 1.5%.

In this paper, we present our calibrations of the TF relation in the mid-infrared W1 ($3.4\mu$m)
and W2 ($4.6\mu$m) bands, using large samples 848 galaxies and 857 galaxies in the W1 and W2 bands
respectively. In this calibration we performed a correction for the cluster population incompleteness
bias, and a morphological type correction. The calibration was performed using a new, iterative
bivariate fitting procedure. For these calibrations we used the total absolute magnitudes, and
HI linewidths $W_{F50}$ derived from the HI global profiles as a measure of the rotational velocities.
We then performed two additional calibrations on the same sample using (i) the isophotal magnitudes
and (ii) the average rotational velocities measured along the flat sections of the spatially resolved
rotation curves of the galaxies, which were obtained from the empirical conversion between rotational
velocity definitions. We compared these three calibrations to determine whether the use of isophotal
magnitudes, or spatially resolved rotational velocities have a significant impact on the scatter
around the TF relations in the W1 and W2 bands. We found that the original calibrations using total
magnitudes and \hi linewidths had the smallest total scatters. These calibrations are given by
$M_{\rm Tot, W1} = (2.02 \pm 0.44) - (10.08 \pm 0.17)\log_{10}(W_{F50})$ and $M_{\rm Tot, W2} = (2.00
\pm 0.44) - (10.11 \pm 0.17)\log_{10}(W_{F50})$, with associated total scatters of $\sigma_{W1}
= 0.68$ and $\sigma_{W2} = 0.69$. Finally, we compared our calibrations in the mid-infrared bands
with previous calibrations in the near-infrared J, H and K bands and the long-wavelength optical
I band, which used the same two corrections. The differences between these relations can be explained
by considering the different regions and components of spiral galaxies that are traced by the different
wavelengths.

We present the results of 15 years of VISNIR spectral monitoring studying the famously variable
RW Aur A classical T Tauri star (CTTS) system. We find direct evidence for a highly excited classical
T Tauri star surrounded by an IR bright, asymmetric, and time variable accretion disk. Comparison
of the spectral and temporal trends found in long term SpeX monitoring determines 5 different components:
(1) a stable continuum from 0.7 - 1.3 um, with color temperature 4000K, produced by the CTTS photospheric
surface; (2) variable hydrogen emission lines emitted from hot excited hydrogen in the CTTS protostellar
atmosphere-accretion envelope; (3) hot CO gas in the CTTS protostellar atmosphere/accretion
envelope; (4) highly variable 1.8-5.0 um thermal continuum emission with color temperature ranging
from 1130 to 1650K, due to a surrounding accretion disk that is spatially variable and has an inner
wall at r = 0.04 AU and T=1650K, and outer edges at 1130K; and (5) transient signatures of abundant
Fe II + associated SI, SiI, and SrI in the systems jet structures created by the catastrophic disruption
of a planetesimal core. The Fe II signatures first appeared in 2015 as highly bifurcated jet lines,
but these collapsed and disappeared into a small single peak protostellar atmosphere feature by
late 2020. By contrast, nearby, coeval binary companion RW Aur B evinces only (1) a stable WTTS photospheric
continuum from 0.7 - 1.3 um + (3) cold CO gas in absorption + (4) stable 1.8-5.0 um thermal continuum
emission with color temperature 1650K. The temporal evolution of the RW Aur A spectral signatures
we find is consistent with a dynamically excited CTTS system forming differentiated Vesta-sized
planetesimals in an asymmetric accretion disk and migrating them inward to be destructively accreted.

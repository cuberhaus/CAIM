gamma Cas is known for its hard and intense X-ray emission that could trace accretion by a compact
companion, wind interaction with a hot sub-dwarf companion, or magnetic interaction between the
star and its Be decretion disc. These scenarios should lead to diverse dependences of the hard X-ray
emission on disc density. We collected X-ray observations of gamma Cas during an episode of enhanced
disc activity around January 2021. We investigate the variations in the disc properties using time
series of dedicated optical spectroscopy and existing broadband photometry. Epoch-dependent
Doppler maps of the H-alpha, H-beta, and He I 5876 emission lines are built to characterise the emission
regions in velocity space. We analyse 4 XMM-Newton observations taken at key phases of the enhanced
disc activity episode. Archival data are used to study the long-term correlation between optical
and X-ray emission. Optical spectroscopy unveils an increase in the radial extent of the emission
regions during the episode of enhanced disc activity, whilst no increase in the V-band flux is recorded.
Doppler maps do not reveal any stable feature in the disc resulting from the putative action of the
companion on the outer parts of the Be disc. No increase in the hard emission is observed in relation
to the enhanced disc activity. However, at two occasions, the soft X-ray emission of gamma Cas is
strongly attenuated, suggesting more efficient obscuration by a large flaring Be disc. There is
a strong correlation between the long-term variations in the X-ray flux and in the V-band photometry.
The observed behaviour of gamma Cas suggests no direct link between the properties of the outer regions
of the Be disc and the hard X-ray emission, but favours a link between the level of X-ray emission and
the properties of the inner part of the Be disc. These results thus disfavour an accretion or colliding
wind scenario.

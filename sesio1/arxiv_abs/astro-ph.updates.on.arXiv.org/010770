Context. A proper estimate of the chromospheric magnetic fields is believed to improve modelling
of both active region and coronal mass ejection evolution. Aims. We investigate the similarity
between the chromospheric magnetic field inferred from observations and the field obtained from
a magnetohydrostatic (MHS) extrapolation. Methods. Based Fe i 6173 {\AA} and Ca ii 8542 {\AA} observations
of NOAA active region 12723, we employed the spatially-regularised weak-field approximation
(WFA) to derive the vector magnetic field in the chromosphere from Ca ii, as well as non-LTE inversions
of Fe i and Ca ii to infer a model atmosphere for selected regions. Milne-Eddington inversions of
Fe i serve as photospheric boundary for the MHS model that delivers the three-dimensional field,
gas pressure and density. Results. For the line-of-sight component, the MHS chromospheric field
generally agrees with the non-LTE inversions and WFA, but tends to be weaker than those when larger
in magnitude than 300 G. The observationally inferred transverse component is stronger, especially
in magnetically weaker regions, yet the qualitative distribution with height is similar to the
MHS results. For either field component the MHS chromospheric field lacks the fine structure derived
from the inversions. Furthermore, the MHS model does not recover the magnetic imprint from a set
of high fibrils connecting the main polarities. Conclusions. The MHS extrapolation and WFA provide
a qualitatively similar chromospheric field, where the azimuth of the former is better aligned
with Ca ii 8542 {\AA} fibrils than that of the WFA, especially outside strong-field concentrations.
The amount of structure as well as the transverse field strengths are underestimated by the MHS extrapolation.
This underscores the importance of considering a chromospheric magnetic field constraint in data-driven
modelling of active regions.

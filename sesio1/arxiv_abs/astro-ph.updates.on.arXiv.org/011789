Dirty fireballs are a hypothesized class of relativistic massive-star explosions with an initial
Lorentz factor $\Gamma_\mathrm{init}$ below the $\Gamma_\mathrm{init}\sim100$ required to
produce a long-duration gamma-ray burst (LGRB), but which could still produce optical emission
resembling LGRB afterglows. Here we present the results of a search for on-axis optical afterglows
using the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). Our search yielded seven optical transients that resemble
on-axis LGRB afterglows in terms of their red colors ($g-r>0$ mag), faint host galaxy ($r>23$ mag),
and rapid fading ($dr/dt>1$ mag/day). Spectroscopy of the transient emission within a few days
of discovery established cosmological distances ($z=0.876$ to $z=2.9$) for six events, tripling
the number of afterglows with redshift measurements discovered by optical surveys without a $\gamma$-ray
trigger. Upon a retrospective search, four events (ZTF20abbiixp/AT2020kym, ZTF21aagwbjr/AT2021buv,
ZTF21aakruew/AT2021cwd, ZTF21abfmpwn/AT2021qbd) turned out to have a likely associated LGRB
(GRB200524A, GRB210204A, GRB210212B, GRB210610B), while three did not (ZTF20aajnksq/AT2020blt,
ZTF21aaeyldq/AT2021any, ZTF21aayokph/AT2021lfa). Our search revealed no definitive new class
of events: the simplest explanation for the apparently "orphan" events is that they were regular
LGRBs missed by high-energy satellites due to detector sensitivity and duty cycle, although it
is possible that they were intrinsically faint in $\gamma$-rays or viewed slightly off-axis. We
rule out a scenario in which dirty fireballs have a similar energy per solid angle to LGRBs and are
an order of magnitude more common. In addition, we set the first direct constraint on the ratio of
the opening angles of the material producing $\gamma$-rays and the material producing early optical
afterglow emission, finding that they must be comparable.

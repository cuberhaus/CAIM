We trace the overall connectivity of the cosmic web as defined by haloes in the Planck-Millennium
simulation using the persistence and Betti curve analysis developed in our previous papers. We
consider the presence of clustering in excess of the second-order correlation function, and investigate
the extent to which the dark matter haloes reflect the intricate web-like pattern of the underlying
dark matter distribution. With our systematic topological analysis we correlate local information
and halo properties with the multi-scale geometrical environment of the cosmic web, delineated
by elongated filamentary bridges and sheetlike walls that connect compact clusters at the nodes
and define the boundaries of near-empty voids. We capture the multi-scale topology traced by the
discrete spatial halo distribution through filtering the distance field of the corresponding
Delaunay tessellation. The tessellation is naturally adaptive to the local density, perfectly
outlining the local geometry. The resulting nested alpha shapes contain the complete information
on the multi-scale topology. Normalising second-order clustering, we find a remarkable linear
relationship between halo masses and topology: haloes of different mass trace environments with
different topological signature. This is topological bias, a bias independent of the halo clustering
bias associated with the two-point correlation function. Topological bias can be viewed as an environmental
structure bias. We quantify it through a linear relation accounting for selection effects in the
analysis and interpretation of the spatial distribution of galaxies. This mass-dependent scaling
relation allows us to take clustering into account and determine the overall connectivity based
on a limited sample of galaxies. This is of particular relevance with large upcoming galaxy surveys
such as DESI, Euclid, and the Vera Rubin telescope surveys.

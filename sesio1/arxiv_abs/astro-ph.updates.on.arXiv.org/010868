The Fornax cluster provides an unparalleled opportunity to investigate in detail the formation
and evolution of early-type galaxies in a dense environment. We aim at kinematically characterizing
photometrically detected globular cluster (GC) candidates in the core of the cluster. We used the
VLT/VIMOS spectroscopic data from the FVSS survey in the Fornax cluster, covering one square degree
around the central massive galaxy NGC 1399. We confirmed a total of 777 GCs, almost doubling the previously
detected GCs, using the same dataset by Pota et al. (2018). Combined with previous literature radial
velocity measurements of GCs in Fornax, we compiled the most extensive spectroscopic GC sample
of 2341 objects in this environment. We found that red GCs are mostly concentrated around major galaxies,
while blue GCs are kinematically irregular and are widely spread throughout the core region of the
cluster. The velocity dispersion profiles of blue and red GCs show a quite distinct behaviour. Blue
GCs exhibit a sharp increase in the velocity dispersion profile from 250 to 400km/s within 5 arcminutes
(29 kpc/1 reff of NGC 1399) from the central galaxy. The velocity dispersion profile of red GCs follows
a constant value in between 200-300km/s until 8 arcminutes (46 kpc/1.6reff), and then rises to 350km/s
at 10 arcminutes (58 kpc/2 reff). Beyond 10 arcminutes and out to 40 arcminutes (230 kpc/8 reff),
blue and red GCs show a constant velocity dispersion of 300+/-50km/s, indicating that both GC populations
are tracing the cluster potential. We have kinematically confirmed and characterized the previously
photometrically discovered overdensities of intra-cluster GCs. We found that those substructured
intra-cluster regions in Fornax are dominated mostly by blue GCs.

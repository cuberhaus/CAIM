In this work, we study the causal relations between a localised energy release and a remote prominence
oscillation, where the prominence has a realistic thread-like structure. We used an open source
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code known as MPI-AMRVAC to create a multithreaded prominence body.
We introduced an additional energy source from which a shock wave originates, thereby inducing
prominence oscillation. We studied two cases with different source amplitudes to analyze its effect
on the oscillations. Our results show that the frequently used pendulum model does not suffice to
fully estimate the period of the prominence oscillation, in addition to showing that the influence
of the source and the thread-like prominence structure needs to be taken into account. Repeated
reflections and transmissions of the initial shock wave occur at the specific locations of multiple
high-temperature and high-density gradients in the domain. This includes the left and right transition
region (TR) located at the footpoints of the magnetic arcade, as well as the various transition regions
between the prominence and the corona (PCTR). This results in numerous interferences of compressional
waves. They contribute to the restoring forces of the oscillation, causing the period to deviate
from the expected pendulum model, in addition to leading to differences in attributed damping or
even growth in amplitude between the various threads. Along with the global longitudinal motion
that result from the shock impact, small-scale transverse oscillations are also evident. Multiple
high-frequency oscillations represent the propagation of magnetoacoustic waves. The damping
we see is linked to the conversion of energy and its exchange with the surrounding corona. Our simulations
demonstrate the exchange of energy between different threads and their different modes of oscillation.

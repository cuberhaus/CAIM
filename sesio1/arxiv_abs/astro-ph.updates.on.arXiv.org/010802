We identify stellar structures in the PHANGS sample of 74 nearby galaxies and construct morphological
masks of sub-galactic environments based on Spitzer 3.6 micron images. At the simplest level, we
distinguish centres, bars, spiral arms, interarm and discs without strong spirals. Slightly more
sophisticated masks include rings and lenses, publicly released but not explicitly used in this
paper. We examine trends using PHANGS-ALMA CO(2-1) intensity maps and tracers of star formation.
The interarm regions and discs without strong spirals dominate in area, whereas molecular gas and
star formation are quite evenly distributed among the five basic environments. We reproduce the
molecular Kennicutt-Schmidt relation with a slope compatible with unity within the uncertainties,
without significant slope differences among environments. In contrast to early studies, we find
that bars are not always deserts devoid of gas and star formation, but instead they show large diversity.
Similarly, spiral arms do not account for most of the gas and star formation in disc galaxies, and
they do not have shorter depletion times than the interarm regions. Spiral arms accumulate gas and
star formation, without systematically boosting the star formation efficiency. Centres harbour
remarkably high surface densities and on average shorter depletion times than other environments.
Centres of barred galaxies show higher surface densities and wider distributions compared to the
outer disc; yet, depletion times are similar to unbarred galaxies, suggesting highly intermittent
periods of star formation when bars episodically drive gas inflow, without enhancing the central
star formation efficiency permanently. In conclusion, we provide quantitative evidence that
stellar structures in galaxies strongly affect the organisation of molecular gas and star formation,
but their impact on star formation efficiency is more subtle.

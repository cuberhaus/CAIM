Over recent years there has been mounting evidence that accreting supermassive black holes in active
galactic nuclei (AGN) and stellar mass black holes have similar observational signatures: thermal
emission from the accretion disk, X-ray corona, and relativisitic jets. Further, there have been
investigations into whether or not AGN have spectral states similar to that of X-ray binaries (XRBs)
and what parallels can be drawn between the two using a hardness-intensity diagram (HID). To address
whether AGN jets might be related to accretion states as in XRBs, we explore whether populations
of radio-AGN classified according to their radio jet morphology (Fanaroff-Riley classes I and
II; FR I and II), excitation class (HERG and LERG), and radio jet linear extent (compact to giant)
occupy different and distinct regions of the AGN hardness-intensity diagram (total luminosity
vs. hardness). We do this by cross correlating 15 catalogs of radio galaxies with the desired characteristics
from the literature withXMM_Newton and Swift X-ray and ultraviolet (UV) source catalogs. We calculate
the luminosity and hardness from the X-ray and UV photometry, place the sources on the AGN hardness-intensity
diagram, and search for separation of populations and analogies with the XRB spectral state HID.
We find that (a) FR Is and IIs, (b) HERGs and LERGs, (c) FR I-LERGs and FR II-HERGs occupy distinct areas
of the HID at a statistically significant level (p-value < 0.05) and no clear evidence for population
distinction between the different radio jet linear extents. The separation between FR I-LERG and
FR II-HERG populations is the strongest in this work.Our results indicate that radio-loud AGN occupy
distinct areas of the HID depending on the morphology and excitation class, showing strong similarities
to XRBs.

Understanding astrophysical phenomena involving compact objects requires an insight about the
engine behind core-collapse supernovae (SNe) and the fate of the stellar collapse of massive stars.
In particular, this insight is crucial in developing an understanding of the origin and formation
channels of detected population of BH-BH, BH-NS and NS-NS mergers. To gain this understanding,
we must tie our current knowledge of pre-SN stars properties and their potential explosions to the
final NS or BH mass distribution. The timescale of convection growth may have a large effect on the
strength of SN explosion and therefore also on the mass distribution of stellar remnants. In this
study we adopt the new formulas for the relation between the pre-SN star properties and its remnant
from Fryer et al. 2022 in prep. into StarTrack population synthesis code and check how they impact
double compact object (DCO) mergers formed via isolated binary evolution. The new formulas give
one ability to test a wide spectrum of assumptions on the convection growth time. In particular,
different variants allow for a smooth transition between having a deep lower mass gap and a remnant
mass distribution filled by massive NSs and low mass BHs. In this paper we present distribution of
masses, mass ratios and the local merger rate densities of DCO mergers for different variants of
new remnant mass formulas. We test them together with different approaches to other highly uncertain
processes. We find that mass distribution of DCO mergers up to m_1+m_2 < 35 Msun is sensitive to adopted
assumption on SN convection growth timescale. Between the two extreme tested variants the probability
of compact object formation within the lower mass gap may differ up to 2 orders of magnitude. The mass
ratio distribution of DCO mergers is significantly influenced by SN model only for our standard
mass transfer stability criteria.

The supernovae (SNe) associated with gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are generally seen as a homogenous
population, but at least one exception exists, both in terms of luminosity as well as Spectral Energy
Distribution (SED). However, this event, SN 2011kl, was associated with an ultra-long GRB 111209A.
Do such outliers also exist for more typical GRBs? Within the context of a systematic analysis of
photometric signatures of GRB-associated SNe, we found an anomalous bump in the late-time transient
following GRB 140506A. We hereby aim to show this bump is significantly more luminous and blue than
usual SNe following GRBs. We compile all available data from the literature, and add a full analysis
of the Swift UVOT data, which allows us to trace the light curve from the first minutes all the way to
the host galaxy, as well as construct a broad SED of the afterglow that extends the previous SED analysis
based on ground-based spectroscopy. We find robust evidence for a late-time bump/plateau following
the afterglow which shows evidence for a strong colour change, with the spectral slope becoming
flatter in the blue region of the spectrum. This bump can be interpreted as a luminous SN bump which
is spectrally dissimilar to typical GRB-SNe. Correcting it for the large line-of-sight extinction
results in extreme values which make the SN associated with GRB 140506A the most luminous detected
so far. Even so, it would be in agreement with a luminosity-duration relation of GRB-SNe. While not
supported by spectroscopic evidence, it is likely the blue bump following GRB 140506A is the signature
of a SN which is spectrally dissimilar to classical GRB-SNe and more similar to SN 2011kl -- while
being associated with an average GRB, indicating the GRB-SN population is more diverse than thought
so far, and can reach luminosities comparable to those of superluminous SNe.

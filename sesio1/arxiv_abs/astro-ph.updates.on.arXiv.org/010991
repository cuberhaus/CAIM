We use Hubble space telescope data of 45 nearby star-forming galaxies to investigate properties
of Lyman-alpha (Ly$\alpha$) halos, Ly$\alpha$ morphology, and the star-forming characteristics
of galaxies. We study how the morphology of Ly$\alpha$ emission is related to other Ly$\alpha$ observables.
Furthermore, we study the interdependencies of Ly$\alpha$ morphological quantities. We studied
the spatial extent of Ly$\alpha$ using surface brightness profiles in i) using circular apertures
and ii) within faint Ly$\alpha$ isophotes. We measured the average intensity and the size of the
regions with a high star formation rate density. The morphology of the galaxies was quantified by
computing centroid position, axis ratio, and position angle in the Ly$\alpha$, ultraviolet continuum,
and I band maps. We found that galaxies with more extended star-forming regions possess larger Ly$\alpha$
halos. Furthermore, galaxies with more elongated Ly$\alpha$ morphology are also more extended
in Ly$\alpha$. Our data suggest that Ly$\alpha$ bright galaxies appear rounder in their Ly$\alpha$
morphology, and there is less of a contribution from their Ly$\alpha$ halo to their overall luminosity.
We compared our results with studies at high redshift and found that whilst the Ly$\alpha$ extent
in the inner regions of the galaxies in our sample are similar to the high$-z$ Ly$\alpha$ emitters
(LAEs), Ly$\alpha$ halos are more extended in high$-z$ LAEs. Our analysis suggests that the Ly$\alpha$
morphology affects the measurement of other observable quantities concerning Ly$\alpha$ emission,
and some of the conclusions drawn from high redshift LAEs might be biased towards galaxies with specific
Ly$\alpha$ shapes. In particular, faint Ly$\alpha$ emitters have larger Ly$\alpha$ scale lengths
and halo fractions. This implies that faint Ly$\alpha$ emitters are harder to detect at high redshift
than previously believed.

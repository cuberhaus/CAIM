Methoxymethanol (CH3OCH2OH, MM) has been identified through gas-phase signatures in both high-
and low-mass star-forming regions. This molecule is expected to form upon hydrogen addition and
abstraction reactions in CO-rich ice through radical recombination of CO hydrogenation products.
The goal of this work is to investigate experimentally and theoretically the most likely solid-state
MM reaction channel -- the recombination of CH2OH and CH3O radicals -- for dark interstellar cloud
conditions and to compare the formation efficiency with that of other species that were shown to
form along the CO-hydrogenation line. Hydrogen atoms and CO or H2CO molecules are co-deposited
on top of the predeposited H2O ice to mimic the conditions associated with the beginning of 'rapid'
CO freeze-out. Quadrupole mass spectrometry is used to analyze the gas-phase COM composition following
a temperature programmed desorption. Monte Carlo simulations are used for an astrochemical model
comparing the MM formation efficiency with that of other COMs. Unambiguous detection of newly formed
MM has been possible both in CO+H and H2CO+H experiments. The resulting abundance of MM with respect
to CH3OH is about 0.05, which is about 6 times less than the value observed toward NGC 6334I and about
3 times less than the value reported for IRAS 16293B. The results of astrochemical simulations predict
a similar value for the MM abundance with respect to CH3OH factors ranging between 0.06 to 0.03. We
find that MM is formed by co-deposition of CO and H2CO with H atoms through the recombination of CH2OH
and CH3O radicals. In both the experimental and modeling studies, the efficiency of this channel
alone is not sufficient to explain the observed abundance of MM. These results indicate an incomplete
knowledge of the reaction network or the presence of alternative solid-state or gas-phase formation
mechanisms.

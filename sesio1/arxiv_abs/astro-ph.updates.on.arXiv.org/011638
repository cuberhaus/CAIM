Aims: Develop a data-driven and statistically based method for finding such clumps in Integrals
of Motion space for nearby halo stars and evaluating their significance robustly. Methods: We use
data from Gaia EDR3 extended with radial velocities from ground-based spectroscopic surveys to
construct a sample of halo stars within 2.5 kpc from the Sun. We apply a hierarchical clustering method
that uses the single linkage algorithm in a 3D space defined by the commonly used integrals of motion
energy $E$, together with two components of the angular momentum, $L_z$ and $L_\perp$. To evaluate
the statistical significance of the clusters found, we compare the density within an ellipsoidal
region centered on the cluster to that of random sets with similar global dynamical properties.
We pick out the signal at the location of their maximum statistical significance in the hierarchical
tree. We estimate the proximity of a star to the cluster center using the Mahalanobis distance. We
also apply the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm in velocity space. Results: Our procedure identifies
67 highly significant clusters ($ > 3\sigma$), containing 12\% of the sources in our halo set, and
in total 232 subgroups or individual streams in velocity space. In total, 13.8\% of the stars in our
data set can be confidently associated to a significant cluster based on their Mahalanobis distance.
Inspection of our data set reveals a complex web of relationships between the significant clusters,
suggesting that they can be tentatively grouped into at least 6 main structures, many of which can
be associated to previously identified halo substructures, and a number of independent substructures.
This preliminary conclusion is further explored in an accompanying paper by Ruiz-Lara et al., where
we also characterize the substructures in terms of their stellar populations. Conclusions: We

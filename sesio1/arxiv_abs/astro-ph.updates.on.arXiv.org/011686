We aim at characterizing the hot phase of the Circum-Galactic Medium in a large sample of galaxies.
We stack X-ray events from the SRG/eROSITA eFEDS survey around central galaxies in the GAMA 9hr field
to construct radially projected soft X-ray luminosity profiles as a function of their stellar mass
and specific star formation rate. We consider samples of quiescent (star-forming) galaxies in
the stellar mass range $2\times 10^{10}$ -- $10^{12}$ M$_\odot$ ($3\times 10^9$ -- $6\times10^{11}$
M$_\odot$). For quiescent galaxies, the X-ray profiles are clearly extended throughout the available
mass range; however, the measured profile is likely biased high due to projection effects, as these
galaxies tend to live in dense and hot environments. For the most massive star forming samples ($\geq10^{11}$
M$_\odot$), there is a hint of detection of extended emission. For star-forming galaxies with $<
10^{11}$ M$_\odot$ the X-ray stacked profiles are compatible with unresolved sources and consistent
with the expected emission from faint Active Galactic Nuclei and X-ray binaries. We measure for
the first time the mean relation between average X-ray luminosity and stellar mass separately for
quiescent and star-forming galaxies. High-mass ($\geq 10^{11}$ M$_\odot$) star-forming or quiescent
galaxies follow the expected scaling of virialized hot haloes, while lower mass star-forming galaxies
show a less prominent luminosity and a weaker dependence on stellar mass, consistent with empirical
models of the weak AGN population. When comparing our results with state-of-the art numerical simulations,
we find an overall consistency on large ($>80$ kpc) scales at masses $\geq 10^{11}$ M$_\odot$, but
disagreement on the small scales, where brighter than observed compact cores are predicted. Simulations
also do not predict the clear differentiation that we observe between quiescent and star-forming
galaxies.

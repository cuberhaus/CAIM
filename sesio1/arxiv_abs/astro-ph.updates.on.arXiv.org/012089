Tidal dissipation is responsible for circularizing the orbits and synchronizing the spins of solar-type
close binary stars, but the mechanisms responsible are not fully understood. Previous work has
indicated that significant enhancements to the theoretically-predicted tidal dissipation rates
are required to explain the observed circularization periods ($P_\mathrm{circ}$) in various
stellar populations, and their evolution with age. This was based partly on the common belief that
the dominant mechanism of tidal dissipation in solar-type stars is turbulent viscosity acting
on equilibrium tides in convective envelopes. In this paper we study tidal dissipation in both convection
and radiation zones of rotating solar-type stars following their evolution. We study equilibrium
tide dissipation, incorporating a frequency-dependent effective viscosity motivated by the
latest hydrodynamical simulations, and inertial wave (dynamical tide) dissipation, adopting
a frequency-averaged formalism that accounts for the realistic structure of the star. We demonstrate
that the observed binary circularization periods can be explained by inertial wave (dynamical
tide) dissipation in convective envelopes. This mechanism is particularly efficient during pre-main
sequence phases, but it also operates on the main sequence if the spin is close to synchronism. The
predicted $P_\mathrm{circ}$ due to this mechanism increases with main-sequence age in accord
with observations. We also demonstrate that both equilibrium tide and internal gravity wave dissipation
are unlikely to explain the observed $P_\mathrm{circ}$, even during the pre-main sequence, based
on our best current understanding of these mechanisms. Finally, we advocate more realistic dynamical
studies of stellar populations that employ tidal dissipation due to inertial waves.

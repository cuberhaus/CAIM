We report {\it HST} COS spectroscopy of 10 quasars with foreground star-forming galaxies at 0.02$<$$z$$<$
0.14 within impact parameters of $\sim$1-7 kpc. We detect damped/sub-damped Ly$\alpha$ absorption
in 100$\%$ of cases where no higher-redshift Lyman-limit systems extinguish the flux at the expected
wavelength of Ly$\alpha$ absorption, obtaining the largest targeted sample of DLA/sub-DLAs in
low-redshift galaxies. We present absorption measurements of neutral hydrogen and metals. Additionally,
we present GBT 21-cm emission measurements for 5 of the galaxies (including 2 detections). Combining
our sample with the literature, we construct a sample of 115 galaxies associated with DLA/sub-DLAs
spanning 0$<$$z$$<$4.4, and examine trends between gas and stellar properties, and with redshift.
The H~I column density is anti-correlated with impact parameter and stellar mass. More massive
galaxies appear to have gas-rich regions out to larger distances. The specific SFR (sSFR) of absorbing
galaxies increases with redshift and decreases with $M^{\ast}$, consistent with evolution of
the star-formation main sequence (SFMS). However, $\sim$20$\%$ of absorbing galaxies lie below
the SFMS, indicating that some DLA/sub-DLAs trace galaxies with longer-than-typical gas-depletion
time-scales. Most DLA/sub-DLA galaxies with 21-cm emission have higher H I masses than typical
galaxies with comparable $M^{\ast}$. High $M_{\rm H I}/M^{\ast}$ ratios and high sSFRs in DLA/sub-DLA
galaxies with $M^{\ast}$$<$$10^{9}$$M_{\odot}$ suggest these galaxies may be gas-rich because
of recent gas accretion rather than inefficient star formation. Our study demonstrates the power
of absorption and emission studies of DLA/sub-DLA galaxies for extending galaxy-evolution studies
to previously under-explored regimes of low $M^{\ast}$ and low SFR.

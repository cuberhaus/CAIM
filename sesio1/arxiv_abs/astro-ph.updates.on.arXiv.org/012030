We analysed the sunspot group data from Greenwich Photoheliographic Results (GPR) during 1874-1976
and Debrecen Photoheliographic Data (DPD) during 1977-2017 and studied the cycle-to-cycle variations
in the values of 13-month smoothed monthly mean sunspot-group area in whole sphere (WSGA), northern
hemisphere (NSGA), and southern hemisphere (SSGA) at the epochs of maxima of Sunspot Cycles 12-24,
and at the epochs of maxima of WSGA, NSGA, and SSGA Cycles 12-24. The cosine fits to the values of WSGA,
NSGA, and SSGA at the maxima of the sunspot number, WSGA, NSGA, and SSGA Cycles 12-24, and to the values
of the corresponding north-south asymmetry, suggest the existence of a ~132-year periodicity
in the activity of northern hemisphere, a 54-66-year periodicity in the activity of southern hemisphere,
and a 50-66 year periodicity in the north-south asymmetry in activity at all the aforementioned
epochs. By extrapolating the best-fit cosine curves we predicted the amplitudes and the corresponding
north-south asymmetry of the 25th WSGA, NSGA, and SSGA cycles. We find that on average Solar Cycle
25 in sunspot-group area would be to some extent smaller than Solar Cycle 24 in sunspot-group area.
However, by inputting the predicted amplitudes of the 25th WSGA, NSGA, and SSGA cycles in the linear
relationship between sunspot-group area and sunspot number we find that the amplitude (130 +or-
12) of Sunspot Cycle 25 would be slightly larger than that of reasonably small Sunspot Cycle 24. Still
it confirms that the beginning of the upcoming Gleissberg cycle would take place around Solar Cycle
25. We also find that except at the maximum of NSGA Cycle 25 where the strength of activity in northern
hemisphere would be dominant, the strength of activity in the southern hemisphere would be dominant
at the maximum epochs of the 25th sunspot, WSGA, and SSGA cycles.

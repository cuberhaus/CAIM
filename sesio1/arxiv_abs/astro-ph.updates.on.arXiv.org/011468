The TRAPPIST-1 planetary system is favourable for transmission spectroscopy and offers the unique
opportunity to study rocky planets with possibly non-primary envelopes. We present here the transmission
spectrum of the seventh planet of the TRAPPIST-1 system, TRAPPIST-1 h (R$_{\rm P}$=0.752 R$_{\oplus}$,
T$_{\rm eq}$=173K) using Hubble Space Telescope (HST), Wide Field Camera 3 Grism 141 (WFC3/G141)
data. First we extracted and corrected the raw data to obtain a transmission spectrum in the near-infrared
(NIR) band (1.1-1.7$\mu$m). We corrected for stellar modulations using three different stellar
contamination models; while some fit the data better, they are statistically not significant and
the conclusion remains unchanged concerning the presence or lack thereof of an atmosphere. Finally,
using a Bayesian atmospheric retrieval code, we put new constraints on the atmosphere composition
of TRAPPIST-1h. According to the retrieval analysis, there is no evidence of molecular absorption
in the NIR spectrum. This suggests the presence of a high cloud deck or a layer of photochemical hazes
in either a primary atmosphere or a secondary atmosphere dominated by heavy species such as nitrogen.
This result could even be the consequence of the lack of an atmosphere as the spectrum is better fitted
using a flat line. We cannot yet distinguish between a primary cloudy or a secondary clear envelope
using HST/WFC3 data; however, in most cases with more than 3$\sigma$ confidence, we can reject the
hypothesis of a clear atmosphere dominated by hydrogen and helium. By testing the forced secondary
atmospheric scenario, we find that a CO-rich atmosphere (i.e. with a volume mixing ratio of 0.2)
is one of the best fits to the spectrum with a Bayes factor of 1.01, corresponding to a 2.1$\sigma$
detection.

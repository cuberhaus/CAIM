Machine Learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.
It is divided into supervised learning, where the computer is presented with examples of entries,
and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs, and unsupervised learning, where
no label is provided to the learning algorithm, leaving it alone to find structures. Deep learning
is a branch of machine learning based on artificial neural networks, which are an interconnected
group of nodes, inspired by a simplification of neurons in a brain. In asteroid dynamics, machine
learning methods have been recently used to identify members of asteroid families, small bodies
images in astronomical fields, and to identify resonant arguments images of asteroids in three-body
resonances, among other applications. Here we will conduct a full review of available literature
in the field, and classify it in terms of metrics recently used by other authors to assess the state
of the art of applications of machine learning in other astronomical sub-fields. While applications
of machine learning to Solar System bodies, an area that includes imaging and spectrophotometry
of small bodies, have already reached a state classified as progressing, with more established
research communities and methodologies, and articles where the use of ML lead to discovery of new
celestial objects or features, or to new insights in the area, ML applied to asteroid dynamics is
still in the emerging phase, with smaller groups, methodologies still not well-established, and
fewer papers producing new discoveries or insights. The still pioneering nature of research in
the area means that much room of improvement is still available, and that several new enticing scientific
discoveries may surge by applications of these new techniques in the next years.

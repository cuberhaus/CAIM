The $\beta$ Cephei pulsators are massive main-sequence stars, presenting low radial-order modes.
These modes probe in particular the chemical gradient at the edge of the convective core. They hence
give constraints on macroscopic processes, such as hydrodynamic or magnetic instabilities. Yet,
it is not clear to what extent the seismic inferences depend on the physics employed for the stellar
modelling or on the observational dataset. We investigate the observational constraints which
are necessary to provide accurate constraints on the mixing processes in $\beta$ Cephei stars.
We explore the importance of the identification of the angular degree of modes. Depending on the
quality of the seismic dataset and the classical constraints, we estimate the precision achievable
with asteroseismology. We propose a method extending the forward approach classically used to
model $\beta$ Cephei stars The probability distributions of the asteroseismic-derived stellar
parameters are obtained. With these distributions, we provide a systemic way to estimate the errors
of the modelling. A particular effort is made to also include the theoretical uncertainties of the
models. We then estimate the accuracy and precision of asteroseismology for $\beta$ Cephei stars
in a series of hare and hound exercises. The exercises show that a set of four to five oscillation frequencies
with an identified angular degree already leads to accurate inferences on the stellar parameters.
Without the identification of the modes, the addition of other classical observational constraints
allow to succeed the seismic modelling. When the micro-physics of the star and stellar models used
for the modelling differ, the constraints derived on the internal structure remain valid if expressed
in terms of acoustic variables. The characterisation of the mixing processes at the boundary of
the convective core remain model-dependent.

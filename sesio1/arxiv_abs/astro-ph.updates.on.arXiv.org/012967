The last generation of X-ray focusing telescopes operating outside the Earth's radiation belt
discovered that optics were able to focus not only astrophysical X-ray photons, but also low-energy
heliophysical protons entering the Field of View (FOV). This "soft proton" contamination affects
around 40\% of the observation time of XMM-Newton. The ATHENA Charged Particle Diverter (CPD) was
designed to use magnetic fields to move these soft protons away from the FOV of the detectors, separating
the background-contributing ions in the focused beam from the photons of interest. These magnetically
deflected protons can hit other parts of the payload and scatter back to the focal plane instruments.
Evaluating the impact of this secondary scattering with accurate simulations is essential for
the CPD scientific assessment. However, while Geant4 simulations of grazing soft proton scattering
on X-ray mirrors have been recently validated, the scattering on the unpolished surfaces of the
payload (e.g. the baffle or the diverter itself) is still to be verified with experimental results.
Moreover, the roughness structure can affect the energy and angle of the scattered protons, with
a scattering efficiency depending on the specific target volume. Using Atomic Force Microscopy
to take nanometer-scale surface roughness measurements from different materials and coating
samples, we use Geant4 together with the CADMesh library to shoot protons at these very detailed
surface roughness models to understand the effects of different material surface roughnesses,
coatings, and compositions on proton energy deposition and scattering angles. We compare and validate
the simulation results with laboratory experiments, and propose a framework for future proton
scattering experiments.

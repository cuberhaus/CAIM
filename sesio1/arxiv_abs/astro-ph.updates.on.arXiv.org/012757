The fourth Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) catalog (4FGL) contains 5064 $\gamma$-ray sources
detected at high significance, but 26% of them still lack associations at other wavelengths. Identifying
these unknown $\gamma$-ray sources is one of the major scientific goals in high-energy astronomy.
The SPT-SZ survey, conducted between 2008 and 2011 with the South Pole Telescope (SPT), covers 2500
$\mathrm{deg^2}$ of the Southern sky in three millimeter-wavelength (mm) bands and was used to
construct a catalog of nearly 5000 emissive sources. In this study, we introduce a new cross-matching
scheme to search for multi-wavelength counterparts of extragalactic $\gamma$-ray sources using
a mm catalog. We apply a Poissonian probability to evaluate the rate of spurious false associations
and compare the multi-wavelength associations from the radio, mm, near-infrared, and X-ray with
$\gamma$-ray sources in the 4FGL catalog. In the SPT-SZ survey field, 85% of 4FGL sources are associated
with mm counterparts. These mm sources include 94% of previously associated 4FGL sources and 56%
of previously unassociated 4FGL sources. The latter group contains 40 4FGL sources for which SPT
has provided the first identified counterparts. Nearly all of the SPT-associated 4FGL sources
can be described as flat-spectrum radio quasars or blazars. We find that the mm band is the most efficient
wavelength for detecting $\gamma$-ray blazars when considering both completeness and purity.
We also demonstrate that the mm band correlates better to the $\gamma$-ray band than the radio or
X-ray bands. With the next generation of CMB experiments, this technique can be extended to greater
sensitivities and more sky area to further complete the identifications of the remaining unknown
$\gamma$-ray blazars.

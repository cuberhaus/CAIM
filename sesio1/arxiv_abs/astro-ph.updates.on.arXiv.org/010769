Due to the increasing number of observations Type Ia supernovae are nowadays regarded as a heterogeneous
class of objects consisting of several subclasses. One of the largest of these is the class of Type
Iax supernovae (SNe Iax) which have been suggested to originate from pure deflagrations in CO Chandrasekhar-mass
white dwarfs (WDs). Although a few deflagration studies have been carried out, the full diversity
of the class is not captured yet. We therefore present a parameter study of single-spot ignited deflagrations
with varying ignition locations, central densities, metallicities and compositions. We also
explore a rigidly rotating progenitor and carry out 3D hydrodynamic simulations, nuclear network
calculations and radiative transfer. The new models extend the range in brightness covered by previous
studies to the lower end. Our explosions produce $^{56}$Ni masses from $5.8 \times 10^{-3}$ to $9.2
\times 10^{-2}\,M_\odot$. In spite of the wide exploration of the parameter space the main characteristics
of the models are primarily driven by the mass of $^{56}$Ni. Secondary parameters have too little
impact to explain the observed trend among faint SNe~Iax. We report kick velocities of the bound
explosion remnants from $6.9$ to $369.8\,$km$\,s^{-1}$. The wide exploration of the parameter
space and viewing-angle effects in the radiative transfer lead to a significant spread in the synthetic
observables. The trends towards the faint end of the class are, however, not reproduced. This motivates
a quantification of the systematic uncertainties in the modeling procedure and the influence of
the $^{56}$Ni-rich bound remnant. While the pure deflagration scenario remains a favorable explanation
for bright and intermediate luminosity SNe~Iax, the possibility that SNe~Iax do not consist of
a single explosion scenario needs to be considered.

Despite the growing number of gamma-ray sources detected by Fermi-LAT, about one third of the sources
in each survey remains of uncertain type. We present a new deep neural network approach for the classification
of unidentified or unassociated gamma-ray sources in the last release of the Fermi-LAT catalogue
(4FGL-DR2) obtained with 10 years of data. In contrast to previous work, our method directly uses
the measurements of the photon energy spectrum and time series as input for the classification,
instead of specific, human-crafted features. Dense neural networks, and for the first time in the
context of gamma-ray source classification recurrent neural networks, are studied in depth. We
focus on the separation between extragalactic sources, i.e.\ Active Galactic Nuclei, and Galactic
pulsars, and on the further classification of pulsars into young and millisecond pulsars. Our neural
network architectures provide powerful classifiers, with a performance that is comparable to
previous analyses based on human-crafted features. Our benchmark neural network predicts that
of the sources of uncertain type in the 4FGL-DR2, 1050 are Active Galactic Nuclei and 78 are Galactic
pulsars, with both classes following the expected sky distribution and the clustering in the variability-curvature
plane. We investigate the problem of sample selection bias by testing our architectures against
a cross-match test data set using an older catalogue, and propose a feature selection algorithm
using autoencoders. Our list of high-confidence candidate sources labelled by the neural networks
provides a set of targets for further multiwavelength observations addressed to identify their
nature. The deep neural network architectures we develop can be easily extended to include specific
features, as well as multiwavelength data on the source photon energy and time spectra coming from
different instruments.

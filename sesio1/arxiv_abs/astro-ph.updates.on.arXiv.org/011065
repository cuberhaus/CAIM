We determined effective temperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities for a sample of 343
M dwarfs observed with CARMENES, the double-channel, high-resolution spectrograph installed
at the 3.5 m telescope at Calar Alto Observatory. We employed SteParSyn, a Bayesian spectral synthesis
implementation particularly designed to infer the stellar atmospheric parameters of late-type
stars following a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. We made use of the BT-Settl model atmospheres
and the radiative transfer code turbospectrum to compute a grid of synthetic spectra around 75 magnetically
insensitive Fe I and Ti I lines plus the TiO $\gamma$ and $\epsilon$ bands. To avoid any potential
degeneracy in the parameter space, we imposed Bayesian priors on Teff and log g based on the comprehensive,
multi-band photometric data available for the sample. We find that this methodology is suitable
down to M7.0 V, where refractory metals such as Ti are expected to condense in the stellar photospheres.
The derived $T_{\rm eff}$, $\log{g}$, and [Fe/H] range from 3000 to 4200 K, 4.5 to 5.3 dex, and -0.7
to 0.2 dex, respectively. Although our $T_{\rm eff}$ scale is in good agreement with the literature,
we report large discrepancies in the [Fe/H] scales, which might arise from the different methodologies
and sets of lines considered. However, our [Fe/H] is in agreement with the metallicity distribution
of FGK-type stars in the solar neighbourhood and correlates well with the kinematic membership
of the targets in the Galactic populations. Lastly, excellent agreement in $T_{\rm eff}$ is found
for M dwarfs with interferometric angular diameter measurements, as well as in the [Fe/H] between
the components in the wide physical FGK+M and M+M systems included in our sample.

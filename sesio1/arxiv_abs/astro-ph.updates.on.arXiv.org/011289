With the increased sensitivity and resolution of radio interferometry the study of the collimation
and acceleration region of jets in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) has come into focus within the last
years. Whereas a large fraction of AGN jets reveal a change from parabolic to conical collimation
around the Bondi radius, a small number of sources deviate from this standard picture, including
the radio galaxy NGC1052. We study the jet width profile, which provides valuable information about
the interplay between the central engine and accretion disk system and the collimation and acceleration
zone of the jets. We observed the double-sided active galaxy NGC1052 at six frequencies with the
VLBA in 2017 and at 22GHz with RadioAstron in 2016. These data are combined with archival 15, 22, and
43 GHz multi-epoch VLBA observations. From ridge-line fitting we obtained width measurements
along the jet and counter-jet which were fitted with broken power-laws. We find a break in the jet
collimation profile at ~10^4 R_s (Schwarzschild radii). Downstream of the break the collimation
is conical with a power-law index of 1.0 - 1.2 (cylindrical 0; parabolic 0.5; conical 1). The upstream
power-law index of 0.36 for the approaching jet is neither cylindrical nor parabolic and for the
receding jet with 0.16 close-to cylindrical. Both jets have an opening angle of ~30 degree at a distance
of ~10^3 R_S and are well collimated with an opening angle of <10 degrees downstream of the break.
There are significant differences in the upstream collimation profile between approaching (Eastern)
and receding (Western) jet. Absorption or scattering in the surrounding torus as well as an accretion
wind may mimic a cylindrical profile. We need to increase the observing frequencies, which do not
suffer from absorption to find the true jet collimation profile upstream of 10^4 R_s.

Due to the complexity of modeling the radiative transfer inside the accretion columns of neutron
star binaries, their X-ray spectra are still commonly described with phenomenological models,
for example, a cutoff power law. While the behavior of these models is well understood and they allow
for a comparison of different sources and studying source behavior, the extent to which the underlying
physics can be derived from the model parameters is very limited. During recent years, several physically
motivated spectral models have been developed to overcome these limitations. Their application,
however, is generally computationally much more expensive and they require a high number of parameters
which are difficult to constrain. Previous works have presented an analytical solution to the radiative
transfer equation inside the accretion column assuming a velocity profile that is linear in the
optical depth. An implementation of this solution that is both fast and accurate enough to be fitted
to observed spectra is available as a model in XSPEC. The main difficulty of this implementation
is that some solutions violate energy conservation and therefore have to be rejected by the user.
We propose a novel fitting strategy that ensures energy conservation during the $\chi^2$-minimization
which simplifies the application of the model considerably. We demonstrate this approach as well
a study of possible parameter degeneracies with a comprehensive Markov-chain Monte Carlo analysis
of the complete parameter space for a combined NuSTAR and Swift/XRT dataset of Cen X-3. The derived
accretion-flow structure features a small column radius of $\sim$63 m and a spectrum dominated
by bulk-Comptonization of bremsstrahlung seed photons, in agreement with previous studies.

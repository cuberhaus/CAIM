The [CII] 158$\mu$m fine-structure line is the dominant cooling line of moderate-density photodissociation
regions (PDRs) illuminated by moderately bright far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation fields. We aim
to understand the origin of [CII] emission and its relation to other tracers of gas and dust in PDRs.
One focus is a study of the heating efficiency of interstellar gas as traced by the [CII] line to test
models of the photoelectric heating of neutral gas by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules
and very small grains. We make use of a one-square-degree map of velocity-resolved [CII] line emission
toward the Orion Nebula complex, and split this out into the individual spatial components, the
expanding Veil Shell, the surface of OMC4, and the PDRs associated with the compact HII region of
M43 and the reflection nebula NGC 1977. We employed Herschel far-infrared photometric images to
determine dust properties. Moreover, we compared with Spitzer mid-infrared photometry to trace
hot dust and large molecules, and velocity-resolved IRAM 30m CO(2-1) observations of the molecular
gas. The [CII] intensity is tightly correlated with PAH emission in the IRAC 8$\mu$m band and far-infrared
emission from warm dust. The correlation between [CII] and CO(2-1) is very different in the four
subregions and is very sensitive to the detailed geometry. Constant-density PDR models are able
to reproduce the observed [CII], CO(2-1), and integrated far-infrared (FIR) intensities. We observe
strong variations in the photoelectric heating efficiency in the Veil Shell behind the Orion Bar
and these variations are seemingly not related to the spectral properties of the PAHs. The [CII]
emission from the Orion Nebula complex stems mainly from moderately illuminated PDR surfaces.
Future observations with the James Webb Space Telescope can shine light on the PAH properties that
may be linked to these variations.

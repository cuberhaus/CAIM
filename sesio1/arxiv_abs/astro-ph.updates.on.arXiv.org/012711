[Abridged] We map the stellar age distribution ($\lesssim 1$ Gyr) across a 6kpc$\,\times\,$6kpc
area of the Galactic disc to constrain our Galaxy's recent star-formation history. Our modelling
draws on the sample of Zari et al. (2021) that encompasses all presumed disc OBA stars ($\sim 500,000$
sources) with $G<16$. To be less sensitive to reddening, we do not forward model the detailed CMD
distribution of these stars, but instead the K-band absolute magnitude distribution, $n(M_K)$,
among stars with $M_K<0$ and $T_{\mathrm{eff}} > 7000$K at a certain positions $\vec{x}$ in the
disc as a step function with five age bins, $b(\tau~|~\vec{x}, \vec{\alpha})$, logarithmically-spaced
in age from $\tau = 5$ Myr to $\tau = 1$ Gyr. Given a set of isochrones and a Kroupa (2001) initial mass
function, we sample $b(\tau\,|\,\vec{x}, \vec{\alpha})$ to maximize the likelihood of the data,
accounting for the selection function. This results in a set of mono-age stellar density maps across
a sizeable portion of the Galactic disc. These maps show that some, but not all, spiral arms are reflected
in overdensities of stars younger than 500 Myr. The maps of the youngest stars ($<10$ Myr) trace major
star forming regions. The maps at all ages exhibit an outward density gradient and distinct spiral-like
spatial structure, which is qualitatively similar on large scales among all age intervals. When
summing over the maps' area and extrapolating to the whole disc, we find an effective star-formation
rate over the last 10 Myr of $\approx 3.3 \mathrm{M_{\odot}/yr}$, higher than previously published
estimates. Remarkably, our stellar age distribution implies that the star-formation rate has
been three times lower throughout most of the last Gyr, having risen distinctly only in the very recent
past.

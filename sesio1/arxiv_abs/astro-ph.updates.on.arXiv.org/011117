We investigate the implications of the current data regarding large scale anisotropies, and examine
to what extent they can be used to constrain the origin of UHECRs and the astrophysical parameters
of the source scenarios. We discuss the possibility of observing an associated anisotropy of the
composition, the potential benefit of the separation of the different nuclear components and the
interest of observing the UHECR sky with larger exposure future observatories. We simulate UHECR
sky maps for various astrophysical scenarios satisfying the current observational constraints,
taking into account the energy losses of the UHE protons and nuclei and their deflections by intervening
magnetic fields. We investigate scenarios in which the UHECR source distribution follows that
of the galaxies, varying the source composition and spectrum, the source density and the magnetic
field models. We apply similar analyses as those used by the Auger collaboration. We find that: i)
reproducing the observed dipole anisotropy and its energy evolution is relatively easy within
our assumptions; ii) this agreement can be obtained with different sets of assumptions on the astrophysical
parameters, and is thus not, at this stage, very constraining for UHECR source scenarios; iii) the
actual reconstructed direction of the dipole appears non natural in essentially all scenarios
investigated, and challenges their main assumptions on the source distribution or the assumed
magnetic field configuration, especially in the Galaxy; iv) except for protons, the energy range
in which the GZK horizon strongly reduces is a key target for anisotropy searches for each given nuclear
species; v) The composition anisotropy naturally expected in our models is unlikely to account
for that recently reported by Auger unless the observed amplitude is a strong positive statistical
fluctuation of an intrinsically weaker signal.

The Wide Field Imager (WFI) flying on Athena will usher in the next era of studying the hot and energetic
Universe. WFI observations of faint, diffuse sources will be limited by uncertainty in the background
produced by high-energy particles. These particles produce easily identified "cosmic-ray tracks"
along with signals from secondary photons and electrons generated by particle interactions with
the instrument. The signal from these secondaries is identical to the X-rays focused by the optics,
and cannot be filtered without also eliminating these precious photons. As part of a larger effort
to understand the WFI background, we here present results from a study of background-reduction
techniques that exploit the spatial correlation between cosmic-ray particle tracks and secondary
events. We use Geant4 simulations to generate a realistic particle background, sort this into simulated
WFI frames, and process those frames in a similar way to the expected flight and ground software to
produce a WFI observation containing only particle background. The technique under study, Self
Anti-Coincidence or SAC, then selectively filters regions of the detector around particle tracks,
turning the WFI into its own anti-coincidence detector. We show that SAC is effective at improving
the systematic uncertainty for observations of faint, diffuse sources, but at the cost of statistical
uncertainty due to a reduction in signal. If sufficient pixel pulse-height information is telemetered
to the ground for each frame, then this technique can be applied selectively based on the science
goals, providing flexibility without affecting the data quality for other science. The results
presented here are relevant for any future silicon-based pixelated X-ray imaging detector, and
could allow the WFI and similar instruments to probe to truly faint X-ray surface brightness.

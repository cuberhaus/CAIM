Infrared space interferometers can surpass the spatial resolution limitations of single-dish
space telescopes. However, stellar interferometers from space have not been realized because
of technical difficulties. Two beams coming from individual satellites separated by more than
a few tens of meters should precisely interfere such that the optical-path and angular differences
between the two beams are reduced at the wavelength level. Herein, we propose a novel beam combiner
for space interferometers that records the spectrally-resolved interferometric fringes using
the densified pupil spectroscopic technique. As the detector plane is optically conjugated to
a plane, on which the two beams interfere, we can directly measure the relative phase difference
between the two beams. Additionally, when an object within the field of view is obtained with a modest
signal-to-noise ratio, we can extract the true complex amplitude from a continuous broadband fringe
(i.e., one exposure measurement), without scanning a delay line and chopping interferometry.
We discovered that this spectral imaging method is validated for observing the solar system objects
by simulating the reflected light from Europa with a small stellar interferometer. However, because
the structure of the object spectrum may cause a systematic error in the measurement, this method
may be limited in extracting the true complex amplitude for other astronomical objects. Applying
this spectral imaging method to general astrophysics will facilitate further research. The beam
combiner and spectral imaging method are applied to a formation-flying stellar interferometer
with multiple small satellites in a Sun-synchronous orbit for observation of the solar system objects
in visible and near-infrared. We present an overview of SEIRIOS and the optimized optical design
for a limited-volume spacecraft.

Inspired by the statistical mechanics of an ensemble of interacting particles (BBGKY hierarchy),
we propose to account for small-scale inhomogeneities in self-gravitating astrophysical fluids
by deriving a non-ideal Virial theorem and non-ideal Navier-Stokes equations using a decomposition
of the gravitational force into a near- and far-field component. These equations involve the pair
radial distribution function (similar to the two-point correlation function), similarly to the
interaction energy and equation of state in liquids. Small-scale correlations lead to a non-ideal
amplification of the gravitational interaction energy, whose omission leads to a missing mass
problem, e.g., in galaxies and galaxy clusters. We also propose an extension of the Friedmann equations
in the non-ideal regime. We estimate the non-ideal amplification factor of the gravitational interaction
energy of the baryons to lie between 5 and 20, potentially explaining the observed value of the Hubble
parameter. Within this framework, the acceleration of the expansion emerges naturally because
of the increasing number of sub-structures induced by gravitational collapse, which increases
their contribution to the total gravitational energy. A simple estimate predicts a non-ideal deceleration
parameter qni~-1;this is potentially the first determination of the observed value based on an
intuitively physical argument. We suggest that correlations and gravitational interactions
could produce a transition to a viscous regime that can lead to flat rotation curves. This transition
could also explain the dichotomy between (Keplerian) LSB elliptical galaxy and (non-Keplerian)
spiral galaxy rotation profiles. Overall, our results demonstrate that non-ideal effects induced
by inhomogeneities must be taken into account in order to properly determine the gravitational
dynamics of galaxies and the larger scale universe.

We present a sample of 135,873 RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) with precise photometric metallicity and distance
estimates from our newly calibrated $P$-$\phi_{31}$-[Fe/H] and $G$-band absolute magnitude-metallicity
relations. The $P$-$\phi_{31}$-[Fe/H] relations for RRab and RRc are obtained from nearly 3000
{\it Gaia}-identified RRLs with precise $\phi_{31}$ measurements from the light curves and metallicity
estimates from spectroscopy. Using over one thousand nearby RRLs with accurate distances estimated
from the parallax measurements with Gaia EDR3, new $G$-band absolute magnitude metallicity relations
and near-infrared period-absolute magnitude-metallicity relations for $K_{\rm s}$ and $W1$
bands are constructed. External checks, using other spectroscopic samples of field RRLs and RRL
members of globular clusters, show that the typical uncertainties in photometric metallicity
are 0.27/0.17 dex for RRab/RRc stars, respectively, without significant systematic offsets.
The accuracies of these metallicity estimates are much improved, especially for RRab stars, when
compared to those provided by the Gaia DR3. Validations of our distance estimates, again by using
RRL members of globular clusters, show that the typical distance errors are 4.6%/3.4% for RRab/RRc
stars, respectively. The distance scale from this study is consistent with that of the globular
clusters. The distance modulus $\mu_{0}=18.444\pm0.135$ mag for the LMC and $\mu_{0}=18.940\pm0.147$
mag for the SMC are estimated from our RRab star sample, respectively, and are in excellent agreement
with previous measurements. The mean metallicity of the LMC and SMC derived in this work are also
consistent with the previous determinations. Using our sample, a steep metallicity gradient of
$-0.021\pm0.001$ dex/kpc is found for the LMC, while a negligible metallicity gradient of $-0.005\pm0.003$
dex/kpc is obtained for the SMC.

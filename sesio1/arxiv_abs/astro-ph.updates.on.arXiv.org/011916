Mesosiderites are a type of stony-iron meteorites composed of a mixture of silicates and Fe-Ni metals.
The mesosiderite silicates and metals are considered to have originated from the crust and metal
core, respectively, of a differentiated asteroid. In contrast, mesosiderites rarely contain
the olivine that is mainly included in a mantle. Although a giant impact onto a differentiated asteroid
is considered to be a probable mechanism to mix crust and metal materials to form mesosiderites,
it is not obvious how such a giant impact can form mesosiderite-like materials without including
mantle materials. We conducted numerical simulations of giant impacts onto differentiated asteroids,
using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics method, to investigate the detailed distribution of
mixed materials on the resultant bodies. For the internal structure of a target body, we used a thin-crust
model derived from the magma ocean crystallization model of the asteroid Vesta and a thick-crust
and a large-core model suggested from the proximity observation of Vesta by the Dawn probe. In the
simulations with the former model, excavation of the metal core requires nearly catastrophic impacts
and mantle is exposed over large surface areas. Thus, stony-iron materials produced on its surface
are likely to include mantle materials and it is difficult to produce mesosiderite-like materials.
Conversely, in the simulations with the latter model, mantle materials are exposed only at impact
sites, even when the impacts excavate the metal core, and the formation of a surface with little mantle
material and the formation of mesosiderite-like materials are possible. Therefore, our simulations
suggest that an internal structure with a thick crust and a large core is more likely as a mesosiderite
parent body rather than the thin-crust internal structure inferred from the conventional magma
ocean model.

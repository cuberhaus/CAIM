Red supergiant (RSGs) are cool massive stars in a late phase of their evolution when the stellar envelope
becomes fully convective. They are the brightest stars in the universe at infrared light and can
be detected in galaxies far beyond the Local Group, allowing for accurate determination of chemical
composition of galaxies. The study of their physical properties is extremely important for various
phenomena including the final fate of massive stars as type II supernovae and gravitational wave
progenitors. We explore the well-studied nearby young stellar cluster chi Per. Using Gaia EDR3
data, we find the distance of the cluster (d = 2.260+-0.020 kpc). We then investigate the variability
of the convection-related surface structure as a source for parallax measurement uncertainty.
We use state-of-the-art 3D radiative hydrodynamics simulations with CO5BOLD and the post-processing
radiative transfer code OPTIM3D to compute intensity maps in the Gaia G photometric system. We calculate
the variabiltiy, as a function of time, of the intensity-weighted mean from the synthetic maps.
We then select the RSG stars in the cluster and compare their uncertainty on parallaxes to the predictions
of photocentre displacements. The synthetic maps of RSG show extremely irregular and temporal
variable surfaces due to convection-related dynamics. Consequentially, the position of the photo-center
varies during Gaia measurements between 0.033 and 0.130 AU (up to 5% of the corresponding simulation
stellar radius). We argue that the variability of the convection-related surface structures accounts
for a substantial part of the Gaia EDR3 parallax error of the RSG sample. We suggest that the variation
of the uncertainty on Gaia parallax could be exploited quantitatively using appropriate 3D simulations
to extract, in a unique way, important information about the stellar dynamics and parameters of
RSG stars.

Cosmological parameter estimation in the post-reionisation era via the radio emission of neutral
hydrogen (HI), is one of the key science goals of the forthcoming SKA Observatory (SKAO). In this
paper, we explore detection capability for baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) with a SKAO-like
experimental set up, using a suite of 100 simulations inclusive of the main limitations from foreground
contamination and poor angular resolution caused by the radio telescope beam. The latter represents
a serious challenge for BAO detection with HI intensity mapping, hence we investigate adopting
a multipole expansion approach as a means for mitigating the BAO detection limitations caused by
the broad single-dish beam. We also showcase the gains made from cross-correlating the HI intensity
mapping data with an overlapping spectroscopic galaxy survey, aiming to test the potential synergies
between the SKA Project and other future cosmological experiments at optical/near-infrared wavelengths,
like the Euclid satellite or the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. Whilst we were still able
to achieve a ~4.5 sigma detection of BAO features in auto-correlation despite the dominant beam
effect, a cross-correlation can increase this to a ~6 sigma detection. Furthermore, by adopting
the widely studied multipole expansion formalism, we show that including the power spectrum quadrupole
besides the monopole in a joint fit can approximately double the BAO detection significance. Despite
not implementing a radial-only power spectrum analysis in favour of the three-dimensional power
spectrum and its multipoles, we were still able to obtain robust constraints on the radial Alcock-Paczynski
parameter, but found that perpendicular parameter remains unconstrained and prior dominated
due to beam effects.

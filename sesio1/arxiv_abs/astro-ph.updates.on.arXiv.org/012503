We aim to develop a simple prescription for migration and accretion in 1D disc models, calibrated
with results of 3D hydrodynamic simulations. Our focus lies on non-self-gravitating discs, but
we also discuss to what degree our prescription could be applied when the discs are self-gravitating.
We study migration using torque densities. Our model for the torque density is based on existing
fitting formulas, which we subsequently modify to prevent premature gap-opening. At higher planetary
masses, we also apply torque densities from hydrodynamic simulations directly to our 1D model.
These torque densities allow modelling the orbital evolution of an initially low-mass planet that
undergoes runaway-accretion to become a massive planet. The two-way exchange of angular momentum
between disc and planet is included. This leads to a self-consistent treatment of gap formation
that only relies on directly accessible disc parameters. We present a formula for Bondi- and Hill-
gas accretion in the disc-limited regime. This formula is self-consistent in the sense that mass
is removed from the disc in the location from where it is accreted. We find that the resulting evolution
in mass and semi-major axis in the 1D framework is in good agreement with those from 3D hydrodynamical
simulations for a range of parameters. Our prescription is valuable for simultaneously modelling
migration and accretion in 1D-models. We conclude that it is appropriate and beneficial to apply
torque densities from hydrodynamic simulations in 1D models, at least in the parameter space we
study here. More work is needed to in order to determine whether our approach is also applicable in
an even wider parameter space and in situations with more complex disc thermodynamics, or when the
disc is self-gravitating.

A photometric and spectroscopic investigation is performed on five W Ursae Majoris eclipsing binaries
(EWs) J015818.6+260247 (hereinafter as J0158b), J073248.4+405538 (hereinafter as J0732), J101330.8+494846
(hereinafter as J1013), J132439.8+130747 (hereinafter as J1324) and J152450.7+245943 (hereinafter
as J1524). The photometric data are collected with the help of the 1.3\,m Devasthal Fast Optical
Telescope (DFOT), the 1.04\,m Sampurnanand Telescope (ST) and the TESS space mission. The low-resolution
spectra of the 4\,m Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) are used
for spectroscopic analysis. The orbital period change of these systems is determined using our
and previously available photometric data from different surveys. The orbital period of J1013
and J1524 is changing with a rate of $-2.552(\pm0.249)\times 10^{-7}$ days $yr^{-1}$ and $-6.792(\pm0.952)\times
10^{-8}$ days $yr^{-1}$, respectively, while others do not show any orbital period change. The
orbital period change of J1013 and J1524 corresponds to a mass transfer rate of $2.199\times10^{-7}
M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}$ and $6.151\times10^{-8}M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}$ from the primary to the secondary
component in these systems. It is likely that angular momentum loss via magnetic braking may also
be responsible for the observed orbital period change in the case of J1524. All systems have a mass-ratio
lower than 0.5, except J0158b with a mass-ratio of 0.71. All the systems are shallow type contact
binaries. The J0158b and J1524 are A-subtype while others are W-subtype. The $H_{\alpha}$ emission
line region is compared with template spectra prepared using two inactive stars with the help of
STARMOD program. The J0158, J1324 and J1524 systems show excess emission in the residual spectra
after subtraction of the template.

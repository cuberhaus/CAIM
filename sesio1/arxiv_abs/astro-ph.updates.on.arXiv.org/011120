We present first science observations taken during the commissioning activities of the Spectral
Imaging of the Coronal Environment (SPICE) instrument on the ESA/NASA Solar Orbiter mission. SPICE
is a high-resolution imaging spectrometer operating at extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths.
In this paper we illustrate the possible types of observations to give prospective users a better
understanding of the science capabilities of SPICE. The paper discusses the first observations
of the Sun on different targets and presents an example of the full spectra from the quiet Sun, identifying
over 40 spectral lines from neutral hydrogen and ions of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, neon, sulphur,
magnesium, and iron. These lines cover the temperature range between 20,000 K and 1 million K (10MK
in flares), providing slices of the Sun's atmosphere in narrow temperature intervals. We provide
a list of count rates for the 23 brightest spectral lines. We show examples of raster images of the
quiet Sun in several strong transition region lines, where we have found unusually bright, compact
structures in the quiet Sun network, with extreme intensities up to 25 times greater than the average
intensity across the image. The lifetimes of these structures can exceed 2.5 hours. We identify
them as a transition region signature of coronal bright points and compare their areas and intensity
enhancements. We also show the first above-limb measurements with SPICE above the polar limb in
C III, O VI, and Ne VIII lines, and far off limb measurements in the equatorial plane in Mg IX, Ne VIII,
and O VI lines. We discuss the potential to use abundance diagnostics methods to study the variability
of the elemental composition that can be compared with in situ measurements to help confirm the magnetic
connection between the spacecraft location and the Sun's surface, and locate the sources of the
solar wind.

21cm tomography opens a window to directly study astrophysics and fundamental physics of early
epochs in our Universe's history, the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR) and Cosmic Dawn (CD). Summary
statistics such as the power spectrum omit information encoded in this signal due to its highly non-Gaussian
nature. Here we adopt a network-based approach for direct inference of CD and EoR astrophysics jointly
with fundamental physics from 21cm tomography. We showcase a warm dark matter (WDM) universe, where
dark matter density parameter $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ and WDM mass $m_\mathrm{WDM}$ strongly influence
both CD and EoR. Reflecting the three-dimensional nature of 21cm light-cones, we present a new,
albeit simple, 3D convolutional neural network for efficient parameter recovery at moderate training
cost. On simulations we observe high-fidelity parameter recovery for CD and EoR astrophysics ($R^2>0.78-0.99$),
together with DM density $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ ($R^2>0.97$) and WDM mass ($R^2>0.61$, significantly
better for $m_\mathrm{WDM}<3-4\,$keV). For realistic mock observed light-cones that include
noise and foreground levels expected for the Square Kilometre Array, we note that in an optimistic
foreground scenario parameter recovery is unaffected, while for moderate, less optimistic foreground
levels (occupying the so-called wedge) the recovery of the WDM mass deteriorates, while other parameters
remain robust against increased foreground levels at $R^2>0.9$. We further test the robustness
of our network-based inference against modelling uncertainties and systematics by transfer learning
between bare simulations and mock observations; we find robust recovery of specific X-ray luminosity
and ionising efficiency, while DM density and WDM mass come with increased bias and scatter.

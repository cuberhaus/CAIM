The evolution of star-forming regions and their thermal balance are strongly influenced by their
chemical composition, that, in turn, is determined by the physico-chemical processes that govern
the transition between the gas phase and the solid state, specifically icy dust grains (e.g., particles
adsorption and desorption). Gas-grain and grain-gas transitions as well as formation and sublimation
of interstellar ices are thus essential elements of understanding astrophysical observations
of cold environments (e.g., pre-stellar cores) where unexpected amounts of a large variety of chemical
species have been observed in the gas phase. Adsorbed atoms and molecules also undergo chemical
reactions which are not efficient in the gas phase. Therefore, the parameterization of the physical
properties of atoms and molecules interacting with dust grain particles is clearly a key aspect
to interpret astronomical observations and to build realistic and predictive astrochemical models.
In this consensus evaluation, we focus on parameters controlling the thermal desorption of ices
and how these determine pathways towards molecular complexity and define the location of snowlines,
which ultimately influence the planet formation process. We review different crucial aspects
of desorption parameters both from a theoretical and experimental point of view. We critically
assess the desorption parameters commonly used in the astrochemical community for astrophysical
relevant species and provide tables with recommended values. In addition, we show that a non-trivial
determination of the pre-exponential factor nu using the Transition State Theory can affect the
binding energy value. Finally, we conclude this work by discussing the limitations of theoretical
and experimental approaches currently used to determine the desorption properties with suggestions
for future improvements.

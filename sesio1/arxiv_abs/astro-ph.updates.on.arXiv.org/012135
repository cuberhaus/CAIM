Andromeda (M31) is the nearest giant spiral galaxy to our Milky Way (MW) and the most massive member
of our Local Group. We obtain a magnitude-limited sample of M31 disc PNe with chemical abundance
measurements through the direct detection of the [OIII] 4363 \r{A} line. This leads to $205$ and
$200$ PNe with oxygen and argon abundance measurements respectively. We find that high- and low-extinction
M31 disc PNe have statistically distinct argon and oxygen abundance distributions. In the radial
range $2-30$ kpc, the older low-extinction disc PNe are metal-poorer on average with a slightly
positive radial oxygen abundance gradient ($0.006 \pm 0.003$ dex/kpc) and slightly negative radial
argon abundance gradient ($-0.005 \pm 0.003$ dex/kpc), while the younger high-extinction disc
PNe are metal-richer on average with steeper radial abundance gradients for both oxygen ($-0.013
\pm 0.006$ dex/kpc) and argon ($-0.018 \pm 0.006$ dex/kpc), similar to the gradients measured for
M31 HII regions. These abundance gradients are consistent with a major merger in the M31 disc, with
the majority of the low-extinction PNe being the older pre-merger disc stars in the thicker disc,
and the majority of the high-extinction PNe being younger stars in the thin disc, formed during and
after the merger event. The chemical abundance of the M31 thicker disc has been radially homogenized
because of the major merger. Accounting for differences in disc-scale lengths, we find the radial
oxygen abundance gradient of the M31 thicker disc is amongst the most positive values observed till
date in spiral galaxies, flatter than that of the MW thick disc which has a negative radial gradient.
On the other hand, the thin discs of the MW and M31 have remarkably similar negative oxygen abundance
gradient values.

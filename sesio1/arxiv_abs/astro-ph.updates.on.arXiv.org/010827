We study the spatially resolved physical properties of the Cosmic Snake arc in MACS J1206.2-0847
and the arc in Abell 0521 (A521). These are two strongly lensed galaxies at redshifts $z=1.036$ and
$z=1.044$. We used observations of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array (ALMA). The former gives access to the star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass ($M_\star$),
and the latter to the H$_2$ molecular gas mass ($M_{\mathrm{mol}}$). HST and ALMA observations
have similar angular resolutions of $0.15^{\prime \prime}-0.2^{\prime \prime}$, which with
the help of strong gravitational lensing enable us to reach spatial resolutions down to $\sim 30\,\mathrm{pc}$
and $\sim 100\,\mathrm{pc}$ in these two galaxies, respectively. These resolutions are close
to the resolution of observations of nearby galaxies. We study the radial profiles of SFR, $M_\star$,
and $M_{\mathrm{mol}}$ surface densities of these high-redshift galaxies and compare the corresponding
exponential scale lengths with those of local galaxies. We find that the scale lengths in the Cosmic
Snake are about $0.5\,\mathrm{kpc}-1.5\,\mathrm{kpc}$, and they are 3 to 10 times larger in A521.
This is a significant difference knowing that the two galaxies have comparable integrated properties.
These high-redshift scale lengths are nevertheless comparable to those of local galaxies, which
cover a wide distribution. The particularity of our high-redshift radial profiles is the normalisation
of the $M_{\mathrm{mol}}$ surface density profiles ($\Sigma M_{\mathrm{mol}}$), which are offset
by up to a factor of 20 with respect to the profiles of $z=0$ counterparts. The SFR surface density
profiles are also offset by the same factor as $\Sigma M_{\mathrm{mol}}$, as expected from the Kennicutt-Schmidt
law.

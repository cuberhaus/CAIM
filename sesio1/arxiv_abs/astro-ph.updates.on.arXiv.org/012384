Hot and Warm Jupiters (HJs&WJs) are gas-giant planets orbiting their host stars at short orbital
periods, posing a challenge to their efficient in-situ formation. Therefore, most of the HJs&WJs
are thought to have migrated from an initially farther-out birth locations. Current migration
models, i.e disc-migration (gas-dissipation driven) and eccentric-migration (tidal evolution
driven), fail to produce the occurrence rate and orbital properties of HJs&WJs. Here we study the
role of the thermal evolution and its coupling to tidal evolution. We use the AMUSE, numerical environment,
and MESA, planetary evolution modeling, to model in detail the coupled internal and orbital evolution
of gas-giants during their eccentric-migration. In a companion paper, we use a simple semi-analytic
model, validated by our numerical model, and run a population-synthesis study. We consider the
initially inflated radii of gas-giants (expected following their formation), as well study the
effects of the potential slowed contraction and even re-inflation of gas-giants (due to tidal and
radiative heating) on the eccentric-migration. Tidal forces that drive eccentric-migration
are highly sensitive to the planetary structure and radius. Consequently, we find that this form
of inflated eccentric-migration operates on significantly (up to an order of magnitude) shorter
timescales than previously studied eccentric-migration models. Thereby, inflated eccentric-migration
gives rise to more rapid formation of HJs&WJs, higher occurrence rates of WJs, and higher rates of
tidal disruptions, compared with previous eccentric migration models which consider constant
~Jupiter radii for HJ&WJ progenitors. Coupled thermal-dynamical evolution of eccentric gas-giants
can therefore play a key-role in their evolution.

Post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) binaries are surrounded by massive disks of gas and dust
that are similar to protoplanetary disks around young stars. We assembled a catalog of all known
Galactic post-AGB binaries with disks. We explore the correlations between the different observables
with the aim of learning more about potential disk-binary interactions. We compiled spectral energy
distributions of 85 Galactic post-AGB binary systems. We built a color-color diagram to differentiate
between the different disk morphologies traced by the infrared excess. We categorized the different
disk types and searched for correlations with other observational characteristics of these systems.
Between 8 and 12% of our targets are surrounded by transition disks, that is, disks having no or low
near-infrared excess. We find a strong link between these transition disks and the depletion of
refractory elements on the surface of the post-AGB star. We interpret this link as evidence of a mechanism
that stimulates the dust and gas separation within the disk and that also produces the transition
disk structure. We propose that such a mechanism is likely to be due to a giant planet carving a hole
in the disk, effectively trapping the dust in the outer disk parts. We propose disk evolutionary
scenarios, depending on the presence of such a giant planet in the disk. We advocate that giant planets
can successfully explain the link between the transition disks and the observed depletion of refractory
materials. If the planetary scenario is confirmed, disks around post-AGB binaries could be a unique
laboratory for testing planet-disk interactions and their influence on the late evolution of binary
stars. The question of whether such planets are first- or second-generation bodies remains to be
considered. We argue that these disks are ideal for studying planet formation in unprecedented
parameter space.

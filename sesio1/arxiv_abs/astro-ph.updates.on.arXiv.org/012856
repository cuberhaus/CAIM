About 70-80% of stars in our solar and galactic neighborhood are M dwarfs. They span a range of low
masses and temperatures relative to solar-type stars, facilitating molecule formation throughout
their atmospheres. Standard stellar atmosphere models primarily designed for FGK stars face challenges
when characterizing broadband molecular features in spectra of cool stars. Here, we introduce
SPHINX--a new 1-D self-consistent radiative-convective thermochemical equilibrium chemistry
model grid of atmospheres and spectra for M dwarfs in low-resolution (R~250). We incorporate the
latest pre-computed absorption cross-sections with pressure-broadening for key molecules dominant
in late-K, early/main-sequence-M stars. We then validate our grid models by acquiring fundamental
properties (Teff, log(g), [M/H], radius, and C/O) for 10 benchmark M+G binary stars with known host
metallicities and 10 M dwarfs with interferometrically measured angular diameters. Incorporating
a Gaussian-process inference tool Starfish, we account for correlated and systematic noise in
low-resolution (spectral stitching of SpeX, SNIFS, and STIS) observations and derive robust estimates
of fundamental M dwarf atmospheric parameters. Additionally, we assess the influence of photospheric
heterogeneity on acquired [M/H] and find that it could explain some deviations from observations.
We also probe whether the model-assumed convective mixing-length parameter influences inferred
radii, effective temperature, and [M/H] and again find that may explain discrepancies between
interferometry observations and model-derived stellar parameters for cooler M dwarfs. Mainly,
we show the unique strength in leveraging broadband molecular absorption features occurring in
low-resolution M dwarf spectra and demonstrate the ability to improve constraints on fundamental
properties of exoplanet hosts and late brown dwarf companions.

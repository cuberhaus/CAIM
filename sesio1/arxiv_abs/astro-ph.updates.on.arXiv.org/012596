We present cosmological parameter constraints as estimated using the Bayesian BeyondPlanck (BP)
analysis framework. This method supports seamless end-to-end error propagation from raw time-ordered
data to final cosmological parameters. As a first demonstration of the method, we analyze time-ordered
Planck LFI observations, combined with selected external data (WMAP 33-61GHz, Planck HFI DR4 353
and 857GHz, and Haslam 408MHz) in the form of pixelized maps which are used to break critical astrophysical
degeneracies. Overall, all results are generally in good agreement with previously reported values
from Planck 2018 and WMAP, with the largest relative difference for any parameter of about 1 sigma
when considering only temperature multipoles between 29<l<601. In cases where there are differences,
we note that the BP results are generally slightly closer to the high-l HFI-dominated Planck 2018
results than previous analyses, suggesting slightly less tension between low and high multipoles.
Using low-l polarization information from LFI and WMAP, we find a best-fit value of tau=0.066 +/-
0.013, which is higher than the low value of tau=0.051 +/- 0.006 derived from Planck 2018 and slightly
lower than the value of 0.069 +/- 0.011 derived from joint analysis of official LFI and WMAP products.
Most importantly, however, we find that the uncertainty derived in the BP processing is about 30%
larger than when analyzing the official products, after taking into account the different sky coverage.
We argue that this is due to marginalizing over a more complete model of instrumental and astrophysical
parameters, and this results in both more reliable and more rigorously defined uncertainties.
We find that about 2000 Monte Carlo samples are required to achieve robust convergence for low-resolution
CMB covariance matrix with 225 independent modes.

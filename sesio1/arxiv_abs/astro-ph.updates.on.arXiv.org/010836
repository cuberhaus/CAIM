The LIGO/Virgo collaboration has reported 50 BH-BH mergers and 8 additional candidates recovered
from digging deeper into the detectors noise. Majority of these mergers have low effective spins
pointing toward low BH spins and efficient angular momentum transport in massive stars as proposed
by several models (e.g., Tayler-Spruit magnetic dynamo or Fuller model). However, out of these
58 mergers, 7 are consistent with having high effective spin parameter (chi_eff>0.3). Additionally,
2 out of these 7 events seem to have high effective spins sourced from the high spin of a primary (more
massive) BH. The most extreme merger has very high primary BH dimensionless spin (a_1=0.9). These
particular observations may be potentially used to discriminate between the isolated binary and
dynamical globular cluster BH-BH formation channels. It may seem that high BH spins point to the
dynamical origin if stars have efficient angular momentum transport and form low-spinning BHs.
Then dynamical formation is required to produce second and third generations of BH-BH mergers that
typically produce high-spinning BHs. Here we show that isolated binary BH-BH formation channel
can naturally reproduce such highly spinning BHs. Our models start with efficient angular momentum
transport in massive stars that is needed to reproduce majority of BH-BH mergers with low effective
spins. However, some massive binaries are subject to strong tidal spin-up allowing for the formation
of moderate fraction (~10%) of BH-BH mergers with high effective spins (chi_eff>0.4-0.5). Moreover,
binary evolution can produce small fraction (~1%) of BH-BH mergers with almost maximally spinning
primary BHs ($a_1>0.9$). Therefore, the formation scenario of those unusual BH-BH mergers remains
unresolved.

We investigate the characteristic modifications in the evolving cosmological perturbations
when dark energy interacts with dust-like matter, causing the latter's background energy density
fall off with time faster than usual. Focusing in particular to the late-time cosmic evolution,
we show that such an interaction (of a specific form, arising naturally in a scalar-tensor formulation,
or a wide range of modified gravity equivalents thereof), can have a rather significant effect on
the perturbative spectrum, than on the background configuration which is not expected to get distorted
much from $\L$CDM. Specifically, the matter density contrast, which is by and large scale-invariant
in the deep sub-horizon limit, not only gets dragged as the interaction affects the background Hubble
expansion rate, but also receives a contribution from the perturbation in the (scalar field induced)
dark energy, which oscillates about a non-zero mean value. As such, the standard parametrization
ansatz for the the matter density growth factor becomes inadequate. So we modify it suitably, and
also find a numerical fit of the growth index in terms of the background parameters, in order to alleviate
the problems that arise otherwise. Such a fit enables direct estimations of the background parameters,
as well as the growth parameter and the reduced Hubble parameter, which we duly carry out using a redshift
space distortion (RSD) subsample and its combination with the observational Hubble data. On the
whole, the parametric estimates show consistency with the general observational constraints
on the background level cosmology, as well as the constraints on scalar-tensor gravity from astrophysical
observations, apart from having significance in the domain of cosmological perturbations.

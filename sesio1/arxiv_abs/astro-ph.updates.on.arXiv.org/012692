The spatial properties of small star-clusters suggest that they may originate from a fragmentation
cascade of the cloud for which there might be traces up to a few dozen of kAU. Our goal is to investigate
the multi-scale spatial structure of gas clumps, to probe the existence of a hierarchical cascade
and to evaluate its possible link with star production in terms of multiplicity. From the Herschel
emission maps of NGC 2264, clumps are extracted using getsf software at each of their associated
spatial resolution, respectively [8.4, 13.5, 18.2, 24.9, 36.3]". Using the spatial distribution
of these clumps and the class 0/I Young Stellar Object (YSO) from Spitzer data, we develop a graph-theoretic
analysis to represent the multi-scale structure of the cloud as a connected network. From this network,
we derive three classes of multi-scale structure in NGC 2264 depending on the number of nodes produced
at the deepest level: hierarchical, linear and isolated. The structure class is strongly correlated
with the column density $N_{\rm H_2}$ since the hierarchical ones dominate the regions whose N$_{\rm
H_2} > 6 \times 10^{22}$cm$^{-2}$. Although the latter are in minority, they contain half of the
class 0/I YSOs proving that they are highly efficient in producing stars. We define a novel statistical
metric, the fractality coefficient F that measure the fractal index describing the scale-free
process of the cascade. For NGC 2264, we estimate F = 1.45$\pm$0.12. However, a single fractal index
fails to fully describe a scale-free process since the hierarchical cascade starts at a 13 kAU characteristic
spatial scale. Our novel methodology allows us to correlate YSOs with their multi-scale gaseous
environment. This hierarchical cascade that drives efficient star formation is suspected to be
both hierarchical and rooted by the larger-scale gas environment up to 13 kAU.

The nature of the Fermi gamma-ray Galactic Center Excess (GCE) has remained a persistent mystery
for over a decade. Although the excess is broadly compatible with emission expected due to dark matter
annihilation, an explanation in terms of a population of unresolved astrophysical point sources
e.g., millisecond pulsars, remains viable. The effort to uncover the origin of the GCE is hampered
in particular by an incomplete understanding of diffuse emission of Galactic origin. This can lead
to spurious features that make it difficult to robustly differentiate smooth emission, as expected
for a dark matter origin, from more "clumpy" emission expected for a population of relatively bright,
unresolved point sources. We use recent advancements in the field of simulation-based inference,
in particular density estimation techniques using normalizing flows, in order to characterize
the contribution of modeled components, including unresolved point source populations, to the
GCE. Compared to traditional techniques based on the statistical distribution of photon counts,
our machine learning-based method is able to utilize more of the information contained in a given
model of the Galactic Center emission, and in particular can perform posterior parameter estimation
while accounting for pixel-to-pixel spatial correlations in the gamma-ray map. This makes the
method demonstrably more resilient to certain forms of model misspecification. On application
to Fermi data, the method generically attributes a smaller fraction of the GCE flux to unresolved
point sources when compared to traditional approaches. We nevertheless infer such a contribution
to make up a non-negligible fraction of the GCE across all analysis variations considered, with
at least $38^{+9}_{-19}\%$ of the excess attributed to unresolved point sources in our baseline
analysis.

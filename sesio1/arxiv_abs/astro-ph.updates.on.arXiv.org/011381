For several transition disks (TDs), dark regions interpreted as shadows have been observed in scattered
light imaging and are hypothesized to originate from misalignments between distinct disk regions.
We aim to investigate the presence of misalignments in TDs. We study the inner disk geometries of
20 well-known transition disks with VLTI/GRAVITY observations and use complementary $^{12}$CO
and $^{13}$CO molecular line data from ALMA to derive the orientation of the outer disk regions.
We fit simple models to the GRAVITY data to derive the inner disks inclination and position angles.
The outer disk geometries were derived from Keplerian fits to the ALMA velocity maps and compared
to the inner disk constraints. We also predicted the locations of shadows for significantly misaligned
systems. Our analysis reveals six disks to exhibit significant misalignments between their inner
and outer disks. The predicted shadow positions agree well with the scattered light images of HD100453
and HD142527, and we find supporting evidence for a shadow in the disk around CQ Tau. In the other three
targets for which we infer significantly misaligned disks, V1247 Ori, V1366 Ori, and RY Lup, we do
not see any evident sign of shadows in the scattered light images. The scattered light shadows observed
in DoAr44, HD135344B, and HD139614 are consistent with our observations, yet the underlying morphology
is likely too complex to be described by our models and the accuracy achieved by our observations.
Whereas we can derive precise constraints on the potential shadow positions for well-resolved
inner disks around HAeBe stars, the statistical uncertainties for the marginally resolved inner
disks around the TTS of our sample make it difficult to extract conclusive constraints for the presence
of shadows in these systems.

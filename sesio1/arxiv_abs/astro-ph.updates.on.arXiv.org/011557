The hot Jupiter WASP-80b has been identified as a possible excellent target for detecting and measuring
HeI absorption in the upper atmosphere. We observed 4 primary transits of WASP-80b in the optical
and near-IR using the HARPS-N and GIANO-B high-resolution spectrographs, focusing on the HeI triplet.
We further employed a three-dimensional hydrodynamic aeronomy model to understand the observational
results. We did not find any signature of planetary absorption at the position of the HeI triplet
with an upper limit of 0.7% (i.e. 1.11 planetary radii; 95% confidence level). We re-estimated the
stellar high-energy emission that we combined with a stellar photospheric model to generate the
input for the hydrodynamic modelling. We obtained that, assuming a solar He to H abundance ratio,
HeI absorption should have been detected. Considering a stellar wind 25 times weaker than solar,
we could reproduce the non-detection only assuming a He to H abundance ratio about 16 times smaller
than solar. Instead, considering a stellar wind 10 times stronger than solar, we could reproduce
the non-detection only with a He to H abundance ratio about 10 times smaller than solar. We attempted
to understand this result by collecting all past HeI measurements looking for correlations with
stellar high-energy emission and planetary gravity, but without finding any. WASP-80b is not the
only planet with a sub-solar estimated He to H abundance ratio, suggesting the presence of efficient
physical mechanisms (e.g. phase separation, magnetic fields) capable of significantly modifying
the He to H content in the upper atmosphere of hot Jupiters. The planetary macroscopic properties
and the shape of the stellar spectral energy distribution are not sufficient for predicting the
presence or absence of detectable metastable He in a planetary atmosphere, as also the He abundance
appears to play a major role.

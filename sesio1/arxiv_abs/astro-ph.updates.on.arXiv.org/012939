Keplerian-Stacker is an algorithm able to combine multiple observations acquired at different
epochs taking into account the orbital motion of a potential planet present in the images to boost
the ultimate detection limit. In 2019, a total of 100 hours of observation were allocated to VLT VISIR-NEAR,
a collaboration between ESO and Breakthrough Initiatives, to search for low mass planets in the
habitable zone of the Alpha Cen AB binary system. A weak signal (S/N = 3) was reported around Alpha
Cen A, at a separation of 1.1 a.u. which corresponds to the habitable zone. We have re-analysed the
NEAR data using K-Stacker. This algorithm is a brute-force method able to find planets in time series
of observations and to constrain their orbital parameters, even if they remain undetected in a single
epoch. We scanned a total of about 3.5e+5 independent orbits, among which about 15 % correspond to
fast moving orbits on which planets cannot be detected without taking into account the orbital motion.
We find only a single planet candidate, which matches the C1 detection reported in Wagner et al. 2021.
Despite the significant amount of time spent on this target, the orbit of this candidate remains
poorly constrained due to these observations being closely distributed in 34 days. We argue that
future single-target deep surveys would benefit from a K-Stacker based strategy, where the observations
would be split over a significant part of the expected orbital period to better constrain the orbital
parameters. This application of K-Stacker on high contrast imaging data in the mid-infrared demonstrates
the capability of this algorithm to aid in the search for Earth-like planets in the habitable zone
of the nearest stars with future instruments of the E-ELT such as METIS.

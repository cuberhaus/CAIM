We aim to make use of the measurements from the Giraffe Inner Bulge Survey (GIBS) and the Gaia$-$ESO
survey (GES) to study the kinematics and distance of the carrier of DIB$\,\lambda$8620, as well
as other properties. We successfully detected and measured DIB$\,\lambda$8620 in 760 of 4117 GES
spectra. Combined with the DIBs measured in GIBS spectra, we confirmed a tight relation between
EW and $E(J-K_{\rm S})$ as well as $A_{\rm V}$, with similar fitting coefficients to those found
by previous works. With a more accurate sample and the consideration of the solar motion, the rest-frame
wavelength of DIB$\,\lambda$8620 was redetermined as 8620.83 \r{A}, with a mean fit error of 0.36
\r{A}. We studied the kinematics of the DIB carriers by tracing their median radial velocities in
each field in the local standard of rest ($V_{\rm LSR}$) and into the galactocentric frame ($V_{\rm
GC}$), respectively, as a function of the Galactic longitudes. Based on the median $V_{\rm LSR}$
and two Galactic rotation models, we obtained valid kinematic distances of the DIB carriers for
nine GIBS and ten GES fields. We also found a linear relation between the DIB$\,\lambda$8620 measured
in this work and the near-infrared DIB in APOGEE spectra at $1.5273\,\mu m$. We demonstrate that
the DIB carriers can be located much closer to the observer than the background stars based on the
following arguments: (i) qualitatively, the carriers occupy in the Galactic longitude$-$velocity
diagram typical rotation velocities of stars in the local Galactic disk, while the background stars
in the GIBS survey are mainly located in the Galactic bulge; (ii) quantitatively, all the derived
kinematic distances of the DIB carriers are smaller than the median distances to background stars
in each field.

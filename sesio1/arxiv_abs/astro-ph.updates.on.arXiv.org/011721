Turbulence in a conducting plasma can amplify seed magnetic fields in what is known as the turbulent,
or small-scale, dynamo. The associated growth rate and emergent magnetic-field geometry depend
sensitively on the material properties of the plasma, in particular on the Reynolds number ${\rm
Re}$, the magnetic Reynolds number ${\rm Rm}$, and their ratio ${\rm Pm}\equiv{\rm Rm}/{\rm Re}$.
For ${\rm Pm} > 1$, the amplified magnetic field is gradually arranged into a folded structure, with
direction reversals at the resistive scale and field lines curved at the larger scale of the flow.
As the mean magnetic energy grows to come into approximate equipartition with the fluid motions,
this folded structure is thought to persist. Using analytical theory and high-resolution MHD simulations
with the Athena++ code, we show that these magnetic folds become unstable to tearing during the nonlinear
stage of the dynamo for ${\rm Rm}\gtrsim 10^4$ and ${\rm Re}\gtrsim 10^3$. An ${\rm Rm}$- and ${\rm
Pm}$-dependent tearing scale, at and below which folds are disrupted, is predicted theoretically
and found to match well the characteristic field-reversal scale measured in the simulations. The
disruption of folds by tearing increases the ratio of viscous-to-resistive dissipation. In the
saturated state, the magnetic-energy spectrum exhibits a sub-tearing-scale steepening to a slope
consistent with that predicted for tearing-mediated Alfv\'enic turbulence. Its spectral peak
appears to be independent of the resistive scale and comparable to the driving scale of the flow,
while the magnetic energy resides in a broad range of scales extending down to the field-reversal
scale set by tearing. Emergence of a degree of large-scale magnetic coherence in the saturated state
of the turbulent dynamo may be consistent with observations of magnetic-field fluctuations in
galaxy clusters and recent laboratory experiments.

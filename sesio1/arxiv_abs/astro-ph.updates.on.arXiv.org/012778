The magnetorotational instability (MRI) is a fundamental mechanism determining the macroscopic
dynamics of astrophysical accretion disks. In collisionless accretion flows around supermassive
black holes, MRI-driven plasma turbulence cascading to microscopic (i.e. kinetic) scales can
result in enhanced angular-momentum transport and redistribution, nonthermal particle acceleration,
and a two-temperature state where electrons and ions are heated unequally. However, this microscopic
physics cannot be captured with standard magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) approaches typically employed
to study the MRI. In this work, we explore the nonlinear development of MRI turbulence in a pair plasma,
employing fully kinetic Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations in two and three dimensions. First,
we thoroughly study the axisymmetric MRI with 2D simulations, explaining how and why the 2D geometry
produces results that differ substantially from MHD expectations. We then perform the largest
(to date) 3D simulations, for which we employ a novel shearing-box approach, demonstrating that
3D PIC models can reproduce the mesoscale (i.e. MHD) MRI dynamics in sufficiently large runs. With
our fully kinetic simulations, we are able to describe the nonthermal particle acceleration and
angular-momentum transport driven by the collisionless MRI. Since these microscopic processes
ultimately lead to the emission of potentially measurable radiation in accreting plasmas, our
work is of prime importance to understand current and future observations from first principles,
beyond the limitations imposed by fluid (MHD) models. While in this first study we focus on pair plasmas
for simplicity, our results represent an essential step toward designing more realistic electron-ion
simulations, on which we will focus in future work.

Direct imaging and spectroscopy of Earth-like planets and young Jupiters require contrasts up
to 10^6-10^10 at angular separations of a few dozen milliarcseconds. To achieve this goal, one of
the most promising approaches consists of using large segmented primary mirror telescopes with
coronagraphic instruments. However, coronagraphs are highly sensitive to wavefront errors.
The segmentation itself is responsible for phasing errors and segment vibrations to be controlled
at a subnanometric accuracy. We propose an innovative method for a coronagraph design that allows
a consequent relaxation of the segment phasing constraints for low segment-count mirrors and generates
an instrument that is more robust to segment-level wavefront errors. It is based on an optimization
of the coronagraph that includes a segment-level apodization. This is repeated over the pupil to
match the segmentation redundancy and improves the contrast stability beyond the minimum separation
set by the single-segment diffraction limit. We validate this method on a GMT-like pupil for two
coronagraph types: apodized pupil Lyot coronagraphs (APLC) and apodizing phase plate coronagraphs
(APP). For the APLC, redundant apodization enables releasing the piston phasing constraints by
a factor of 5 to 20 compared to classical designs. For the APP, the contrast remains almost constant
up to 1 radian RMS of the phasing errors. We also show that redundant apodizations increase the robustness
of the coronagraph to segment tip-tilt errors, as well as to missing segments. This method cannot
be applied to higher-segment count mirrors such as the ELT or the TMT, but it is particularly suitable
for low segment-count mirrors (fewer than 20 segments) such as the GMT aperture. These mirrors aim
for high-contrast imaging of debris disks or exoplanets down to 100 mas.

The third Gaia data release contains, beyond the astrometry and photometry, dispersed light for
hundreds of millions of sources from the Gaia prism spectra (BP and RP) and the spectrograph (RVS).
This data release opens a new window on the chemo-dynamical properties of stars in our Galaxy, essential
knowledge for understanding the structure, formation, and evolution of the Milky Way. To provide
insight into the physical properties of Milky Way stars, we used these data to produce a uniformly-derived,
all-sky catalog of stellar astrophysical parameters (APs): Teff, logg, [M/H], [$\alpha$/Fe],
activity index, emission lines, rotation, 13 chemical abundance estimates, radius, age, mass,
bolometric luminosity, distance, and dust extinction. We developed the Apsis pipeline to infer
APs of Gaia objects by analyzing their astrometry, photometry, BP/RP, and RVS spectra. We validate
our results against other literature works, including benchmark stars, interferometry, and asteroseismology.
Here we assessed the stellar analysis performance from Apsis statistically. We describe the quantities
we obtained, including our results' underlying assumptions and limitations. We provide guidance
and identify regimes in which our parameters should and should not be used. Despite some limitations,
this is the most extensive catalog of uniformly-inferred stellar parameters to date. These comprise
Teff, logg, and [M/H] (470 million using BP/RP, 6 million using RVS), radius (470 million), mass
(140 million), age (120 million), chemical abundances (5 million), diffuse interstellar band
analysis (1/2 million), activity indices (2 million), H{$\alpha$} equivalent widths (200 million),
and further classification of spectral types (220 million) and emission-line stars (50 thousand).
More precise and detailed astrophysical parameters based on epoch BP, RP, and RVS are planned for
the next Gaia data release.

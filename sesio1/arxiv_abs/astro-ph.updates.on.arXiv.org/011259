We revisit the structure of conformal gravity in the presence of a c-number, conformally coupled,
macroscopic, long range, massless scalar field. And in the static, spherically symmetric case
discuss two classes of exact exterior solutions. In one solution the scalar field has a constant
value and in the other solution (due to Brihaye and Verbin, Phys. Rev. D 80, 124048 (2009)) it has a
dependence on the radial coordinate, with the two exterior solutions being relatable by a conformal
transformation. In light of these two solutions Horne, Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc. 458, 4122 (2016)
raised the concern that the fitting of conformal gravity to galactic rotation curves had been misapplied
and thus called the successful fitting of the conformal gravity theory into question. We show that
the analysis of Brihaye and Verbin needs to reappraised, with their reported result not being as
general as had been indicated, but nonetheless still being valid in the particular case they studied.
For the analysis of Horne we show that this long range scalar field is not related to the mass generation
required in a conformal theory. Rather, it would lead to test particles whose masses would be of the
same order as the masses of the galaxies around which they orbit, as the long range scalar fields produced
by the matter sources in each galaxy would all act on the test particles. Since such a mass pattern
is in conflict with observation, in the conformal theory no massless scalar fields can exist, consistent
with there actually being no known massless scalar particles in nature. Instead, mass generation
in a conformal theory has to be due to dynamical expectation values of q-number fermion bilinear
composites. Such expectation values are microscopic. And being purely internal they have no effect
on galactic orbits, to thus leave the good conformal gravity fitting to galactic rotation curves
intact.

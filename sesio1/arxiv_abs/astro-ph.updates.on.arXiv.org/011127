The scattered disk is a vast population of trans-Neptunian minor bodies that orbit the sun on highly
elongated, long-period orbits. The stability of scattered disk objects is primarily controlled
by a single parameter - their perihelion distance. While the existence of a perihelion boundary
that separates chaotic and regular motion of long-period orbits is well established through numerical
experiments, its theoretical basis as well as its semi-major axis dependence remain poorly understood.
In this work, we outline an analytical model for the dynamics of distant trans-Neptunian objects
and show that the orbital architecture of the scattered disk is shaped by an infinite chain of $2:j$
resonances with Neptune. The widths of these resonances increase as the perihelion distance approaches
Neptune's semi-major axis, and their overlap drives chaotic motion. Within the context of this
picture, we derive an analytic criterion for instability of long-period orbits, and demonstrate
that rapid dynamical chaos ensues when the perihelion drops below a critical value, given by $q_{\rm{crit}}=a_{\rm{N}}\,\big(\ln((24^2/5)\,(m_{\rm{N}}/M_{\odot})\,(a/a_{\rm{N}})^{5/2})\big)^{1/2}$.
This expression constitutes a boundary between the "detached" and actively "scattering" sub-populations
of distant trans-Neptunian minor bodies. Additionally, we find that within the stochastic layer,
the Lyapunov time of scattered disk objects approaches the orbital period, and show that the semi-major
axis diffusion coefficient is approximated by $\mathcal{D}_a\sim(8/(5\,\pi))\,(m_{\rm{N}}/M_{\odot})\,\sqrt{\mathcal{G}\,M_{\odot}\,a_{\rm{N}}}\,\exp\big[-(q/a_{\rm{N}})^2/2\big]$.
We confirm our results with numerical simulations and highlight the connections between scattered
disk dynamics and the Chirikov Standard Map. Implications of our results for the long-term evolution
of the distant solar system are discussed.

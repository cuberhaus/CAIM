We predicted, observed, and analyzed the multichord stellar occultation of the Second Gaia Data
Release (Gaia DR2) source 3449076721168026624 (m$_v$ = 14.1 mag) by the plutino object 2003 VS$_2$
(hereafter, VS$_2$) on 2019 October 22. We also carried out photometric observations to derive
the rotational light curve amplitude and rotational phase of VS$_2$ during the stellar occultation.
Combining the results and assuming a triaxial shape, we derived the 3D shape of VS$_2$. Out of the
39 observatories involved in the observational campaign, 12 sites reported a positive detection;
this makes it one of the best observed stellar occultations by a TNO so far. We obtained a rotational
light curve amplitude of ${\Delta}$m = 0.264 $\pm$ 0.017 mag, a mean area-equivalent diameter of
D$_{A_{eq}}$ = 545 $\pm$ 13 km, and a geometric albedo of 0.134 $\pm$ 0.010. The best triaxial shape
obtained for VS$_2$ has semiaxes a = 339 $\pm$ 5 km, b = 235 $\pm$ 6 km, and c = 226 $\pm$ 8 km. The derived
aspect angle is ${\theta}$ = 59${\deg} \pm$ 2${\deg}$ or its supplementary ${\theta}$ = 121${\deg}
\pm$ 2${\deg}$, depending on the north-pole position. The spherical-volume equivalent diameter
is D$_{V_{eq}}$ = 524 $\pm$ 7 km. If we consider large albedo patches on its surface, the semi-major
axis of the ellipsoid could be ~10 km smaller. These results are compatible with the previous ones
determined from the single-chord 2013 and four-chord 2014 stellar occultations and with the effective
diameter and albedo derived from Herschel and Spitzer data. They provide evidence that VS$_2$'s
3D shape is not compatible with a homogeneous triaxial body in hydrostatic equilibrium, but it might
be a differentiated body and/or might be sustaining some stress. No secondary features related
to rings or material orbiting around VS$_2$ were detected.

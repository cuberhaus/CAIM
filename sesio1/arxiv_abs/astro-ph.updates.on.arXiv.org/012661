The dynamics of ionized gas around the W33 Main ultracompact HII region is studied using observations
of hydrogen radio recombination lines and a detailed multiwavelength characterization of the
massive star-forming region W33 Main is performed. We used the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope
(GMRT) to observe the H167$\alpha$ recombination line at 1.4 GHz at an angular resolution of 10 arcsec,
and Karl. G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) data acquired in the GLOSTAR survey to study the dynamics
of ionized gas. We also observed the radio continuum at 1.4 GHz and 610 MHz with the GMRT and used GLOSTAR
4$-$8 GHz continuum data to characterize the nature of the radio emission. In addition, archival
data from submillimeter to near-infrared wavelengths were used to study the dust emission and identify
YSOs in the W33 Main star-forming region. The radio recombination lines were detected at good signal
to noise in the GLOSTAR data, while the H167$\alpha$ radio recombination line was marginally detected
with the GMRT. The spectral index of radio emission in the region determined from GMRT and GLOSTAR
shows the emission to be thermal in the entire region. Along with W33 Main, an arc-shaped diffuse
continuum source, G12.81$-$0.22, was detected with the GMRT data. The GLOSTAR recombination line
data reveal a velocity gradient across W33 Main and G12.81$-$0.22. The electron temperature is
found to be 6343 K and 4843 K in W33 Main and G12.81$-$0.22, respectively. The physical properties
of the W33 Main molecular clump were derived by modeling the dust emission using data from the ATLASGAL
and Hi-GAL surveys and they are consistent with the region being a relatively evolved site of massive
star formation. The gas dynamics and physical properties of G12.81$-$0.22 are consistent with
the HII region being in an evolved phase and its expansion on account of the pressure difference is
slowing down.

Clusters of galaxies are powerful probes with which to study cosmology and astrophysics. However,
for many applications an accurate measurement of a cluster's mass is essential. A systematic underestimate
of hydrostatic masses from X-ray observations (the so-called hydrostatic bias) may be responsible
for tension between the results of different cosmological measurements. We compare X-ray hydrostatic
masses with masses estimated using the caustic method (based on galaxy velocities) in order to explore
the systematic uncertainties of both methods and place new constraints on the level of hydrostatic
bias. Hydrostatic and caustic mass profiles were determined independently for a sample of 44 clusters
based on Chandra observations of clusters from the Hectospec Cluster Survey. This is the largest
systematic comparison of its kind. Masses were compared at a standardised radius ($R_{500}$) using
a model that includes possible bias and scatter in both mass estimates. The systematics affecting
both mass determination methods were explored in detail. The hydrostatic masses were found to be
systematically higher than caustic masses on average, and we found evidence that the caustic method
increasingly underestimates the mass when fewer galaxies are used to measure the caustics. We limit
our analysis to the 14 clusters with the best-sampled caustics where this bias is minimised ($\ge210$
galaxies), and find that the average ratio of hydrostatic to caustic mass at $R_{500}$ is $M_X/M_C=1.12^{+0.11}_{-0.10}$.
We interpret this result as a constraint on the level of hydrostatic bias, favouring small or zero
levels of hydrostatic bias (less than $20\%$ at the $3\sigma$ level). However, we find systematic
uncertainties associated with both mass estimation methods remain at the $10-15\%$ level, which
would permit significantly larger levels of hydrostatic bias.

Active regions (ARs) play an important role in the magnetic dynamics of the Sun. Solar surface flux
transport models (SFTMs) are used to describe the evolution of the radial magnetic field at the solar
surface. There is however uncertainty about using these models in the early stage of AR evolution.
We aim to test the applicability of SFTMs in the first days after the emergence of ARs by comparing
them with observations. The models we employ range from passive evolution to models where the inflows
around ARs are included. We simulate the evolution of the surface magnetic field of 17 emerging active
regions using a local surface flux transport simulation. We selected regions that do not form fully-fledged
sunspots that exhibit moat flows. The simulation includes diffusion and advection. We use observed
flows from local correlation tracking of solar granulation, as well as parametrizations of the
inflows around ARs. To evaluate our simulations, we measure the cross correlation between the observed
and the simulated magnetic field, as well as the total unsigned flux of the ARs, over time. We also
test the validity of our simulations by varying the starting time relative to the emergence of flux.
We find that the simulations using observed surface flows can reproduce the evolution of the observed
magnetic flux. The effect of buffeting of the field by supergranulation can be described as a diffusion
process. The SFTM is applicable after 90% of the peak total unsigned flux of the AR has emerged. Diffusivities
in the range between $D=250$ to $720$ km$^2$/s are consistent with the evolution of the AR flux in
the first five days after this time. We find that the converging flows around emerging ARs are not
important for the evolution of the total flux of the AR in these first five days; their effect of increasing
flux cancellation is balanced by the decrease of flux transport away from the AR.

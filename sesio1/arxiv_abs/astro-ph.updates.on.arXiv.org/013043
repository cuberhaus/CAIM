Cosmic Ray (CR) hits are the major contaminants in astronomical imaging and spectroscopic observations
involving solid-state detectors. Correctly identifying and masking them is a crucial part of the
image processing pipeline, since it may otherwise lead to spurious detections. For this purpose,
we have developed and tested a novel Deep Learning based framework for the automatic detection of
CR hits from astronomical imaging data from two different imagers: Dark Energy Camera (DECam) and
Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope (LCOGT). We considered two baseline models namely deepCR
and Cosmic-CoNN, which are the current state-of-the-art learning based algorithms that were trained
using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) ACS/WFC and LCOGT Network images respectively. We have experimented
with the idea of augmenting the baseline models using Attention Gates (AGs) to improve the CR detection
performance. We have trained our models on DECam data and demonstrate a consistent marginal improvement
by adding AGs in True Positive Rate (TPR) at 0.01% False Positive Rate (FPR) and Precision at 95% TPR
over the aforementioned baseline models for the DECam dataset. We demonstrate that the proposed
AG augmented models provide significant gain in TPR at 0.01% FPR when tested on previously unseen
LCO test data having images from three distinct telescope classes. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that the proposed baseline models with and without attention augmentation outperform state-of-the-art
models such as Astro-SCRAPPY, Maximask (that is trained natively on DECam data) and pre-trained
ground-based Cosmic-CoNN. This study demonstrates that the AG module augmentation enables us
to get a better deepCR and Cosmic-CoNN models and to improve their generalization capability on
unseen data.

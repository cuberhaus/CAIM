(Abridged) The question of how most stars in the Universe form remains open. While star formation
predominantly occurs in young massive clusters, the current framework focuses on isolated star
formation. One way to access the bulk of protostellar activity within star-forming clusters is
to trace signposts of active star formation with emission from molecular outflows. These outflows
are bright in water emission, providing a direct observational link between nearby and distant
galaxies. We propose to utilize the knowledge of local star formation as seen with molecular tracers
to explore the nature of star formation in the Universe. We present a large-scale statistical galactic
model of emission from galactic active star-forming regions. Our model is built on observations
of well-resolved nearby clusters. By simulating emission from molecular outflows, which is known
to scale with mass, we create a proxy that can be used to predict the emission from clustered star formation
at galactic scales. We evaluated the impact of the most important global-star formation parameters
(i.e., initial stellar mass function (IMF), molecular cloud mass distribution, star formation
efficiency (SFE), and free-fall time efficiency) on simulation results. We observe that for emission
from the para-H2O 202 - 111 line, the IMF and molecular cloud mass distribution have a negligible
impact on the emission, both locally and globally, whereas the opposite holds for the SFE and free-fall
time efficiency. Moreover, this water transition proves to be a low-contrast tracer of star formation.
The fine-tuning of the model and adaptation to morphologies of distant galaxies should result in
realistic predictions of observed molecular emission and make the galaxy-in-a-box model a tool
to analyze and better understand star formation throughout cosmological times.

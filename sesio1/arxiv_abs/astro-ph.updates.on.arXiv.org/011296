Young star clusters consisting of massive stars are the ideal sites to study the star formation processes
and influence of massive stars on the subsequent star formation. NGC 1893 is a young star cluster
associated with the HII region Sh2-236. It contains about five `O'-type stars and several early
`B'-type stars. It is located at a distance of $\sim$3.25 kpc and has a reddening, E(B-V)$\sim$0.4
mag. To characterize the young low-mass stellar population in the central portion of the cluster,
we carried out deep VI band observations of the region using the 4K$\times$4K CCD IMAGER mounted
on the 3.6-m DOT. Our analysis shows that the present data are deep enough to detect stars below $\sim$24
mag. We found optical counterparts of $\sim$220 candidate members, including young stars and unclassified
cluster members from Caramazza et al. (2008). We estimated the membership probabilities of the
Gaia sources (mostly bright stars with G$<$19 mag) located within the cluster radius using the Gaia
EDR3. Toward the fainter end, we used the optical color-magnitude diagram (CMD) to select the cluster
members from a sample of young stars. The unclassified member candidates and X-ray sources from
Caramazza et al. (2012) are also found to be young low-mass stars. In total, we identified $\sim$425
young stars with age$<$10 Myr, and 110 of these are new. Most of these stars appear kinematic members
of the cluster. By examining the CMD for the stars in the cluster region, we suggest that the cluster
has insignificant contamination due to field stars in the pre-main sequence zone of the CMD. The
slope of the mass function in the mass range 0.2$\le$M/M$\odot$$\le$2.5 is found to be $\Gamma$
= -1.43 $\pm$ 0.15, consistent with those of other star-forming complexes. The spatial distribution
of the young stars as a function of mass suggests that toward the cluster center, most of the stars
are massive.

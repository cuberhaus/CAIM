In this work, we aimed at investigating the star formation rate of active galactic nuclei host galaxies
in the early Universe. To this end, we constructed a sample of 149 luminous ($\rm L_{2-10keV} > 10^{44}\,erg\,s^{-1}$)
X-ray AGNs at $\rm z \geq3.5$ selected in three fields with different depths and observed areas (Chandra
COSMOS Legacy survey, XMM-XXL North and eFEDS). We built their spectral energy distributions (SED)
using available multi-wavelength photometry from X-rays up to far-IR. Then, we estimated the stellar
mass, M$_{*}$, and the SFR of the AGNs using the X-CIGALE SED fitting algorithm. After applying several
quality criteria, we ended up with 89 high-z sources. More than half (55\%) of the X-ray sample have
spectroscopic redshifts. Based on our analysis, our high-z X-ray AGNs live in galaxies with median
$\rm M_{*}=5.6 \times10^{10}~M_\odot$ and $\rm SFR_{*}\approx240\,M_\odot yr^{-1}$. The majority
of the high-z sources ($\sim89$\%) were found inside or above the main sequence (MS) of star-forming
galaxies. Estimation of the normalised SFR, $\rm SFR_{NORM}$, defined as the ratio of the SFR of
AGNs to the SFR of MS galaxies, showed that the SFR of AGNs is enhanched by a factor of $\sim 1.8$ compared
to non-AGN star-forming systems. Combining our results with previous studies at lower redshifts,
we confirmed that $\rm SFR_{NORM}$ does not evolve with redshift. Using the specific BHAR (i.e.,
$\rm L_X$ divided by $\rm M_{*}$), $\rm \lambda _{BHAR}$, that can be used as a tracer of the Eddington
ratio, we found that the bulk of AGNs that lie inside or above the MS have higher specific accretion
rates compared to sources below the MS. Finally, we found indications that the SFR of the most massive
AGN host galaxies ($\rm log\,(M_{*}/ M_\odot) >10^{11.5-12}$) remains roughly constant as a function
of M$_*$, in agreement with the SFR of MS star-forming galaxies.

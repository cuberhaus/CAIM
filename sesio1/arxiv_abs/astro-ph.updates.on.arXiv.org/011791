Gravitational wave (GW) signals from compact binary coalescences can be used as standard sirens
to constrain cosmological parameters if their redshift can be measured independently. However,
mergers of stellar binary black holes (BBHs) may not have electromagnetic counterparts and thus
have no direct redshift measurements. These dark sirens may be still used to statistically constrain
cosmological parameters by combining their GW measured luminosity distances and localization
with deep redshift surveys of galaxies around it. We investigate this dark siren method in detail
by using mock BBH and galaxy samples. We find that the Hubble constant can be constrained well with
an accuracy $\lesssim1\%$ with a few tens or more of BBH mergers at redshift up to $1$ if GW observations
can provide accurate estimates of their luminosity distance (with relative error of $\lesssim0.01$)
and localization ($\lesssim0.1~\rm{deg}^2$), though the constraint may be significantly biased
if the luminosity distance and localization errors are larger. We also introduce a simple method
to correct this bias and find it is valid when the luminosity distance and localization errors are
modestly large. We further generate mock BBH samples, according to current constraints on BBH merger
rate and the distributions of BBH properties, and find that the Deci-hertz Observatory (DO) in a
half year observation period may detect about one hundred BBHs with signal-to-noise ratio $\varrho\gtrsim30$,
relative luminosity distance error $\lesssim0.02$, and localization error $\lesssim0.01\rm{deg}^2$.
By applying the dark standard siren method, we find that the Hubble constant can be constrained to
the $\sim0.1-1\%$ level using these DO BBHs, an accuracy comparable to the constraints obtained
by using electromagnetic observations in the near future, thus it may provide insight into the Hubble
tension.

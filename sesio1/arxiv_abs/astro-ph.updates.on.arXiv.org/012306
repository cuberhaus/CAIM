Halo models and halo occupation distributions (HODs) are important tools to model the galaxy and
matter distribution. We present and assess a new method for constraining the parameters of HODs
using the gravitational lensing shear around galaxy pairs, galaxy-galaxy-galaxy-lensing (G3L).
In contrast to galaxy-galaxy-lensing, G3L is sensitive to correlations between the per-halo numbers
of galaxies from different populations. We use G3L to probe these correlations and test the default
hypothesis that they are negligible. We derive a halo model for G3L and validate it with realistic
mock data from the Millennium Simulation and a semi-analytic galaxy model. Then, we analyse public
data from the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), the VISTA Infrared Kilo-Degree Galaxy Survey (VIKING)
and data from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly Survey (GAMA) to infer the HODs of galaxies at $z<0.5$ in
five different stellar mass bins between $10^{8.5}h^{-2} M_\odot$ and $10^{11.5}h^{-2} M_\odot$
and two colours (red and blue), as well as correlations between satellite numbers. The analysis
recovers the true HODs in the simulated data within the $68\%$ credibility range. The inferred HODs
vary significantly with colour and stellar mass. There is also strong evidence ($>3\sigma$) for
correlations, increasing with halo mass, between the numbers of red and blue satellites and galaxies
with stellar masses below $10^{10} \Msun. Possible causes of these correlations are the selection
of similar galaxies in different samples, the survey flux limit, or physical mechanisms like a fixed
ratio between the satellite numbers of distinct populations. The decorrelation for halos with
smaller masses is probably an effect of shot noise by low-occupancy halos. The inferred HODs can
be used to complement galaxy-galaxy-lensing or galaxy clustering HOD studies or as input to cosmological
analyses and improved mock galaxy catalogues.

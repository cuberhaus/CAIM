Aims. Estimates of coronal wave energy remain uncertain as a large fraction of the energy is likely
hidden in the non-thermal line widths of emission lines. In order to estimate these wave energies,
many previous studies have considered the root mean squared wave amplitudes to be a factor of $\sqrt{2}$
greater than the non-thermal line widths. However, other studies have used different factors.
To investigate this problem, we consider the relation between wave amplitudes and the non-thermal
line widths within a variety of 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. Methods. We consider
the following 3D numerical models: Alfv\'en waves in a uniform magnetic field, transverse waves
in a complex braided magnetic field, and two simulations of coronal heating in an arcade. We applied
the forward modelling code FoMo to generate the synthetic emission data required to analyse the
non-thermal line widths. Results. Determining a single value for the ratio between the non-thermal
line widths and the root mean squared wave amplitudes is not possible across multiple simulations.
It was found to depend on a variety of factors, including line-of-sight angles, velocity magnitudes,
wave interference, and exposure time. Indeed, some of our models achieved the values claimed in
recent articles while other more complex models deviated from these ratios. Conclusions. To estimate
wave energies, an appropriate relation between the non-thermal line widths and root mean squared
wave amplitudes is required. However, evaluating this ratio to be a singular value, or even providing
a lower or upper bound on it, is not realistically possible given its sensitivity to various MHD models
and factors. As the ratio between wave amplitudes and non-thermal line widths is not constant across
our models, we suggest that this widely used method for estimating wave energy is not robust.

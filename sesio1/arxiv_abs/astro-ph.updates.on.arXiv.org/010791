Semi-regular variables (SRVs) are similar to Miras in brightness, and they also follow PLRs, though
not necessarily the same as Miras. As potential standard candles they are more challenging than
Miras due to their smaller variability amplitudes and less regular light curves, but they are substantially
more numerous and especially promising to probe old stellar populations. We aim to characterize
the variability of SRVs, with focus on their connection with Miras, in order to prepare the ground
for investigating their potential as distance indicators. We examine SRVs and Miras in the Magellanic
Clouds from OGLE-III observations, with data from Gaia and 2MASS. After cleaning the sample from
variability periods unrelated to pulsation, we classify each source by chemical type and combination
of pulsation modes. We examine the results in terms of global photometric and pulsation properties.
We identify four SRVs groups that fit the general evolutionary scenario predicted by theory. SRVs
dominated by fundamental-mode pulsation are very similar to Miras, especially if mono-periodic.
They further split into two sub-groups, one of which follows the same sequence as Miras in the period-luminosity
and period-amplitude diagram, without discontinuity. The similarities between Miras and SRVs
suggest that the latter can be adopted as complementary distance indicators to the former, thereby
at least doubling the available number of LPVs suitable for use as distance indicators. The traditional
amplitude-based separation between Miras and SRVs is not necessarily appropriate, and a more physically
sound criterion should also involve pulsation periods. While this would require comparatively
longer time series, they are expected to become accessible in the coming years even for weak sources
thanks to current and future large-scale surveys. The table of reclassified LPVs is made public.

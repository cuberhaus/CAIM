Coronagraphic imaging of exoplanets using ground-based instruments on large telescopes is intrinsically
limited by speckles induced by uncorrected aberrations. These aberrations originate from the
imperfect correction of the atmosphere by an extreme adaptive optics system; from static optical
defects; or from small opto-mechanical variations due to changes in temperature, pressure, or
gravity vector. More than the speckles themselves, the performance of high-contrast imagers is
ultimately limited by their temporal stability, since most post-processing techniques rely on
difference of images acquired at different points in time. Identifying the origin of the aberrations
and the timescales involved is therefore crucial to understanding the fundamental limits of dedicated
high-contrast instruments. We previously demonstrated the use of a Zernike wavefront sensor called
ZELDA for sensing non-common path aberrations (NCPA) in VLT/SPHERE. We now use ZELDA to investigate
the stability of the instrumental aberrations using 5 long sequences of measurements obtained
at high cadence on the internal source. Our study reveals two regimes of decorrelation of the NCPA.
The first, with a characteristic timescale of a few seconds and an amplitude of a few nanometers,
is induced by a fast internal turbulence within the enclosure. The second is a slow quasi-linear
decorrelation on the order of a few $10^{-3}$ nm rms/s that acts on timescales from minutes to hours.
We use coronagraphic image reconstruction to demonstrate that these two NCPA contributions have
a measurable impact on differences of images, and that the fast internal turbulence is a dominating
term over to the slow linear decorrelation. We also use dedicated sequences where the derotator
and atmospheric dispersion compensators emulate a real observation to demonstrate the importance
of performing observations symmetric around the meridian.

We propose a cosmological scenario in which the universe undergoes through a non-singular bounce,
and after the bounce, it decelerates having a matter-like dominated evolution during some regime
of the deceleration era, and finally at the present epoch it evolves through an accelerating stage.
Our aim is to study such evolution in the context of Chern-Simons corrected F(R) gravity theory and
confront the model with various observational data. Using the reconstruction technique, and in
addition by employing suitable boundary conditions, we determine the form of F(R) for the entire
possible range of the cosmic time. The form of F(R) seems to unify a non-singular bounce with a dark
energy epoch, in particular, from a non-singular bounce to a deceleration epoch and from a deceleration
epoch to a late time acceleration era. It is important to mention that the bouncing scenario in the
present context is an asymmetric bounce, in particular, the Hubble radius monotonically increases
and asymptotically diverges at the late contracting era, while it seems to decrease with time at
the present epoch. Such evolution of the Hubble radius leads to the primordial perturbation modes
generate at the deep contracting era when all the perturbation modes lie within the horizon. We calculate
the scalar and tensor power spectra, and as a result, the primordial observables are found to be in
agreement with the latest Planck 2018 constraints. In this regard, the Chern-Simons term seems
to have considerable effects on the tensor perturbation evolution, however keeping intact the
scalar part of the perturbation with that of in the case of a vacuum F(R) model, and as a result, the
Chern-Simons term proves to play an important role in making the observable quantities consistent
with the Planck results. Furthermore the theoretical expectation of the dark energy observables
are confronted with the Planck+SNe+BAO data.

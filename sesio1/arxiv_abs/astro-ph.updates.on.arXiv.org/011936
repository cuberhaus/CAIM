Classical Cepheids are the most popular distance indicators and tracers of young stellar populations.
The key advantage is that they are bright and they can be easily identified in Local Group and Local
Volume galaxies. Their evolutionary and pulsation properties depend on their chemical abundances.
The main aim of this investigation is to perform a new and accurate abundance analysis of two tens
of calibrating Galactic Cepheids using high spectral resolution (R$\sim$40,000-115,000) and
high S/N spectra ($\sim$400) covering the entire pulsation cycle. We focus our attention on possible
systematics affecting the estimate of atmospheric parameters and elemental abundances along
the pulsation cycle. We cleaned the line list by using atomic transition parameters based on laboratory
measurements and by removing lines that are either blended or display abundance variations along
the pulsation cycle. The spectroscopic approach that we developed brings forward small dispersions
in the variation of the atmospheric parameters ($\sigma$($T_{\rm eff}$)$\sim$50 K, $\sigma$($\log{g}$)$\sim$0.2
dex, and $\sigma$($\xi$)$\sim$0.2 km/s) and in the abundance of both iron ($\lesssim$ 0.05 dex)
and alpha elements ($\lesssim$0.10 dex) over the entire pulsation cycle. We also provide new and
accurate effective temperature templates by splitting the calibrating Cepheids into four different
period bins, ranging from short to long periods. For each period bin, we performed an analytical
fit with Fourier series providing $\theta = 5040/{T_{\rm eff}}$ as a function of the pulsation phase.
The current findings are a good viaticum to trace the chemical enrichment of the Galactic thin disk
by using classical Cepheids and a fundamental stepping stone for further investigations into the
more metal-poor regime typical of Magellanic Cepheids.

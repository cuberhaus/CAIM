The extended stellar halos of galaxies contain important clues for investigating their assembly
history and evolution. We investigate the resolved stellar content and the extended halo of NGC
5128 as a function of galactocentric distance. We used HST images to resolve individual red giant
branch (RGB) stars in 28 independent pointings. Star counts from deep VI color-magnitude diagrams
reaching at least 1.5 mag below the tip of the RGB are used to derive the surface density distribution
of the halo. The contamination by Milky Way stars is assessed with a new control field, with models,
and by combining optical and near-IR photometry. We present a new calibration of the WFC3 F606W+F814W
photometry to the ground-based VI photometric system. The photometry shows that the stellar halo
of NGC 5128 is dominated by old RGB stars that are present in all fields. The V-band surface brightness
changes from 23 to 32 mag/arcsec$^2$ between 8.3 kpc from the galaxy center to our outermost halo
fields located 140 kpc away from the center along the major axis and 92 kpc along the minor axis. Within
~30 kpc, we also find evidence for a 2-3 Gyr old population traced by bright asymptotic giant branch
stars. This population contributes only up to 10% in total stellar mass if it is 2 Gyr old, but a larger
fraction of 30-40% is required if its age is 3 Gyr. The stellar surface density profile is well fit
by a r$^{1/4}$ curve or a power-law $\sim r^{-3.1}$ over the full radial range, with no obvious break
in the slope, but with large field-to-field scatter. The ellipticity measured from integrated-light
photometry in the inner parts, $e=(b/a)=0.77$, flattens to $e=0.54 \pm 0.02$ beyond 30 kpc. Considering
the flattening of the outer halo, the projection of the elliptical isophote on the semimajor axis
for our most distant field reaches nearly 30 effective radii. [abridged]

In the second work of this series, we explore the optimal search strategy for serendipitous and gravitational-wave-triggered
target-of-opportunity observations of kilonovae (KNe) and optical short-duration gamma-ray
burst (sGRB) afterglows (AGs) from binary neutron star (BNS) mergers, assuming that cosmological
KNe are AT2017gfo-like (but with viewing-angle dependence) and that the properties of AGs are consistent
with those of cosmological sGRB AGs. A one-day cadence serendipitous search strategy with an exposure
time of $\sim30\,$s can always achieve an optimal search strategy of KNe and AGs for various survey
projects. We show that the optimal detection rates of the KN-dominated (AG-dominated) events are
$\sim0.2/0.5/0.8/20\,$yr$^{-1}$ ($\sim500/300/600/3000\,$yr$^{-1}$) for ZTF/Mephisto/WFST/LSST,
respectively. A better search strategy for SiTian is to increase the exposure time. SiTian can find
$\sim5(6000)\,$yr$^{-1}$ KN-dominated (AG-dominated) events. We predict abundant off-axis
orphan AGs may be recorded in the survey database although not been identified. For target-of-opportunity
observations, we simulate the maximum BNS gravitational-wave (GW) detection rates, which are
$\sim27/210/1800/2.0\times10^5\,$yr$^{-1}$, in the networks of 2nd/2.5th/3rd(Voyager)/3rd(ET\&CE)-generation
GW detectors. In the upcoming 2nd-generation networks, follow-up observations with a limiting
magnitude of $m_{\rm limit}\gtrsim22-23\,$mag can discover all EM signals from BNS GW events.
Among these detected GW events, $\sim60\%$ events ($\sim16\,$yr$^{-1}$) can detect clear KN signals,
while AG-dominated events would account for the other $\sim40\%$ events ($\sim11\,$yr$^{-1}$).
In the 2.5th- and 3rd(Voyager)-generation era, the critical magnitudes for the detection of EM
emissions from all BNS GW events would be $\sim23.5\,$mag and $\sim25\,$mag, respectively.

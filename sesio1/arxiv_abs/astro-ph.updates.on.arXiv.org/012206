We searched for correlations between the number of satellites and fundamental galactic properties
for the Milky Way-like host galaxies in order to better understand their diverse satellite populations.
We specifically aim to understand why galaxies that are very similar in stellar mass content, star
formation rate, and local environment have very different numbers of satellites. Satellites of
Galactic Analogs (SAGA) spectroscopic survey has completed spectroscopic observations of 36
Milky Way-like galaxies within their virial radii down to the luminosity of Leo I dwarf galaxy. All
the available galactic properties of SAGA galaxies from the literature along with measured stellar
masses were correlated with the number of satellites and no significant correlation was found.
However, when we considered the "expected" number of satellites based on the correlation between
the baryonic bulge-to-total ratio and the number of satellites confirmed for several nearby galaxies
then strong correlations emerge between this number and (1) the mass of the bulge, and (2) the total
specific angular momentum. The first correlation is positive, implying that galaxies with more
massive bulges have more satellites, as already confirmed. The second correlation with the angular
momentum is negative, meaning that, the smaller the angular momentum, the greater the number of
expected satellites. This would imply that either satellites cannot form if galaxy angular momentum
is too high, or that satellites form inside-out, so that angular momentum is being transferred to
the outer parts of the galaxies. However, deeper spectroscopic observations are needed to confirm
these findings, because they rely on the expected rather than detected number of satellites. There
was a luminosity limit to the SAGA survey equivalent to the luminosity of Leo I dwarf satellite of
the Milky Way galaxy.

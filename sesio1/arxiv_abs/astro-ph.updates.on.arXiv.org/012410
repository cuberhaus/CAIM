In accelerating and supersonic media, the interaction of photons with spectral lines can be of ultimate
importance. However, fully accounting for such line forces currently can only be done by specialised
codes in 1-D steady-state flows. More general cases and higher dimensions require alternative
approaches. We presented a comprehensive and fast method for computing the radiation line-force
using tables of spectral line-strength distribution parameters, which can be applied in arbitrary
(multi-D, time-dependent) simulations, including those accounting for the line-deshadowing
instability, to compute the appropriate opacities. We assumed local thermodynamic equilibrium
to compute a flux-weighted line opacity from $>4$ million spectral lines. We derived the spectral
line strength and tabulated the corresponding line-distribution parameters for a range of input
densities $\rho\in[10^{-20},10^{-10}]gcm^{-3}$ and temperatures $T\in[10^4,10^{4.7}]K$.
We found that the variation of the line distribution parameters plays an essential role in setting
the wind dynamics in our models. In our benchmark study, we also found a good overall agreement between
the O-star mass-loss rates of our models and those derived from steady-state studies using more
detailed radiative transfer. Our models reinforce that self-consistent variation of the line-distribution
parameters is important for the dynamics of line-driven flows. Within a well-calibrated O-star
regime, our results support the proposed methodology. In practice, utilising the provided tables,
yielded a factor $>100$ speed-up in computational time compared to specialised 1-D model-atmosphere
codes of line-driven winds, which constitutes an important step towards efficient multi-D simulations.
We conclude that our method and tables are ready to be exploited in various radiation-hydrodynamic
simulations where the line force is important.

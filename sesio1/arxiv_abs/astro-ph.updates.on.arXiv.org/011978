Type Ia supernovae play a critical role in stellar feedback and elemental enrichment in galaxies.
Recent transient surveys like the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernova (ASAS-SN) and the Dark
Energy Survey (DES) find that the specific Ia rate at z ~ 0 may be ~ 15-50 times higher in lower-mass
galaxies than at Milky Way-mass. Independently, Milky Way observations show that the close-binary
fraction of solar-type stars is higher at lower metallicity. Motivated by these observations,
we use the FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in simulations to explore the impact of varying Ia rate models,
including metallicity dependence, on galaxies across a range of stellar masses: 10^7 Msun - 10^{11}
Msun. First, we benchmark our simulated star-formation histories (SFHs) against observations.
We show that assumed SFHs and stellar mass functions play a major role in determining the degree of
tension between observations and metallicity-independent Ia rate models, and potentially cause
ASAS-SN and DES observations to be much more consistent with each other than might naively appear.
Models in which the Ia rate increases with decreasing metallicity (as ~ Z^{-0.5} to Z^{-1}) provide
significantly better agreement with observations. Encouragingly, these increases in Ia rate
(> 10 times in low-mass galaxies) do not significantly impact galaxy stellar masses and morphologies:
effective radii, axis ratios, and v/sigma remain largely unaffected except for our most extreme
rate models. We explore implications for both [Fe/H] and [alpha/Fe] enrichment: metallicity-dependent
Ia rate models can improve agreement with observed stellar mass-metallicity relations in low-mass
galaxies. Our results demonstrate that a wide range of metallicity-dependent Ia models are viable
for galaxy formation and motivate future work in this area.

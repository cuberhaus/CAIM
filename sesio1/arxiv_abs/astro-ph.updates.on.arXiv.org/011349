We use 20 years of magnetic field measurements from the Oersted, CHAMP and Swarm satellite missions,
supplemented by calibrated platform magnetometer data from the CryoSat2 satellite, to study time
variations of the Earth's core field at satellite altitude and at the core-mantle boundary (CMB).
From the satellite data we derive composite time series of the core field secular variation (SV)
with 4month cadence, at 300 globally distributed Geomagnetic Virtual Observatories (GVO). GVO
radial SV series display regional fluctuations with 5-10 years duration and amplitudes reaching
20 nT/yr, most notably at low latitudes over Indonesia (2014), over South America and the South Atlantic
(2007, 2011 and 2014), and over the central Pacific (2017). Applying the Subtractive Optimally
Localized Averages (SOLA) method, we map the SV at the CMB as a collection of locally averaged SV estimates.
We demonstrate that using 2-year windows of CryoSat2 data, it is possible to reliably estimate the
SV and its time derivative, the secular acceleration (SA), at the CMB, with a spatial resolution,
corresponding to spherical harmonic degree 10. Along the CMB geographic equator, we find strong
SA features under Indonesia from 2011-2014, under central America from 2015 to 2019, and sequences
of SA with alternating sign under the Atlantic during 2004-2019. We find that data from CryoSat2
make a valuable contribution to the emerging picture of sub-decadal core field variations. Using
1 year windows of data from the Swarm satellites, it is possible to study SA changes at low latitudes
on timescales down to 1 year, with spatial resolution corresponding to spherical harmonic degree
10. We find strong positive and negative SA features appearing side-by-side in the Pacific in 2017,
and thereafter drift westward.

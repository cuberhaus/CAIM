Galactic haloes in a $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) universe are predicted to host
today a swarm of debris resulting from cannibalised dwarf galaxies that have been accreted via the
process of hierarchical mass assembly. The chemo-dynamical information recorded in the Galactic
stellar populations associated with such systems helps elucidate their nature, placing constraints
on the mass assembly history of the Milky Way. Using data from the APOGEE and \textit{Gaia} surveys,
we examine APOGEE targets belonging to the following substructures in the stellar halo: Heracles,
\textit{Gaia}-Enceladus/Sausage (GES), Sagittarius dSph, the Helmi stream, Sequoia, Thamnos,
Aleph, LMS-1, Arjuna, I'itoi, Nyx, Icarus, and Pontus. We examine the distributions of all substructures
in chemical space, considering the abundances of elements sampling various nucleosynthetic pathways.
Our main findings include: {\it i)} the chemical properties of GES, Heracles, the Helmi stream,
Sequoia, Thamnos, LMS-1, Arjuna, and I'itoi match qualitatively those of dwarf satellites of the
Milky Way, such as the Sagittarius dSph; {\it ii)} the abundance pattern of the recently discovered
inner Galaxy substructure Heracles differs statistically from that of populations formed {\it
in situ}. Heracles also differs chemically from all other substructures; {\it iii)} the abundance
patterns of Sequoia (selected in various ways), Arjuna, LMS-1, and I'itoi are indistinguishable
from that of GES, indicating a possible common origin; {\it iv)} the abundance patterns of the Helmi
stream and Thamnos substructures are different from all other halo substructures; {\it v)} the
chemical properties of Nyx and Aleph are very similar to those of disc stars, implying that these
substructures likely have an \textit{in situ} origin.

Star-forming galaxies (SFGs) are expected to harbour an abundant reservoir of cosmic rays (CRs).
At GeV energies, these CRs can undergo hadronic interactions with interstellar gases to produce
$\gamma$-rays, and the unresolved $\gamma$-ray emission from populations of SFGs form a component
of the extragalactic $\gamma$-ray background (EGB). In this work, we investigate the contribution
to the 0.01 - 50 GeV EGB from SFG populations located up to redshift $z=3$. We consider their redshift
evolution and variations in their physical properties, and model how this affects their contribution
to the EGB. We find this is dominated by starbursts, while the contribution from main sequence SFGs
is marginal at all energies. We also demonstrate that most of the $\gamma$-ray contribution from
SFGs emanates from low mass galaxies, with over 80 per cent of the emission originating from galaxies
with stellar masses below $10^8 \;\!{\rm M}_{\odot}$. We show that the EGB at different energies
captures different stages of the evolution of the source galaxies. At 0.01 GeV, the emission is dominated
by galaxies at the noon of cosmic star-formation, around $z\sim 2$, however higher energy $\gamma$-rays
are instead mainly contributed from low mass starburst populations at higher redshifts, $\sim$
700 Myr earlier. The redshift distributions of the EGB sources at different energies imprint intensity
signatures at different angular scales, allowing their contribution to be distinguished using
analyses of small-scale EGB intensity anisotropies. We show that the EGB is sensitive to the evolution
of low mass populations of galaxies, particularly around $z\sim2-2.5$, and that it provides a new
means to probe the engagement of CRs in these galaxies before and during the high noon of cosmic star-formation.

Close-by planets may excite various kinds of oscillations in their host stars through their time-varying
tidal potential. Magnetostrophic oscillations with a frequency much smaller than the stellar
rotation frequency have recently been proposed to account for the spin-orbit commensurability
observed in several planet-hosting stars. In principle, they can be resonantly excited in an isolated
slender magnetic flux tube by a Fourier component of the time-varying tidal potential with a very
low frequency in the reference frame rotating with the host. However, due to the weakness of such
high-order tidal components, a mechanism is required to lock the oscillations in phase with the
forcing for long time intervals ($10^{3}-10^{7}$ years) in order to allow the oscillation amplitude
to grow. We propose that the locking mechanism is an autoresonance produced by the non-linear dependence
of the oscillation frequency on its amplitude. We suggest that the angular momentum loss rate is
remarkably reduced in hosts entering autoresonance that contributes to maintain those systems
in that regime for a long time. We apply our model to a sample of ten systems showing spin-orbit commensurability
and estimate the maximum drifts of the relevant tidal potential frequencies that allow them to enter
the autoresonant regime. Such drifts are compared with the expected drifts owing to the tidal evolution
of the planetary orbits and the stellar angular momentum loss in the magnetized winds finding that
autoresonance is a viable mechanism in eight systems, at least in our idealized model. The duration
of the autoresonant regime and the associated spin-orbit commensurability may be comparable with
the main-sequence lifetimes of the host stars, indicating that gyrochronology may not be applicable
to those hosts.

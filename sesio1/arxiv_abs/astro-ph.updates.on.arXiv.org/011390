Making use of the publicly available 1D photoionization hydrodynamics code ATES we set out to investigate
the combined effects of planetary gravitational potential energy ($\phi_p\equiv GM_p/R_p$)
and stellar XUV irradiation ($F_{\rm XUV}$) on the evaporation efficiency ($\eta$) of moderately-to-highly
irradiated gaseous planets, from sub-Neptunes through hot Jupiters. We show that the (known) existence
of a threshold potential above which energy-limited escape (i.e., $\eta\simeq 1$) is unattainable
can be inferred analytically. For $\phi_p\gtrsim \phi_p^{\rm thr}\approx [7.7-14.4]\times
10^{12}$ erg g$^{-1}$, most of the energy absorption occurs where the average kinetic energy acquired
by the ions through photo-electron collisions is insufficient for escape. This causes the evaporation
efficiency to plummet with increasing $\phi_p$,. Whether or not planets with $\phi_p\lesssim
\phi_p^{\rm thr}$ exhibit energy-limited outflows is regulated primarily by the stellar irradiation
level. Specifically, the following analytical threshold is derived: $F_{\rm XUV}^{\rm thr}\approx
[2-8]\times 10^3 (g/g_\oplus)$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. Above this value, Ly$\alpha$ losses overtake
adiabatic cooling and the evaporation efficiency of low-gravity planets, too, drops below the
energy-limited approximation, albeit remaining largely independent of $\phi_p$. Further, we
show that whereas $\eta$ increases as $F_{\rm XUV}$ increases for planets above $\phi^{\rm thr}_p$,
the opposite is true for low-gravity planets. This behaviour can be understood by examining the
relative fractional contributions of adiabatic vs. Ly$\alpha$ cooling as a function of atmospheric
temperature. This novel framework enables a reliable, physically motivated prediction of the
expected evaporation efficiency for a given planetary system; an analytical approximation of
the best-fitting $\eta$ is given in the Appendix.

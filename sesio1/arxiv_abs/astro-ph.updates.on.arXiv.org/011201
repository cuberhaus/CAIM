Long-duration gamma-ray bursts are thought to be associated with the core-collapse of massive,
rapidly spinning stars and the formation of black holes. However, efficient angular momentum transport
in stellar interiors, currently supported by asteroseismic and gravitational-wave constraints,
leads to predominantly slowly-spinning stellar cores. Here, we report on binary stellar evolution
and population synthesis calculations, showing that tidal interactions in close binaries not
only can explain the observed sub-population of spinning, merging binary black holes but also lead
to long gamma-ray bursts at the time of black-hole formation. Given our model calibration against
the distribution of isotropic-equivalent energies of luminous long gamma-ray bursts, we find
that ~10% of the GWTC-2 reported binary black holes had a luminous long gamma-ray burst associated
with their formation, with GW190517 and GW190719 having a probability of ~85% and ~60%, respectively,
being among them. Moreover, given an assumption about their average beaming fraction, our model
predicts the rate density of long gamma-ray bursts, as a function of redshift, originating from
this channel. For a constant beaming fraction $f_\mathrm{B}\sim 0.05$ our model predicts a rate
density comparable to the observed one, throughout the redshift range, while, at redshift $z \in
[0,2.5]$, a tentative comparison with the metallicity distribution of observed LGRB host galaxies
implies that between 20% to 85% of the observed long gamma-ray bursts may originate from progenitors
of merging binary black holes. The proposed link between a potentially significant fraction of
observed, luminous long gamma-ray bursts and the progenitors of spinning binary black-hole mergers
allows us to probe the latter well outside the horizon of current-generation gravitational wave
observatories, and out to cosmological distances.

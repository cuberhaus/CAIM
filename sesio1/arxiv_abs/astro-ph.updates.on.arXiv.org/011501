An accurate covariance matrix is essential for obtaining reliable cosmological results when using
a Gaussian likelihood. In this paper we study the covariance of pseudo-$C_\ell$ estimates of tomographic
cosmic shear power spectra. Using two existing publicly available codes in combination, we calculate
the full covariance matrix, including mode-coupling contributions arising from both partial
sky coverage and non-linear structure growth. For three different sky masks, we compare the theoretical
covariance matrix to that estimated from publicly available N-body weak lensing simulations,
finding good agreement. We find that as a more extreme sky cut is applied, a corresponding increase
in both Gaussian off-diagonal covariance and non-Gaussian super-sample covariance is observed
in both theory and simulations, in accordance with expectations. Studying the different contributions
to the covariance in detail, we find that the Gaussian covariance dominates along the main diagonal
and the closest off-diagonals, but further away from the main diagonal the super-sample covariance
is dominant. Forming mock constraints in parameters describing matter clustering and dark energy,
we find that neglecting non-Gaussian contributions to the covariance can lead to underestimating
the true size of confidence regions by up to 70 per cent. The dominant non-Gaussian covariance component
is the super-sample covariance, but neglecting the smaller connected non-Gaussian covariance
can still lead to the underestimation of uncertainties by 10--20 per cent. A real cosmological analysis
will require marginalisation over many nuisance parameters, which will decrease the relative
importance of all cosmological contributions to the covariance, so these values should be taken
as upper limits on the importance of each component.

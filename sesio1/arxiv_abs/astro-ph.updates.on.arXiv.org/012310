In the context of the IRAM 30m Large Program GEMS, we present a study of thioformaldehyde in several
starless cores located in star-forming filaments of Taurus, Perseus, and Orion. We investigate
the influence of the environmental conditions on the abundances of these molecules in the cores,
and the effect of time evolution. We have modelled the observed lines of H2CS, HDCS, and D2CS using
the radiative transfer code RADEX. We have also used the chemical code Nautilus to model the evolution
of these species depending on the characteristics of the starless cores. We derive column densities
and abundances for all the cores. We also derive deuterium fractionation ratios, Dfrac, to determine
and compare the evolutionary stage between different parts of each star-forming region. Our results
indicate that the north region of the B213 filament in Taurus is more evolved than the south, while
the north-eastern part of Perseus presents an earlier evolutionary stage than the south-western
zone. Model results also show that Dfrac decreases with the cosmic-ray ionisation rate, while it
increases with density and with the degree of sulphur depletion. In particular, we only reproduce
the observations when the initial sulphur abundance in the starless cores is at least one order of
magnitude lower than the solar elemental sulphur abundance. The progressive increase in HDCS/H2CS
and D2CS/H2CS with time makes these ratios powerful tools for deriving the chemical evolutionary
stage of starless cores. However, they cannot be used to derive the temperature of these regions,
since both ratios present a similar evolution at two different temperature ranges (7-11 K and 15-19
K). Regarding chemistry, (deuterated) thioformaldehyde is mainly formed through gas-phase reactions
(double-replacement and neutral-neutral displacement reactions), while surface chemistry
plays an important role as a destruction mechanism.

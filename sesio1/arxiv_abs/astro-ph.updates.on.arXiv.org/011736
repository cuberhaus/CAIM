M105 is an early-type galaxy in the nearby Leo I group, the closest galaxy group to contain all galaxy
types and therefore an excellent environment to explore the low-mass end of intra-group light (IGL)
assembly. We present a new extended kinematic survey of planetary nebulae (PNe) in M105 and the surrounding
30'x30' in the Leo I group with the Planetary Nebula Spectrograph. We use PNe as kinematic tracers
of the diffuse stellar light in the halo and IGL and employ Gaussian mixture models to separate contributions
from the companion galaxy NGC 3384 and associate PNe with halo and IGL components around M105. We
present a catalogue of 314 PNe and firmly associate 93 with NGC 3384 and 169 with M105. The PNe in M105
are further associated with its halo and the surrounding exponential envelope. We construct smooth
velocity and velocity dispersion fields and calculate projected rotation, velocity dispersion,
and $\lambda_R$ profiles for each component. Halo PNe exhibit declining velocity dispersion and
rotation profiles, while the velocity dispersion and rotation of the exponential envelope increase
notably at large radii. We identify three regimes with distinct kinematics that are linked to distinct
stellar population properties: (i) the rotating core (within $1~R_\mathrm{eff}$) formed in situ
and dominated by metal-rich ([M/H]~0) stars likely formed in situ, (ii) the halo from 1 to $7.5~R_\mathrm{eff}$
consisting of intermediate-metallicity stars ([M/H]>-1), either formed in situ or brought in
through major mergers, and (iii) the exponential envelope reaching beyond our farthest data point
at 16 $R_\mathrm{eff}$, predominately composed of metal-poor ([M/H]<-1) stars. The high velocity
dispersion and moderate rotation of the latter are consistent with that measured for dwarf satellite
galaxies in the Leo I group, indicating that the exponential envelope traces the transition to the
IGL.

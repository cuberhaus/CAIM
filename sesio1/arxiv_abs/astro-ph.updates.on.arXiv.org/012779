The optical properties of the second generation dust that we observe in debris disks remain quite
elusive, whether it is the absorption efficiencies at millimeter wavelengths or the (un)polarized
phase function at near-infrared wavelengths. Thankfully the same particles are experiencing
forces that are size dependent (e.g., radiation pressure), and with high angular resolution observations
we can take advantage of this natural spatial segregation. Observations at different wavelengths
probe different ranges of sizes, and there is therefore a great synergy in multi-wavelength observations
to better constrain the optical properties of the particles. We present a new approach to simultaneously
model SPHERE and ALMA observations and apply it to the debris disk around HD\,32297, putting the
emphasis on the spatial distribution of the grains with different $\beta$ values. This modeling
approach requires few assumptions on the actual sizes of the particles and the interpretation can
therefore be done a posteriori. We find that the ALMA observations are best reproduced with a combination
of small and large $\beta$ values ($0.03$ and $0.42$) while the SPHERE observations require several
intervals of $\beta$ values. We discuss the nature of the halo previously reported in ALMA observations,
and hypothesize it could be caused by over-abundant $\mu$m-sized particles (the over-abundance
being the consequence of their extended lifetime). We model the polarized phase function at near-infrared
wavelengths and fluffy aggregates larger than a few $\mu$m provide the best solution. Comparing
our results with comets of the solar system, we postulate that the particles released in the disk
originate from rather pristine cometary bodies (to avoid compaction of the fluffy aggregates)
and are then set on highly eccentric orbits, which could explain the halo detected at long wavelengths.

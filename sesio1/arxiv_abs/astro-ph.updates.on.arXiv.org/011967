The Juno mission has revolutionized and challenged our understanding of Jupiter. As Juno transitioned
to its extended mission, we review the major findings of Jupiter's internal structure relevant
to understanding Jupiter's formation and evolution. Results from Juno's investigation of Jupiter's
interior structure imply that the planet has compositional gradients and is accordingly non-adiabatic,
with a complex internal structure. These new results imply that current models of Jupiter's formation
and evolution require a revision. In this paper, we discuss potential formation and evolution paths
that can lead to an internal structure model consistent with Juno data, and the constraints they
provide. We note that standard core accretion formation models, including the heavy-element enrichment
during planetary growth is consistent with an interior that is inhomogeneous with composition
gradients in its deep interior. However, such formation models typically predict that this region,
which could be interpreted as a primordial dilute core, is confined to about 10% of Jupiter's total
mass. In contrast, structure models that fit Juno data imply that this region contains 30% of the
mass or more. One way to explain the origin of this extended region is by invoking a relatively long
(about 2 Myrs) formation phase where the growing planet accretes gas and planetesimals delaying
the runaway gas accretion. Alternatively, Jupiter's fuzzy core could be a result of a giant impact
or convection post-formation. These novel scenarios require somewhat special and specific conditions.
Clarity on the plausibility of such conditions could come from future high-resolution observations
of planet-forming regions around other stars, from the observed and modeled architectures of extrasolar
systems with giant planets, and future Juno data obtained during its extended mission.

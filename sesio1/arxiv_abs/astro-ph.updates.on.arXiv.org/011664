(Abridged) We present a study of the disk population in L1688, the densest and youngest region in
Ophiuchus, and we compare it with other nearby regions of different age, namely Lupus, Chamaeleon
I, Corona Australis, Taurus and Upper Scorpius. We select our L1688 sample using a combination of
criteria (ALMA data, Gaia, optical/near-IR spectroscopy) and determine stellar and disk properties,
specifically stellar mass (Mstar), average population age, mass accretion rate (Macc) and disk
dust mass (Mdust). a) In L1688 the relations between Macc and Mstar, Mdust and Mstar, and Macc and
Mdust have a roughly linear trend with slopes 1.8-1.9 for the first two relations and ~1 for the third,
similarly to what found in the other regions. b) When ordered according to the characteristic age
of each region, Macc decreases as 1/t, when corrected for the different stellar mass content; Mdust
follows roughly the same trend between 0.5 and 5 Myr, but has an increase of a factor ~3 at ages of 2-3
Myr. We suggest that this could result from an earlier planet formation, followed by collisional
fragmentation that temporarily replenishes the millimeter-size grain population. c) The dispersion
of Macc and Mdust around the best-fitting relation with Mstar, as well as that of Macc versus Mdust
are large: we find that the dispersions have continuous distributions with a log-normal shape and
similar width (~0.8 dex). The amount of dust observed at ~1 Myr does not appear to be sufficient to
assemble the majority of planetary systems, which suggests an earlier planetary cores formation.
The dust mass traces to a large extent the disk gas mass evolution. Two properties remain puzzling:
the steep dependence of Macc and Mdust on Mstar and the cause of the large dispersion in the three relations
analyzed in this paper, in particular the one of the Macc versus Mdust relation.

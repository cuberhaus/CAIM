The orbital observatory Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG), equipped with the grazing-incidence
X-ray telescopes Mikhail Pavlinsky ART-XC and eROSITA, was launched by Roscosmos to the Lagrange
L2 point of the Sun-Earth system on July 13, 2019. The launch was carried out from the Baikonur Cosmodrome
by a Proton-M rocket with a DM-03 upper stage. The German telescope eROSITA was installed on SRG under
an agreement between Roskosmos and the DLR, the German Aerospace Agency. In December 2019, SRG started
to perform its main scientific task: scanning the celestial sphere to obtain X-ray maps of the entire
sky in several energy ranges (from 0.2 to 8 keV with eROSITA, and from 4 to 30 keV with ART-XC). By mid-June
2021, the third six-month all-sky survey had been completed. Over a period of four years, it is planned
to obtain eight independent maps of the entire sky in each of the energy ranges. The sum of these maps
will provide high sensitivity and reveal more than three million quasars and over one hundred thousand
massive galaxy clusters and galaxy groups. The availability of eight sky maps will enable monitoring
of long-term variability (every six months) of a huge number of extragalactic and Galactic X-ray
sources, including hundreds of thousands of stars with hot coronae. The rotation of the satellite
around the axis directed toward the Sun with a period of four hours enables tracking the faster variability
of bright X-ray sources during one day every half year. The chosen strategy of scanning the sky leads
to the formation of deep survey zones near both ecliptic poles. The paper presents sky maps obtained
by the telescopes on board SRG during the first survey of the entire sky and a number of results of deep
observations performed during the flight to the L2 point in the frame of the performance verification
program.(Abriged)

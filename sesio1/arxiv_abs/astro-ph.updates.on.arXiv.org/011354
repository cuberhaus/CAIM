We investigated whether the two recently discovered nuclei in NGC7727 both host a super-massive
black hole (SMBH). We used the high spatial resolution mode of the integral-field spectrograph
MUSE on the VLT in adaptive optics mode to resolve the stellar kinematics within the sphere of influence
of both putative black holes. We combined the kinematic data with an HST-based mass model and used
Jeans models to measure their SMBH mass. We report the discovery of a dual SMBH system in NGC7727.
We detect a SMBH in the photometric center of the galaxy in Nucleus 1, with a mass of $M_{\rm SMBH}=1.54^{+0.18}_{-0.15}
\times10^{8}M_{\odot}$. In the second nucleus, which is 500pc offset from the main nucleus, we
also find a clear signal for a SMBH with a mass of $M_{\rm BH}=6.33^{+3.32}_{-1.40}\times10^{6}M_{\odot}$.
Both SMBHs are detected at high significance. The off-axis nature of Nucleus 2 makes modeling the
system challenging; but a number of robustness tests suggest that a black hole is required to explain
the kinematics. The SMBH in the offset Nucleus 2 makes up 3.0% of its total mass, which means its SMBH
is over-massive compared to the $M_{\rm BH}-M_{\rm Bulge}$ scaling relation. This confirms it
as the surviving nuclear star cluster of a galaxy that has merged with NGC7727. This discovery is
the first dynamically confirmed dual SMBH system with a projected separation of less than a kiloparsec
and the nearest dynamically confirmed dual SMBH at a distance of 27.4Mpc. The second Nucleus is in
an advanced state of inspiral, and it will eventually result in a 1:24 mass ratio SMBH merger. Optical
emission lines suggest Nucleus 2 is a Seyfert galaxy, making it a low-luminosity Active Galactic
Nuclei (AGN). There are likely many more quiescent SMBHs as well as dual SMBH pairs in the local Universe
that have been missed by surveys that focus on bright accretion signatures.

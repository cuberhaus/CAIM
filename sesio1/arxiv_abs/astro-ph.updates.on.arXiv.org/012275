Cross-correlations of galaxy positions and galaxy shears with maps of gravitational lensing of
the cosmic microwave background (CMB) are sensitive to the distribution of large-scale structure
in the Universe. Such cross-correlations are also expected to be immune to some of the systematic
effects that complicate correlation measurements internal to galaxy surveys. We present measurements
and modeling of the cross-correlations between galaxy positions and galaxy lensing measured in
the first three years of data from the Dark Energy Survey with CMB lensing maps derived from a combination
of data from the 2500 deg$^2$ SPT-SZ survey conducted with the South Pole Telescope and full-sky
data from the Planck satellite. The CMB lensing maps used in this analysis have been constructed
in a way that minimizes biases from the thermal Sunyaev Zel'dovich effect, making them well suited
for cross-correlation studies. The total signal-to-noise of the cross-correlation measurements
is 23.9 (25.7) when using a choice of angular scales optimized for a linear (nonlinear) galaxy bias
model. We use the cross-correlation measurements to obtain constraints on cosmological parameters.
For our fiducial galaxy sample, which consist of four bins of magnitude-selected galaxies, we find
constraints of $\Omega_{m} = 0.272^{+0.032}_{-0.052}$ and $S_{8} \equiv \sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_{m}/0.3}=
0.736^{+0.032}_{-0.028}$ ($\Omega_{m} = 0.245^{+0.026}_{-0.044}$ and $S_{8} = 0.734^{+0.035}_{-0.028}$)
when assuming linear (nonlinear) galaxy bias in our modeling. Considering only the cross-correlation
of galaxy shear with CMB lensing, we find $\Omega_{m} = 0.270^{+0.043}_{-0.061}$ and $S_{8} = 0.740^{+0.034}_{-0.029}$.
Our constraints on $S_8$ are consistent with recent cosmic shear measurements, but lower than the
values preferred by primary CMB measurements from Planck.

We analyse the kinematics of 170 AGN host galaxies as compared to those of a matched control sample
of non-active galaxies from the MaNGA survey in order to characterise and estimate the extents of
the Narrow Line Region (NLR) and of the kinematically disturbed region (KDR) by the AGN. We define
the observed NLR radius as the farthest distance from the nucleus within which both [Oiii]/H\beta
and [Nii]/H\alpha ratios fall in the AGN region of the BPT diagram and the H\alpha equivalent width
is required to be larger than 3.0\AA. The extent of the KDR is defined as the distance from the nucleus
within which the AGN hosts galaxies shows a more disturbed gas kinematics than the control galaxies.
The kinematics derived from the [Oiii] line profiles reveal that, on average, the most luminous
AGN (L[Oiii] > 3.8 * 10^40 erg s^-1) possess higher residual difference between the gaseous and stellar
velocities and velocities dispersion than their control galaxies. Spatially resolved NLR's and
KDR's were found in 55 and 46 AGN host galaxies, with corrected radii 0.2 < r_KDR,c < 2.3 kpc and 0.4
< r_NLR,c < 10.1 kpc, with a relation between the two given by log r_KDR,c = (0.53\pm0.12) log r_NLR,c
+ (1.07\pm0.22), respectively. The extension of the KDR corresponds to about 30 per cent of that
of the NLR. Assuming that the KDR is due to an AGN outflow, we have estimated ionised gas mass outflow
rates that range between 10^-5 and \approx 1 Myr^-1, and kinetic powers that range from 10^34 to 10^40
erg s^-1. Comparing the power of the AGN ionised outflows with the AGN luminosities, they are always
below the 0.05 L_AGN model threshold for having an important feedback effect on their respective
host galaxies. The mass outflow rates (and power) of our AGN sample correlate with their luminosities,
populating the lowest AGN luminosity range of the correlations previously found for more powerful
sources.

We present the galaxy size-mass ($R_{e}-M_{\ast}$) distributions using a stellar-mass complete
sample of $\sim1.5$ million galaxies, covering $\sim100$ deg$^2$, with $\log(M_{\ast}/M_{\odot})>10.2~(9.2)$
over the redshift range $0.2<z<1.0$ $(z<0.6)$ from the second public data release of the Hyper Suprime-Cam
Subaru Strategic Program. We confirm that, at fixed redshift and stellar mass over the range of $\log(M_{\ast}/M_{\odot})<11$,
star-forming galaxies are on average larger than quiescent galaxies. The large sample of galaxies
with accurate size measurements, thanks to the excellent imaging quality, also enables us to demonstrate
that the $R_{e}-M_{\ast}$ relations of both populations have a form of broken power-law, with a
clear change of slopes at a pivot stellar mass $M_{p}$. For quiescent galaxies, below an (evolving)
pivot mass of $\log(M_{p}/M_{\odot})=10.2-10.6$ the relation follows $R_{e}\propto M_{\ast}^{0.1}$;
above $M_{p}$ the relation is steeper and follows $R_{e}\propto M_{\ast}^{0.6-0.7}$. For star-forming
galaxies, below $\log(M_{p}/M_{\odot})\sim10.7$ the relation follows $R_{e}\propto M_{\ast}^{0.2}$;
above $M_{p}$ the relation evolves with redshift and follows $R_{e}\propto M_{\ast}^{0.3-0.6}$.
The shallow power-law slope for quiescent galaxies below $M_{p}$ indicates that large low-mass
quiescent galaxies have sizes similar to those of their counterpart star-forming galaxies. We
take this as evidence that large low-mass quiescent galaxies have been recently quenched (presumably
through environment-specific process) without significant structural transformation. Interestingly,
the pivot stellar mass of the $R_{e}-M_{\ast}$ relations coincides with mass at which half of the
galaxy population is quiescent, implied that the pivot mass represents the transition of galaxy
growth from being dominated by in-situ star formation to being dominated by (dry) mergers.

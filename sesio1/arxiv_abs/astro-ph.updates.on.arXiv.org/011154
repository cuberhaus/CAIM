The pulsed radio emission of rotating neutron stars is connected to slow resistive instabilities
feeding off an inhomogeneous twist profile within the open circuit. This paper considers the stability
of a weakly sheared, quantizing magnetic field in which the current is supported by a relativistic
particle flow. The electromagnetic field is almost perfectly force-free, and the particles are
confined to the lowest Landau state, experiencing no appreciable curvature drift. In a charge-neutral
plasma, we find multiple branches of slowly growing tearing modes, relativistic analogs of the
double tearing mode, with peak growth rate $s \gtrsim 4\pi \widetilde k_y J_z/B_z$. Here, $B_z$
is the strong (nearly potential) guide magnetic field, $J_z$ the field-aligned current density,
and $\widetilde k_y$ is the mode wavenumber normalized by the current gradient scale. These modes
are overstable when the plasma carries net charge, with real frequency $\omega \sim s\cdot |n_0^+
- n_0^-|/(n_0^+ + n_0^-)$ proportional to the imbalance in the densities of positive and negative
charges. An isolated current sheet thinner than the skin depth supports localized tearing modes
with growth rate scaling as (sheet thickness/skin depth)$^{-1/2}$. In a pulsar, the peak growth
rate is comparable to the angular frequency of rotation, $s \gtrsim 2\widetilde k_y \Omega$, slow
compared with the longitudinal oscillations of particles and fields in a polar gap. The resistive
modes experience azimuthal drift reminiscent of sub-pulse drift and are a promising driver of pulse-to-pulse
flux variations. A companion paper demonstrates a Cerenkov-like instability of current-carrying
Alfv\'en waves in thin current sheets with relativistic particle flow, and proposes coherent curvature
emission by these waves as a source of pulsar radio emission.

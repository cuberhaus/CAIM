Exoplanetary observations reveal that the occurrence rate of hot Jupiters is correlated with star
clustering. In star clusters, interactions between planetary systems and close fly-by stars can
significantly change the architecture of primordially coplanar, circular planetary systems.
Flybys in dense clusters have a significant impact on hot Jupiter formation via activation of high
eccentricity excitation mechanisms such as the Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) effect and planet-planet
scattering. Previous studies have shown that if there are two giant planets in the planetary system,
close flybys can efficiently activate the ZLK mechanism, thus triggering high eccentricity tidal
migration and ultimately form hot Jupiters in star clusters. Here we extend our previous study with
a multi-planet (triple) system. We perform high precision, high-accuracy few-body simulations
of stellar flybys and subsequent planetary migration within the perturbed planetary systems using
the code {\tt SpaceHub}. Our simulations demonstrate that a single close flyby on a multi-planet
system in a cluster can activate secular chaos and ultimately lead to hot Jupiter formation via high
eccentricity migration. We find that the hot Jupiter formation rate per system increases with both
the size of the planetary system as well as with the mass of the outer planet, and we quantify the relative
formation fractions for a range of parameters. Hot Jupiters formed via secular chaos are expected
to be accompanied by massive companions with very long periods. Our study further shows that this
flyby-induced secular chaos is preferred in low-density clusters where multi-planet systems
are more likely to survive, and that it contributes a significant fraction of the hot Jupiter formation
in star clusters compared to the flyby-induced ZLK mechanism.

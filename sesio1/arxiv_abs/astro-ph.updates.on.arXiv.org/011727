Context. Observations reveal that shocks can be driven by fast coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and
play essential roles in particle accelerations. A critical ratio, $\delta$, derived from a shock
standoff distance normalized by the radius of curvature (ROC) of a CME, allows us to estimate shock
and ambient coronal parameters. However, true ROCs of CMEs are difficult to measure due to observed
projection effects. Aims. We investigate the formation mechanism of a shock driven by an aspherical
CME without evident lateral expansion. Through three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions without
a priori assumptions of the object morphology, we estimate two principal ROCs of the CME surface
and demonstrate how the difference between two principal ROCs of the CME affects the estimate of
the coronal physical parameters. Methods. The CME was observed by the Sun Earth Connection Coronal
and Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI) instruments and the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph
(LASCO). We used the mask-fitting method to obtain the irregular 3D shape of the CME and reconstructed
the shock surface using the bow-shock model. Through smoothings with fifth-order polynomial functions
and Monte Carlo simulations, we calculated the ROCs at the CME nose. Results. We find that (1) the
maximal ROC is 2-4 times the minimal ROC of the CME. A significant difference between the CME ROCs
implies that the assumption of one ROC of an aspherical CME could cause over-/under- estimations
of the shock and coronal parameters. (2) The shock nose obeys the bow-shock formation mechanism,
considering the constant standoff distance and the similar speed between the shock and CME around
the nose. (3) With a more precise $\delta$ calculated via 3D ROCs in space, we derive corona parameters
at high latitudes of about -50$^{\circ}$, including the Alfv{\'e}n speed and the coronal magnetic
field strength.

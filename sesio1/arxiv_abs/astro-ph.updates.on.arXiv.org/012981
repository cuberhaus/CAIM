Using 3D gyrofluid simulations, we revisit the problem of Alfven-wave (AW) collisions as building
blocks of the Alfvenic cascade and their interplay with magnetic reconnection at magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) scales. Depending on the large-scale nonlinearity parameter $\chi_0$ (the ratio between
AW linear propagation time and nonlinear turnover time), different regimes are observed. For strong
nonlinearities ($\chi_0\sim1$), turbulence is consistent with a dynamically aligned, critically
balanced cascade -- fluctuations exhibit a scale-dependent alignment $\sin\theta_k\propto
k_\perp^{-1/4}$, a $k_\perp^{-3/2}$ spectrum and $k_\|\propto k_\perp^{1/2}$ spectral anisotropy.
At weaker nonlinearities (small $\chi_0$), a spectral break marking the transition between a large-scale
weak regime and a small-scale $k_\perp^{-11/5}$ tearing-mediated range emerges, implying that
dynamic alignment occurs also for weak nonlinearities. At $\chi_0<1$ the alignment angle $\theta_{k_\perp}$
shows a stronger scale dependence than in the $\chi_0\sim1$ regime, i.e. $\sin\theta_k\propto
k_\perp^{-1/2}$ at $\chi_0\sim0.5$, and $\sin\theta_k\propto k_\perp^{-1}$ at $\chi_0\sim0.1$.
Dynamic alignment in the weak regime also modifies the large-scale spectrum, scaling roughly as
$k_\perp^{-3/2}$ for $\chi_0\sim0.5$ and as $k_\perp^{-1}$ for $\chi_0\sim0.1$. A phenomenological
theory of dynamically aligned turbulence at weak nonlinearities that can explain these spectra
and the transition to the tearing-mediated regime is provided; at small $\chi_0$, the strong scale
dependence of the alignment angle combines with the increased lifetime of turbulent eddies to allow
tearing to onset and mediate the cascade at scales that can be larger than those predicted for a critically
balanced cascade by several orders of magnitude. Such a transition to tearing-mediated turbulence
may even supplant the usual weak-to-strong transition

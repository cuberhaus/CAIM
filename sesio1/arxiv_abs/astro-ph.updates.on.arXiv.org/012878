We study self-consistent approximations such as the $\Phi$-derivable and virial approaches to
dilute strongly interacting systems in equilibrium. We consider a system of non-relativistic
fermions of one kind interacting via a pair potential Thermodynamical quantities are expressed
in terms of various spectral functions. We review the $\Phi$ derivable approximation scheme demonstrating
the exact conservation of the Noether and the Botermans-Malfliet fermion number densities, and
then for $\Phi$ described by the tadpole and sandwich diagrams we show the coincidence of these two
number densities. As examples of test pair potentials, we consider the Yukawa central nucleon-nucleon
potentials within Walecka, CD Bonn, and Reid parameterizations, and the corresponding classical
Lennard-Jones potentials. Expressions for the second and third virial coefficients are derived
and analyzed for $\Phi$ described by the tadpole and sandwich diagrams. Next, we focus on the virial
approach to the equation of state. Classical, semiclassical, and purely quantum approaches are
studied in detail. Then, different extrapolations of the virial equation of state are considered
including the van~der~Waals form and excluded-volume models. We derive the expression for the
second virial coefficient using the effective range approximation for the scattering amplitude
and compare the result with the purely quantum result using the experimental phase shifts. Attention
is focused on the problem of anomalously large value of the nucleon-nucleon scattering length appearing
due to the presence of the quasi-bound state in nucleon-nucleon scattering, which can be destroyed
in the matter because of the action of the Pauli blocking. We present results for the second virial
coefficient subtracting this term. We discuss the validity of such a procedure to describe the equation
of state of the nuclear matter in the virial limit.

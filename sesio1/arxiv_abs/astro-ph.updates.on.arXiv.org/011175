HCN is considered a good tracer of the dense molecular gas that serves as fuel for star formation.
However, recent large-scale surveys of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) have detected extended HCN
line emission. Such observations often resolve the HCN J=1-0 hyperfine structure (HFS). A precise
determination of the physical conditions of the gas requires treating the HFS line overlap effects.
Here, we study the HCN HFS excitation and line emission using nonlocal radiative transfer models
that include line overlaps and new HFS-resolved collisional rate coefficients for inelastic collisions
of HCN with both para-H2 and ortho-H2 (computed via the scaled-IOS approximation up to Tk=500 K).
In addition, we account for the role of electron collisions in the HFS level excitation. We find that
line overlap and opacity effects frequently produce anomalous HCN J=1-0 HFS line intensity ratios
(inconsistent with the common assumption of the same Tex for all HFS lines) as well as anomalous HFS
line width ratios. Line overlap and electron collisions also enhance the excitation of the higher
J rotational lines. Electron excitation becomes important for molecular gas with H2 densities
below a few 10^5 cm-3 and electron abundances above ~10^-5. In particular, electron excitation
can produce low-surface-brightness HCN emission from very extended but low-density gas in GMCs.
The existence of such a widespread HCN emission component may affect the interpretation of the extragalactic
relationship HCN luminosity versus star-formation rate. Alternatively, extended HCN emission
may arise from dense star-forming cores and become resonantly scattered by large envelopes of lower
density gas. There are two scenarios - namely, electron-assisted (weakly) collisionally excited
versus scattering - that lead to different HCN J=1-0 HFS intensity ratios, which can be tested on
the basis of observations.

WASP-148 is a recently announced extra-solar system harbouring at least two giant planets. The
inner planet transits its host star. The planets travel on eccentric orbits and are near the 4:1 mean-motion
resonance, which implies significant mutual gravitational interactions. In particular, this
causes transit-timing variations of a few minutes, which were detected based on ground-based photometry.
This made WASP-148 one of the few cases where such a phenomenon was detected without space-based
photometry. Here, we present a self-consistent model of WASP-148 that takes into account the gravitational
interactions between all known bodies in the system. Our analysis simultaneously fits the available
radial velocities and transit light curves. In particular, we used the photometry secured by the
TESS space telescope and made public after the WASP-148 discovery announcement. The TESS data confirm
the transit-timing variations, but only in combination with previously measured transit times.
The system parameters we derived agree with those previously reported and have a significantly
improved precision, including the mass of the non-transiting planet. We found a significant mutual
inclination between the orbital planes of the two planets: I=41.0 +6.2 -7.6 deg based on the modelling
of the observations, although we found I=20.8 +/- 4.6 deg when we imposed a constraint on the model
enforcing long-term dynamical stability. When a third planet was added to the model - based on a candidate
signal in the radial velocity - the mutual inclination between planets b and c changed significantly
allowing solutions closer to coplanar. We conclude that more data are needed to establish the true
architecture of the system. If the significant mutual inclination is confirmed, WASP-148 would
become one of the only few candidate non-coplanar planetary systems. We discuss possible origins
for this misalignment.

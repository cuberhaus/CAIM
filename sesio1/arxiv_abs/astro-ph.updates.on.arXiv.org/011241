Interstellar dust affects astronomical observations through absorption and reddening, yet this
extinction is also a powerful tool for studying interstellar matter in galaxies. 3D reconstructions
of dust extinction and density in the Milky Way have suffered from artefacts such as the fingers-of-god
effect and negative densities, and have been limited by large computational costs. Here we aim to
overcome these issues with a novel algorithm that derives the 3D extinction density of dust in the
Milky Way using a latent variable Gaussian Process and variational inference. Our model maintains
non-negative density and hence monotonically non-decreasing extinction along all lines-of-sight,
and performs inference within a reasonable computational time. Using extinctions for hundreds
of thousands of stars computed from optical and near-IR photometry, together with distances based
on Gaia parallaxes, we use our algorithm to infer the structure of the Orion, Taurus, Perseus, and
Cygnus X star-forming regions. A number of features superimposed in 2D extinction maps are clearly
deblended in 3D dust extinction density maps. We find a large filament on the edge of Orion, identify
filament that in the Taurus and Perseus regions, and show that Cygnus X is located at 1300-1500pc.
We compute dust masses of the regions and find these to be slightly higher than previous estimates,
likely a consequence of our input data recovering the highest column densities more effectively.
Comparing our predicted extinctions to Planck data, we find that known relationships between density
and dust processing, where high extinction lines of sight have the most processed grains, hold up
in resolved observations when density is included, and that they exist at smaller scales than previously
suggested. This can be used to study the changes in size or composition of dust as they are processed
in molecular clouds. (Abridged)

The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration recently released horizon-scale images of the
supermassive black hole M87*. These images are consistently described by an optically thin, lensed
accretion flow in the Kerr spacetime. General relativity (GR) predicts that higher-resolution
images of such a flow would present thin, ring-shaped features produced by photons on extremely
bent orbits. Recent theoretical work suggests that these "photon rings" produce clear interferometric
signatures whose observation could provide a stringent consistency test of the Kerr hypothesis,
with scant dependence on the astrophysical configuration. Gralla, Lupsasca and Marrone (GLM)
argued that the shape of high-order photon rings follows a specific functional form that is insensitive
to the details of the astrophysical source, and proposed an experimental method for measuring this
GR-predicted shape via space-based interferometry. We wish to assess the robustness of their prediction
by checking that it holds for a variety of astrophysical profiles, black hole spins and observer
inclinations. We repeat their analysis for hundreds of models and identify the width of the photon
ring and its angular variation as a main obstacle to their method's success. We qualitatively describe
how this width varies with the emission profile, black hole spin and observer inclination. At low
inclinations, an improved method is robust enough to confirm the shape prediction for a variety
of emission profiles; however, the choice of baseline is critical to the method's success. At high
inclinations, we encounter qualitatively new effects that are caused by the ring's non-uniform
width and require further refinements to the method. We also explore how the photon ring shape could
constrain black hole spin and inclination.

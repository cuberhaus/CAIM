We present a Spitzer/IRAC survey of H-faint ($H_{160} \gtrsim 26.4$, $<5\sigma$) sources in 101
lensing cluster fields. Across a CANDELS/Wide-like survey area of $\sim$648 arcmin$^2$ (effectively
$\sim$221 arcmin$^2$ in the source plane), we have securely discovered 53 sources in the IRAC Channel-2
band (CH2, 4.5 $\mathrm{\mu m}$; median CH2$=22.46\pm0.11$ AB mag) that lack robust HST/WFC3-IR
F160W counterparts. The most remarkable source in our sample, namely ES-009 in the field of Abell
2813, is the brightest H-faint galaxy at 4.5 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ known so far ($\mathrm{CH2}=20.48\pm0.03$
AB mag). We show that the H-faint sources in our sample are massive (median $M_\mathrm{star} = 10^{10.3\pm
0.3}$ $M_\odot$), star-forming (median star formation rate $=100_{-40}^{+60}$ $M_\odot$yr$^{-1}$)
and dust-obscured ($A_V=2.6\pm0.3$) galaxies around a median photometric redshift of $z=3.9\pm0.4$.
The stellar continua of 14 H-faint galaxies can be resolved in the CH2 band, suggesting a median circularized
effective radius ($R_\mathrm{e,circ}$; lensing corrected) of $1.9\pm0.2$ kpc and $<1.5$ kpc
for the resolved and whole samples, respectively. This is consistent with the sizes of massive unobscured
galaxies at $z\sim4$, indicating that H-faint galaxies represent the dusty tail of the distribution
of a wider galaxy population. Comparing with the ALMA dust continuum sizes of similar galaxies reported
previously, we conclude that the heavy dust obscuration in H-faint galaxies is related to the compactness
of both stellar and dust continua ($R_\mathrm{e,circ}\sim 1$ kpc). These H-faint galaxies make
up $16_{-7}^{+13}$% of the galaxies in the stellar mass range of $10^{10}-10^{11.2}$ $M_\odot$
at $z=3\sim5$, contributing to $8_{-4}^{+8}$% of the cosmic star formation rate density in this
epoch and likely tracing the early phase of massive galaxy formation.

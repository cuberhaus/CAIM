The Onsala twin telescopes (OTT) are two 13 m telescopes located at the Onsala Space Observatory
in Sweden. With dual linear polarized broad-band (3-14 GHz) receivers, they are part of the next
generation Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) Global Observing System (VGOS) for geodesy
and astrometry. The VGOS network is currently being rolled out globally, and regularly observes
hundreds of quasars. In contrast to legacy S/X-band geodetic VLBI, VGOS will eventually - in addition
to purely geodetic data products - also produce full-polarisation images and flux densities of
all observed radio quasars on a regular basis. This will be a rich archive of broad-band quasar monitoring
information, of value both for geodesy and astronomy. We scheduled, correlated and analysed 91
short (<30 min) observing sessions with the OTT spanning 7 months, with 33 sessions placed within
a 3 day period to search for short-term variability. We monitored seven quasars (0059+581, 0552+398,
1144+402, 1156+295, 1617+229, 3C418, OJ287) and three absolute flux-density reference calibrators
(3C147, 3C286, 3C295). We used the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) package to fringe-fit,
bandpass-correct and scale (using auto-correlations, antenna gains and measured system temperatures)
the data to obtain simultaneous flux densities in the four standard VGOS bands: A = 3.0-3.5 GHz, B=
5.2-5.7 GHz, C=6.3-6.8 GHz, and D=10.2-10.7 GHz. After correcting for instrumental biases, we
find the OTT capable of monitoring flux densities with 5 % uncertainty in all four VGOS bands for Jansky-level
sources. Three quasars show significant variability during our observing campaign: 0059+581,
OJ287 and 1156+295. We also find a tentative elevation-dependence of about 5 %, suggesting that
more detailed characterisation of the antenna gain curves could further improve the accuracy of
the monitoring.

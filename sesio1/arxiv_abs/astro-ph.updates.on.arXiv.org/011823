Any viable cosmological framework has to match the observed proportion of early- and late-type
galaxies. In this contribution, we focus on the distribution of galaxy morphological types in the
standard model of cosmology (Lambda cold dark matter, $\Lambda$CDM). Using the latest state-of-the-art
cosmological $\Lambda$CDM simulations known as Illustris, IllustrisTNG, and EAGLE, we calculate
the intrinsic and sky-projected aspect ratio distribution of the stars in subhalos with stellar
mass $M_* > 10^{10}\,M_\odot$ at redshift $z=0$. There is a significant deficit of intrinsically
thin disk galaxies, which however comprise most of the locally observed galaxy population. Consequently,
the sky-projected aspect ratio distribution produced by these $\Lambda$CDM simulations disagrees
with the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey and Sloan Digital Sky Survey at $\geq 12.52\sigma$
(TNG50-1) and $\geq 14.82\sigma$ (EAGLE50) confidence. The deficit of intrinsically thin galaxies
could be due to a much less hierarchical merger-driven build-up of observed galaxies than is given
by the $\Lambda$CDM framework. It might also arise from the implemented sub-grid models, or from
the limited resolution of the above-mentioned hydrodynamical simulations. We estimate that an
$8^5$ times better mass resolution realization than TNG50-1 would reduce the tension with GAMA
to the $5.58\sigma$ level. Finally, we show that galaxies with fewer major mergers have a somewhat
thinner aspect ratio distribution. Given also the high expected frequency of minor mergers in $\Lambda$CDM,
the problem may be due to minor mergers. In this case, the angular momentum problem could be alleviated
in Milgromian dynamics (MOND) because of a reduced merger frequency arising from the absence of
dynamical friction between extended dark matter halos.

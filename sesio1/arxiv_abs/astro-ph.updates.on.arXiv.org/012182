The interstellar medium contains filamentary structure over a wide range of scales. Understanding
the role of this structure, both as a conduit of gas across the scales and a diagnostic tool of local
physics, is a major focus of star formation studies. We review recent progress in studying filamentary
structure in the ISM, interpreting its properties in terms of physical processes, and exploring
formation and evolution scenarios. We include structures from galactic-scale filaments to tenth-of-a-parsec
scale filaments, comprising both molecular and atomic structures, from both observational and
theoretical perspectives. In addition to the literature overview, we assemble a large amount of
catalogue data from different surveys and provide the most comprehensive census of filamentary
structures to date. Our census consists of 22 803 filamentary structures, facilitating a holistic
perspective and new insights. We use our census to conduct a meta-analysis, leading to a description
of filament properties over four orders of magnitudes in length and eight in mass. Our analysis emphasises
the hierarchical and dynamical nature of filamentary structures. Filaments do not live in isolation,
nor they generally resemble static structures close to equilibrium. We propose that accretion
during filament formation and evolution sets some of the key scaling properties of filaments. This
highlights the role of accretion during filament formation and evolution and also in setting the
initial conditions for star formation. Overall, the study of filamentary structures during the
past decade has been observationally driven. While great progress has been made on measuring the
basic properties of filaments, our understanding of their formation and evolution is clearly lacking.
In this context, we identify a number of directions and questions we consider most pressing for the
field.

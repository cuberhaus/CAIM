Existence of pulsating stars in eclipsing binaries has been known for decades. These types of objects
are extremely valuable systems for astronomical studies as they exhibit both eclipsing and pulsation
variations. The eclipsing binaries are the only way to directly measure the mass and radius of stars
with a good accuracy ($\leq$1\%), while the pulsations are a unique way to probe the stellar interior
via oscillation frequencies. There are different types of pulsating stars existing in eclipsing
binaries. One of them is the Delta Scuti variables. Currently, the known number of Delta Scuti stars
in eclipsing binaries is around 90 according to the latest catalog of these variables. An increasing
number of these kinds of variables is important to understand the stellar structure, evolution
and the effect of binarity on the pulsations. Therefore, in this study, we focus on discovering new
eclipsing binaries with Delta Scuti component(s). We searched for the northern TESS field with
a visual inspection by following some criteria such as light curve shape, the existence of pulsation
like variations in the out-of-eclipse light curve and the Teff values of the targets. As a result
of these criteria, we determined some targets. The TESS light curves of the selected targets first
were removed from the binarity and frequency analysis was performed on the residuals. The luminosity,
absolute and bolometric magnitudes of the targets were calculated as well. To find how much of these
parameters represent the primary binary component (more luminous) we also computed the flux density
ratio of the systems by utilizing the area of the eclipses. In addition, the positions of the systems
in the H-R diagram were examined considering the flux density ratios. As a consequence of the investigation,
we defined 38 candidates Delta Scuti and also one Maia variable in eclipsing binary systems.

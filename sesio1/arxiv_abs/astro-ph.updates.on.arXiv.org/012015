Closure phase is the phase of a closed-loop product of correlations in a $\ge 3$-element interferometer
array. Its invariance to element-based phase corruption makes it invaluable for interferometric
applications that otherwise require high-accuracy phase calibration. However, its understanding
has remained mainly mathematical and limited to the aperture plane (Fourier dual of image plane).
Here, we lay the foundations for a geometrical insight. we show that closure phase and its invariance
to element-based corruption and to translation are intricately related to the conserved properties
(shape, orientation, and size, or SOS) of the principal triangle enclosed by the three fringes formed
by a closed triad of array elements, which is referred herein as the "SOS conservation principle".
When element-based amplitude calibration is not needed, as is typical in optical interferometry,
the 3-element interference image formed from phase-uncalibrated correlations is a true and uncorrupted
representation of the source object's morphology, except for a possible shift. Based on this SOS
conservation principle, we present two geometric methods to measure the closure phase directly
from a 3-element interference image (without requiring an aperture-plane view): (i) the closure
phase is directly measurable from any one of the triangle's heights, and (ii) the squared closure
phase is proportional to the product of the areas enclosed by the triad of array elements and the principal
triangle in the aperture and image planes, respectively. We validate this geometric understanding
across a wide range range of interferometric conditions using data from the Very Large Array and
the Event Horizon Telescope. This geometric insight can be potentially valuable to other interferometric
applications such as optical interferometry. These geometric relationships are generalised
for an $N$-element interferometer.

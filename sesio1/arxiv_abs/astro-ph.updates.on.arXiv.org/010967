We present wideband polarimetric observations, obtained with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array
(VLA), of the merging galaxy cluster MACS J0717.5+3745, which hosts one of the most complex known
radio relic and halo systems. We use both Rotation Measure Synthesis and QU-fitting, and find a reasonable
agreement of the results obtained with these methods, in particular, when the Faraday distribution
is simple and the depolarization is mild. The relic is highly polarized over its entire length reaching
a fractional polarization ${>}30\%$ in some regions. We also observe a strong wavelength-dependent
depolarization for some regions of the relic. The northern part of the relic shows a complex Faraday
distribution suggesting that this region is located in or behind the intracluster medium (ICM).
Conversely, the southern part of the relic shows a Rotation Measure very close to the Galactic foreground,
with a rather low Faraday dispersion, indicating very little magnetoionic material intervening
the line-of-sight. From spatially resolved polarization analysis, we find that the scatter of
Faraday depths correlates with the depolarization, indicating that the tangled magnetic field
in the ICM causes the depolarization. At the position of a well known narrow-angle-tailed galaxy
(NAT), we find evidence of two components clearly separated in Faraday space. The high Faraday dispersion
component seems to be associated with the NAT, suggesting the NAT is embedded in the ICM while the
southern part of the relic lies in front of it. The magnetic field orientation follows the relic structure
indicating a well-ordered magnetic field. We also detect polarized emission in the halo region;
however the absence of significant Faraday rotation and a low value of Faraday dispersion suggests
the polarized emission, previously considered as the part of the halo, has a shock(s) origin.

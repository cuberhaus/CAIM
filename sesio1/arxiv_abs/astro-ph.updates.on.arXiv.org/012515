Context: The Ophiuchus cluster of galaxies, located at low latitudes in the direction of the Galactic
bulge, has been relatively poorly studied in comparison with other rich galaxy clusters like Coma,
Virgo and Fornax, in spite of being the 2nd brightest X-ray cluster in the sky. Methods: Deep near-infrared
images and photometry from the VISTA Variables in the V\'ia L\'actea eXtended survey (VVVX) were
used to detect galaxy member candidates of Ophiuchus cluster up to 2 Mpc from the cD galaxy 2MASX J17122774-2322108
using the Galdeano et al. criteria to select the galaxies among the foreground sources. We also perform
a morphological visual classification, color-magnitude diagram and density profiles. Results:
We identified 537 candidate galaxy members of the Ophiuchus cluster up to 2 Mpc from the cD galaxy,
increasing 7 times the number of galaxies reported in previous catalogs. In addition, we performed
a morphological classification of these galaxy candidates finding that the fraction of Ellipticals
reaches more than the 60% in the central region of the cluster. On the other hand the Spirals fraction
is lower than the 20% remaining almost constant throughout the cluster. Moreover, we study the red
sequence of galaxy member candidates and use mock catalogs to explore the density profile of the
cluster, finding that the value derived from the mock catalog towards an overdense region is in agreement
with the galaxy excess of the central zone of the Ophiuchus cluster. Conclusions: Our investigation
of the hidden population of Ophiuchus galaxies underscores the importance of this cluster as a prime
target for future photometric and spectroscopic studies. Moreover the results of this work highlights
the potential of VVVX survey to study extragalactic objects in the Zone of Avoidance.

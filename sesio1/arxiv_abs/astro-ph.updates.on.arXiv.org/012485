Context. The [Mg/Fe] abundance ratios are a fundamental fossil signature to trace the chemical
evolution of the disc. Despite of the huge observational and theoretical effort, discrepancies
between models and data are still present and several explanations have been put forward to explain
the [$\alpha$/Fe] bimodality. Aims. In this work, we take advantage of a new AMBRE:HARPS dataset,
which provides new and more precise [Mg/Fe] estimations, as well as reliable stellar ages for a subsample
of stars, to study the evolution of the solar neighbourhood. Methods. The above data are compared
with detailed chemical evolution models for the Milky Way, exploring the most used prescriptions
for stellar yields and different formation scenarios for the Galactic disc, i.e. the delayed two-infall
and the parallel model, also including prescriptions for stellar radial migration. Results. We
see that most of the stellar yields struggle to reproduce the observed trend of the data and that semi-empirical
yields are still the best to describe the [Mg/Fe] evolution in the thick and thin discs. In particular,
most of the yields still predict a steeper decrease of the [Mg/Fe] ratio at high metallicity than
what is shown by the data. The bulk of the data are well reproduced by the parallel and two-infall scenarios,
but both scenarios have problems in explaining the most metal-rich and metal-poor tails of the low-$\alpha$
data. These tails can be explained in light of radial migration from inner and outer disc regions,
respectively. Conclusions. Despite of the evidence of stellar migration, it is difficult to estimate
the actual contribution of stars from other parts of the disc to the solar vicinity. However, the
comparison between data and models suggests that peculiar histories of star formation, such as
that of the two-infall model, are still needed to reproduce the observed distribution of stars.

Stars can be tidally destroyed or swallowed by supermassive black hole binaries. Using a large number
of accurate few-body simulations, we investigate the enhancement and suppression of full and partial
disruption and direct capture events by hard supermassive black hole binaries with a wide ranges
of key parameters, i.e., the primary black hole mass ($10^{5}-10^{8}M_{\odot}$), the binary mass
ratio ($10^{-3}-1$), the ratio of the binary semimajor axis to the hardening radius ($10^{-4}-1$),
the binary eccentricity ($0.0-0.9$) and the stellar mass ($0.3-3M_{\odot}$). This is a significant
extension of the parameter space compared to previous work. We show that the encounter probabilities
of all three events are well-described by the encounter cross section, which is proportional to
the pericenter distance. The probability of full disruptions by supermassive black hole binaries
can be enhanced by up to a factor of $40-50$ or suppressed by up to a factor of $10$, relative to that
by single black holes, depending on the binary parameters. The Post-Newtonian effects are not important
for the primary black hole mass $\leq 10^{7}M_{\odot}$, but can provide an additional enhancement
of the full disruption probability by less than a factor of $2-3$ for higher primary black hole masses.
We provide a fitting formula for the full disruption probability by the hard supermassive black
hole binaries that works for a wide range of parameters. We also find that partial disruption events
can occur multiple times before full disruptions or direct captures, and their probabilities can
be greater than that of full disruption events by a factor of three. Because partial disruption events
can induce stellar spins and mass loss and change the orbits, it can significantly affect the overall
full disruption event rate and the shape of the light curves.

The aim of this study is to better understand the connection between the Lyman $\alpha$ rest-frame
equivalent width (EW$_0$) and spectral properties as well as ultraviolet (UV) continuum morphology
by obtaining reliable EW$_0$ histograms for a statistical sample of galaxies and by assessing the
fraction of objects with large equivalent widths. We used integral field spectroscopy from MUSE
combined with broad-band data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to measure EW$_0$. We analysed
the emission lines of $1920$ Lyman $\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) detected in the full MUSE-Wide (one
hour exposure time) and MUSE-Deep (ten hour exposure time) surveys and found UV continuum counterparts
in archival HST data. We fitted the UV continuum photometric images using the Galfit software to
gain morphological information on the rest-UV emission and fitted the spectra obtained from MUSE
to determine the double peak fraction, asymmetry, full-width at half maximum, and flux of the Lyman
$\alpha$ line. The two surveys show different histograms of Lyman $\alpha$ EW$_0$. In MUSE-Wide,
$20\%$ of objects have EW$_0 > 240$ \r{A}, while this fraction is only $11\%$ in MUSE-Deep and $\approx
16\%$ for the full sample. This includes objects without HST continuum counterparts (one-third
of our sample), for which we give lower limits for EW$_0$. The object with the highest securely measured
EW$_0$ has EW$_0=589 \pm 193$ \r{A} (the highest lower limit being EW$_0=4464$ \r{A}). We investigate
the connection between EW$_0$ and Lyman $\alpha$ spectral or UV continuum morphological properties.
The survey depth has to be taken into account when studying EW$_0$ distributions. We find that in
general, high EW$_0$ objects can have a wide range of spectral and UV morphological properties,
which might reflect that the underlying causes for high EW$_0$ values are equally varied. (abridged)

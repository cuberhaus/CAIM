HD 93206 is early-type massive stellar system, composed of components resolved by direct imaging
(Ab, Ad, B, C, D) as well as a compact sub-system (Aa1, Aa2, Ac1, Ac2). Its geometry was already determined
on the basis of extensive photometric, spectroscopic and interferometric observations. However,
the fundamental absolute parameters are still not known precisely enough. We use an advanced N-body
model to account for all mutual gravitational perturbations among the four close components, and
all observational data types, including: astrometry, radial velocities, eclipse timing variations,
squared visibilities, closure phases, triple products, normalized spectra, and spectral-energy
distribution (SED). The respective model has 38 free parameters, namely three sets of orbital elements,
component masses, and their basic radiative properties ($T$, $\log g$, $v_{\rm rot}$). We revised
the fundamental parameters of QZ Car as follows. For a model with the nominal extinction coefficient
$R_V \equiv A_V/E(B-V) = 3.1$, the best-fit masses are $m_1 = 26.1\,M_{\rm S}$, $m_2 = 32.3\,M_{\rm
S}$, $m_3 = 70.3\,M_{\rm S}$, $m_4 = 8.8\,M_{\rm S}$, with uncertainties of the order of $2\,M_{\rm
S}$, and the system distance $d = (2800\pm 100)\,{\rm pc}$. In an alternative model, where we increased
the weights of RV and TTV observations and relaxed the SED constraints, because extinction can be
anomalous with $R_V \sim 3.4$, the distance is smaller, $d = (2450\pm 100)\,{\rm pc}$. This would
correspond to that of Collinder 228 cluster. Independently, this is confirmed by dereddening of
the SED, which is only then consistent with the early-type classification (O9.7Ib for Aa1, O8III
for Ac1). Future modelling should also account for an accretion disk around Ac2 component.

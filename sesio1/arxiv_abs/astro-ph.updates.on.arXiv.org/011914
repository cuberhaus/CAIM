The physical mechanisms for starburst or quenching in less massive ($M_* < 10^{10} M_{\odot}$)
galaxies are unclear. The merger is one of the inescapable processes referred to as both starburst
and quenching in massive galaxies. However, the effects of the merger on star formation in dwarf
galaxies and their evolution results are still uncertain. We aim to explore how to trigger and quench
star formation in dwarf galaxies by studying the metal-poor gas-rich dwarf mergers based on the
multi-band observations at a spatial resolution of $\sim$ 460 pc. We use the archival data of ALMA
(band 3, 8) and VLT/MUSE to map CO($J=$1-0), [CI]($^3$P$_1 - ^3$P$_0$), and H$\alpha$ emission
in one of the most extreme starburst merging dwarf galaxies, Haro 11. We find the molecular gas is
assembled around the central two star-forming regions. The molecular/ionized gas and stellar
components show complex kinematics, indicating that the gas is probably at a combined stage of collision
of clouds and feedback from star formation. The peak location and distribution of [CI](1-0) strongly
resemble the CO(1-0) emission, meaning that it might trace the same molecular gas as CO in such a dwarf
merger starburst galaxy. The enhancement of line ratios ($\sim 0.5$) of [CI]/CO around knot C is
probably generated by the dissociation of CO molecules by cosmic rays and far-ultraviolet photons.
Globally, Haro 11 and its star-forming regions share similar SFEs as the high-$z$ starburst galaxies
or the clumps in nearby (U)LIRGs. Given the high SFE, sSFR, small stellar mass, low metallicity,
and deficient HI gas, Haro 11 could be an analog of high-$z$ dwarf starburst and the potential progenitor
of the nearby less massive elliptical galaxies. The significantly smaller turbulent pressure
and viral parameter will probably trigger the intense starbursts. We also predict that it will quench
at $M_* < 8.5 \times 10^9 M_{\odot}$.

We present the temporal and spectral study of blazar PKS 0208-512, using recent flaring activity
from November 2019 to May 2020, as detected by the Fermi-LAT observatory. The contemporaneous X-ray,
optical/UV observations from Swift-XRT/UVOT are also used. During the activity state, 2-days
binned ${\gamma}$-ray lightcurve shows multiple peaks indicating sub-flares. To understand
the possible physical mechanisms behind flux enhancement, we divided the activity state of the
source into several flux-states and carried out detailed temporal and spectral studies. Timing
analysis of lightcurves suggest that peaks of sub-flares have rise and decay time on the order of
days, with flux-doubling time $\sim$ 2-days. The 2-days binned ${\gamma}$-ray lightcurve shows
double-lognormal flux distribution. The broadband spectral-energy-distribution (SED) for
three selected flux states can be well fitted under synchrotron, synchrotron self-Compton (SSC)
and external-Compton (EC) emission mechanisms. We obtained the physical parameters of the jet
by the SED modeling and their confidence intervals through ${\chi}^2$-statistics. Our SED modeling
results suggest that during quiescent-state, ${\gamma}$-ray spectrum can be well explained by
considering the EC-scattering of infra-red (IR) photons from dusty-torus. However, ${\gamma}$-ray
spectra corresponding to flares demand additional target photons from broad-line-region (BLR)
along with IR. These suggest that during flares, the emission-region is close to the edge of BLR,
while for quiescent-state the emission-region is away from BLR. The best fit results suggest that
marginal increase in magnetic-field during the flaring-episode can result in the flux enhancement.
This is possibly associated with the efficiency of particle acceleration during flaring-states
as compared to quiescent-state.

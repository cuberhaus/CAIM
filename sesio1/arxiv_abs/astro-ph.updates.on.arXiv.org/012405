(ABRIDGED) We use the 17th data release of the second phase of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic
Evolution Experiment (APOGEE-2) to provide a homogenous census of N-rich red giant stars across
the Milky Way (MW). We report a total of 149 newly identified N-rich field giants toward the bulge,
metal-poor disk, and halo of our Galaxy. They exhibit significant enrichment in their nitrogen
abundance ratios ([N/Fe] $\gtrsim+0.5$), along with simultaneous depletions in their [C/Fe]
abundance ratios ([C/Fe] $< +0.15$), and they cover a wide range of metallicities ($-1.8 < $ [Fe/H]
$ <-0.7$). The final sample of candidate N-rich red giant stars with globular-cluster-like (GC-like)
abundance patterns from the APOGEE survey includes a grand total of $\sim$ 412 unique objects. These
strongly N-enhanced stars are speculated to have been stripped from GCs based on their chemical
similarities with these systems. Even though we have not found any strong evidence for binary companions
or signatures of pulsating variability yet, we cannot rule out the possibility that some of these
objects were members of binary systems in the past and/or are currently part of a variable system.
In particular, the fact that we identify such stars among the field stars in our Galaxy provides strong
evidence that the nucleosynthetic process(es) producing the anomalous [N/Fe] abundance ratios
occurs over a wide range of metallicities. This may provide evidence either for or against the uniqueness
of the progenitor stars to GCs and/or the existence of chemical anomalies associated with likely
tidally shredded clusters in massive dwarf galaxies such as "Kraken/Koala," \textit{Gaia}-Enceladus-Sausage,
among others, before or during their accretion by the MW. A dynamical analysis reveals that the newly
identified N-rich stars exhibit a wide range of dynamical characteristics throughout the MW, ...

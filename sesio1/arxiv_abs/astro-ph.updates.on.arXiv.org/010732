We perform 2D, fully compressible, time-implicit simulations of convection in a solar-like model
with the MUSIC code. Our main motivation is to explore the impact of a common tactic adopted in numerical
simulations of convection that use realistic stellar conditions. This tactic is to artificially
increase the luminosity and to modify the thermal diffusivity of the reference stellar model. This
work focuses on the impact of these modifications on convective penetration (or overshooting)
at the base of the convective envelope of a solar-like model. We explore a range of enhancement factors
for the energy input and confirm the increase in the characteristic overshooting depth with the
increase in the energy input. Our results highlight the importance of the impact of penetrative
downflows on the thermal background below the convective boundary. This is a result of compression
and shear which induce local heating and thermal mixing. The artificial increase in the energy flux
intensifies the heating process by increasing the velocities in the convective zone and at the convective
boundary, revealing a subtle connection between the local heating of the thermal background and
the plume dynamics. This heating also increases the efficiency of heat transport by radiation which
may counterbalance further heating and helps to establish a steady state. The modification of the
thermal background by penetrative plumes impacts the width of the overshooting layer. Our results
suggest that an artificial modification of the radiative diffusivity in the overshooting layer,
rather than only accelerating the thermal relaxation, could also alter the dynamics of the penetrating
plumes and thus the width of the overshooting layer. Results from simulations with an artificial
modification of the energy flux and of the thermal diffusivity should be regarded with caution if
used to determine an overshooting width.

Statistical theory for self-gravitating collisionless dark matter flow is not fully developed
because of 1) intrinsic complexity involving constant divergence flow on small scale and irrotational
flow on large scale; 2) lack of self-closed description for peculiar velocity; and 3) mathematically
challenging. To better understand dark matter flow, kinematic and dynamic relations must be developed
for different types of flow. In this paper, a compact derivation is presented to formulate general
kinematic relations of any order for incompressible, constant divergence, and irrotational flow.
Results are validated by N-body simulation. Dynamic relations can only be determined from self-closed
description of velocity evolution. On large scale, we found i) third order velocity correlation
can be related to density correlation or pairwise velocity; ii) effective viscosity in adhesion
model originates from velocity fluctuations; iii) negative viscosity is due to inverse energy
cascade; iv) $q$th order velocity correlations follow $\propto a^{(q+2)/2}$ for odd $q$ and $\propto
a^{q/2}$ for even $q$; v) overdensity is proportional to density correlation on the same scale,
$\langle\delta\rangle\propto\langle\delta\delta'\rangle$; vi) (reduced) velocity dispersion
is proportional to density correlation on the same scale. On small scale, self-closed description
for velocity evolution is developed by decomposing velocity into motion in halo and motion of halos.
Vorticity, enstrophy, and energy evolution can all be derived subsequently. Dynamic relation
is derived to relate second and third order correlations. Third moment of pairwise velocity is determined
by energy cascade rate $\epsilon_u$ or $\langle(\Delta u_L)^3\rangle\propto\epsilon_uar$.
Combined kinematic and dynamic relations determines the exponential and one-fourth power law
velocity correlations on large and small scales, respectively.

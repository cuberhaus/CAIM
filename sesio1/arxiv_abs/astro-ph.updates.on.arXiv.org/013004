Supernova light curves are dominated at early time, hours to days, by the escape of photons from the
expanding shock heated envelope. We provide a simple analytic description of the time dependent
luminosity, $L$, and color temperature, $T_{\rm col}$, for explosions of red supergiants (with
convective polytropic envelopes), valid up to H recombination ($T\approx0.7$ eV). The analytic
description is based on an interpolation between earlier analytic expressions valid at different
(initial planar and later spherical) stages of the expansion, calibrated against the results of
numerical hydrodynamic diffusion calculations for a wide range of progenitor parameters (mass,
radius, core/envelope mass and radius ratios, metalicity), and explosion energies. The numerically
derived $L$ and $T_{\rm col}$ are described by the analytic expressions with 10\% and 5\% accuracy
respectively. $T_{\rm col}$ is inferred from the hydrodynamic profiles using (time and space dependent)
effective "gray" (frequency independent) opacity, based on opacity tables that we have constructed
for this purpose (and will be made publicly available) including the contributions of bound-bound
and bound-free transitions. In an accompanying paper (Paper II) we show, using a large set of multi-group
photon diffusion calculations, that the spectral energy distribution is well described by a Planck
spectrum with $T=T_{\rm col}$, except at UV frequencies (beyond the spectral peak at $3T_{\rm col}$),
where the flux is significantly suppressed due to the presence of strong line absorption. We defer
the full discussion of the multi-group results to paper II, but provide here for completeness an
analytic description also of the UV suppression. Our analytic results are a useful tool for inferring
progenitor properties, explosion velocity, and also relative extinction based on early multi-band
shock cooling observations of supernovae.

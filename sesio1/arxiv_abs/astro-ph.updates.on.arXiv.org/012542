We analyse the kinematical and dynamical state of the galaxy cluster RXCJ1230.7+3439, at z=0.332,
using 93 new spectroscopic redshifts of galaxies acquired at the 3.6m TNG telescope and from SDSS
DR16 public data. We find that RXCJ1230 appears as a clearly isolated peak in the redshift space,
with a global line-of-sight velocity dispersion of $1004_{-122}^{+147}$ km s$^{-1}$, and showing
a very complex structure with the presence of three subclusters. Our analyses confirm that the three
substructures detected are in a pre-merger phase, where the main interaction takes place with the
south-west subclump. We compute a velocity dispersion of $\sigma_\textrm{v} \sim 1000$ and $\sigma_\textrm{v}
\sim 800$ km s$^{-1}$ for the main cluster and the south-west substructure, respectively. The central
main body and south-west substructure differ by $\sim 870$ km s$^{-1}$ in the LOS velocity. From
these data, we estimate a dynamical mass of $M_{200}= 9.0 \pm 1.5 \times 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$ and
$4.4 \pm 3.3 \times 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$ for the RXCJ1230 main body and south-west clump, respectively,
which reveals that the cluster will suffer a merging characterized by a 2:1 mass ratio impact. We
solve a two-body problem for this interaction and find that the most likely solution suggests that
the merging axis lies almost contained in the plane of the sky and the subcluster will fully interact
in $\sim0.3$ Gyr. The comparison between the dynamical masses and those derived from X-ray data
reveals a good agreement within errors (differences $\sim 15$\%), which suggests that the innermost
regions ($<r_{500}$) of the galaxy clumps are almost in hydrostatical equilibrium. To summarize,
RXCJ1230 is a young but also massive cluster in a pre-merging phase accreeting other galaxy systems
from its environment.

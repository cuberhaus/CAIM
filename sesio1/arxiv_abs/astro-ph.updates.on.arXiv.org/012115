We use a sample of 27 GRBs at redshift $z=2-6$ to probe the outflows in their respective host galaxies
($\mathrm{log(M_*/M_{\odot})}~\sim~9-11$) and search for possible relations between the outflow
properties and those of the host galaxies such as $\mathrm{M_*}$, SFR, and specific SFR. First,
we consider three outflow properties $-$ outflow column density ($\mathrm{N_{out}}$), maximum
outflow velocity ($\mathrm{V_{max}}$), and normalized maximum velocity ($\mathrm{V_{norm}}$
= $\mathrm{V_{max}/V_{circ, halo}}$, where $\mathrm{V_{circ,halo}}$ is the halo circular velocity).
We observe clear trends of $\mathrm{N_{out}}$ and $\mathrm{V_{max}}$ with increasing SFR in high-ion-traced
outflows, with a stronger ($>~3\sigma$) $\mathrm{V_{max}}-$SFR correlation. We find that the
estimated mass outflow rate and momentum flux of the high-ion outflows scale with SFR and can be supported
by the momentum imparted by star formation (supernovae and stellar winds). The kinematic correlations
of high-ion-traced outflows with SFR are similar to those observed for star-forming galaxies at
low redshifts. The correlations with SFR are weaker in low-ions. This, along with the lower detection
fraction in low-ions, indicates that the outflow is primarily high-ion dominated. We also observe
a strong ($>~3\sigma$) trend of normalized velocity ($\mathrm{V_{norm}}$) decreasing with halo
mass and increasing with sSFR, suggesting that outflows from low-mass halos and high-sSFR galaxies
are most likely to escape and enrich the outer CGM and IGM with metals. By comparing the CGM-GRB stacks
with those of starbursts at $z\sim2$ and $z\sim0.1$, we find that over a broad redshift range, the
outflow strength strongly depends on the main-sequence offset at the respective redshifts rather
than simply the SFR.

We report a NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array (ALMA) search for redshifted CO emission from the galaxies associated with seven high-metallicity
([M/H] $\geq -1.03$) damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorbers (DLAs) at $z\approx1.64-2.51$. Our observations
yielded one new detection of CO(3-2) emission from a galaxy at $z=2.4604$ using NOEMA, associated
with the $z=2.4628$ DLA towards QSO B0201+365. Including previous searches, our search results
in detection rates of CO emission of $\approx56^{+38}_{-24}$ % and $\approx11^{+26}_{-9}$ %,
respectively, in the fields of DLAs with ${\rm [M/H]}>-0.3$ and ${\rm [M/H]}<-0.3$. Further, the
HI-selected galaxies associated with five DLAs with [M/H] $>-0.3$ all have high molecular gas masses,
$\gtrsim5\times10^{10}\ {\rm M}_\odot$. This indicates that the highest-metallicity DLAs at
$z\approx2$ are associated with the most massive galaxies. The newly-identified $z\approx2.4604$
HI-selected galaxy, DLA0201+365g, has an impact parameter of $\approx7$ kpc to the QSO sightline,
and an implied molecular gas mass of $(5.04\pm0.78) \times10^{10}\times(\alpha_{\rm CO}/4.36)\times(r_{31}/0.55)\
{\rm M}_\odot$. Archival Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 imaging covering
the rest-frame near-ultraviolet (NUV) and far-ultraviolet (FUV) emission from this galaxy yield
non-detections of rest-frame NUV and FUV emission, and a $5\sigma$ upper limit of 2.3 M$_\odot$
yr$^{-1}$ on the unobscured star formation rate (SFR). The low NUV-based SFR estimate, despite
the very high molecular gas mass, indicates that DLA0201+365g either is a very dusty galaxy, or has
a molecular gas depletion time that is around two orders of magnitude larger than that of star-forming
galaxies at similar redshifts.

[Abridged] Far-infrared observations with Herschel revealed a surprisingly low abundance of
cold-water reservoirs in protoplanetary discs. On the other hand, a handful of discs show emission
of hot water transitions excited at temperatures above a few hundred Kelvin. In particular, the
protoplanetary discs around the Herbig Ae stars HD 100546 and HD 163296 show opposite trends in terms
of cold versus hot water emission: in the first case, the ground-state transitions are detected
and the high-J lines are undetected, while the trend is opposite in HD 163296. We performed a spectral
analysis using the thermo-chemical model DALI. We find that HD 163296 is characterised by a water-rich
(abundance $\gtrsim 10^{-5}$) hot inner disc (within the snowline) and a water-poor ($< 10^{-10}$)
outer disc: the relative abundance may be due to the thermal desorption of icy grains that have migrated
inward. Remarkably, the size of the H$_2$O emitting region corresponds to a narrow dust gap visible
in the millimeter continuum at $r=10\,$au with ALMA. The low-J lines detected in HD 100546 instead
imply an abundance of a few $10^{-9}$ in the cold outer disc ($> 40$ au). The emitting region of the
cold H$_2$O transitions is spatially coincident with that of the H$_2$O ice previously seen in the
near-infrared. Notably, millimetre observations with ALMA reveal the presence of a large dust
gap between nearly 40 and 150 au, likely opened by a massive embedded protoplanet. In both discs,
we find that the warm molecular layer in the outer region (beyond the snow line) is highly depleted
of water molecules, implying an oxygen-poor chemical composition of the gas. We speculate that
gas-phase oxygen in the outer disc is readily depleted and its distribution in the disc is tightly
coupled to the dynamics of the dust grains.

Quasars can be used to measure baryon acoustic oscillations at high redshift, which are considered
as direct tracers of the most distant large-scale structures in the Universe. It is fundamental
to select quasars from observations before implementing the above research. This work focuses
on creating a catalog of quasar candidates based on photometric data to provide primary priors for
further object classification with spectroscopic data in the future, such as The Dark Energy Spectroscopic
Instrument (DESI) Survey. We adopt a machine learning algorithm (Random Forest, RF) for quasar
identification. The training set includes $651,073$ positives and $1,227,172$ negatives, in
which the photometric information are from DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (DESI-LIS) \& Wide-field
Infrared Survey Explore (WISE), and the labels are from a database of spectroscopically confirmed
quasars based on Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Set of Identifications \& Measurements
and Bibliography for Astronomical Data (SIMBAD). The trained RF model is applied to point-like
sources in DESI-LIS Data Release 9. To quantify the classifier's performance, we also inject a testing
set into the to-be-applied data. Eventually, we obtained $1,953,932$ Grade-A quasar candidates
and $22,486, 884$ Grade-B quasar candidates out of $425,540,269$ sources ($\sim 5.7\%$). The catalog
covers $\sim 99\%$ of quasars in the to-be-applied data by evaluating the completeness of the classification
on the testing set. The statistical properties of the candidates agree with that given by the method
of color-cut selection. Our catalog can intensely decrease the workload for confirming quasars
with the upcoming DESI data by eliminating enormous non-quasars but remaining high completeness.

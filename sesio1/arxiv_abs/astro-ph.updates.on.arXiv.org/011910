Thousands of active artificial objects are orbiting around Earth along with much more non-operational
ones -- derelict satellites or rocket bodies, collision debris, or spacecraft payloads, significant
part of them being uncatalogued. They all impact observations of the sky by ground-based telescopes
by producing a large number of streaks polluting the images, as well as generating false alerts hindering
the search for new astrophysical transients. While the former threat for astronomy is widely discussed
nowadays in regard of rapidly growing satellite mega-constellations, the latter one -- false transients
-- still lacks attention on the similar level. In this work we assess the impact of satellite glints
-- rapid flashes produced by reflections of a sunlight from flat surfaces of rotating satellites
-- on current and future deep sky surveys such as the ones conducted by the Zwicky Transient Facility
(ZTF) and the Vera Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). For that, we propose
a simple routine that detects, in a single exposure, a series of repeated flashes along the trajectories
of otherwise invisible satellites, and describe its implementation in FINK alert broker. Application
of the routine to ZTF alert stream revealed about 73,000 individual events polluting 3.6\% of all
ZTF science images between November 2019 and December 2021 and linked to more than 300 different
glinting satellites on all kinds of orbits, from low-Earth up to geostationary ones. The timescales
of individual flashes are as short as $0.1$--$10^{-3}$ seconds, with instant brightness of 4--14
magnitudes, peak amplitudes of at least 2--4 magnitudes, and generally complex temporal patterns
of flashing activity. We expect LSST to see much more such satellite glints of even larger amplitudes
due to its better sensitivity.

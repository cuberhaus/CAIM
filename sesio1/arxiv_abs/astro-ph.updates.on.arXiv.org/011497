We study the striking case of a blue narrow stream with a possible globular cluster-like progenitor
around the Milky Way-size galaxy NGC 7241 and its foreground dwarf companion. We present a follow-up
spectroscopic study of this stream based on data taken with the MEGARA instrument at the 10.4-m Gran
Telescopio Canarias using the integral field spectroscopy mode. Although our data suggest that
this compact object in the stream is actually a foreground Milky Way halo star, we detect emission
lines overlapping a less compact, bluer and fainter blob of the stream that is clearly visible in
both ultra-violet and optical deep images. From its heliocentric systemic radial velocity derived
from the [OIII] 5007A lines (V_syst= 1548.58+/-1.80 km\s^-1) and new UV and optical broad-band
photometry, we conclude that this over-density could be the actual core of the stream, with an absolute
magnitude of Mg~ -10 and a g-r = 0.08+/- 0.11, consistent with a remnant of a low-mass dwarf satellite
undergoing a current episode of star formation. From the width of the stream, we calculate that the
progenitor mass is between 6.4 x 10^6 Mo -2.7 x 10^7 Mo, which is typical of a dwarf galaxy. These estimates
suggest that this is one of the lowest mass streams detected so far beyond the Local Group. We find
that blue stellar streams containing star formation regions are commonly predicted by high-resolution
cosmological simulations of galaxies lighter than the Milky Way. This scenario is consistent with
the processes explaining the bursty star formation history of some dwarf satellites, which are
followed by a gas depletion and a fast quenching once they enter within the virial radius of their
host galaxies. Thus, it is likely that the stream's progenitor is suffering a star-formation burst
comparable to those that have shaped the star-formation history of several Local Group dwarfs in
the last few Gigayears.

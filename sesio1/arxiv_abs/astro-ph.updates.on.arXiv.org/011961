We present an extensive archival analysis of a sample of local galaxies, combining multi-wavelength
data from GALEX, Spitzer and Herschel to investigate "blue-side" mid-infrared (MIR) and "red-side"
far-infrared (FIR) color-color correlations within the observed infrared spectral energy distributions
(IR SEDs). Our sample largely consists of the KINGFISH galaxies, with the important addition of
a select few including NGC5236 (M83) and NGC4449. With data from the far-ultraviolet FUV (${\sim}0.15$
$\mu$m) through 500 $\mu$m convolved to common angular resolution, we measure photometry of $kpc$-scale
star-forming regions 36$"\times$36$"$ in size. Star formation rates (SFRs), stellar masses and
metallicity distributions are derived throughout our sample. Focusing on the $f_{70}/f_{500}$
"FIR" and $f_{8}/f_{24}$ "MIR" flux density ratios (colors), we find that a sub-sample of galaxies
demonstrate a strong IR color-color correlation within their star-forming regions, while others
demonstrate uncorrelated colors. This division is driven by two main effects: 1) the local strength
of star formation (SF) and 2) the metal content of the interstellar medium (ISM). Galaxies uniformly
dominated by high surface densities of SF (e.g. NGC5236) demonstrate strong IR color-color correlations,
while galaxies that exhibit lower levels of SF and mixed environments (e.g. NGC5457) demonstrate
weaker or no correlation--explained by the increasing effect of varying ISM heating and metal content
on the IR colors, specifically in the MIR. We find large dispersion in the SFR-$L_{8}$ (8 $\mu$m luminosity)
relation that is traced by the metallicity distributions, consistent with extant studies, highlighting
its problematic use as a SFR indicator across diverse systems/samples.

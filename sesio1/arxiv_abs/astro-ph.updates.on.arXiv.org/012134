We analyze two binary systems containing giant stars, V723 Mon ("the Unicorn") and 2M04123153+6738486
("the Giraffe"). Both giants orbit more massive but less luminous companions, previously proposed
to be mass-gap black holes. Spectral disentangling reveals luminous companions with star-like
spectra in both systems. Joint modeling of the spectra, light curves, and spectral energy distributions
robustly constrains the masses, temperatures, and radii of both components: the primaries are
luminous, cool giants ($T_{\rm eff,\,giant} = 3,800\,\rm K$ and $4,000\,\rm K$, $R_{\rm giant}=
22.5\,R_{\odot}$ and $25\,R_{\odot}$) with exceptionally low masses ($M_{\rm giant} \approx
0.4\,M_{\odot}$) that likely fill their Roche lobes. The secondaries are only slightly warmer
subgiants ($T_{\rm eff,\,2} = 5,800\,\rm K$ and $5,150\,\rm K$, $R_2= 8.3\,R_{\odot}$ and $9\,R_{\odot}$)
and thus are consistent with observed UV limits that would rule out main-sequence stars with similar
masses ($M_2 \approx 2.8\,M_{\odot}$ and $\approx 1.8\,M_{\odot}$). In the Unicorn, rapid rotation
blurs the spectral lines of the subgiant, making it challenging to detect even at wavelengths where
it dominates the total light. Both giants have surface abundances indicative of CNO processing
and subsequent envelope stripping. The properties of both systems can be reproduced by binary evolution
models in which a $1-2\,M_{\odot}$ primary is stripped by a companion as it ascends the giant branch.
The fact that the companions are also evolved implies either that the initial mass ratio was very
near unity, or that the companions are temporarily inflated due to rapid accretion. The Unicorn
and Giraffe offer a window into into a rarely-observed phase of binary evolution preceding the formation
of wide-orbit helium white dwarfs, and eventually, compact binaries containing two helium white
dwarfs.

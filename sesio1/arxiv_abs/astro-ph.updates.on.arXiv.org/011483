Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration signals, to be highly dispersed at distant galaxies,
the physical origin of which is still challenging. Coherent curvature emission by bunches powered,
e.g., by starquakes, has already been proposed for repeating FRBs, with a friendly nature of understanding
the narrowband radiation exhibiting time-frequency drifting. Recently, a highly active FRB source,
FRB 20201124A, was reported to enter a newly active episode and emit at least some highly circle-polarized
bursts. We revisit the polarized FRB emission here, investigating especially the production mechanisms
of a high circular polarization by deriving intrinsic and propagation effects. The intrinsic mechanisms
by invoking charged bunches are approached in two scenarios of coherence: curvature radiation
(CR) and inverse Compton scattering (ICS), and consequently, a high circular polarization could
naturally be explained by the coherent summation of outcome waves, generated or scattered by bunches,
with different phases and electric vectors. Cyclotron resonance can result in an absorption of
R-mode photons at lower altitude region of magnetosphere, and an FRB should then be emitted from
a higher region if the waves are of strong linear polarization. Circularly polarized components
could be produced from Faraday conversion exhibiting a $\lambda^3$-oscillation, but the average
circular polarization fraction depends only on the income wave, indicating a possibility of highly
circle-polarized income wave. The analysis could be welcome if extremely high (e.g., almost 100\%)
circular polarization from repeating FRBs would be detected in the future. The production of a bulk
of energetic bunches in pulsar-like magnetosphere is discussed finally, which is relevant to the
nature of FRB central engine.

Precise fundamental atmospheric stellar parameters and abundance determination of individual
elements in stars are important for all stellar population studies. Non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium
(Non-LTE; hereafter NLTE) models are often important for such high precision, however, can be computationally
complex and expensive, which renders the models less utilized in spectroscopic analyses. To alleviate
the computational burden of such models, we developed a robust 1D, LTE and NLTE fundamental atmospheric
stellar parameter derivation tool, $\texttt{LOTUS}$, to determine the effective temperature
$T_{\mathrm{eff}}$, surface gravity $\log g$, metallicity $\mbox{[Fe/H]}$ and microturbulent
velocity $v_{\mathrm{mic}}$ for FGK type stars, from equivalent width (EW) measurements of Fe
I and Fe II lines. We utilize a generalized curve of growth method to take into account the EW dependencies
of each Fe I and Fe II line on the corresponding atmospheric stellar parameters. A global differential
evolution optimization algorithm is then used to derive the optimized fundamental parameters.
Additionally, $\texttt{LOTUS}$ can determine precise uncertainties for each stellar parameter
using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. We test and apply $\texttt{LOTUS}$ on a sample
of benchmark stars, as well as stars with available asteroseismic surface gravities from the K2
survey, and metal-poor stars from $R$-process Alliance (RPA) survey. We find very good agreement
between our NLTE-derived parameters in $\texttt{LOTUS}$ to non-spectroscopic values within
$T_{\mathrm{eff}}=\pm 30$ K and $\log g=\pm 0.20$ dex for benchmark stars. We provide open access
of our code, as well as of the interpolated pre-computed NLTE EW grids available on Github, and documentation
with working examples on Readthedocs.

We compare observations of HI from the Very Large Array (VLA) and the Arecibo Observatory and observations
of HCO$^+$ from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the Northern Extended
Millimeter Array (NOEMA) in the diffuse ($A_V\lesssim1$) interstellar medium (ISM) to predictions
from a photodissociation region (PDR) chemical model and multi-phase ISM simulations. Using a
coarse grid of PDR models, we estimate the density, FUV radiation field, and cosmic ray ionization
rate (CRIR) for each structure identified in HCO$^+$ and HI absorption. These structures fall into
two categories. Structures with $T_s<40~\mathrm{K}$, mostly with $N(\mathrm{HCO^+})\lesssim10^{12}~\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$,
are consistent with modest density, FUV radiation field, and CRIR models, typical of the diffuse
molecular ISM. Structures with spin temperature $T_s>40~\mathrm{K}$, mostly with $N(\mathrm{HCO^+})\gtrsim10^{12}~\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$,
are consistent with high density, FUV radiation field, and CRIR models, characteristic of environments
close to massive star formation. The latter are also found in directions with a significant fraction
of thermally unstable HI. In at least one case, we rule out the PDR model parameters, suggesting that
alternative mechanisms (e.g., non-equilibrium processes like turbulent dissipation and/or
shocks) are required to explain the observed HCO$^+$ in this direction. Similarly, while our observations
and simulations of the turbulent, multi-phase ISM agree that HCO$^+$ formation occurs along sightlines
with $N(\mathrm{HI})\gtrsim10^{21}~\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$, the simulated data fail to explain
HCO$^+$ column densities $\gtrsim\rm{few}\times10^{12}~\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$. Since a majority
of our sightlines with HCO$^+$ had such high column densities, this likely indicates that non-equilibrium
chemistry is important for these lines of sight.

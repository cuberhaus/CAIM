Cosmological analyses with type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) often assume a single empirical relation
between color and luminosity ($\beta$) and do not account for varying host-galaxy dust properties.
However, from studies of dust in large samples of galaxies, it is known that dust attenuation can
vary significantly. Here we take advantage of state-of-the-art modeling of galaxy properties
to characterize dust parameters (dust attenuation $A_V$, and a parameter describing the dust law
slope $R_V$) for the Dark Energy Survey (DES) SN Ia host galaxies using the publicly available \texttt{BAGPIPES}
code. Utilizing optical and infrared data of the hosts alone, we find three key aspects of host dust
that impact SN Ia cosmology: 1) there exists a large range ($\sim1-6$) of host $R_V$ 2) high stellar
mass hosts have $R_V$ on average $\sim0.7$ lower than that of low-mass hosts 3) there is a significant
($>3\sigma$) correlation between the Hubble diagram residuals of red SNe Ia that when corrected
for reduces scatter by $\sim13\%$ and the significance of the ``mass step'' to $\sim1\sigma$. These
represent independent confirmations of recent predictions based on dust that attempted to explain
the puzzling ``mass step'' and intrinsic scatter ($\sigma_{\rm int}$) in SN Ia analyses. We also
find that red-sequence galaxies have both lower and more peaked dust law slope distributions on
average in comparison to non red-sequence galaxies. We find that the SN Ia $\beta$ and $\sigma_{\rm
int}$ both differ by $>3\sigma$ when determined separately for red-sequence galaxy and all other
galaxy hosts. The agreement between fitted host-$R_V$ and SN Ia $\beta$ \& $\sigma_{\rm int}$ suggests
that host dust properties play a major role in SN Ia color-luminosity standardization and supports
the claim that SN Ia intrinsic scatter is driven by $R_V$ variation.

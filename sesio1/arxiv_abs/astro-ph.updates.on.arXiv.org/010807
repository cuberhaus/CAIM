Observations of reconnection jets in the solar corona are emerging as a possible diagnostic to study
highly elusive coronal heating. Such nanojets can be observed in coronal loops and they have been
linked to nanoflares. However, while models successfully describe the bilateral post-reconnection
magnetic slingshot effect that leads to the jets, observations reveal that nanojets are unidirectional,
or highly asymmetric, with only the jet travelling inward with respect to the coronal loop's curvature
being clearly observed. The aim of this work is to address the role of the curvature of the coronal
loop in asymmetric reconnection jets. In order to do so, we first use a simplified analytical model
where we estimate the post-reconnection tension forces based on the local intersection angle between
the pre-reconnection magnetic field lines and on their post-reconnection retracting length towards
new equilibria. Second, we use a simplified numerical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model to study
how two opposite propagating jets evolve in curved magnetic field lines. Our analytical model demonstrates
that in the post-reconnection reorganised magnetic field, the inward directed magnetic tension
is inherently stronger (up to 3 orders of magnitude) than the outward directed one and that, with
a large enough retracting length, a regime exists where the outward directed tension disappears,
leading to no outward jet at large, observable scales. Our MHD numerical model provides support
for these results proving also that in the following time evolution the inward jets are consistently
more energetic. The degree of asymmetry is also found to increase for small-angle reconnection
and for more localised reconnection regions. This work shows that the curvature of the coronal loops
plays a role in the asymmetry of the reconnection jets and inward directed jets are more likely to
occur and more energetic.

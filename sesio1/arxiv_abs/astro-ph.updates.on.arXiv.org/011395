OB star clusters originate from parsec-scale massive molecular clumps. We aim to understand the
evolution of temperature and density structures on the intermediate-scale ($\lesssim$0.1-1
pc) extended gas of massive clumps. We performed $\sim$0.1 pc resolution observations (SMA+APEX)
of multiple molecular line tracers (e.g., CH$_{3}$CCH, H$_{2}$CS, CH$_{3}$CN, CH$_{3}$OH) which
cover a wide range of excitation conditions, towards a sample of eight massive clumps. Based on various
radiative transfer models, we constrain the gas temperature and density structures and establish
an evolutionary picture, aided by a spatially-dependent virial analysis and abundance ratios
of multiple species. We determine temperature radial profiles varying between 30-200 K over a continuous
scale, from the center of the clumps out to 0.3-0.4 pc radii. The clumps' radial gas density profiles,
described by radial power-laws with slopes between -0.6 and $\sim$-1.5, are steeper for more evolved
sources, as suggested by results based on both dust continuum, representing the bulk of the gas ($\sim$10$^{4}$
cm$^{-3}$), and CH$_{3}$OH lines probing the dense gas ($\gtrsim$10$^{6}$-10$^{8}$ cm$^{-3}$)
regime. The density contrast between the dense gas and the bulk gas increases with evolution, and
may be indicative of spatially and temporally varying star formation efficiencies. The radial
profiles of the virial parameter show a global variation towards a sub-virial state as the clump
evolves. The line-widths decline with increasing radius around the central core region and increase
in the outer envelope, with a slope shallower than the case of the supersonic turbulence ($\,\propto\,$$r^{0.5}$)
and the subsonic Kolmogorov scaling ($\,\propto\,$$r^{0.33}$). In the context of clump evolution,
we also find that the abundance ratios of [CCH]/[CH$_{3}$OH] and [CH$_{3}$CN]/[CH$_{3}$OH] show
correlations with clump $L/M$.

The presence of forming planets embedded in their protoplanetary disks has been inferred from the
detection of multiring structures in such disks. Most of these suspected planets are undetectable
by direct imaging observations at current measurement sensitivities. Inward migration and accretion
might make these putative planets accessible to the Doppler method, but the actual extent of growth
and orbital evolution remains unconstrained. Under the premise that the gaps in the disk around
HD 163296 originate from new-born planets, we investigate if and under which circumstances the
gap-opening planets could represent progenitors of the exoplanet population detected around
A-type stars. In particular, we study the dependence of final planetary masses and orbital parameters
on the viscosity of the disk. The evolution of the embedded planets was simulated throughout the
disk lifetime and up to 100 Myr after the dispersal of the disk, taking the evolving disk structure
and a likely range of disk lifetimes into account. We find that the final configuration of the planets
is largely determined by the $\alpha$ viscosity parameter of the disk and less dependent on the choice
for the disk lifetime and the initial planetary parameters. If we assume that planets such as those
in HD 163296 evolve to form the observed exoplanet population of A-type stars, a $\alpha$ parameter
on the order of $3.16 \times 10^{-4} \lesssim \alpha \lesssim 10^{-3}$ is required for the disks
to induce sufficiently high migration rates. Depending on whether or not future direct imaging
surveys will uncover a larger number of planets with $m_\mathrm{pl} \lesssim 3 M_\mathrm{Jup}$
and $a_\mathrm{pl} \gtrsim 10 \mathrm{AU}$ we expect the $\alpha$ parameter to be at the lower or
upper end of this range, always under the assumption that such disks indeed harbor wide orbit planets.

We present ALMA data on the 3mm continuum emission, CO isotopologues (12CO, 13CO, C18O), and high-density
molecular tracers (HCN, HCO+, HNC, HNCO, CS, CN, and CH3OH) in NGC4526. These data enable a detailed
study of the physical properties of the molecular gas in a longtime resident of the Virgo Cluster;
comparisons to more commonly-studied spiral galaxies offer intriguing hints into the processing
of molecular gas in the cluster environment. Many molecular line ratios in NGC4526, along with our
inferred abundances and CO/H2 conversion factors, are similar to those found in nearby spirals.
One striking exception is the very low observed 12CO/13CO(1-0) line ratio, $3.4\pm0.3$, which
is unusually low for spirals though not for Virgo Cluster early-type galaxies. We carry out radiative
transfer modeling of the CO isotopologues with some archival (2-1) data, and we use Bayesian analysis
with Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques to infer the physical properties of the CO-emitting gas.
We find surprisingly low [12CO/13CO] abundance ratios of $7.8^{+2.7}_{-1.5}$ and $6.5^{+3.0}_{-1.3}$
at radii of 0.4 kpc and 1 kpc. The emission from the high-density tracers HCN, HCO+, HNC, CS and CN is
also relatively bright, and CN is unusually optically thick in the inner parts of NGC4526. These
features hint that processing in the cluster environment may have removed much of the galaxy's relatively
diffuse, optically thinner molecular gas along with its atomic gas. Angular momentum transfer
to the surrounding intracluster medium may also have caused contraction of the disk, magnifying
radial gradients such as we find in [13CO/C18O]. More detailed chemical evolution modeling would
be interesting in order to explore whether the unusual [12CO/13CO] abundance ratio is entirely
an environmental effect or whether it also reflects the relatively old stellar population in this
early-type galaxy.

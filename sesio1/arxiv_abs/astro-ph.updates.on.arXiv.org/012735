In the Milky Way, recent progress in the exploration of its assembly history is driven by the tremendous
amount of high-quality data delivered by Gaia, which has revealed a number of substructures potentially
linked to several ancient accretion events. In this work, aiming to explore the phase-space structure
of accreted stars, we analyze six M31/MW analogues from the HESTIA suite of cosmological hydrodynamics
zoom-in simulations of the Local Group. We found that all the HESTIA galaxies experience a few dozen
mergers but only 1-4 mergers have the stellar mass ratio >0.2 where, depending on the halo definition,
the most massive merger contributes from 20% to 70% of the total stellar halo. Individual merger
remnants show diverse density distributions at z=0, significantly overlapping with each other
and with the in-situ stars in the ELz, UV and RVphi coordinates. The mergers debris often change their
position in the ELz with time due to the galactic mass growth and the non-axisymmetry of the potential.
In agreement with previous works, we show that even individual merger debris exhibit a number of
distinct ELz features. In the UV plane, all HESTIA galaxies reveal radially hot, non-rotating or
weakly counter-rotating, Gaia-Sausage-like features. We found an age gradient in Elz space for
the individual debris, where the youngest stars, formed in the inner regions of accreting systems,
deposit to the innermost regions of the host. The bulk of these stars is being formed during the last
stages of accretion, making it possible to date the merger. In actions space (Jr, Jz, J\phi), the
mergers debris do not appear as isolated substructures but are instead scattered over a large parameters
area and overlapping with the in-situ stars. We also introduce a purely kinematic space (Jz/Jr-eccentricity),
where different merger debris can be disentangled better from each other and from the in-situ stars.

Pair-instability supernovae are theorized supernovae that have not yet been observationally
confirmed. They are predicted to exist in low-metallicity environments. Because overall metallicity
becomes lower at higher redshifts, deep near-infrared transient surveys probing high-redshift
supernovae are suitable to discover pair-instability supernovae. The Euclid satellite, which
is planned to be launched in 2023, has a near-infrared wide-field instrument that is suitable for
a high-redshift supernova survey. Although no dedicated supernova survey is currently planned
during the Euclid's 6 year primary mission, the Euclid Deep Survey is planned to make regular observations
of three Euclid Deep Fields (40 deg2 in total) spanning six years. While the observations of the Euclid
Deep Fields are not frequent, we show that the predicted long duration of pair-instability supernovae
would allow us to search for high-redshift pair-instability supernovae with the Euclid Deep Survey.
Based on the current observational plan of the Euclid mission, we conduct survey simulations in
order to estimate the expected numbers of pair-instability supernova discoveries. We find that
up to several hundred pair-instability supernovae at z < ~ 3.5 can be discovered by the Euclid Deep
Survey. We also show that pair-instability supernova candidates can be efficiently identified
by their duration and color that can be determined with the current Euclid Deep Survey plan. We conclude
that the Euclid mission can lead to the first confident discovery of pair-instability supernovae
if their event rates are as high as those predicted by recent theoretical studies. We also update
the expected numbers of superluminous supernova discoveries in the Euclid Deep Survey based on
the latest observational plan.

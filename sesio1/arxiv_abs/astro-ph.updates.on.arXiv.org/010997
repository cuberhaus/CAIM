We investigate the structural properties, distribution and abundance of LCDM dark matter subhaloes
using the Phi-4096 and Uchuu suite of N-body cosmological simulations. Thanks to the combination
of their large volume, high mass resolution and superb statistics, we are able to quantify -- for
the first time consistently over more than seven decades in ratio of subhalo-to-host-halo mass
-- dependencies of subhalo properties with mass, maximum circular velocity, Vmax, host halo mass
and distance to host halo centre. We also dissect the evolution of these dependencies over cosmic
time. We provide accurate fits for the subhalo mass and velocity functions, both exhibiting decreasing
power-law slopes in the expected range of values and with no significant dependence on redshift.
We also find subhalo abundance to depend weakly on host halo mass. We explore the distribution of
subhaloes within their hosts and its evolution over cosmic time for subhaloes located as deep as
~0.1 per cent of the host virial radius. Subhalo structural properties are codified via a concentration
parameter, cV, that does not depend on any specific, pre-defined density profile and relies only
on Vmax. We derive the cV-Vmax relation in the range 7-1500 km/s and find an important dependence
on distance of the subhalo to the host halo centre, as already described in Molin\'e et al. (2017).
Interestingly, we also find subhaloes of the same mass to be significantly more concentrated into
more massive hosts. Finally, we investigate the redshift evolution of cV, and provide accurate
fits that take into account all mentioned dependencies. Our results offer an unprecedented detailed
characterization of the subhalo population, consistent over a wide range of subhalo and host halo
masses, as well as cosmic times. Our work enables precision work in any future research involving
dark matter halo substructure.

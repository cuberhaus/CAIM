We investigate the relation between rotation periods $P_\mathrm{rot}$ and photometric modulation
amplitudes $R_\mathrm{per}$ for $\approx 4,000$ Sun-like main-sequence stars observed by Kepler,
using $P_\mathrm{rot}$ and $R_\mathrm{per}$ from McQuillan et al. (2014), effective temperature
$T_\mathrm{eff}$ from LAMOST DR6, and parallax data from Gaia EDR3. As has been suggested in previous
works, we find that $P_\mathrm{rot}$ scaled by the convective turnover time $\tau_\mathrm{c}$,
or the Rossby number $\mathrm{Ro}=P_\mathrm{rot}/\tau_\mathrm{c}$, serves as a good predictor
of $R_\mathrm{per}$: $R_\mathrm{per}$ plateaus around $1\%$ in relative flux for $0.2 \lesssim
\mathrm{Ro}/\mathrm{Ro}_\odot \lesssim 0.4$, and decays steeply with increasing $\mathrm{Ro}$
for $0.4 \lesssim \mathrm{Ro}/\mathrm{Ro}_\odot \lesssim 0.8$, where $\mathrm{Ro}_\odot$
denotes $\mathrm{Ro}$ of the Sun. In the latter regime we find $\mathrm{d}\ln R_\mathrm{per}/\mathrm{d}\ln\mathrm{Ro}
\sim -4.5$ to $-2.5$, although the value is sensitive to detection bias against weak modulation
and may depend on other parameters including $T_\mathrm{eff}$ and surface metallicity. The existing
X-ray and Ca II H&K flux data also show transitions at $\mathrm{Ro}/\mathrm{Ro}_\odot\sim 0.4$,
suggesting that all these transitions share the same physical origin. We also find that the rapid
decrease of $R_\mathrm{per}$ with increasing $\mathrm{Ro}$ causes rotational modulation of
fainter Kepler stars with $\mathrm{Ro}/\mathrm{Ro}_\odot \gtrsim 0.6$ to be buried under the
photometric noise. This effect sets the longest $P_\mathrm{rot}$ detected in the McQuillan et
al. (2014) sample as a function of $T_\mathrm{eff}$, and obscures the signature of stalled spin
down that has been proposed to set in around $\mathrm{Ro}/\mathrm{Ro}_\odot \sim 1$.

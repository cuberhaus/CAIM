Luminous red novae (LRNe) are astrophysical transients believed to be caused by the partial ejection
of a binary star's common envelope (CE) and the merger of its components. The formation of the CE is
likely to occur during unstable mass transfer, initiated by a primary star which is evolving off
the main sequence (a Hertzsprung gap star) and a lower mass companion. In agreement with observations,
theoretical studies have shown that outflows from the pre-CE phase produce a detectable brightening
of the progenitor system a few years before the ejection event. Based on these assumptions, we present
a method to identify Galactic LRNe precursors, the resulting precursor candidates, and our follow-up
analysis to uncover their nature. We begin by constructing a sample of progenitor systems, i.e.
Hertzsprung gap stars, by statistically modelling the density of a colour magnitude diagram formed
from "well behaved" Gaia DR2 sources. Their time-domain evolution from the Zwicky Transient Facility
(ZTF) survey is used to search for slowly brightening events, as pre-CE precursor candidates. The
nature of the resulting candidates is further investigated using archival data and our own spectroscopic
follow-up. Overall, we constructed a sample of $\sim5.4\times{10^4}$ progenitor sources, from
which 21 were identified as candidate LRNe precursors. Further analysis revealed 16 of our candidates
to be H$\alpha$ emitters, with their spectra often suggesting hotter (albeit moderately extincted)
A-type or B-type stars. Because of their long-term variability in optical and mid-infrared wavelengths,
we propose that many of our candidates are mass-transferring binaries with compact companions
surrounded by dusty circumstellar disks or alternatively magnetically active stellar merger
remnants.

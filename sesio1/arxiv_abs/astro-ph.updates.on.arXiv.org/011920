Spiral-driven instabilities may drive gas inflow to enhance central star formation in disk galaxies.
We investigate this hypothesis using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) in a sample of 2779 nearby
unbarred star-forming main-sequence spiral galaxies. The strength of spiral arms is quantified
by their average Fourier amplitude relative to the axisymmetric disk. The star formation properties
in the central 1--3\,kpc region were derived from the SDSS spectra. We show that galaxies with stronger
spiral arms not only tend to have more intense central specific star formation rate (sSFR), larger
Balmer absorption line index, and lower 4000-\AA\ break strength, but also have enhanced central
sSFR relative to sSFR measured for the whole galaxy. This link is independent of redshift, stellar
mass, surface density, and concentration. There is a lack of evidence for strong spiral arms being
associated with a significant fraction of starburst or post-starburst galaxies, implying that
the spiral-induced central star formation is likely continuous rather than bursty. We also show
that stronger spiral arms tend to have an increasing fraction of pseudo bulges, a relatively unchanged
fraction of star-forming classical bulges, and a decreasing fraction of quenched classical bulges.
Moreover, the concentration of galaxies hosting pseudo bulges mildly increases with stronger
spiral arms, implying that spirals help pseudo bulges grow. The connection between spirals and
the bulge type is partly attributed to the suppression of spirals by classical bulges and partly
to the enhanced central star formation driven by spirals. We explain our results in a picture where
spiral arms transport cold gas inward to trigger continuous central star formation, which facilitates
the build-up of pseudo bulges. Spiral arms thus play a role in the secular evolution of disk galaxies.

Venus's past climate evolution is uncertain. General circulation model simulations permit a habitable
climate as late as ~0.7 Ga, and there is suggestive-albeit inconclusive-evidence for previous
liquid water from surface geomorphology and mineralogy. However, it is unclear whether a habitable
past can be reconciled with Venus's inferred atmospheric evolution. In particular, the lack of
leftover atmospheric oxygen argues against recent water loss. Here, we apply a fully coupled model
of Venus's atmospheric-interior-climate evolution from post-accretion magma ocean to present.
The model self-consistently tracks C-, H-, and O-bearing volatiles and surface climate through
the entirety of Venus's history. Atmospheric escape, mantle convection, melt production, outgassing,
deep water cycling, and carbon cycling are explicitly coupled to climate and redox evolution. Plate
tectonic and stagnant lid histories are considered. Using this coupled model, we conclude that
both a habitable Venusian past and one where Venus never possessed liquid surface water can be reconciled
with known constraints. Specifically, either scenario can reproduce bulk atmospheric composition,
inferred surface heat flow, and observed $^{40}$Ar and $^{4}$He. Moreover, the model suggests
that Venus could have been habitable with a ~100 m global ocean as late as 1 Ga, without violating any
known constraints. In fact, if diffusion-limited water loss is throttled by a cool, CO$_2$-dominated
upper atmosphere, then a habitable past is tentatively favored by our model. This escape throttling
makes it difficult to simultaneously recover negligible water vapor and ~90 bar CO$_2$ in the modern
atmosphere without temporarily sequestering carbon in the interior via silicate weathering to
enhance H escape.

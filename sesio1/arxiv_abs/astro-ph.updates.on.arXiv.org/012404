In this paper, the X-ray Earth occultation (XEO) of the Crab Nebula is investigated by using the Hard
X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT). The pointing observation data on the 30th September,
2018 recorded by the Low Energy X-ray telescope (LE) of Insight-HXMT are selected and analyzed.
The extinction lightcurves and spectra during the X-ray Earth occultation process are extracted.
A forward model for the XEO lightcurve is established and the theoretical observational signal
for lightcurve is predicted. The atmospheric density model is built with a scale factor to the commonly
used MSIS density profile within a certain altitude range. A Bayesian data analysis method is developed
for the XEO lightcurve modeling and the atmospheric density retrieval. The posterior probability
distribution of the model parameters is derived through the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm
with the NRLMSISE-00 model and the NRLMSIS 2.0 model as basis functions and the best-fit density
profiles are retrieved respectively. It is found that in the altitude range of 105--200 km, the retrieved
density profile is 88.8% of the density of NRLMSISE-00 and 109.7% of the density of NRLMSIS 2.0 by
fitting the lightcurve in the energy range of 1.0--2.5 keV based on XEOS method. In the altitude range
of 95--125 km, the retrieved density profile is 81.0% of the density of NRLMSISE-00 and 92.3% of the
density of NRLMSIS 2.0 by fitting the lightcurve in the energy range of 2.5--6.0 keV based on XEOS
method. In the altitude range of 85--110 km, the retrieved density profile is 87.7% of the density
of NRLMSISE-00 and 101.4% of the density of NRLMSIS 2.0 by fitting the lightcurve in the energy range
of 6.0--10.0 keV based on XEOS method. This study demonstrates that the XEOS from the X-ray astronomical
satellite Insight-HXMT can provide an approach for the study of the upper atmosphere.

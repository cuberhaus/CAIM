Many brown dwarfs are on ultra-short period and tidally-locked orbits around white dwarf hosts.
Because of these small orbital separations, the brown dwarfs are irradiated at levels similar to
hot Jupiters. Yet, they are easier to observe than hot Jupiters because white dwarfs are fainter
than main-sequence stars at near-infrared wavelengths. Irradiated brown dwarfs are, therefore,
ideal hot Jupiter analogs for studying the atmospheric response under strong irradiation and fast
rotation. We present the 1.1--1.67$\rm \mu m$ spectroscopic phase curve of the irradiated brown
dwarf (SDSS1411-B) in the SDSS J141126.20+200911.1 brown-dwarf white-dwarf binary with the near-infrared
G141 grism of Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3. SDSS1411-B is a $50~\rm M_{\rm Jup}$ brown
dwarf with an irradiation temperature of 1300K and has an orbital period of 2.02864 hours. Our best-fit
model suggests a phase-curve amplitude of 1.4$\%$ and places an upper limit of 11 degrees for the
phase offset from the secondary eclipse. After fitting the white-dwarf spectrum, we extract the
phase-resolved brown-dwarf emission spectra. We report a highly wavelength-dependent day-night
spectral variation, with the water-band flux variation of about $360\pm70\% $ and a comparatively
small J-band flux variation of $37\pm2\%$. By combining the atmospheric modeling results and the
day-night brightness-temperature variations, we derive a pressure-dependent temperature contrast.
We discuss the difference in the spectral features of SDSS1411-B and hot Jupiter WASP-43b, and the
lower-than-predicted day-night temperature contrast of J4111-BD. Our study provides the high-precision
observational constraints on the atmospheric structures of an irradiated brown dwarf at different
orbital phases.

Aims. To search for these rare objects, we study 32 Galactic O-type stars that were reported as SB1s
in the literature. In our sample we include Cyg X-1, which is known to host an accreting stellar-mass
BH, and HD 74194, a supergiant fast X-ray transient, in order to validate our methodology. The final
goal is to characterise the nature of the unseen companions to determine if they are MS stars, stripped
helium stars, triples, or compact objects such as neutron stars or stellar-mass BHs. Methods. After
measuring radial velocities and deriving orbital solutions for all the systems in our sample, we
performed spectral disentangling to extract putative signatures of faint secondary companions
from the composite spectra. We derived stellar parameters for the visible stars and estimated the
mass ranges of the secondary stars using the binary mass function. Variability observed in the photometric
TESS light curves was also searched for indications of the presence of putative companions, degenerate
or not. Results. In 17 of the 32 systems reported as SB1s, we extract secondary signatures, down to
mass ratios of ~0.15. For the 17 newly detected double-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB2s), we
derive physical properties of the individual components and discuss why they have not been detected
as such before. Among the remaining systems, we identify nine systems with possible NS or low-mass
MS companions. For Cyg X-1 and HD 130298, we are not able to extract any signatures for the companions,
and the minimum masses of their companions are estimated to be about 7Msun. Our simulations show
that secondaries with such a mass should be detectable from our dataset, no matter their nature:
MS stars, stripped helium stars or even triples. While this is expected for Cyg X-1, confirming our
methodology, our simulations also strongly suggest that HD 130298 could be another candidate to
host a stellar-mass BH.

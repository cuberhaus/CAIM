In the numerical modeling of the GRB afterglow, for simplicity, some approximations have been made
and different groups developed their own codes. A robust test of these modeling/approaches is challenging
because of the lack of directly measured physical parameters. Fortunately, the viewing angle inferred
from the afterglow modeling is widely anticipated to be the same as the inclination angle of the binary
neutron star (BNS) mergers that can be evaluated with the gravitational wave (GW) data. Therefore
in the future, it is possible to calibrate the afterglow modeling with the GW inclination angle measurements.
We take three methods, including both analytical estimations and direct simulations, to project
the uncertainties of the inclination angle measurements. For some BNS mergers accompanied with
electromagnetic counterparts detected in the O4/O5 runs of LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA/LIGO-India detectors,
we show that the inclination angle can be determined within an uncertainty of $\leq 0.1$ rad, supposing
that the Hubble constant is known with an accuracy of $\leq 3\%$. The off-axis GRB outflow will give
rise to afterglow emission and the most energetic ones may be detectable at the distance of $\sim
100-200$ Mpc even for a viewing angle of $\geq 0.3$ rad. Such events can thus serve as a robust test
of the afterglow modeling approach. We have also evaluated the prospect of resolving the so-called
Hubble constant tension with a single GW/GRB association event. We find out that a $\sim 3\%$ precision
Hubble constant is obtainable if the uncertainty of the viewing angle can be constrained to be within
$\sim 0.1$ rad, which is expected to be the case for some nearby ($\leq 250$ Mpc) bright/on-axis GRBs
with a well behavioured afterglow light curve displaying a clear achromatic break at early times.

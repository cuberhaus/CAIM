We investigate the performance of the Metacalibration shear calibration framework using simulated
imaging data for the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman) reference High-Latitude Imaging
Survey (HLIS). The weak lensing program of the Roman mission requires the mean weak lensing shear
estimate to be calibrated within about 0.03%. To reach this goal, we can test our calibration process
with various simulations and ultimately isolate the sources of residual shear biases in order to
improve our methods. In this work, we build on the Roman HLIS image simulation pipeline in Troxel
et al. 2021 to incorporate several new realistic processing-pipeline updates necessary to more
accurately process the imaging data and calibrate the shear. We show the first results of this calibration
for six deg$^2$ of the simulated reference HLIS using Metacalibration and compare these results
to measurements on more simple, faster Roman-like image simulations. In both cases, we neglect
the impact of blending of objects. We find that in the simplified simulations, Metacalibration
can calibrate shapes to be within $m=(-0.01\pm 0.10)$%. When applied to the current most-realistic
version of the simulations, the precision is much lower, with estimates of $m=(-1.34\pm 0.67)$%
for joint multi-band single-epoch measurements and $m=(-1.13\pm 0.60)$% for multi-band coadd
measurements. These results are all consistent with zero within 1-2$\sigma$, indicating we are
currently limited by our simulated survey volume. Further work on testing the shear calibration
methodology is necessary at higher precision to reach the level of the Roman requirements, in particular
in the presence of blending. Current results demonstrate, however, that the Metacalibration method
can work on undersampled space-based Roman imaging data at levels comparable to the requirements
of current weak lensing surveys.

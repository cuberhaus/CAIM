We investigate the fine-structure [C${\rm \scriptsize II}$] line at $158\,\mu$m as a molecular
gas tracer by analyzing the relationship between molecular gas mass ($M_{\rm mol}$) and [C${\rm
\scriptsize II}$] line luminosity ($L_{\rm [CII]}$) in 11,125 $z\simeq 6$ star-forming, main
sequence galaxies from the SIMBA simulations, with line emission modeled by S\'IGAME. Though most
($\sim 50-100\,\%$) of the gas mass in our simulations is ionized, the bulk ($> 50\,\%$) of the [C${\rm
\scriptsize II}$] emission comes from the molecular phase. We find a sub-linear (slope $0.78\pm
0.01$) $\log L_{\rm [CII]}-\log M_{\rm mol}$ relation, in contrast with the linear relation derived
from observational samples of more massive, metal-rich galaxies at $z \lesssim 6$. We derive a median
[C${\rm \scriptsize II}$]-to-$M_{\rm mol}$ conversion factor of $\alpha_{\rm [CII]} \simeq
18\,{\rm M_{\rm \odot}/L_{\rm \odot}}$. This is lower than the average value of $\simeq 30\,{\rm
M_{\rm \odot}/L_{\rm \odot}}$ derived from observations, which we attribute to lower gas-phase
metallicities in our simulations. Thus, a lower, luminosity-dependent, conversion factor must
be applied when inferring molecular gas masses from [C${\rm \scriptsize II}$] observations of
low-mass galaxies. For our simulations, [C${\rm \scriptsize II}$] is a better tracer of the molecular
gas than CO $J=1-0$, especially at the lowest metallicities, where much of the gas is 'CO-dark'.
We find that $L_{\rm [CII]}$ is more tightly correlated with $M_{\rm mol}$ than with star-formation
rate (${\rm SFR}$), and both the $\log L_{\rm [CII]}-\log M_{\rm mol}$ and $\log L_{\rm [CII]}-\log
{\rm SFR}$ relations arise from the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. Our findings suggest that $L_{\rm
[CII]}$ is a promising tracer of the molecular gas at the earliest cosmic epochs.

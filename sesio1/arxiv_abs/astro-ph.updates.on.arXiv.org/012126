Recent surveys show that wide ($>10^4$ AU) binaries and triples are abundant in the field. We study
the long-term evolution of wide hierarchical triple systems and the role played by the Galactic
tidal (GT) field. We find that when the timescales of the secular von-Ziepel-Lidov-Kozai and the
GT oscillations are comparable, triple evolution becomes chaotic which leads to extreme eccentricities.
Consequently, the close pericentre approaches of the inner-binary components lead to strong interactions,
mergers and collisions. We use a novel secular evolution code to quantify the key parameters and
carry out a population-synthesis study of low and intermediate-mass wide-orbit triples. We find
that in $\sim9\%$ of low-mass wide-triples the inner main-sequence binaries collide or tidally-inspiral
within $10\ \rm Gyr$, with direct collisions are $6$ times more likely to occur. For the intermediate-mass
sample, $\sim7.6\%$ of the systems merge or inspiral with roughly equal probabilities. We discuss
the relative fractions of different stellar merger/inspiral outcomes as a function of their evolutionary
stage (Main-Sequence, MS; Red-Giant, RG; or White-Dwarf, WD), their transient electromagnetic
signatures and the final products of the merger/inspiral. In particular, the rate of WD-WD direct-collisions
that lead to type-Ia Supernovae is comparable to other dynamical channels and accounts for at most
$0.1\%$ of the observed rate. RG inspirals provide a novel channel for the formation of eccentric
common-envelope-evolution binaries. The catalysis of mergers/collisions in triples due to GT
could explain a significant fraction, or even the vast majority, of blue-stragglers in the field,
produce progenitors for cataclysmic-variables, and give-rise to mergers/collisions of double-RG
binaries.

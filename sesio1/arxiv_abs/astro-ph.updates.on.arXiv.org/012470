HD 169142 is part of the class of (pre-)transitional protoplanetary disks showing multiple carbon
nanodust spectroscopic signatures (aromatic, aliphatic) dominating the infrared spectrum.
Precise constraints on the spatial distribution and properties of carbonaceous dust particles
are essential to understanding the physics of the disk. The HD 169142 disk is seen almost face-on
and thus offers a unique opportunity to study the dust radial evolution. We investigate the spatial
distribution and properties of the carriers of several dust aromatic emission features in the disk
across a broad spatial range (10-200 AU). We analysed imaging and spectroscopic observations in
the 8-12 microns range from VLT/VISIR, as well as adaptive optics spectroscopic observations in
the 3-4 microns range from VLT/NACO. The data probes the spatial evolution of the 3.3, 8.6, and 11.3
microns aromatic bands. To constrain the radial distribution of carbonaceous nano-grains, the
observations were compared to models using The Heterogeneous dust Evolution Model for Interstellar
Solids (THEMIS), integrated into the POLARIS radiative transfer code by calculating the thermal
and stochastic heating of sub-micrometer dust grains. Our data show predominant nano-particle
emission at all radii (resolution of about 0.1", 12 AU at 3 microns and 0.3", 35 AU at 10 microns) in
the HD 169142 disk. This unambiguously shows that carbonaceous nano-grains dominate radiatively
the infrared spectrum in most of the disk, as suggested by previous studies. In order to account for
both VISIR and NACO emission maps, we show the need for aromatic particles distributed within the
disk from the outermost regions to a radius of 20 AU, corresponding to the outer limit of the inner
cavity derived from previous observations. In the inner cavity, these aromatic particles might
be present but their abundance would then be significantly decreased.

We derive expressions for the survey-window convolved galaxy power spectrum in real space for a
full sky and deep redshift survey, but taking into account the geometrical lightcone effect. We
investigate the impact of using the standard mean redshift approximation as a function of survey
depth, and show that this assumption can lead to both an overall amplitude suppression and scale-dependent
error when compared to the `true' spectrum. However, we also show that by using a carefully chosen
`effective fixed-time', one can find a range of scales where the approximation to the full model
is highly accurate, but only on a more restricted set of scales. We validate the theory by constructing
dark matter and galaxy lightcone mock surveys from a large $N$-body simulation with a high cadence
of snapshots. We do this by solving the light cone equation exactly for every particle, where the
particle worldlines are obtained in a piecewise fashion with cubic interpolation between neighbouring
snapshots. We find excellent agreement between our measurements and the theory ($\sim \pm 5\%$)
over scales $(0.004 \ h \ {\rm Mpc}^{-1} \leq k \leq 0.54 \ h \ {\rm Mpc}^{-1})$ and for a variety of magnitude
limits. We also test how well the commonly used FKP weights affect the measurements, for various
choices of the fiducial power $P_0$ and apparent magnitude cuts. We find that including the weighting
scheme can boost the signal-to-noise ratio by factors of a few. Finally, we look to see how accurately
we can measure the turnover scale of the galaxy power spectrum $k_0$. Using the lightcone mocks we
show that one can detect the turnover scale with a probability $P \geq 95\%$ in an all-sky catalogue
limited to an apparent magnitude $m_{\rm lim}\sim 21$. We also show that the detection significance
would remain high for surveys with $m_{\rm lim}\sim22$ and $20\%$ sky coverage.

We present a Bayesian re-analysis of the sky-averaged 21-cm experimental data from SARAS2 using
nested sampling implemented with Polychord, spectrally smooth foreground modelling implemented
with maxsmooth, detailed systematic modelling and rapid signal emulation with globalemu. Our
analysis differs from previous analysis of the SARAS2 data through the use of a full Bayesian framework
and separate modelling of the foreground and non-smooth systematics present in the data. We use
the most up-to-date global signal models including Lyman-$\alpha$ and CMB heating and parameterised
by astrophysical parameters such as star formation efficiency, X-ray heating efficiency, minimal
virial circular velocity, CMB optical depth and the low energy cutoff of the X-ray spectral energy
distribution. We also consider models with an excess radio background above the CMB produced via
radio emission from early galaxies and parameterised by a radio production efficiency. A non-smooth
systematic is identified and modelled as both a frequency damped sinusoid introduced by the electronics
and separately from the sky. The latter is modulated by the total efficiency of the antenna and marginally
favoured by the data. We consider three models for the noise in the data with different frequency
dependencies. We find that the SARAS2 constraints on individual astrophysical parameters are
extremely weak however we identify classes of disfavoured signals. Specifically, we weakly disfavour
standard astrophysical models with high Lyman-$\alpha$ fluxes and generally weak heating and
more confidently disfavour exotic models with high Lyman-$\alpha$ fluxes, low X-ray efficiencies,
high radio production efficiencies in early galaxies and high CMB optical depths. We intend to follow
this work up with a similar analysis of the recently published SARAS3 data.

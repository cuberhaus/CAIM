Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are intense episodes of high-energy emission seen isotropically across
the sky and all through cosmic time. For decades, they have been broadly divided into `long'- and
`short'-duration bursts, lasting more or less than 2s, respectively, but it has been apparent for
several years that this dichotomy is imperfect. The split does not map directly to the two progenitor
channels that are known to produce GRBs -- the merger of compact objects (merger-GRBs) or the collapse
of massive stars (collapsar-GRBs). In particular, the merger population (typically short-duration)
also includes bursts with a short, hard $<$2s spike and subsequent longer, softer extended emission
(EE). There have also been examples of apparent short bursts in which supernova detections indicate
a collapsar origin. The recent discovery of a kilonova -- the radioactive glow of heavy elements
made in neutron star mergers -- in the 50s-duration GRB 211211A further complicates this picture,
demonstrating that mergers can drive GRBs with complex and long-lived light curves whose broad
spectral and temporal properties are consistent with the collapsar population. Here we present
detailed analysis of the high energy emission associated with GRB 211211A. We demonstrate that
the rapidly-evolving spectrum can be fit by purely synchrotron emission with both the peak and cooling
frequencies moving through the $\gamma$-ray band, down to the X-rays. This is the first time that
such spectral evolution has been demonstrated in a merger-GRB, and we show that it drives the extended
emission signature at late times. The remarkable consistency of these signatures across the population
suggests that GRB 211211A may provide a unifying blueprint for identifying long-duration GRBs
from mergers, potentially paving the way for strong diagnostics of the progenitor type.

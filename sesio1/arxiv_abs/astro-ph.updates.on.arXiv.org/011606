The mass ranges of meteors, imaged by electro-optical (EO) cameras and backscatter radar receivers,
for the most part do not overlap. Typical EO systems detect meteoroid masses down to 10$^{-5}$ kg
or roughly magnitude +2 meteors when using moderate field of view optics, un-intensified optical
components, and meteor entry velocities around 45 km/sec. This is near the high end of the mass range
of typical meteor radar observations. Having the same mass meteor measured by different sensor
wavelength bands would be a benefit in terms of calibrating mass estimations for both EO and radar.
To that end, the University of Western Ontario (UWO) has acquired and deployed a very low light imaging
system based on an electron-multiplying CCD camera technology. This embeds a very low noise, per
pixel intensifier chip in a cooled camera setup with various options for frame rate, region of interest
and binning. The EO system of optics and sensor was optimally configured to collect 32 frames per
second in a square field of view 14.7 degrees on a side, achieving a single-frame stellar limiting
magnitude of m$_G$ = +10.5. The system typically observes meteors of +6.5. A key development in this
pipeline has been the first true application of matched filter processing to process the faintest
meteors possible in the EMCCD system while also yielding high quality automated metric measurements
of meteor focal plane positions. With pairs of EMCCD systems deployed at two sites, triangulation
and high accuracy orbits are one of the many products being generated by this system. These measurements
will be coupled to observations from the Canadian Meteor Orbit Radar (CMOR) used for meteor plasma
characterization and the Canadian Automated Meteor Observatory (CAMO) high resolution mirror
tracking system.

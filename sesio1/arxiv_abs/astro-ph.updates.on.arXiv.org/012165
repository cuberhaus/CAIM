(abridged) Mass loss is a key parameter in the evolution of massive stars, with discrepancies between
theory and observations and with unknown importance of the episodic mass loss. To address this we
need increased numbers of classified sources stars spanning a range of metallicity environments.
We aim to remedy the situation by applying machine learning techniques to recently available extensive
photometric catalogs. We used IR/Spitzer and optical/Pan-STARRS, with Gaia astrometric information,
to compile a large catalog of known massive stars in M31 and M33, which were grouped in Blue, Red, Yellow,
B[e] supergiants, Luminous Blue Variables, Wolf-Rayet, and background galaxies. Due to the high
imbalance, we implemented synthetic data generation to populate the underrepresented classes
and improve separation by undersampling the majority class. We built an ensemble classifier using
color indices. The probabilities from Support Vector Classification, Random Forests, and Multi-layer
Perceptron were combined for the final classification. The overall weighted balanced accuracy
is ~83%, recovering Red supergiants at ~94%, Blue/Yellow/B[e] supergiants and background galaxies
at ~50-80%, Wolf-Rayets at ~45%, and Luminous Blue Variables at ~30%, mainly due to their small sample
sizes. The mixing of spectral types (no strict boundaries in their color indices) complicates the
classification. Independent application to IC 1613, WLM, and Sextans A galaxies resulted in an
overall lower accuracy of ~70%, attributed to metallicity and extinction effects. The missing
data imputation was explored using simple replacement with mean values and an iterative imputor,
which proved more capable. We also found that r-i and y-[3.6] were the most important features. Our
method, although limited by the sampling of the feature space, is efficient in classifying sources
with missing data and at lower metallicitites.

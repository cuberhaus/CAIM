The existence of possible early oceans in the northern hemisphere of Mars has been researched and
debated for decades. The nature of the early martian climate is still somewhat mysterious, but evidence
for one or more early oceans implies long-lasting periods of habitability. The primary evidence
supporting early oceans is a set of proposed remnant shorelines circling large fractions of the
planet. The features are thought to be older than 3.6 Ga and possibly as old as 4 Ga, which would make
them some of the oldest large-scale features still identifiable on the surface of Mars. One question
that has not been thoroughly addressed, however, is whether shorelines this old could survive modification
and destruction processes like impact craters, tectonics, volcanism, and hydrology in recognizable
form. Here we address one of these processes -- impact cratering -- in detail. We use standard crater
counting age models to generate synthetic, global populations of craters and intersect them with
hypothetical shorelines, tracking portions of the shoreline that are directly impacted. The oldest
shorelines (>= 4 Ga) are at least 70 % destroyed by direct impacts. Shorelines of any age >3.6 Ga are
dissected into relatively short, discontinuous segments no larger than about 40 km when including
the effects of craters larger than 100 m in radius. When craters smaller than 500 m in radius are excluded,
surviving segment lengths can be as large as ~1000 km. The oldest shorelines exhibit fractal structure
after impacts, presenting as a discontinuous collection of lines over a range of scales. If the features
are truly shorelines, high-resolution studies should find similar levels of destruction and discontinuity.
However, our results indicate that observing shorelines as old as 4 Ga, should they exist, is a significant
challenge and raises questions about prior mapping efforts.

A fundamental requirement for reionizing the Universe is that a sufficient fraction of the ionizing
photons emitted by galaxies successfully escapes into the intergalactic medium. However, due
to the scarcity of high-redshift observational data, the sources driving reionization remain
uncertain. In this work we calculate the ionizing escape fractions ($f_{\rm esc}$) of reionization-era
galaxies from the state-of-the-art THESAN simulations, which combine an accurate radiation-hydrodynamic
solver AREPO-RT with the well-tested IllustrisTNG galaxy formation model to self-consistently
simulate both small-scale galaxy physics and large-scale reionization throughout a large patch
of the universe ($L_{\rm box} = 95.5\,\rm cMpc$). This allows the formation of numerous massive
haloes ($M_{\rm halo} \gtrsim 10^{10}\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$), which are often statistically underrepresented
in previous studies but are believed to be important to achieve rapid reionization. We find that
low-mass galaxies ($M_{\rm stars} \lesssim 10^7\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$) are the main drivers of reionization
above $z \gtrsim 7$, while high-mass galaxies ($M_{\rm stars} \gtrsim 10^8\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$)
dominate the escaped ionizing photon budget at lower redshifts. The variation in halo escape fractions
decreases for higher-mass haloes, which can be understood from the more settled galactic structure,
SFR stability, and fraction of sightlines within each halo significantly contributing to the escaped
flux. We show that dust is capable of reducing the escape fractions of massive galaxies, but the impact
on the global $f_{\rm esc}$ depends on the dust model. Finally, AGN are unimportant for reionization
in THESAN and their escape fractions are lower than stellar ones due to being located near the centres
of galaxy gravitational potential wells.

High-resolution spectroscopic surveys of the Milky Way have entered the Big Data regime and have
opened avenues for solving outstanding questions in Galactic archaeology. However, exploiting
their full potential is limited by complex systematics, whose characterization has not received
much attention in modern spectroscopic analyses. In this work, we present a novel method to disentangle
the component of spectral data space intrinsic to the stars from that due to systematics. Using functional
principal component analysis on a sample of $18,933$ giant spectra from APOGEE, we find that the
intrinsic structure above the level of observational uncertainties requires ${\approx}$10 functional
principal components (FPCs). Our FPCs can reduce the dimensionality of spectra, remove systematics,
and impute masked wavelengths, thereby enabling accurate studies of stellar populations. To demonstrate
the applicability of our FPCs, we use them to infer stellar parameters and abundances of 28 giants
in the open cluster M67. We employ Sequential Neural Likelihood, a simulation-based Bayesian inference
method that learns likelihood functions using neural density estimators, to incorporate non-Gaussian
effects in spectral likelihoods. By hierarchically combining the inferred abundances, we limit
the spread of the following elements in M67: $\mathrm{Fe} \lesssim 0.02$ dex; $\mathrm{C} \lesssim
0.03$ dex; $\mathrm{O}, \mathrm{Mg}, \mathrm{Si}, \mathrm{Ni} \lesssim 0.04$ dex; $\mathrm{Ca}
\lesssim 0.05$ dex; $\mathrm{N}, \mathrm{Al} \lesssim 0.07$ dex (at 68% confidence). Our constraints
suggest a lack of self-pollution by core-collapse supernovae in M67, which has promising implications
for the future of chemical tagging to understand the star formation history and dynamical evolution
of the Milky Way.

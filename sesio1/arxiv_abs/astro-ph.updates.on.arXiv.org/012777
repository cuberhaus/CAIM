We present a rich, multiwavelength, multiscale database built around the PHANGS-ALMA CO$\,$(2-1)
survey and ancillary data. We use this database to present the distributions of molecular cloud
populations and sub-galactic environments in 80 PHANGS galaxies, to characterize the relationship
between population-averaged cloud properties and host galaxy properties, and to assess key timescales
relevant to molecular cloud evolution and star formation. We show that PHANGS probes a wide range
of kpc-scale gas, stellar, and star formation rate (SFR) surface densities, as well as orbital velocities
and shear. The population-averaged cloud properties in each aperture correlate strongly with
both local environmental properties and host galaxy global properties. Leveraging a variable
selection analysis, we find that the kpc-scale surface densities of molecular gas and SFR tend to
possess the most predictive power for the population-averaged cloud properties. Once their variations
are controlled for, galaxy global properties contain little additional information, which implies
that the apparent galaxy-to-galaxy variations in cloud populations are likely mediated by kpc-scale
environmental conditions. We further estimate a suite of important timescales from our multiwavelength
measurements. The cloud-scale free-fall time and turbulence crossing time are ${\sim}5{-}20$
Myr, comparable to previous cloud lifetime estimates. The timescales for orbital motion, shearing,
and cloud-cloud collisions are longer, ${\sim}100$ Myr. The molecular gas depletion time is $1{-}3$
Gyr and shows weak to no correlations with the other timescales in our data. We publish our measurements
online and expect them to have broad utility to future studies of molecular clouds and star formation.

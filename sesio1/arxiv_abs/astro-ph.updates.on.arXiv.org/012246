To evaluate the role of radio activity in galaxy evolution, we designed a large archival CO survey
of radio galaxies (RGs) to determine their molecular gas masses at different epochs. We used a sample
of 120 RGs representative of the NVSS 1.4GHz survey, when flux limited at 0.4Jy. Of those, 66 galaxies
belonged to the ALMA Radio-source Catalogue (ARC) of calibrators and had spectral window tunings
around CO (1-0), (2-1), (3-2), or (4-3). We reduced their ALMA data, determined their H2 mass contents,
and combined the results with similar results for the remaining 54 galaxies from the literature.
We found that, while at all epochs the majority of RGs have undetectable reservoirs, there is a rapid
increase in the H2 mass content of the CO-detected RGs with z. At 1<z<2.5, 1/4 of the RGs have at least
as much molecular gas as simulations would indicate for a typical halo mass of that epoch. These galaxies
plausibly have 'normal' or even starbursty hosts. Taking into account the completeness correction
of the sample, we created the corresponding H2 mass functions at 0.005<z<0.3 and 1<z<2.5. The local
mass function reveals that the number density of low-z RGs with detectable molecular gas reservoirs
is only a little lower (a factor of ~4) than that of type 1 and 2 AGN in simulations. At 1<z<2.5, there
is a significant decrease in the number density of high-z RGs due to the rarity of bright radio galaxies.
An estimate for the missing faint RGs would, nonetheless, bring populations close again. Finally,
we find that the volume density of molecular gas locked up in the brightest 1/5000-1/7000 RGs is similar
in the examined z bins. This result likely indicates that the inflow rate on one hand and the star-formation
depletion rate plus the jet-driven expulsion rate on the other hand counteract each other in the
most luminous RGs of each epoch.

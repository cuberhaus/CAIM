We study the properties and the origin of the radio emission in the most luminous early-type galaxies
(ETGs) in the nearby Universe (MK<-25, recession velocity < 7,500 km/s) as seen by the 150 MHz Low-Frequency
ARray (LOFAR) observations. LOFAR images are available for 188 of these giant ETGs (gETGs) and 146
(78%) of them are detected above a typical luminosity of ~10E21 W/Hz. They show a large spread in power,
reaching up to ~10E26 W/Hz. We confirm a positive link between the stellar luminosity of gETGs and
their median radio power, the detection rate, and the fraction of extended sources. About two-thirds
(91) of the detected gETGs are unresolved, with sizes <4 kpc, confirming the prevalence of compact
radio sources in local sources. Forty-six gETGs show extended emission on scales ranging from 4
to 340 kpc, at least 80% of which have a FRI class morphology. Based on the morphology and spectral
index of the extended sources, ~30% of them might be remnant or restarted sources but further studies
are needed to confirm this. Optical spectroscopy (available for 44 gETGs) indicates that for seven
of them the nuclear gas is ionized by young stars suggesting a contribution to their radio emission
from star forming regions. Their radio luminosities correspond to a star formation rate (SFR) in
the range 0.1-8 Msun/yr and a median specific SFR of 0.8x10E-12 yr-1. The gas flowing toward the center
of gETGs can accrete onto the supermassive black hole but also stall at larger radii and form new stars,
an indication that feedback does not completely quench star formation. The most luminous gETGs
(25 galaxies with MK < -25.8) are all detected at 150 MHz however they are not all currently turned
on: at least four of them are remnant sources and at least one is likely powered by star formation.

The [CII] 158$~\mu$m emission line represents so far one of the most profitable tools for the investigation
of the high-redshift galaxies in the early Universe. Being one of the brightest cooling lines in
the rest-frame far-infrared regime of star-forming galaxies, it has been successfully exploited
as a tracer of star-formation rate (SFR) in local sources. The picture is more complex at higher redshifts,
where its usability in this context is still under investigation. Recent results from the ALMA Large
Program to INvestigate [CII] at Early times (ALPINE) survey suggest that there is no (or weak) evolution
of the L$\mathrm{_{[CII]}}$-SFR relation up to $z\sim6$ but their reliability is hampered by the
presence of a large population of [CII] non-detected galaxies. In this work, we characterize the
population of [CII] non-detections in ALPINE. By stacking their ALMA spectra, we obtain a signal
detected at $\sim5.1\sigma$, resulting in a [CII] luminosity of $\mathrm{log(L_\mathrm{[CII]}}/\mathrm{L_{\odot}})$
$\sim7.8$. When combining this value with those from the [CII] detections, we find a $\mathrm{L_{[CII]}}$-SFR
relation with a slope $b=1.14\pm0.11$, in agreement within the uncertainties both with the linear
relation found in the local Universe, and with the previous findings from ALPINE at $z\sim5$. This
suggests that the [CII] line can be considered a good tracer of star formation up to the distant Universe.
Finally, we show that the galaxies of our sample that most deviate from the observed L$_\mathrm{[CII]}$-SFR
relation could suffer from a less precise redshift estimation, perhaps artificially reducing
their [CII] luminosity. In this respect, we claim that there is no evidence in favour of a deficit
of [CII] content in high-z galaxies, in contrast with earlier studies.

Primordial magnetic fields can change the recombination history of the universe by inducing clumping
in the baryon density at small scales. They were recently proposed as a candidate model to relieve
the Hubble tension. We investigate the consistency of the constraints on a clumping factor parameter
$b$ in a simplistic model, using the latest CMB data from Planck, ACT DR4 and SPT-3G 2018. For the combined
CMB data alone, we find no evidence for clumping being different from zero, though when adding a prior
on $H_0$ based on the latest distance-ladder analysis of the SH0ES team, we report a weak detection
of $b$. Our analysis of simulated datasets shows that ACT DR4 has more constraining power with respect
to SPT-3G 2018 due to the degeneracy breaking power of the TT band powers (not included in SPT). Simulations
also suggest that the TE,EE power spectra of the two datasets should have the same constraining power.
However, the ACT DR4 TE,EE constraint is tighter than expectations, while the SPT-3G 2018 one is
looser. While this is compatible with statistical fluctuations, we explore systematic effects
which may account for such deviations. Overall, the ACT results are only marginally consistent
with Planck or SPT-3G, at the $2-3\sigma$ level within $\Lambda$CDM+$b$ and $\Lambda$CDM, while
Planck and SPT-3G are in good agreement. Combining the CMB data together with BAO and SNIa provides
an upper limit of b<0.4 at 95\% c.l. (b<0.5 without ACT). Adding a SH0ES-based prior on the Hubble
constant gives $b = 0.31^{+0.11}_{-0.15}$ and $H_0=69.28 \pm 0.56$ km/s/Mpc ($b = 0.41^{+0.14}_{-018}$
and $H_0=69.70 \pm 0.63$ km/s/Mpc without ACT). Finally, we forecast constraints on $b$ for the
full SPT-3G survey, Simons Observatory, and CMB-S4, finding improvements by factors of 1.5 (2.7
with Planck), 5.9 and 7.8, respectively, over Planck alone.

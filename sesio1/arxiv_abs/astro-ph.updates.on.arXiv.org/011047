We study how stellar rotation curves (RCs) of galaxies are correlated on average with morphology
and stellar mass ($M_\mathrm{star}$) using the final release of Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV MaNGA
data. We use the visually assigned $T$-types for the morphology indicator, and adopt a functional
form for the RC that can model non-flat RCs at large radii. We discover that within the radial coverage
of the MaNGA data, the popularly known flat rotation curve at large radii applies only to the particular
classes of galaxies, i.e., massive late types ($T$-type $\geq1$, $M_\mathrm{star}\gtrsim10^{10.8}M_\odot$)
and S0 types ($T$-type$=-1$ or $0$, $M_\mathrm{star}\gtrsim10^{10.0}M_\odot$). The RC of late-type
galaxies at large radii rises more steeply as $M_\mathrm{star}$ decreases, and its slope increases
to about $+9$ km s$^{-1}$kpc$^{-1}$ at $M_\mathrm{star}\approx10^{9.7}M_\odot$. By contrast,
elliptical galaxies ($T$-type $\le-2$) have descending RCs at large radii. Their slope becomes
more negative as $M_\mathrm{star}$ decreases, and reaches as negative as $-15$ km s$^{-1}$kpc$^{-1}$
at $M_\mathrm{star}\approx10^{10.2}M_\odot$. We also find that the inner slope of the RC is highest
for elliptical galaxies with $M_\mathrm{star}\approx10^{10.5}M_\odot$, and decreases as $T$-type
increases or $M_\mathrm{star}$ changes away from $10^{10.5}M_\odot$. The velocity at the turnover
radius $R_t$ is higher for higher $M_\mathrm{star}$, and $R_t$ is larger for higher $M_\mathrm{star}$
and later $T$-types. We show that the inner slope of the RC is coupled with the central surface stellar
mass density, which implies that the gravitational potential of central regions of galaxies is
dominated by baryonic matter. With the aid of simple models for matter distribution, we discuss
what determines the shapes of RCs.

We present general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics (GRRMHD) simulations of super-Eddington
accretion flows around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) which may apply to tidal disruption events
(TDEs). We perform long duration ($t\geq81,200\, GM/c^3$) simulations which achieve mass accretion
rates $\gtrsim 11$ times the Eddington rate and produce thermal synchrotron spectra and images
of their jets. The jet reaches a maximum velocity of $v/c \approx 0.5-0.9$, but the density weighted
outflow velocity is $\sim0.2-0.35c$. Gas flowing beyond the funnel wall expands conically and
drives a strong shock at the jet head while variable mass ejection along the jet axis results in internal
shocks and dissipation. For a $T_i/T_e=1$ model, the radio/submillimeter spectra peak at $>100$
GHz and the luminosity increases with BH spin, exceeding $\sim 10^{41} \, \rm{erg\, s^{-1}}$ in
the brightest models. The emission is extremely sensitive to $T_i/T_e$ as some models show an order
of magnitude decrease in the peak frequency and up to four orders of magnitude decline in their radio/submillimeter
luminosity as $T_i/T_e$ approaches 20. Assuming a maximum VLBI baseline distance of $10 \ {\rm{G}}\lambda$,
230 GHz images of $T_i/T_e=1$ models shows that the jet head may be bright enough for its motion to
be captured with the EHT (ngEHT) at $D\lesssim110$ (180) Mpc at the $5\sigma$ significance level.
Resolving emission from internal shocks requires $D\lesssim45$ Mpc for both the EHT or ngEHT. The
5 GHz emission in each model is dimmer ($\lesssim10^{36} \ {\rm{erg\, s^{-1}}}$) than upper limits
placed on TDEs with no radio emission which suggests jets similar to our models may have gone undetected
in previous observations. Our models suggest that the ngEHT may be utilized for $>230$ GHz radio/submillimeter
followup of future TDEs.

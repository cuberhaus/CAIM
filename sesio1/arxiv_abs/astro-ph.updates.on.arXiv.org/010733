New-generation spectroscopic surveys of the Milky Way plane have been revealing the structure
of the interstellar medium, allowing the simultaneous study of dense structures from single star-forming
objects or systems to entire spiral arms. We present the catalogue of molecular clouds extracted
from the $^{13}$CO(1-0) data cubes of the Forgotten Quadrant Survey, which mapped the Galactic
plane in the range 220\deg<l<240\deg, and -2.5\deg<b<0\deg in $^{12}$CO(1-0) and $^{13}$CO(1-0).The
catalogue contains 87 molecular clouds for which the main physical parameters such as area, mass,
distance, velocity dispersion, and virial parameter were derived. These structures are overall
less extended and less massive than the molecular clouds identified in the $^{12}$CO(1-0) data-set
because they trace the brightest and densest part of the $^{12}$CO(1-0) clouds. Conversely, the
distribution of aspect ratio, equivalent spherical radius, velocity dispersion, and virial parameter
in the two catalogues are similar. The mean value of the mass surface density of molecular clouds
is 87$\pm$55 M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$ and is almost constant across the galactocentric radius, indicating
that this parameter, which is a proxy of star formation, is mostly affected by local conditions.In
data of the Forgotten Quadrant Survey, we find a good agreement between the total mass and velocity
dispersion of the clouds derived from $^{12}$CO(1-0) and $^{13}$CO(1-0). This is likely because
in the surveyed portion of the Galactic plane, the H$_2$ column density is not particularly high,
leading to a CO emission with a not very high optical depth. This mitigates the effects of the different
line opacities between the two tracers on the derived physical parameters. This is a common feature
in the outer Galaxy, but our result cannot be readily generalised to the entire Milky Way.

The anomalously large radii of highly-irradiated gaseous exoplanets has long been a mystery. One
mechanism suggested as a solution for hot Jupiters is the heating of the deep atmosphere via the vertical
advection of potential temperature resulting in an increased internal entropy. Here we intend
to explore if this mechanism can also explain the observed brown dwarf radii trend: a general increase
in radius with irradiation, with an exception for highly-irradiated brown dwarfs orbiting white
dwarfs. We use a 3D GCM, DYNAMICO, to run a series of long-timescale models of the atmospheres of Kepler-13Ab,
KELT-1b, and SDSS1411B. These models allow us to explore not only if a stable advective adiabat can
develop, but also the associated dynamics. We find that our models fall into two distinct regimes:
Kepler-13Ab and KELT-1b both show signs of significant deep heating and hence maintain adiabats
that are hotter than 1D models predict. On the other hand, SDSS1411B exhibits a much weaker downward
heating profile which not only struggles to heat the interior under ideal conditions, but is highly
sensitive to the presence of deep radiative dynamics. We find that the vertical advection of potential
temperature by large-scale atmospheric circulations represents a robust mechanism to explain
the trend of increasing inflation with irradiation, including the exception for highly irradiated
brown dwarfs orbiting white dwarfs. This can be understood as occurring due to the role that increasing
rotational influence plays on mid- to-high latitude advective dynamics. Furthermore, when paired
with a suitable parametrisation of the outer atmosphere irradiation profile, this mechanism alone
could potentially provide a complete explanation for the observed levels of inflation in our brown
dwarfs.

A new one-dimensional, inviscid, and vertically integrated disk model with prescribed infall
is presented. The flow is computed using a second-order shock-capturing scheme. Included are vertical
infall, radial infall at the outer radial boundary, radiative cooling, stellar irradiation, and
heat addition at the disk-surface shock. Simulation parameters are chosen to target the L1527 IRS
disk which has been observed using ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter Array). The results give an outer
envelope of radial infall and $u_\phi \propto 1/r$ which encounters a radial shock at $r_\mathrm{shock}
\sim 1.5\ \times$ the centrifugal radius ($r_\mathrm{c}$) across which the radial velocity is
greatly reduced and the gas temperature rises from a pre-shock value of $\approx 25$ K to $\approx
180$ K over a spatially thin region calculated using a separate shock structure code. At $r_\mathrm{c}$,
the azimuthal velocity $u_\phi$ transitions from being $\propto 1/r$ to being nearly Keplerian.
These results qualitatively agree with recent ALMA observations which indicate a radial shock
where SO is sublimated as well as a transition from a $u_\phi \sim 1/r$ region to a Keplerian inner
disk. However, in one set of observations, the position-velocity map of cyclic-C$_3$H$_2$, together
with a certain ballistic maximum velocity relation, has suggested that the radial shock coincides
with a ballistic centrifugal barrier, which places the shock at $r_\mathrm{shock} = 0.5 r_\mathrm{c}$,
i.e, inward of $r_\mathrm{c}$, rather than outward as given by our simulations. It is argued that
radial velocity plots from previous magnetic rotating-collapse simulations also indicate that
the radial shock is located outward of $r_\mathrm{c}$. The discrepancy with observations is analyzed
and discussed, but remains unresolved.

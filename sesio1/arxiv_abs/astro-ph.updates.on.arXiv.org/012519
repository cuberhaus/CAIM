We study the formation and destruction of the first molecules at the epochs of the Dark Ages and Cosmic
Dawn to evaluate the luminosity of the protogalaxy clumps (halos) in the molecular lines. The cosmological
recombination is described using the model of an effective three-level atom, while the chemistry
of the molecules is examined using the relevant basic kinetic equations. We then studied the effect
of collisional and radiative excitation of molecules on the intensity of molecular emission in
both warm and hot halos. Using the Planck data on the reionization of the intergalactic medium at
z~6-8, we evaluated the upper limits of the light energy density for four models of thermal light
from the first sources that appeared in the Cosmic Dawn epoch. Assuming that in the halos, the light
energy density may essentially be even higher, we estimated the impact of the light from the first
sources on the formation and destruction of the first molecules. We show that the molecules H2 and
HD are destroyed by photodissociation processes shortly before the full reionization in the inter-halo
medium, in the medium of both types of halos and for all models of the first light. At the same time,
the number density of helium hydride ions, HeH+, shows essentially more complicated dependences
on the kinetic temperature of halos and the models of the first light. Furthermore, we estimated
the differential brightness temperature of the individual halo in the rotational lines of H2, HD
and HeH+ molecules at redshifts corresponding to the Dark Ages and Cosmic Dawn epochs. It does not
exceed the microkelvin, but its detection may be an important source of information about the physical
processes taking place at the beginning of the formation of the first stars and galaxies at the epochs
of the Dark Ages and Cosmic Dawn.

Existence of subsurface oceans on the satellites of the giant planets and Trans-Neptunian objects
has been predicted for some time. Oceans on icy worlds exert a considerable influence on the dynamics
of the ice-ocean system and, because of the astrobiological potential, represent an important
objective for future missions. The Pluto-Charon system is representative of an icy moon orbiting
a dwarf planet formed from the remnants of a giant impact. Evolution of icy moons is primarily controlled
by the mode and efficiency of heat transfer through the outer ice shell, which is influenced by the
presence of impurities, by tidal dissipation in the ice shell, and the radioactive element budget
in the core. Previous studies on the evolution of the Pluto-Charon system considered either only
the thermal or the tidal evolution, and in the cases where both were considered, the important effect
of the presence of impurities in the liquid oceans was not addressed. We consider the joint tidal-thermal
evolution of the system by combining a comprehensive tidal model that incorporates a viscoelastic
tidal response with a parameterized convection model developed for icy worlds. This approach enables
an extensive analysis of the conditions required for formation and maintenance of subsurface liquid
oceans to the present. Our results show that because of fast circularization and synchronization
of the orbits, tidal heating is only important during the early stages of evolution (<1 Myr). We test
the sensitivity of our results to the initial orbital and thermal parameters. In all the cases, oceans
on Pluto are always predicted to remain liquid to the present, ranging from 40 km to 150-km thick,
whereas oceans on Charon have solidified. This is supported by New Horizons observations of extensional
faults on Pluto and both extensional and compressional faults on Charon.

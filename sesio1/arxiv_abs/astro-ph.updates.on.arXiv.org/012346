The driving of turbulence in galaxies is deeply connected with the physics of feedback, star formation,
outflows, accretion, and radial transport in disks. The velocity dispersion of gas in galaxies
therefore offers a promising observational window into these processes. However, the relative
importance of each of these mechanisms remains controversial. In this work we revisit the possibility
that turbulence on galactic scales is driven by the direct impact of accreting gaseous material
on the disk. We measure this effect in a disk-like star-forming galaxy in IllustrisTNG, using the
high-resolution cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulation TNG50. We employ Lagrangian
tracer particles with a high time cadence of only a few Myr to identify accretion and other events,
such as star formation, outflows, and movement within the disk. The energies of particles as they
arrive in the disk are measured by stacking the events in bins of time before and after the event. The
average effect of each event is measured on the galaxy by fitting explicit models for the kinetic
and turbulent energies as a function of time in the disk. These measurements are corroborated by
measuring the cross-correlation of the turbulent energy in the different annuli of the disk with
other time series, and searching for signals of causality, i.e. asymmetries in the cross-correlation
across zero time lag. We find that accretion contributes to the large-scale turbulent kinetic energy
even if it is not the dominant driver of turbulence in this $\sim 5 \times 10^{9} M_\odot$ stellar
mass galaxy. Extrapolating this finding to a range of galaxy masses, we find that there are regimes
where energy from direct accretion may dominate the turbulent energy budget, particularly in disk
outskirts, galaxies less massive than the Milky Way, and at redshift $\sim 2$.

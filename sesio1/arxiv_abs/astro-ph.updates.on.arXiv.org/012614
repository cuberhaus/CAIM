Recent studies have reported the detection of the galactic stellar halo wake and dipole triggered
by the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), mirroring the corresponding response from dark matter (DM).
These studies open up the possibility of adding constraints on the global mass distribution of the
Milky Way (MW), and even on the nature of DM itself, with current and upcoming stellar surveys reigniting
the discussion on response modes in dynamical friction. However, the simulation of such features
remains computationally challenging. We used a collisionless Boltzmann equation (CBE)+Poisson
solver based on an existing method from the literature. We investigated the density and velocity
response modes in simulations of Galactic-type DM halos accreting LMC-sized satellites, including
the dependence on the halo density profile. We successfully captured both the local wake and the
global over- and underdensity induced in the host halo. We also captured the velocity response.
In line with previous studies, we find that the code can reproduce the core formation in the cuspy
profile and the satellite core stalling. The angular power spectrum (APS) response is shown to be
sensitive to each density profile. The cored Plummer density profile seems the most responsive,
displaying a richness of modes. At the end of the simulation, the central halo acquires cylindrical
rotation. The CBE description makes it tenable to capture the response modes with a better handling
of noise in comparison to traditional N-body simulations. Hence, given a certain noise level, BPM
has a lower computational cost than N-body simulations, making it feasible to explore large parameter
sets. We anticipate that stellar spheroids in the MW or external galaxies could show central cylindrical
rotation if they underwent a massive accretion event. The code can be adjusted to include a variety
of DM physics.

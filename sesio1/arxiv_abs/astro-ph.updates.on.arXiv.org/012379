Theories on the origins of life propose that early cell membranes were synthesized from amphiphilic
molecules simpler than phospholipids such as fatty alcohols. The discovery in the interstellar
medium (ISM) of ethanolamine, the simplest phospholipid head group, raises the question whether
simple amphiphilic molecules are also synthesized in space. We investigate whether precursors
of fatty alcohols are present in the ISM. For this, we have carried out a spectral survey at 7, 3, 2 and
1 mm toward the Giant Molecular Cloud G+0.693-0.027 located in the Galactic Center using the IRAM
30m and Yebes 40m telescopes. Here, we report the detection in the ISM of the primary alcohol n-propanol
(in both conformers Ga-n-C3H7OH and Aa-n-C3H7OH), a precursor of fatty alcohols. The derived column
densities of n-propanol are (5.5+-0.4)x10^13 cm^-2 for the Ga conformer and (3.4+-0.3)x10^13
cm^-2 for the Aa conformer, which imply molecular abundances of (4.1+-0.3)x10^-10 for Ga-n-C3H7OH
and of (2.5+-0.2)x10^-10 for Aa-n-C3H7OH. We also searched for the AGa conformer of n-butanol (AGa-n-C4H9OH)
without success yielding an upper limit to its abundance of <4.1x10^-11. The inferred CH3OH:C2H5OH:C3H7OH:C4H9OH
abundance ratios go as 1:0.04:0.006:<0.0004 toward G+0.693-0.027, i.e. they decrease roughly
by one order of magnitude for increasing complexity. We also report the detection of both syn and
anti conformers of vinyl alcohol, with column densities of (1.11+-0.08)x10^14 cm^-2 and (1.3+-0.4)x10^13
cm^-2, and abundances of (8.2+-0.6)x10^-10 and (9.6+-3.0)x10^-11, respectively. The detection
of n-propanol, together with the recent discovery of ethanolamine in the ISM, opens the possibility
that precursors of lipids according to theories of the origin of life, could have been brought to
Earth from outer space.

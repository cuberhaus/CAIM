Atmospheric refraction modifies the apparent position of objects in the sky. We computed the lateral
translation that is to be considered for short-range applications, such as wavefront sensing and
meteor trajectories. We aim to calculate the lateral shift at each altitude and study its variation
according to meteorological conditions and the location of the observation site. We also pay special
attention to the chromatism of this lateral shift. We extracted the variation equations of refraction
from the geometric tracing of a light ray path. A numerical method and a dry atmosphere model allowed
us to numerically integrate the system of coupled equations. In addition to this, based on Taylor
expansions, we established three analytic approximations of the lateral shift, one of which is
the one already known in the literature. We compared the three approximations to the numerical solution.
All these estimators are included in a Python 3.2 package, which is available online. Using the numerical
integration estimator, we calculated the lateral shift values for any zenith angle including low
elevations. The shift is typically around 3 m at a zenith angle of 45{\deg}, 10 m at 65{\deg}, and even
300 m{\deg} at 85{\deg}. Next, the study of the variability of the lateral shift as a function of wavelength
shows differences of up to 2% between the visible and near infrared. The analysis of the errors of
each approximation shows the ranges of validity of the three estimators as a function of the zenith
angle. The flat Earth estimator achieves a relative error of less than 1% up to 55{\deg} while the
new extended second-order estimators improves this result up to 75{\deg}. The flat Earth estimator
is sufficient for applications where the zenith angle is below 55{\deg} but a refined estimator
is necessary to estimate meteor trajectories at low elevations.

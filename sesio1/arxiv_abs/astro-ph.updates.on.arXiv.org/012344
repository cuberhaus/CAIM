The characterization of the dynamical state of galaxies up to z~7 is crucial for constraining the
mechanisms driving the mass assembly in the early Universe. However, it is unclear whether the data
quality of current and future observations is sufficient to perform a solid dynamical analysis.
This paper defines the angular resolution and S/N required for a robust characterization of the
dynamical state of galaxies up to the EoR. The final aim is to help design spatially-resolved surveys
targeting emission lines of primeval galaxies. We investigate the [CII]-158um emission from z~6-7
LBGs from the SERRA cosmological simulation, covering a range of dynamical states: from disks to
major mergers. We create ALMA mock observations with various data quality and apply the kinematic
classification methods used in the literature. These tests allow us to quantify the performances
of such methods as a function of angular resolution and S/N. We find that barely-resolved observations
do not allow the correct dynamical characterization of a galaxy, resulting in the misclassification
of all disks in our sample. However, even when using spatially-resolved observations with data
quality typical of high-z galaxies, the standard kinematic classification methods, based on the
analysis of the moment maps, fail to distinguish a merger from a disk. The high angular resolution
and S/N needed to apply these standard methods successfully can be achieved with current data only
for a handful of bright galaxies. We propose a new classification method, called PVsplit, that quantifies
the asymmetries and morphological features in position-velocity diagrams using three empirical
parameters. We test PVsplit on our mock data concluding that it can predict whether a galaxy is a disk
or a merger provided that S/N $\gtrsim10$, and the major axis is covered by $\gtrsim3$ independent
resolution elements.

The TRAPPIST-1 Habitable Atmosphere Intercomparison (THAI) project was initiated to compare
3D climate models that are commonly used for predicting theoretical climates of habitable zone
extrasolar planets. One of the core models studied as part of THAI is ExoCAM, an independently curated
exoplanet branch of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Earth System
Model (CESM) version 1.2.1. ExoCAM has been used for studying atmospheres of terrestrial extrasolar
planets around a variety of stars. To accompany the THAI project and provide a primary reference,
here we describe ExoCAM and what makes it unique from standard configurations of CESM. Furthermore,
we also conduct a series of intramodel sensitivity tests of relevant moist physical tuning parameters
while using the THAI protocol as our starting point. A common criticism of 3D climate models used
for exoplanet modeling is that cloud and convection routines often contain free parameters that
are tuned to the modern Earth, and thus may be a source of uncertainty in evaluating exoplanet climates.
Here, we explore sensitivities to numerous configuration and parameter selections, including
a recently updated radiation scheme, a different cloud and convection physics package, different
cloud and precipitation tuning parameters, and a different sea ice albedo. Improvements to our
radiation scheme and the modification of cloud particle sizes have the largest effect on global
mean temperatures, with variations up to ~10 K, highlighting the requirement for accurate radiative
transfer and the importance of cloud microphysics for simulating exoplanetary climates. However
for the vast majority of sensitivity tests, climate differences are small. For all cases studied,
intramodel differences do not bias general conclusions regarding climate states and habitability.

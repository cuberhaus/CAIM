As of October 2021 (Period 108), the European Southern Observatory (ESO) offers a new mode of the
ESPRESSO spectrograph designed to use the High Resolution grating with 4x2 binning (spatial by
spectral; HR42 mode) with the specific objective of observing faint targets with a single Unit Telescope
at Paranal. We validated the new HR42 mode using four hours of on-target observations of the quasar
J0003-2603, known to host an intervening metal-poor absorber along the line of sight. The capabilities
of the ESPRESSO HR42 mode (resolving power R~137 000) were evaluated by comparing to a UVES spectrum
of the same target with a similar integration time but lower resolving power (R~48 000). For both
data sets we tested the ability to decompose the velocity profile of the intervening absorber using
Voigt profile fitting and extracted the total column densities of CIV, NI, SiII, AlII, FeII, and
NiII. With ~3x the resolving power and ~2x lower S/N for a nearly equivalent exposure time, the ESPRESSO
data is able to just as accurately characterize the individual components of the absorption lines
as the comparison UVES data, but has the added bonus of identifying narrower components not detected
by UVES. For UVES to provide similar spectral resolution (R>100 000; 0.3'' slit) and the broad wavelength
coverage of ESPRESSO, the Exposure Time Calculator (ETC) supplied by ESO estimates 8 hrs of exposure
time spread over two settings; requiring double the time investment than that of ESPRESSO's HR42
mode whilst not properly sampling the UVES spectral resolution element. Thus ESPRESSO's HR42 mode
offers nearly triple the resolving power of UVES (0.8'' slit to match typical ambient conditions
at Paranal) and provides more accurate characterization of quasar absorption features for an equivalent
exposure time.

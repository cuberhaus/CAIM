Spectroscopic multiplicity surveys of O stars in young clusters and OB associations have revealed
that a large portion ($\sim$ 70%) of these massive stars (M$_{i}$ $\gt$ 15 $M_{\odot}$) belong to
close and short-period binaries (physical separation d $\lt$few au). Despite the recent and significant
progress, the formation mechanisms leading to such close massive multiple systems remain to be
elucidated. As a result, young massive close binaries (or higher-order multiple systems) are unique
laboratories to figure out the pairing mechanism of high-mass stars. We present the first VLTI/GRAVITY
observations of six young O stars in the M17 star-forming region ($\lesssim$ 1 Myr) and two additional
foreground stars. From the interferometric model fitting of visibility amplitudes and closure
phases, we search for companions and measure their positions and flux ratios. Combining the resulting
magnitude difference with atmosphere models and evolutionary tracks, we further constrain the
masses of the individual components. All of the six high-mass stars are in multiple systems, leading
to a multiplicity fraction (MF) of 100%, yielding a 68% confidence interval of 94-100%. We detect
a total number of 9 companions with separations up to 120 au. Including previously identified spectroscopic
companions, the companion fraction of the young O stars in our sample reaches 2.3$\pm$0.6. The derived
masses span a wide range from 2.5 to 50 $M_{\odot}$, with a great tendency towards high-mass companions.
While based on a modest sample, our results clearly indicate that the origin of the high degree of
multiplicity is rooted in their star formation mechanism. No clear evidence for one of the competing
concepts of massive star formation (core accretion or competitive accretion) could be found. However,
our results are compatible with migration as a scenario for the formation of close massive binaries.

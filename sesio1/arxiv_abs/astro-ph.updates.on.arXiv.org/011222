MeerKAT's large number of antennas, spanning 8 km with a densely packed 1 km core, create a powerful
instrument for wide-area surveys, with high sensitivity over a wide range of angular scales. The
MeerKAT Galaxy Cluster Legacy Survey (MGCLS) is a programme of long-track MeerKAT L-band (900-1670
MHz) observations of 115 galaxy clusters, observed for $\sim$6-10 hours each in full polarisation.
The first legacy product data release (DR1), made available with this paper, includes the MeerKAT
visibilities, basic image cubes at $\sim$8" resolution, and enhanced spectral and polarisation
image cubes at $\sim$8" and 15" resolutions. Typical sensitivities for the full-resolution MGCLS
image products are $\sim$3-5 {\mu}Jy/beam. The basic cubes are full-field and span 4 deg^2. The
enhanced products consist of the inner 1.44 deg^2 field of view, corrected for the primary beam.
The survey is fully sensitive to structures up to $\sim$10' scales and the wide bandwidth allows
spectral and Faraday rotation mapping. HI mapping at 209 kHz resolution can be done at $0<z<0.09$
and $0.19<z<0.48$. In this paper, we provide an overview of the survey and DR1 products, including
caveats for usage. We present some initial results from the survey, both for their intrinsic scientific
value and to highlight the capabilities for further exploration with these data. These include
a primary beam-corrected compact source catalogue of $\sim$626,000 sources for the full survey,
and an optical/infrared cross-matched catalogue for compact sources in Abell 209 and Abell S295.
We examine dust unbiased star-formation rates as a function of clustercentric radius in Abell 209
and present a catalogue of 99 diffuse cluster sources (56 are new), some of which have no suitable
characterisation. We also highlight some of the radio galaxies which challenge current paradigms
and present first results from HI studies of four targets.

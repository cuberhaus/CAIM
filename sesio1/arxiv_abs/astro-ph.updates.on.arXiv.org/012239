The formation of clusters at sub-saturation densities constitutes an essential feature for a reliable
modelization of the nuclear matter equation of state (EoS). Phenomenological models that make
use of energy density functionals (EDFs) offer a convenient approach to account for the presence
of these bound states of nucleons when introduced as additional degrees of freedom. However, in
these models clusters dissolve, by construction, when the nuclear saturation density is approached
from below, revealing inconsistencies with recent findings that evidence the existence of short-range
correlations (SRCs) even at larger densities. In this work, within the EDF framework, a novel approach
is proposed to embed SRCs within a relativistic mean-field model with density dependent couplings.
This is realized through the introduction of suitable in-medium modifications of the cluster binding
energy shifts, which are responsible for describing the cluster dissolution. As a first exploratory
step, the example of a quasi-deuteron within the generalized relativistic density functional
approach is investigated. For the first time, suitable parameterizations of the cluster mass shift
at zero temperature are derived for all baryon densities. They are constrained by experimental
results for the effective deuteron fraction in nuclear matter near saturation and by microscopic
many-body calculations in the low-density limit. The strength of the deuteron-meson couplings
is assessed to be of crucial importance. The findings of the present study represent a first step
to improve the description of nuclear matter and its EoS at supra-saturation densities in EDFs by
considering correlations in an effective way. Novel effects on some thermodynamic quantities,
such as the matter incompressibility, the symmetry energy and its slope, are finally discerned
and discussed.

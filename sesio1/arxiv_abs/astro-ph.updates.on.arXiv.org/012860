We use a large N-body simulation to study the characteristic scales in the density gradient profiles
in and around halos with masses ranging from $10^{12}$ to $10^{15} h^{-1}{\rm M_\odot}$. We investigate
the profiles separately along the major (T_1) and minor (T_3) axes of the local tidal tensor and how
the characteristic scales depend on halo mass, formation time, and environment. We find two kinds
of prominent characteristic features in the gradient profiles, a deep `valley' and a prominent
`peak'. We use the Gaussian Process Regression to fit the gradient profiles and identify the local
extrema to determine the scales associate with these features. Around the valley, we identify three
types of distinct local minima, corresponding to caustics of particles orbiting around halos.
The appearance and depth of the three caustics depend significantly on the direction defined by
the local tidal field, formation time and environment of halos. The first caustic is located at a
radius r>0.8R_{200}, corresponding to the splashback feature, and is dominated by particles at
their first apocenter after infall. The second and third caustics, around 0.6R_{200} and 0.4R_{200}
respectively, can be determined reliably only for old halos. The first caustic is always the most
prominent feature along T_3, but may not be the case along T_1 or in azimuthally-averaged profiles,
suggesting that caution must be taken when using averaged profiles to investigate the splashback
radius. We find that the splashback feature is approximately isotropic when proper separations
are made between the first and the other caustics. We also identify a peak feature located at $\sim$
2.5R_{200} in the density gradient profile. This feature is the most prominent along T_1 and is produced
by mass accumulations from the structure outside halos. We also discuss the origins of these features
and their observational implications.

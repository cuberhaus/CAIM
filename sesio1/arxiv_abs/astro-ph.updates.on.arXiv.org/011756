Detection of the gravitational-wave events revealed that there are numerous population of the
black hole binaries which can merge within the age of the Universe. Although several formation channels
of such binaries are known, considerable theoretical uncertainties associated in each channel
defeats the robust prediction of how much each channel contributes to the total merger rate density.
Given that the time evolution of the merger rate density in some channels is (exactly or nearly) independent
of the BH masses, clarifying this feature from the observational data will shed some light on the
nature of the black hole binaries. Based on this motivation, we formulate the methodology to perform
the statistical test of whether the mass distribution of the black hole mergers evolves in time or
not by means of the hypothesis testing. Our statistical test requires neither a priori specification
of the mass distribution which is largely uncertain nor that of the time dependence of the merger
rate. We then apply it to the mock data for some concrete shapes of the merger rate density and show
that the proposed method rejects/(does not reject) the null hypothesis correctly for the large
sample size. We also investigate if the catalog of the gravitational-wave events obtained during
the LIGO-Virgo's third observing run has a large sample size enough to apply our hypothesis testing.
We find that the number of the events is too small to draw any statistical conclusion regarding our
test and the meaningful result of our hypothesis testing can be obtained only by the future detectors
having much better sensitivity. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our hypothesis
testing to determine from the (future) observational data whether the merger rate density evolves
in time independently of the BH masses or not.

The sub-Chandrasekhar mass double-detonation (DDet) scenario is a contemporary model for SNe
Ia. The donor star in the DDet scenario is expected to survive the explosion and to be ejected at the
high orbital velocity of a compact binary system. For the first time, we consistently perform 3D
hydrodynamical simulations of the interaction of SN ejecta with a helium (He) star companion within
the DDet scenario. We map the outcomes of 3D impact simulations into 1D stellar evolution codes and
follow the long-term evolution of the surviving He-star companions. Our main goal is to provide
the post-impact observable signatures of surviving He-star companions of DDet SNe Ia, which will
support the search for such companions in future observations. We find that our surviving He-star
companions become significantly overluminous for about 1e6 yr during the thermal re-equilibration
phase. After the star re-establishes thermal equilibrium, its observational properties are not
sensitive to the details of the ejecta-donor interaction. We apply our results to hypervelocity
star US 708, which is the fastest unbound star in our Galaxy, travelling with a velocity of about 1200
km/s, making it natural candidate for an ejected donor remnant of a DDet SN Ia. We find that a He-star
donor with an initial mass of >0.5 Msun is needed to explain the observed properties of US 708. Based
on our detailed binary evolution calculations, however, the progenitor system with such a massive
He-star donor cannot get close enough at the moment of SN explosion to explain the high velocity of
US 708. Instead, if US 708 is indeed the surviving He-star donor of a DDet SN~Ia, it would require the
entire pre-SN progenitor binary to travel at a velocity of about 400 km/s. It could, for example,
have been ejected from a globular cluster in the direction of the current motion of the surviving
donor star.

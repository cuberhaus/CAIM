The jets launched by actively accreting black holes are capable of launching several of the massive
(million or billion solar mass) molecular outflows observed in galaxies. These outflows could
suppress or enhance star formation in galaxies. To investigate the stability of clouds capable
to form stars in outflows, we modeled CO and HCO+ ALMA data of the galaxy IC5063, in which black-hole
jets impact molecular clouds. Using a radiative transfer code that self-consistently performs
astrochemical and thermal balance calculations based on the available gas heating sources, we
found that mechanical heating and cosmic ray (CR) heating are fully capable of individually reproducing
the data. In our best-fit model, CRs provide about 1/3rd of the dense gas heating at the radio lobes,
emphasizing the role of this often neglected mechanism in heating the gas and potentially generating
outflows. The gas temperature and density indicate that the jet passage leads to an increase of about
1 order of magnitude in the internal pressure Pi of molecular clouds (with Pi/k from 8*10^5 up to 7*10^6
K cm^-3), irrespective of the excitation mechanism. From the fluxes of [S II] and [N II] lines in VLT
MUSE data, the external pressure Pe of molecular clouds increases in several regions enough to exceed
Pi. This result leads us to conclude that we are observing the expansion of an ionized overpressurized
cocoon that compresses molecular clouds and that could lead to their collapse. Some jet-impacted
clouds, nonetheless, near pathways that the jet cleared have increased Pi and decreased Pe. They
are likely to undergo evaporation of their outer layers. Part of the evaporated layers could mass
load the outflow thanks to ram pressure from co-spatial ionized gas flows. The observed pressure
changes thus suggest that both star formation enhancement and suppression could simultaneously
occur.

Massive stars at low metallicity are among the main feedback agents in the early Universe and in present-day
star forming galaxies. When in binaries, these stars are potential progenitors of gravitational-wave
events. Knowledge of stellar masses is a prerequisite to understanding evolution and feedback
of low-metallicity massive stars. Using abundant spectroscopic and photometric measurements
of an outstandingly bright eclipsing binary, we compare its dynamic, spectroscopic, and evolutionary
mass estimates and develop a binary evolution scenario. We comprehensively studied the eclipsing
binary system, AzV 476, in the Small Magellanic Cloud. The light curve and radial velocities were
analyzed to obtain the orbital parameters. The photometric and spectroscopic data in the UV and
optical were analyzed using the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet model atmospheres. The obtained results are
interpreted using binary-evolution tracks. AzV 476 consists of an O4IV-III((f))p primary and
an O9.5:Vn secondary. Both components have similar current masses (~20 M$_{\odot}$) obtained
from both the orbital and spectroscopic analysis. The wind mass-loss rate of log($\dot{M}$/(M$_{\odot}$/yr))=-6.2
of the primary is a factor of ten higher than a recent empirical prescription for single O stars in
the SMC. Only close-binary evolution with mass transfer can reproduce the current stellar and orbital
parameters. The binary evolutionary model reveals that the primary has lost about half of its initial
mass and is already core helium burning. Our comprehensive analysis of AzV 476 yields a consistent
set of parameters and suggests previous case B mass transfer. The derived stellar masses agree within
their uncertainties. The moderate masses of AzV 476 underline the scarcity of bright massive stars
in the SMC. The core helium burning nature of the primary indicates that stripped stars might be hidden
among OB-type populations.

Protostellar jets are an important agent of star formation feedback, tightly connected with the
mass-accretion process. The history of jet formation and mass-ejection provides constraints
on the mass accretion history and the nature of the driving source. We want to characterize the time-variability
of the mass-ejection phenomena at work in the Class 0 protostellar phase, in order to better understand
the dynamics of the outflowing gas and bring more constraints on the origin of the jet chemical composition
and the mass-accretion history. We have observed the emission of the CO 2-1 and SO N_J=5_4-4_3 rotational
transitions with NOEMA, towards the intermediate-mass Class 0 protostellar system Cep E. The CO
high-velocity jet emission reveals a central component associated with high-velocity molecular
knots, also detected in SO, surrounded by a collimated layer of entrained gas. The gas layer appears
to accelerate along the main axis over a length scale delta_0 ~700 au, while its diameter gradually
increases up to several 1000au at 2000au from the protostar. The jet is fragmented into 18 knots of
mass ~10^-3 Msun, unevenly distributed between the northern and southern lobes, with velocity
variations up to 15 km/s close to the protostar, well below the jet terminal velocities. The knot
interval distribution is approximately bimodal with a scale of ~50-80yr close to the protostar
and ~150-200yr at larger distances >12''. The mass-loss rates derived from knot masses are overall
steady, with values of 2.7x10^-5 Msun/yr (8.9x10^-6 Msun/yr) in the northern (southern) lobe.
The interaction of the ambient protostellar material with high-velocity knots drives the formation
of a molecular layer around the jet, which accounts for the higher mass-loss rate in the north. The
jet dynamics are well accounted for by a simple precession model with a period of 2000yr and a mass-ejection
period of 55yr.

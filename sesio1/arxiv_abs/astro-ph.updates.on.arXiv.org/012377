AliCPT-1 is the first Chinese CMB experiment aiming for high precision measurement of Cosmic Microwave
Background B-mode polarization. The telescope, currently under deployment in Tibet, will observe
in two frequency bands centered at 90 and 150 GHz. We forecast the CMB lensing reconstruction, lensing-galaxy
as well as lensing-CIB (Cosmic Infrared Background) cross correlation signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) for AliCPT-1. We consider two stages with different integrated observation time, namely
"4 module*yr" (first stage) and "48 module*yr" (final stage). For lensing reconstruction, we use
three different quadratic estimators, namely temperature-only, polarization-only and minimum-variance
estimators, using curved sky geometry. We take into account the impact of inhomogeneous hit counts
as well as of the mean-field bias due to incomplete sky coverage. In the first stage, our results show
that the 150 GHz channel is able to measure the lensing signal at $15\sigma$ significance with the
minimum-variance estimator. In the final stage, the measurement significance will increase to
$31\sigma$. We also combine the two frequency data in the harmonic domain to optimize the SNR. Our
result show that the coadding procedure can significantly reduce the reconstruction bias in the
multiple range l>800. Thanks to the high quality of the polarization data in the final stage of AliCPT-1,
the EB estimator will dominate the lensing reconstruction in this stage. We also estimate the SNR
of cross-correlations between AliCPT-1 CMB lensing and other tracers of the large scale structure
of the universe. For its cross-correlation with DESI galaxies/quasars, we report the cross-correlation
SNR = 10-20 for the 4 redshift bins at 0.05<z<2.1. In the first stage, the total SNR is about $32$. In
the final stage, the lensing-galaxy cross-correlation can reach SNR=52.

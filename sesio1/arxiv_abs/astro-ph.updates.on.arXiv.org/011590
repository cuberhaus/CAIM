Understanding the geological modification processes on asteroids can provide information concerning
their surface history. Images of small asteroids from spacecraft show a depletion in terms of smaller
craters. Seismic shaking was considered to be responsible for crater erasure and the main driver
modifying the geology of asteroids via regolith convection or the Brazil nut effect. However, a
recent artificial impact experiment on the asteroid Ryugu by the Japanese Hayabusa2 mission revealed
minimal seismic activity. To investigate whether a seismic shaking model can reproduce the observed
crater record, the crater distribution on Ryugu was analyzed using crater production functions
under cohesionless conditions. Crater retention ages were estimated as a function of crater diameter
for Ryugu, Itokawa, Eros, and Bennu using the crater size-frequency distribution and crater production
function estimated for those asteroids. We found that the power-law indices "a" are inconsistent
with diffusion processes (e.g., seismic shaking, a=2). This result suggests that seismic shaking
models based on diffusion equations cannot explain the crater distribution on small asteroids.
Alternative processes include surface flows, possibly at the origin of geomorphological and spectral
features of Ryugu. We demonstrate that the vertical mixing of material at depths shallower than
1 m occurs over 10^3-10^5 yr by cratering and obliteration. The young surface age of Ryugu is consistent
with the slow space weathering that results from cratering, as suggested in previous studies. The
timescale (10^4-10^6 yr) required for resurfacing at depths of 2-4 m can be compared with the cosmic-ray
exposure ages of returned samples to constrain the distribution of impactors that collide with
Ryugu.

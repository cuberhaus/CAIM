We present Diffstar, a smooth parametric model for the in-situ star formation history (SFH) of galaxies.
Diffstar is distinct from conventional SFH models that are used to interpret the spectral energy
distribution (SED) of an observed galaxy, because our model is parametrized directly in terms of
basic features of galaxy formation physics. The Diffstar model assumes that star formation is fueled
by the accretion of gas into the dark matter halo of the galaxy, and at the foundation of Diffstar is
a parametric model for halo mass assembly, Diffmah. We include parametrized ingredients for the
fraction of accreted gas that is eventually transformed into stars, $\epsilon_{\rm ms},$ and for
the timescale over which this transformation occurs, $\tau_{\rm cons};$ some galaxies in Diffstar
experience a quenching event at time $t_{\rm q},$ and may subsequently experience rejuvenated
star formation. We fit the SFHs of galaxies predicted by the IllustrisTNG (TNG) and UniverseMachine
(UM) simulations with the Diffstar parameterization, and show that our model is sufficiently flexible
to describe the average stellar mass histories of galaxies in both simulations with an accuracy
of $\sim0.1$ dex across most of cosmic time. We use Diffstar to compare TNG to UM in common physical
terms, finding that: (i) star formation in UM is less efficient and burstier relative to TNG; (ii)
galaxies in UM have longer gas consumption timescales, $\tau_{\rm cons}$, relative to TNG; (iii)
rejuvenated star formation is ubiquitous in UM, whereas quenched TNG galaxies rarely experience
sustained rejuvenation; and (iv) in both simulations, the distributions of $\epsilon_{\rm ms}$,
$\tau_{\rm cons}$, and $t_{\rm q}$ share a common characteristic dependence upon halo mass, and
present significant correlations with halo assembly history. [Abridged]

We investigate the molecular gas content of z~6 quasar host galaxies using the IRAM / Northern Extended
Millimeter Array. We target the 3mm dust continuum, and the line emission from CO(6-5), CO(7-6),
[CI]2-1 in 10 infra-red-luminous quasars that have been previously studied in their 1mm dust continuum
and [CII] line emission. We detect CO(7-6) at various degrees of significance in all the targeted
sources, thus doubling the number of such detections in z~6 quasars. The 3mm to 1mm flux density ratios
are consistent with a modified black body spectrum with a dust temperature $T_{dust}$~47 K and an
optical depth $\tau_{\nu}$=0.2 at the [CII] frequency. Our study provides us with four independent
ways to estimate the molecular gas mass, $M_{H2}$, in the targeted quasars. This allows us to set
constraints on various parameters used in the derivation of molecular gas mass estimates, such
as the mass per luminosity ratios $\alpha_{CO}$ and $\alpha_{[CII]}$, the gas-to-dust ratio $\delta_{g/d}$,
and the carbon abundance [C]/H2. Leveraging either on the dust, CO, [CI], or [CII] emission yields
mass estimates of the entire sample in the range $M_{H2}$~$10^{10}$ to $10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$.
We compare the observed luminosities of dust, [CII], [CI], and CO(7-6) with predictions from photo-dissociation
and X-ray dominated regions. We find that the former provide better model fits to our data, assuming
that the bulk of the emission arises from dense ($n_H>10^4$ cm$^{-3}$) clouds with a column density
$N_{H}$~$10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$, exposed to a radiation field with intensity $G_0$~$10^3$ (in Habing
units). Our analysis reiterates the presence of massive reservoirs of molecular gas fueling star
formation and nuclear accretion in $z$~6 quasar host galaxies. It also highlights the power of combined
3mm and 1mm observations for quantitative studies of the dense gas content in massive galaxies at
cosmic dawn.

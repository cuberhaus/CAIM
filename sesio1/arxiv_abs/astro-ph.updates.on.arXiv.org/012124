Long-period variable stars (LPVs) are pulsating red giants, primarily in the asymptotic giant
branch phase, and they include both Miras and semi-regular variables (SRVs). Their period-age
and period-luminosity relations enable us to trace different stellar populations, as they are
intrinsically very bright and cover a wide range in distances and ages. The purpose of this study
is to establish a census of LPV stars in a region close to the Galactic center, using the six-year database
of the Vista Variables in the V\'ia L\'actea (VVV) ESO Public Survey, as well as to describe the methodology
that was employed to search for and characterize LPVs using VVV data. Near-IR surveys such as VVV
provide a unique opportunity to probe the high-extinction innermost regions of the Milky Way. The
detection and analysis of the intrinsically bright Miras in this region could provide us with an
excellent probe of the properties of the Milky Way far behind its bulge. We used point-spread function
photometry for all available $K_{s}$-band images in ten VVV tiles, covering $16.4~\deg^2$ in total,
overlapping fields observed in the course of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE)-III
survey. We designed a method to select LPV candidates, and we used the known variables from OGLE-III
and other known variables from the literature to test our approach. The reduced $\chi^2$ statistic,
along with the flux-independent index $K_{(fi)}$, were used in our analysis. The Lomb-Scargle
period search method, Fourier analysis, template fitting, and visual inspection were then performed
to refine our sample and characterize the properties of the stars included in our catalog. A final
sample of 130 Mira candidates, of which 129 are new discoveries, was thus obtained, with periods
in the range between about 80 and 1400~days.

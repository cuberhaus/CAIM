The Milky Way's satellite galaxies ("surviving dwarfs") have been studied for decades as unique
probes of chemical evolution in the low-mass regime. Here we extend such studies to the "disrupted
dwarfs", whose debris constitutes the stellar halo. We present abundances ([Fe/H], [$\alpha$/Fe])
and stellar masses for nine disrupted dwarfs with $M_{\star}\approx10^{6}-10^{9}M_{\odot}$
from the H3 Survey (Sagittarius, $Gaia$-Sausage-Enceladus, Helmi Streams, Sequoia, Wukong/LMS-1,
Cetus, Thamnos, I'itoi, Orphan/Chenab). The surviving and disrupted dwarfs are chemically distinct:
at fixed mass, the disrupted dwarfs are systematically metal-poor and $\alpha$-enhanced. The
disrupted dwarfs define a mass-metallicity relation (MZR) with a similar slope as the $z=0$ MZR
followed by the surviving dwarfs, but offset to lower metallicities by $\Delta$[Fe/H]$\approx0.3-0.4$
dex. Dwarfs with larger offsets from the $z=0$ MZR are more $\alpha$-enhanced. In simulations as
well as observations, galaxies with higher $\Delta$[Fe/H] formed at higher redshifts -- exploiting
this, we infer the disrupted dwarfs have typical star-formation truncation redshifts of $z_{\rm{trunc}}{\sim}1-2$.
We compare the chemically inferred $z_{\rm{trunc}}$ with dynamically inferred accretion redshifts
and find almost all dwarfs are quenched only after accretion. The differences between disrupted
and surviving dwarfs are likely because the disrupted dwarfs assembled their mass rapidly, at higher
redshifts, and within denser dark matter halos that formed closer to the Galaxy. Our results place
novel archaeological constraints on low-mass galaxies inaccessible to direct high-$z$ studies:
(i) the redshift evolution of the MZR along parallel tracks but offset to lower metallicities extends
to $M_{\star}\approx10^{6}-10^{9}M_{\odot}$; (ii) galaxies at $z\approx2-3$ are $\alpha$-enhanced
with [$\alpha$/Fe]$\approx0.4$.

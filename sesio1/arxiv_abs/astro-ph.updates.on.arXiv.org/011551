Spectropolarimetric reconstructions of the photospheric vector magnetic field are intrinsically
limited by the so-called 180$^\circ$ ambiguity in the orientation of the transverse component.
The successful launch and operation of Solar Orbiter has made the removal of the 180$^\circ$ ambiguity
possible using solely observations obtained from two different vantage points. While the exploitation
of such a possibility is straightforward in principle, it is less so in practice and it is therefore
important to assess the accuracy and limitations, as a function of both the satellites orbits and
measurement principles. In this work we present a stereoscopic disambiguation method (SDM) and
discuss a thorough testing of its accuracy in applications to modeled active regions and quiet Sun
observations. In a first series of tests, we employ magnetograms extracted from three different
numerical simulations as test fields, and model observations of the magnetograms from different
angles and distances. In these more idealized tests, the SDM is proven to to reach a 100% disambiguation
accuracy when applied to moderately-to-well resolved fields. Even in the case of disambiguation
of quiet Sun magnetograms with significant under-resolved scale, the SDM provides an accuracy
between 82% and 98% depending on the field strength. The accuracy of the SDM is found to be mostly sensitive
to the variable resolution of Solar Orbiter on its highly elliptic orbit, as well as to the intrinsic
scale of the observed field. Finally, as a more realistic test, we consider magnetograms that are
obtained using a radiative transfer inversion code and the SOPHISM instrument simulator applied
to a 3D simulation of a pore, and present a preliminary discussion of the effect of the viewing angle
on the observed field.

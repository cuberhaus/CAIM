The eclipsing time variations in post-common-envelope binaries were proposed to be due to the time-varying
component of the stellar quadrupole moment. This is suggested to be produced by changes in the stellar
structure due to an internal redistribution of the angular momentum and the effect of the centrifugal
force. We examine this hypothesis presenting 3D simulations of compressible magneto-hydrodynamics
(MHD) performed with the Pencil Code, modeling the stellar dynamo for a solar mass star with angular
velocities of 20 and 30 times solar. We include and vary the strength of the centrifugal force, comparing
with reference simulations without the centrifugal force and including a simulation where its
effect is enhanced. The centrifugal force is causing perturbations in the evolution of the stars,
so that the outcome in the details becomes different as a result of non-linear evolution. While the
average density profile is unaffected by the centrifugal force, a relative change in density difference
between high altitudes and the equator of order $\sim 10^{-4}$ is found. The power spectrum of the
convective velocity is found to be more sensitive to the angular velocity than the strength of the
centrifugal force. The quadrupole moment of the stars includes a fluctuating and a time-independent
component which varies with the rotation rate. As very similar behavior is produced in the absence
of the centrifugal force, we conclude that it is not the main ingredient for producing the time-averaged
quadrupole moment of the star. In a real physical system, we thus expect contributions from both
components, that is, due to the time-dependent gravitational force from the variation in the quadrupole
term and due to spin-orbit coupling due to the persistent part of the quadrupole.

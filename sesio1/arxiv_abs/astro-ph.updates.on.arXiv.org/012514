In recent decades our understanding of solar active regions (ARs) has improved substantially due
to observations made with better angular resolution and wider spectral coverage. While prior AR
observations have shown that these structures were always brighter than the quiet Sun at centimeter
wavelengths, recent observations at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths have shown ARs
with well defined dark umbrae. Given this new information, it is now necessary to update our understanding
and models of the solar atmosphere in active regions. In this work, we present a data-constrained
model of the AR solar atmosphere, in which we use brightness temperature measurements of NOAA 12470
at three radio frequencies: 17 (NoRH), 100 and 230 GHz (ALMA). Based on our model, which assumes that
the radio emission originates from thermal free-free and gyroresonance processes, we calculate
radio brightness temperature maps that can be compared with the observations. The magnetic field
at distinct atmospheric heights was determined in our modelling process by force-free field extrapolation
using photospheric magnetograms taken by HMI/SDO. In order to determine the best plasma temperature
and density height profiles necessary to match the observations, the model uses a genetic algorithm
that modifies a standard quiet Sun atmospheric model. Our results show that the height of the transition
region (TR) of the modelled atmosphere varies with the type of region being modelled: for umbrae
the TR is located at 1080 +/- 20 km above the solar surface; for penumbrae, the TR is located at 1800
+/- 50 km; and for bright regions outside sunspots, the TR is located at 2000 +/- 100 km. With these
results, we find good agreement with the observed AR brightness temperature maps. Our modelled
AR can be used to estimate the emission at frequencies without observational coverage.

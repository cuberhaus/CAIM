We present deep broadband radio polarization observations of the Spiderweb radio galaxy (J1140-2629)
in a galaxy proto-cluster at $z=2.16$. These yield the most detailed polarimetric maps yet made
of a high redshift radio galaxy. The intrinsic polarization angles and Faraday Rotation Measures
(RMs) reveal coherent magnetic fields spanning the $\sim60$ kpc length of the jets, while $\sim50$%
fractional polarizations indicate these fields are well-ordered. Source-frame absolute RM values
of $\sim1,000$ rad/m/m are typical, and values up to $\sim11,100$ rad/m/m are observed. The Faraday-rotating
gas cannot be well-mixed with the synchrotron-emitting gas, or stronger-than-observed depolarization
would occur. Nevertheless, an observed spatial coincidence between a localized absolute RM enhancement
of $\sim1,100$ rad/m/m, a bright knot of Ly$\alpha$ emission, and a deviation of the radio jet provide
direct evidence for vigorous jet-gas interaction. We detect a large-scale RM gradient totaling
$\sim1,000$s rad/m/m across the width of the jet, suggesting a net clockwise (as viewed from the
AGN) toroidal magnetic field component exists at 10s-of-kpc-scales, which we speculate may be
associated with the operation of a Poynting-Robertson cosmic battery. We conclude the RMs are mainly
generated in a sheath of hot gas around the radio jet, rather than the ambient foreground proto-cluster
gas. The estimated magnetic field strength decreases by successive orders-of-magnitude going
from the jet hotspots ($\sim90$ $\mu$G) to the jet sheath ($\sim10$ $\mu$G) to the ambient intracluster
medium ($\sim1$ $\mu$G). Synthesizing our results, we propose that the Spiderweb radio galaxy
is actively magnetizing its surrounding proto-cluster environment, with possible implications
for theories of the origin and evolution of cosmic magnetic fields.

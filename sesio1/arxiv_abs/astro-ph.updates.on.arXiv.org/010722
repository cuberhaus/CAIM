Ultra-hot Jupiters are highly irradiated gas giants with equilibrium temperatures typically
higher than 2000K. Atmospheric studies of these planets have shown that their transmission spectra
are rich in metal lines, with some of these metals being ionised due to the extreme temperatures.
Here, we use two transit observations of WASP-76b obtained with the CARMENES spectrograph to study
the atmosphere of this planet using high-resolution transmission spectroscopy. Taking advantage
of the two channels and the coverage of the red and near-infrared wavelength ranges by CARMENES,
we focus our analysis on the study of the CaII infrared triplet (IRT) at 8500A and the HeI triplet at
10830A. We present the discovery of the CaII IRT at 7$\sigma$ in the atmosphere of WASP-76b using
the cross-correlation technique, which is consistent with previous detections of the CaII H&K
lines in the same planet, and with the atmospheric studies of other ultra-hot Jupiters reported
to date. The low mass density of the planet, and our calculations of the XUV irradiation received
by the exoplanet, show that this planet is a potential candidate to have a HeI evaporating envelope
and, therefore, we performed further investigations focussed on this aspect. The transmission
spectrum around the HeI triplet shows a broad and red-shifted absorption signal in both transit
observations. However, due to the strong telluric contamination around the HeI lines and the relatively
low signal-to-noise ratio of the observations, we are not able to unambiguously conclude if the
absorption is due to the presence of helium in the atmosphere of WASP-76b, and we consider the result
to be only an upper limit. Finally, we revisit the transmission spectrum around other lines such
as NaI, LiI, H$\alpha$, and KI. The upper limits reported here for these lines are consistent with
previous studies.

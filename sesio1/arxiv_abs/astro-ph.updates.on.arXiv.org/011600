QFP wave trains in the corona have been studied intensively in the past decade, thanks to the full-disk,
high spatiotemporal resolution, and wide-temperature coverage observations taken by the SDO/AIA.
In AIA observations, QFP wave trains are seen to consist of multiple coherent and concentric wavefronts
emanating successively near the epicenter of the accompanying flares; they propagate outwardly
either along or across coronal loops at fast-mode magnetosonic speeds from several hundred to more
than 2000 km/s, and their periods are in the range of tens of seconds to several minutes. Based on the
distinct different properties of QFP wave trains, they might be divided into two distinct categories
including narrow and broad ones. For most QFP wave trains, some of their periods are similar to those
of quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) in the accompanying flares, indicating that they are probably
different manifestations of the same physical process. Currently, candidate generation mechanisms
for QFP wave trains include two main categories: pulsed energy excitation mechanism in association
with magnetic reconnection and dispersion evolution mechanism related to the dispersive evolution
of impulsively generated broadband perturbations. In addition, the generation of some QFP wave
trains might be driven by the leakage of three and five minute oscillations from the lower atmosphere.
As one of the new discoveries of SDO, QFP wave trains provide a new tool for coronal seismology to probe
the corona parameters, and they are also useful for diagnosing the generation of QPPs, flare processes
including energy release and particle accelerations. This review aims to summarize the main observational
and theoretical results of the spatially-resolved QFP wave trains in extreme ultraviolet observations,
and states briefly a number of questions that deserve further investigations.

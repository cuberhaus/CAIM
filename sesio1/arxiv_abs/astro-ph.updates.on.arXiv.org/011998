The chromosphere above active regions (ARs) on the Sun hosts magnetized supersonic downflows.
Studies of these supersonic downflows help to decipher the magnetic fine structure and dynamics
of the chromosphere. We perform a statistical analysis of the magnetized supersonic downflows
in a number of ARs and survey their characteristics. We analyze spectro-polarimetric scans of parts
of 13 ARs obtained in the infrared He I 10830 \r{A} triplet formed in the upper chromosphere recorded
with the GREGOR Infrared Spectrograph (GRIS) mounted at the GREGOR solar telescope. We retrieve
the line-of-sight velocities and the magnetic field vector using the HeLIx+ inversion code that
assumes Milne-Eddington atmospheres. We find magnetized supersonic downflows in all the ARs,
with larger area coverage by such flows in ARs observed during their emerging phase. The fact that
supersonic downflows were detected in all scans, though they cover only a small fraction, 0.2--6.4%,
of the observed field-of-view, suggests that they are a common phenomenon in the upper chromospheres
of ARs. The supersonic downflows are found to be associated with many AR features such as pores, sunspot
umbrae, sunspot penumbrae, light bridges, plages, He I loops as part of arch filament systems characteristic
of emerging fields, and filaments. Although several mechanisms are identified to be causing the
supersonic downflows, by far the most common one appears to be the draining of plasma along the legs
of rising magnetic loops. The loops mainly drain into forming pores. The line-of-sight velocities
of the supersonic downflows reach up to 49 kms-1 and the velocity distribution shows multiple populations.
Almost 92% of these supersonic downflows coexist with a subsonic flow component. The weaker, more
horizontal fields associated with the supersonic component suggests that it is formed above the
subsonic component.

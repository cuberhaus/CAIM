Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are more precise standardizable candles when measured in the near-infrared
(NIR) than in the optical. With this motivation, from 2012-2017 we embarked on the RAISIN program
with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to obtain rest-frame NIR light curves for a cosmologically
distant sample of 37 SN Ia ($0.2 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.6$) discovered by Pan-STARRS and the Dark Energy
Survey. By comparing higher-$z$ HST data with 42 SN Ia at $z<0.1$ observed in the NIR by the Carnegie
Supernova Project, we construct a Hubble diagram from NIR observations (with only time of maximum
light and some selection cuts from optical data) to pursue a unique avenue to constrain the dark energy
equation of state parameter, $w$. We analyze the dependence of the full set of Hubble residuals on
the SN Ia host galaxy mass and find Hubble residual steps of size $\sim$0.06-0.1~mag with 1.5- to
2.5-$\sigma$ significance depending on the method and step location. Combining our NIR sample
with CMB constraints, we find $1+w=-0.17\pm0.12$ (stat$+$syst). The largest systematic errors
are the redshift-dependent SN selection biases and the properties of the NIR mass step. We also use
these data to measure $H_0=75.9\pm 2.2$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ from stars with geometric distance
calibration in the hosts of 8 SNe Ia observed in the NIR versus $H_0=71.2\pm3.8$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$
using an inverse distance ladder approach tied to Planck. Using optical data we find $1+w=-0.10\pm0.09$
and with optical and NIR data combined, we find $1+w=-0.06\pm0.07$; these shifts of up to 0.11 in
$w$ could point to inconsistency in optical versus NIR SN models. There will be many opportunities
to improve this NIR measurement and better understand systematic uncertainties through larger
low-$z$ samples, new light-curve models, calibration improvements, and by building high-$z$
samples from the Roman Space Telescope.

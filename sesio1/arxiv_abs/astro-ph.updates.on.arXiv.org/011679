Aims: Optical interferometry from space for the purpose of detecting and characterising exoplanets
is seeing a revival, specifically from missions such as the proposed Large Interferometer For Exoplanets
(LIFE). A default assumption since the design studies of Darwin and TPF-I has been that the Emma X-array
configuration is the optimal architecture for this goal. Here, we examine whether new advances
in the field of nulling interferometry, such as the concept of kernel nulling, challenge this assumption.
Methods: We develop a tool designed to derive the photon-limited signal to noise ratio of a large
sample of simulated planets for different architecture configurations and beam combination schemes.
We simulate four basic configurations: the double Bracewell/X-array, and kernel nullers with
three, four and five telescopes respectively. Results: We find that a configuration of five telescopes
in a pentagonal shape, using a five aperture kernel nulling scheme, outperforms the X-array design
in both search (finding more planets) and characterisation (obtaining better signal, faster)
when total collecting area is conserved. This is especially the case when trying to detect Earth
twins (temperate, rocky planets in the habitable zone), showing a 23\% yield increase over the X-array.
On average, we find that a five telescope design receives 1.2 times the signal over the X-array design.
Conclusions: With the results of this simulation, we conclude that the Emma X-array configuration
may not be the best architecture choice for the upcoming LIFE mission, and that a five telescope design
utilising kernel nulling concepts will likely provide better scientific return for the same collecting
area, provided that technical solutions for the required achromatic phase shifts can be implemented.

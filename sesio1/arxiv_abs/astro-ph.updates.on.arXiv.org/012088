We present panchromatic observations and modeling of calcium-strong supernovae (SNe) 2021gno
in the star-forming host galaxy NGC 4165 (D = 30.5 Mpc) and 2021inl in the outskirts of elliptical
galaxy NGC 4923 (D = 80 Mpc), both monitored through the Young Supernova Experiment (YSE) transient
survey. The multi-color light curves of both SNe show two peaks, the former peak being derived from
shock cooling emission (SCE) and/or shock interaction with circumstellar material (CSM). The
primary peak in SN 2021gno is coincident with luminous, rapidly decaying X-ray emission ($L_x =
5 \times 10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$) detected by Swift-XRT at $\delta t = 1$ day after explosion, this
observation being the second ever detection of X-rays from a calcium-strong transient. We interpret
the X-ray emission from SN 2021gno in the context of shock interaction with dense CSM that extends
to $r < 3 \times 10^{14}$ cm. Based on modeling of the SN 2021gno X-ray spectrum, we calculate a CSM
mass range of $M_{\rm CSM} = (0.3 - 1.6) \times 10^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ and particle densities of $n
= (1-4) \times 10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$. Radio non-detections of SN 2021gno indicate a low-density environment
at larger radii ($r > 10^{16}$ cm) and a progenitor mass loss rate of $\dot{M} < 10^{-4}$ M$_{\odot}$
yr$^{-1}$, for $v_w = 500$ km s$^{-1}$. For radiation derived from SCE, modeling of the primary light
curve peak in both SNe indicates an extended progenitor envelope mass and radius of $M_e = 0.02 - 0.05$
M$_{\odot}$ and $R_e = 30 - 230$ R$_{\odot}$. The explosion properties of SNe 2021gno and 2021inl
suggest progenitor systems containing either a low-mass massive star or a white dwarf (WD), the
former being unlikely for either object given the lack of star formation at both explosion sites.
Furthermore, the progenitor environments of both SNe are consistent with explosion models for
low-mass hybrid He/C/O WD + C/O WD binaries.

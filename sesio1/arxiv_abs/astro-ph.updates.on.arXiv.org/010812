Stellar abundances and ages afford the means to link chemical enrichment to galactic formation.
In the Milky Way, individual element abundances show tight correlations with age, which vary in
slope across ([Fe/H]-[$\alpha$/Fe]). Here, we step from characterising abundances as measures
of age, to understanding how abundances trace properties of stellar birth-environment in the disk
over time. Using measurements from $\sim$27,000 APOGEE stars (R=22,500, SNR$>$200), we build
simple local linear models to predict a sample of elements (X = Si, O, Ca, Ti, Ni, Al, Mn, Cr) using (Fe,
Mg) abundances alone, as fiducial tracers of supernovae production channels. Given [Fe/H] and
[Mg/H], we predict these elements, [X/H], to about double the uncertainty of their measurements.
The intrinsic dispersion, after subtracting measurement errors in quadrature is $\approx 0.015-0.04$~dex.
The residuals of the prediction (measurement $-$ model) for each element demonstrate that each
element has an individual link to birth properties at fixed (Fe, Mg). Residuals from primarily massive-star
supernovae (i.e. Si, O, Al) partially correlate with guiding radius. Residuals from primarily
supernovae Ia (i.e. Mn, Ni) partially correlate with age. A fraction of the intrinsic scatter that
persists at fixed (Fe, Mg), however, after accounting for correlations, does not appear to further
discriminate between birth properties that can be traced with present-day measurements. Presumably,
this is because the residuals are also, in part, a measure of the typical (in)-homogeneity of the
disk's stellar birth environments, previously inferred only using open-cluster systems. Our
study implies at fixed birth radius and time, there is a median scatter of $\approx 0.01-0.015$ dex
in elements generated in supernovae sources.

Using spatially resolved H-alpha emission line maps of star-forming galaxies, we study the evolution
of gradients in galaxy assembly over a wide range in redshift ($0.5<z<1.7$). Our $z\sim0.5$ measurements
come from deep Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 G102 grism spectroscopy obtained as part of the CANDELS
Lyman-alpha Emission at Reionization (CLEAR) Experiment. For star-forming galaxies with Log$(M_{*}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot})\geqslant8.96$,
the mean H-alpha effective radius is $1.2\pm0.1$ times larger than that of the stellar continuum,
implying inside-out growth via star formation. This measurement agrees within $1\sigma$ with
those measured at $z\sim1$ and $z\sim1.7$ from the 3D-HST and KMOS-3D surveys respectively, implying
no redshift evolution. However, we observe redshift evolution in the stellar mass surface density
within 1 kiloparsec ($\Sigma_\mathrm{1kpc}$). Star-forming galaxies at $z\sim0.5$ with a stellar
mass of Log$(M_{*}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot})=9.5$ have a ratio of $\Sigma_\mathrm{1kpc}$ in H-alpha
relative to their stellar continuum that is lower by $(19\pm2)\%$ compared to $z\sim1$ galaxies.
$\Sigma_{1\mathrm{kpc, H}\alpha}$/$\Sigma_{1\mathrm{kpc,Cont}}$ decreases towards higher
stellar masses. The majority of the redshift evolution in $\Sigma_{1\mathrm{kpc,H}\alpha}$/$\Sigma_{1\mathrm{kpc,Cont}}$
versus stellar mass stems from the fact that Log($\Sigma_{1\mathrm{kpc, H}\alpha}$) declines
twice as much as Log($\Sigma_{1\mathrm{kpc, Cont}}$) from $z\sim 1$ to 0.5 (at a fixed stellar mass
of Log$(M_{*}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot})=9.5$). By comparing our results to the TNG50 cosmological
magneto-hydrodynamical simulation, we rule out dust as the driver of this evolution. Our results
are consistent with inside-out quenching following in the wake of inside-out growth, the former
of which drives the significant drop in $\Sigma_{1\mathrm{kpc, H}\alpha}$ from $z\sim1$ to $z\sim0.5$.

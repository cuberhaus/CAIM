Large fractions of metals are missing from the observable gas-phase in the interstellar medium
(ISM) because they are incorporated into dust grains, a phenomenon called dust depletion. The study
of dust depletion in the ISM is important to investigate the origin and evolution of metals and cosmic
dust. Here we aim at characterizing the dust depletion of several metals from the Milky Way to distant
galaxies. We collect ISM metal column densities from absorption-line spectroscopy in the literature,
and in addition, we determine Ti and Ni column densities from a sample of 70 damped Lyman-$\alpha$
absorbers (DLAs) towards quasars, observed with UVES/VLT. We use ISM relative abundances to estimate
the dust depletion of 18 metals (C, P, O, Cl, Kr, S, Ge, Mg, Si, Cu, Co, Mn, Cr, Ni, Al, Ti, Zn and Fe) for
different environments (the Milky Way, the Magellanic Clouds (MCs), DLAs towards quasars and towards
gamma-ray bursts). We observe linear relations between the depletion of each metal and the strength
of dust depletion, which we trace with the observed [Zn/Fe]. In the neutral ISM of the MCs we find small
deviations from linearity observed as an overabundance of the $\alpha$-elements Ti, Mg, S and an
underabundance of Mn. The deviations disappear if we assume that all OB stars observed towards the
MCs in our sample have an $\alpha$-element enhancement and Mn underabundance. This may imply that
the MCs have been recently enriched in $\alpha$-elements, potentially due to recent bursts of star
formation. The observed strong correlations of the depletion sequences of the metals all the way
from low metallicity QSO-DLAs to the Milky Way suggest that cosmic dust has a common origin, independently
of the star formation history, which varies significantly between these different galaxies. This
supports the importance of grain growth in the ISM as a significant process of dust production.

Driven by increasingly complete observational knowledge of systems of satellite galaxies, mutual
spatial alignments and relations in velocities among satellites belonging to a common host have
become a productive field of research. Numerous studies have investigated different types of such
phase-space correlations, and were met with varying degrees of attention by the community. The
Planes of Satellite Galaxies issue is maybe the best-known example, with a rich field of research
literature and an ongoing, controversial debate on how much of a challenge it poses to the LCDM model
of cosmology. Another type of correlation, the apparent excess of close pairs of dwarf galaxies,
has received considerably less attention despite its reported tension with LCDM expectations.
With the expansion of proper motion measurements, largely driven by Gaia, other peculiar phase-space
correlations were uncovered among the Milky Way satellites. Examples are the tangential velocity
excess of satellites compared to cosmological expectations, and the unexpected preference of
satellites to be close to pericenter. At the same time, other kinds of correlations have been found
to be more in line with cosmological expectations, specifically lopsided satellite galaxy systems
and the accretion of groups of satellite galaxies. The latter has mostly been studied in cosmological
simulations thus far, but offers the potential to address some of the other issues by providing a
way to produce correlations among the orbits of a group's satellite galaxy members. This review
is the first to provide an introduction to the highly active field of phase-space correlations among
satellite galaxy systems. It summarizes existing, recent research and highlights interdependencies
between the different, currently almost exclusively individually considered types of correlations.
Future prospects are also briefly discussed. (abridged)

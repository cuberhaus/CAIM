The Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S$^{4}$G) is a detailed study of over 2300 nearby
galaxies in the near-infrared (NIR), which has been critical to our understanding of the detailed
structures of nearby galaxies. Because the sample galaxies were selected only using radio-derived
velocities, however, the survey favored late-type disk galaxies over lenticulars and ellipticals.
A follow-up Spitzer survey was conducted to rectify this bias, adding 465 early-type galaxies (ETGs)
to the original sample, to be analyzed in a manner consistent with the initial survey. We present
the data release of this ETG extension, up to the third data processing pipeline (P3): surface photometry.
We produce curves of growth and radial surface brightness profiles (with and without inclination
corrections) using reduced and masked Spitzer IRAC 3.6$\mu$m and 4.5$\mu$m images produced through
Pipelines 1 and 2, respectively. From these profiles, we derive the following integrated quantities:
total magnitudes, stellar masses, concentration parameters, and galaxy size metrics. We showcase
NIR scaling relations for ETGs among these quantities. We examine general trends across the whole
S$^{4}$G and ETG extension among our derived parameters, highlighting differences between ETGs
and late-type galaxies (LTGs). ETGs are, on average, more massive and more concentrated than LTGs,
and also show subtle distinctions among ETG morphological sub-types. We also derive the following
scaling relations and compare with previous results in visible light: mass--size (both half-light
and isophotal), mass--concentration, mass--surface brightness (central, effective, and within
1 kpc), and mass--color. We find good agreement with previous works, though some relations (e.g.,
mass--central surface brightness) will require more careful multi-component decompositions
to be fully understood.

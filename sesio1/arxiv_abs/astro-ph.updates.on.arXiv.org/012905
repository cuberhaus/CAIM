We present a sample of 135,873 RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) with precise photometric-metallicity and distance
estimates from our newly calibrated $P$--$\phi_{31}$--[Fe/H] and $G$-band absolute magnitude-metallicity
relations. The $P$-$\phi_{31}$-[Fe/H] relations for type RRab and type RRc stars are obtained
from nearly 3000 Gaia-identified RRLs with precise $\phi_{31}$ measurements from the light curves
and metallicity estimates from spectroscopy. Using $\sim$1000 nearby RRLs with accurate distances
estimated from parallax measurements with Gaia EDR3, new $G$-band absolute magnitude-metallicity
relations and near-infrared period-absolute magnitude-metallicity relations for $K_{\rm s}$
and $W1$ bands are constructed. External checks, using other spectroscopic samples of field RRLs
and RRL members of globular clusters (GCs), show that the typical uncertainties in our photometric-metallicity
estimates are about 0.30 and 0.20 dex for type RRab and RRc stars, respectively, without significant
systematic offsets. The accuracies of these metallicity estimates are much improved, especially
for type RRab stars, when compared to those provided by the Gaia DR3 release. Validations of our distance
estimates, again by using RRL members of GCs, show that the typical distance errors are only 3-4%
for type RRab/c stars. The distance scale from this study is also consistent with that of the GCs.
The distance modulus $\mu_0=18.444\pm0.001(stat)\pm0.028(syst)$mag for the LMC and $\mu_0=18.944\pm0.002(stat)\pm0.030(syst)$mag
for the SMC are estimated from our RRab star sample, and are in excellent agreement with previous
measurements. The mean metallicity of the LMC and SMC derived in this work are also consistent with
the previous determinations. Using our sample, a steep metallicity gradient of $-0.021$ dex kpc$^{-1}$
is found for the LMC, while a negligible metallicity gradient is obtained for the SMC.

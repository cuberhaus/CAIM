We present a rest-frame UV-optical stacked spectrum representative of quiescent galaxies at $1.0
< z < 1.3$ with log$(M_*/\rm{M_\odot}) > 10.8$. The stack is constructed using VANDELS survey data,
combined with new KMOS observations. We apply two independent full-spectral-fitting approaches,
obtaining consistent stellar ages and metallicities. We measure a total metallicity, [Z/H] = $-0.13\pm0.08$,
and an iron abundance, [Fe/H] = $-0.18\pm0.08$, representing falls of $\sim0.3$ dex and $\sim0.15$
dex respectively compared with the local Universe. We also measure the alpha enhancement via the
magnesium abundance, obtaining [Mg/Fe] = 0.23$\pm$0.12, consistent with similar-mass galaxies
in the local Universe, indicating no evolution in the average alpha enhancement of log$(M_*/\rm{M_\odot})
\sim 11$ quiescent galaxies over the last 8 Gyr. This suggests the very high alpha enhancements recently
reported for several very bright $z\sim1-2$ quiescent galaxies are due to their extreme masses,
in accordance with the well-known downsizing trend, rather than being typical of the $z\gtrsim1$
population. The metallicity evolution we observe with redshift (falling [Z/H], [Fe/H], but constant
[Mg/Fe]) is consistent with recent studies. We recover a mean stellar age of $2.5^{+0.6}_{-0.4}$
Gyr, corresponding to a formation redshift, $z_\rm{form} = 2.4^{+0.6}_{-0.3}$. Recent studies
have obtained varying average formation redshifts for $z\gtrsim1$ massive quiescent galaxies,
and, as these studies report consistent metallicities, we identify different star-formation-history
models as the most likely cause. Larger spectroscopic samples from upcoming ground-based instruments
will provide precise constraints on ages and metallicities at $z\gtrsim1$. Combining these with
precise $z>2$ quiescent-galaxy stellar-mass functions from JWST will provide an independent
test of formation redshifts from spectral fitting.

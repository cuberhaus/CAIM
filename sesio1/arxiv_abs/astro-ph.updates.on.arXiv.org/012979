The Trappist-1 planets provide a unique opportunity to test the current understanding of rocky
planet evolution. The James Webb Space Telescope is expected to characterize the atmospheres of
these planets, potentially detecting CO$_2$, CO, H$_2$O, CH$_4$, or abiotic O$_2$ from water photodissociation
and subsequent hydrogen escape. Here, we apply a coupled atmosphere-interior evolution model
to the Trappist-1 planets to anticipate their modern atmospheres. This model, which has previously
been validated for Earth and Venus, connects magma ocean crystallization to temperate geochemical
cycling. Mantle convection, magmatic outgassing, atmospheric escape, crustal oxidation, a radiative-convective
climate model, and deep volatile cycling are explicitly coupled to anticipate bulk atmospheres
and planetary redox evolution over 8 Gyr. By adopting a Monte Carlo approach that samples a broad
range of initial conditions and unknown parameters, we make some tentative predictions about current
Trappist-1 atmospheres. We find that anoxic atmospheres are probable, but not guaranteed, for
the outer planets; oxygen produced via hydrogen loss during the pre-main sequence is typically
consumed by crustal sinks. In contrast, oxygen accumulation on the inner planets occurs in around
half of all models runs. Complete atmospheric erosion is possible but not assured for the inner planets
(occurs in 20%-50% of model runs), whereas the outer planets retain significant surface volatiles
in virtually all model simulations. For all planets that retain substantial atmospheres, CO$_2$-dominated
or CO$_2$-O$_2$ atmospheres are expected; water vapor is unlikely to be a detectable atmospheric
constituent in most cases. There are necessarily many caveats to these predictions, but the ways
in which they misalign with upcoming observations will highlight gaps in terrestrial planet knowledge.

When observed in quiet regions close to the solar limb, many strong resonance lines show conspicuous
linear polarization signals, produced by scattering processes, with extended wing lobes. Recent
studies indicate that, contrary to what was previously believed, the wing lobes are sensitive to
the presence of relatively weak longitudinal magnetic fields through magneto-optical (MO) effects.
We theoretically investigate the sensitivity of the scattering polarization wings of the Ca I 4227
{\AA} line to the MO effects, and we explore its diagnostic potential for inferring information
on the longitudinal component of the photospheric magnetic field. We calculate the intensity and
polarization profiles of the Ca I 4227 {\AA} line by numerically solving the problem of the generation
and transfer of polarized radiation under non-local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions in
one-dimensional semi-empirical models of the solar atmosphere, taking into account the joint
action of the Hanle, Zeeman, and MO effects. We consider volume-filling magnetic fields as well
as magnetic fields occupying a fraction of the resolution element. In contrast to the circular polarization
signals produced by the Zeeman effect, we find that the linear polarization angle in the scattering
polarization wings of Ca I 4227 presents a clear sensitivity, through MO effects, not only to the
flux of the photospheric magnetic field, but also to the fraction of the resolution element that
the magnetic field occupies. We identify the linear polarization angle in the wings of strong resonance
lines as a valuable observable for diagnosing unresolved magnetic fields. Used in combination
with observables that encode information on the magnetic flux and other properties of the observed
atmospheric region, it can provide constraints on the filling factor of the magnetic field.

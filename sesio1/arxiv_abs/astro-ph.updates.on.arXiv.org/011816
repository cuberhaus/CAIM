Measuring the abundances of neutron-capture elements in Galactic disk stars is an important part
of understanding key stellar and galactic processes. In the optical wavelength regime a number
of different neutron-capture elements have been measured, however from the infrared H-band only
the s-process dominated element cerium has been accurately measured for a large sample of disk stars.
The more r-process dominated element ytterbium has only been measured in a small subset of stars
so far. In this study we aim to measure the ytterbium (Yb) abundance of local disk giants using the
Yb II line at $\lambda_\text{air}$=16498\AA. We also compare the resulting abundance trend with
Ce and Eu abundances for the same stars to analyse the s- and r-process contributions. We analyse
30 K-giants with high-resolution H-band spectra using spectral synthesis. The very same stars
have already been analysed using high-resolution optical spectra using the same method, but the
abundance of Yb was not possible to determine from those spectra due to blending issues for stars
with [Fe/H]>-1. In this present analysis, we utilise the stellar parameters determined from the
optical analysis. We determined the Yb abundances with an estimated uncertainty for [Yb/Fe] of
0.1 dex. From comparison, the trend of [Yb/Fe] follows closely the [Eu/Fe] trend and has clear s-process
enrichment in identified s-rich stars. From the comparison, both the validity of the Yb abundances
are ensured, and the theoretical prediction of a roughly 40/60 s-/r-process contribution to Yb's
origin is supported. These results show that with a careful and detailed analysis of infrared spectra,
reliable Yb abundances can be derived for a wider sample of cooler giants in the range -1.1<[Fe/H]<0.3.
This is promising for further studies of the production of Yb and for the r-process channel, key for
Galactochemical evolution, in the infrared.

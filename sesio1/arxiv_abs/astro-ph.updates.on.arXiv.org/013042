Modeling of strongly gravitationally lensed galaxies is often required in order to use them as astrophysical
or cosmological probes. With current and upcoming wide-field imaging surveys, the number of detected
lenses is increasing significantly such that automated and fast modeling procedures for ground-based
data are urgently needed. This is especially pertinent to short-lived lensed transients in order
to plan follow-up observations. Therefore, we present in a companion paper (submitted) a neural
network predicting the parameter values with corresponding uncertainties of a Singular Isothermal
Ellipsoid (SIE) mass profile with external shear. In this work, we present a newly-developed pipeline
glee_auto.py to model consistently any galaxy-scale lensing system. In contrast to previous automated
modeling pipelines that require high-resolution images, glee_auto.py is optimized for ground-based
images such as those from the Hyper-Suprime-Cam (HSC) or the upcoming Rubin Observatory Legacy
Survey of Space and Time. We further present glee_tools.py, a flexible automation code for individual
modeling that has no direct decisions and assumptions implemented. Both pipelines, in addition
to our modeling network, minimize the user input time drastically and thus are important for future
modeling efforts. We apply the network to 31 real galaxy-scale lenses of HSC and compare the results
to the traditional models. In the direct comparison, we find a very good match for the Einstein radius
especially for systems with $\theta_E \gtrsim 2$". The lens mass center and ellipticity show reasonable
agreement. The main discrepancies are on the external shear as expected from our tests on mock systems.
In general, our study demonstrates that neural networks are a viable and ultra fast approach for
measuring the lens-galaxy masses from ground-based data in the upcoming era with $\sim10^5$ lenses
expected.

Context: How do expanding HII regions interact with their environmental cloud? This is one of the
central questions driving the SOFIA legacy program FEEDBACK. Here, we present a case study toward
the prototypical H{\sc ii} region NGC7538. Methods: With SOFIA we mapped an area of ~210'^2 around
NGC7538 in the [CII] line at 1.9THz. Complementary observed atomic carbon [CI] and high-J CO(8-7)
data as well as archival NIR/FIR, cm continuum, CO(3-2) and HI data are folded into the analysis.
Results: While the overall [CII] morphology follows the general ionized gas, the channel maps show
multiple bubble-like structures with sizes on the order of ~80-100" (~1.0-1.28pc). While at least
one of them may be an individual feedback bubble driven by the main exciting sources of the region,
the other bubble-morphologies may also be due to the intrinsically porous structure of the HII region.
An analysis of the expansion velocities around 10km s^{-1} indicates that thermal expansion is
not sufficient but that wind-driving from the central O-stars is required. The most blue-shifted
[CII] component has barely any molecular or atomic counterparts. At the interface to the molecular
cloud, we find a typical photon-dominated region (PDR) with a bar-shape. Ionized, atomic and molecular
carbon show a layered structure in this PDR. The carbon in the PDR is dominated by its ionized form
with atomic and molecular masses of ~0.45+-0.1M_{\odot} and ~1.2+-0.1M_{\odot}, respectively,
compared to the ionized carbon in the range of 3.6-9.7M_{\odot}. Conclusions: The NGC7538 HII region
exhibits a diverse set of sub-structures that interact with each other as well as with the adjacent
cloud. Compared to other recent [CII] observations of HII regions (e.g., Orion Veil, RCW120, RCW49),
bubble-shape morphologies revealed in [CII] emission, indicative of expanding shells, are recurring
structures of PDRs.

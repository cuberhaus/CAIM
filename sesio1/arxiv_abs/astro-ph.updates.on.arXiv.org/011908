The High Energy Stereoscopic System (HESS), the Major Atmospheric Gamma-ray Imaging Cherenkov
Telescope (MAGIC), and the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS)
have observed diffuse gamma-ray emission strongly correlated with the central molecular zone
in the Galactic center. The most accepted scenario to generate this emission is via a hadronic interaction
between cosmic rays (CRs) and ambient gas, where CRs are accelerated from a central and continuous
source of 1 PeV protons (PeVatron). We explore the influence of the three-dimensional (3D) shape
of the central molecular zone on the indirect observation of the CR energy density via gamma-ray
detection. We simulated synthetic gamma-ray maps using a CR diffusion model with spherical injection,
one isotropic diffusion coefficient, no advection, and mono-energetic particles of 1 PeV. Also,
we used two different 3D gas distributions considering the observed gas column density, both with
and without an inner cavity. We find that when using a persistent CR source, a disk-like gas distribution
is needed to reproduce the existing CR indirect observations. This is in agreement with the continuous
gas distribution implied by some dynamical models and studies based on the comparison of emission
and absorption molecular lines. However, it contradicts several models of the central molecular
zone, which imply that this structure has a significant inner cavity. This tension can be reconciled
by an additional, impulsive CR injection. If the central molecular zone has a cavity, a composite
CR population, coming from the stellar winds of the Wolf-Rayet stars in the central 0.5 pc and the
supernova Sgr A East, produces a good match to the observed gamma-ray morphology in the Galactic
center.

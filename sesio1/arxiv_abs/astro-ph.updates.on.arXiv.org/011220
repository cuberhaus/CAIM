In this work we want to study the average mass density profile of tens to hundreds of clusters of galaxies
acting as lenses that produce a magnification bias on the SMGs, and to estimate their associated
masses and concentrations for different richness ranges. The background sample is composed of
SMGs observed by Herschel with 1.2<z<4.0 (mean redshift at ~2.3) while the foreground sample is
made up of galaxy clusters extracted from the SDSS III with photometric redshifts of 0.05< z< 0.8
(mean redshift at ~0.38). Measurements are obtained by stacking the SMG--cluster pairs to estimate
the cross-correlation function using the Davis-Peebles estimator. This methodology allows us
to derive the mass density profile for a wide range of angular scales, ~2-250 arcsec or ~10-1300 kpc
for z=0.38, with a high radial resolution. We find that It is impossible to fit the data with a single
mass density profile at all scales. As for the outer part, the estimated average masses increase
from $M_{200c}=5.8$ to $51.5\times 10^{13} M_\odot$ and the concentration parameter from C=0.74
to 1.74. In the small-scale regions, the obtained average masses fluctuate around $M_{200c}=3-4
\times 10^{13}M_\odot$ with average C~4. The total average masses are in perfect agreement with
the M-R relationship estimated from the cluster catalogue. While the estimated average C values
of the central galactic halos are in agreement with traditional M-C relationships, we find low concentrations
for the outer part. Moreover, C decrease for lower R values, probably indicating that the group of
galaxies cannot be considered to be relaxed systems. Finally, we notice a systematic lack of signal
at the transition between the dominance of the cluster halo and the central galactic halo (~100 kpc).
This feature is also present in previous studies using different catalogues and/or methodologies,
but is never discussed.

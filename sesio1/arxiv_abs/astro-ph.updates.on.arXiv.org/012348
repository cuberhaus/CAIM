Most simulations of outflow feedback on star formation are based on the assumption that outflows
are driven by a wide angle "X-wind," rather than a narrow jet. However, the arguments initially raised
against pure jet-driven flows were based on steady ejection in a uniform medium, a notion that is
no longer supported based on recent observations. We aim to determine whether a pulsed narrow jet
launched in a density-stratified, self-gravitating core could reproduce typical molecular outflow
properties, without the help of a wide-angle wind component. We performed axisymmetric hydrodynamic
simulations using the MPI-AMRVAC code with optically thin radiative cooling on timescales up to
10000 yrs. Then we computed and compared the predicted properties with observational data. First,
the jet-driven shell expands faster and wider through a core with steeply decreasing density than
through an uniform core. Second, when blown into the same singular flattened core, a jet-driven
shell has a similar width as a wide-angle wind-driven shell in the first few hundred years, but a decelerating
expansion on long timescales. The flow adopts a conical shape and a base opening angle reaching up
to $90\unicode{xb0}$. Third, after $\sim$ 10000 yrs, a pulsed jet-driven shell shows fitting features
and a qualitative resemblance with recent observations of protostellar outflows with the Atacama
Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), such as HH46-47 and CARMA-7. In particular, similarities are seen
in the shell widths, opening angles, position-velocity diagrams, and mass-velocity distribution,
with some showing a closer resemblance than in simulations based on a wide-angle "X-wind" model.
Therefore, a realistic ambient density stratification in addition to millenia-long integration
times are equally essential to reliably predict the properties of outflows driven by a pulsed jet
and to confront them with the observations.

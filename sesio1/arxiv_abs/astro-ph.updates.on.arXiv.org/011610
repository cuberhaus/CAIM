Here, we study the temperature structure of flaring and non-flaring coronal loops, using extracted
loops from images taken in six extreme ultraviolet (EUV) channels recorded by Atmospheric Imaging
Assembly (AIA)/ Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO). We use data for loops of X2.1-class-flaring active
region (AR11283) during 22:10UT till 23:00UT, on 2011, September 6; and non-flaring active region
(AR12194) during 08:00:00UT till 09:00:00UT on 2014, October 26. By using spatially-synthesized
Gaussian DEM forward-fitting method, we calculate the peak temperatures for each strip of the loops.
We apply the Lomb-Scargle method to compute the oscillations periods for the temperature series
of each strip. The periods of the temperature oscillations for the flaring loops are ranged from
7 min to 28.4 min. These temperature oscillations show very close behavior to the slow-mode oscillation.
We observe that the temperature oscillations in the flaring loops are started at least around 10
minutes before the transverse oscillations and continue for a long time duration even after the
transverse oscillations are ended. The temperature amplitudes are increased at the flaring time
(during 20 min) in the flaring loops. The periods of the temperatures obtained for the non-flaring
loops are ranged from 8.5 min to 30 min, but their significances are less (below 0.5) in comparison
with the flaring ones (near to one). Hence the detected temperature periods for the non-flaring
loops' strips are less probable in comparison with the flaring ones, and maybe they are just fluctuations.
Based on our confined observations, it seems that the flaring loops' periods show more diversity
and their temperatures have wider ranges of variation than the non-flaring ones. More accurate
commentary in this respect requires more extensive statistical research and broader observations.

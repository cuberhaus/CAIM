Protoplanetary discs (PPDs) are cold, dense and weakly ionised environments that witness the planetary
formation. Among these discs, transition discs (TDs) are characterised by a wide cavity in the dust
and gas distribution. Despite this lack of material, many TDs strongly accrete onto their central
star, possibly indicating that a mechanism is driving fast accretion in TDs cavities. The presence
of radially extended 'dead zones' in PPDs recently revived the interest in magnetised disc winds
(MDWs), where accretion is driven by a large magnetic field. We propose that TDs could be subject
to similar winds, explaining their fast-accreting and long-lived cavities. We present the results
of the first 2.5D global numerical simulations of TDs harbouring MDWs using the PLUTO code. We impose
a cavity in the gas distribution and consider a power law distribution for the large-scale magnetic
field strength. We assume weakly ionised discs subject to ambipolar diffusion, as expected in this
range of densities and temperatures. Our simulated TDs reach a steady state with an inner cavity
and an outer 'standard' disc. The accretion rates remain approximately constant through the entire
discs, reaching $10^{-7}~M_\odot/\text{yrs}^{-1}$ for typical surface density values. The
MDW launched from the cavity is more magnetised with a much larger lever arm than the MDW launched
from the outer disc. The material in the cavity is accreted at sonic velocities, and the cavity itself
is rotating at 70% of the Keplerian velocity due to the efficient magnetic braking imposed by the
MDW. Overall, our cavity matches the dynamical properties of an inner jet emitting disc (JED) and
of magnetically arrested discs (MADs) in black hole physics. Finally, kinematic diagnostics (wind
speeds, orbital and accretion velocities) could disentangle classical photo-evaporation from
MDW models.

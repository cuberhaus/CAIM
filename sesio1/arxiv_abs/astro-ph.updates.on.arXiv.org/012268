Stripped-envelope stars can be observed as Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars, or as less luminous hydrogen-poor
stars with low mass loss rates and transparent winds. Both types are potential progenitors of Type
I core-collapse supernovae (SNe). We use grids of core-collapse models obtained from helium stars
at different metallicities to study the effects of metallicity on the transients and remnants these
stars produce. We characterise the surface and core properties of our core collapse models, and
investigate their explodability employing three criteria. In cases where explosions are predicted,
we estimate the ejecta mass, explosion energy, nickel mass and neutron star (NS) mass. Otherwise,
we predict the mass of the resulting black hole (BH). We construct a simplified population model,
and find that the properties SNe and compact objects depend strongly on metallicity. Ejecta masses
and explosion energies for Type Ic SNe are best reproduced by models with Z=0.04 which exhibit strong
winds during core helium burning. This implies that either their mass loss rates are underestimated,
or that Type Ic SN progenitors experience mass loss through other mechanisms before exploding.
The distributions of ejecta masses, explosion energies and nickel mass for Type Ib SNe are not well
reproduced by progenitor models with WR mass loss, but are better reproduced if we assume no mass
loss in progenitors with luminosities below the minimum WR star luminosity. We find that Type Ic
SNe become more common as metallicity increases, and that the vast majority of progenitors of Type
Ib SNe must be transparent-wind stripped-envelope stars. We find several models with pre-collapse
CO-masses of up to $\sim 30 M_{\odot}$ may form $\sim 3 M_{\odot}$ BHs in fallback SNe. This may carry
important consequences for our understanding of SNe, binary BH and NS systems, X-ray binary systems
and gravitational wave transients.

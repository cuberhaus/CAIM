Several diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) have profiles with resolved sub-peaks that resemble
rotational bands of large molecules. Analysis of these profiles can constrain the sizes and geometries
of the DIB carriers, especially if the profiles exhibit clear variations along lines of sight probing
different physical conditions. Using the extensive data set from the EDIBLES survey we searched
for systematic variations in the peak-to-peak separation of these sub-peaks for the $\lambda\lambda$5797,
6379, and 6614 DIBs in lines of sight with a single dominant interstellar cloud. We used the spectra
of twelve single-cloud sight lines to measure the peak-to-peak separation in the band profile substructures
for these DIBs. We adopted the rotational contour formalism to infer the rotational constant for
each DIB carrier and the rotational excitation temperature in the sight lines. We compared these
to rotational constants for linear and spherical molecules to estimate the DIB carrier sizes. All
three DIBs have peak separations that vary systematically between lines of sight, indicating correlated
changes in the rotational excitation temperatures. We derived $B_{6614}$=$(22.2\pm8.9)\times
10^{-3}$ cm$^{-1}$, consistent with previous estimates. Assuming a similar rotational temperature
for the $\lambda$6614 DIB carrier and assuming a linear carrier, we found B$_{5797}^{\rm linear}=(5.1\pm2.0)\times10^{-3}~{\rm
cm}^{-1}$ and B$_{6379}^{\rm linear} =(2.3\pm0.9)\times10^{-3}~{\rm cm}^{-1}$. If the carriers
of those DIBs however are spherical species, their rotational constants are half that value, $B_{5797}^{\rm
spherical} = (2.6\pm1.0)\times10^{-3}~{\rm cm}^{-1}$ and $B_{6379}^{\rm spherical} = (1.1\pm0.4)\times10^{-3}~{\rm
cm}^{-1}$. We estimate molecule sizes that range from 7--9 carbon atoms ($\lambda$6614 carrier,
linear) to 77--114 carbon atoms ($\lambda$6379, spherical).

We present results from a search for high-redshift radio galaxy (H$z$RG) candidates using 1.28
GHz data in the Abell 2751 field drawn from the MeerKAT Galaxy Cluster Legacy Survey (MGCLS). We use
the H$z$RG criteria that a radio source is undetected in all-sky optical and infrared catalogues,
and has a very steep radio spectrum. We cross-match the radio catalogue against multi-wavelength
galaxy catalogues from DECaLS and AllWISE. For those radio sources with no multi-wavelength counterpart,
we further implement a radio spectral index criterium of $\alpha < -1$, using in-band spectral index
measurements from the wide-band MeerKAT data. Using a 5$\sigma$ signal-to-noise cut on the radio
flux densities, we find a total of 274 HzRG candidates: 179 ultra-steep spectrum sources, and 95
potential candidates which cannot be ruled out as they have no spectral information available.
The spectral index assignments in this work are complete above a flux density of 0.3 mJy, at least
an order of magnitude lower than existing studies in this frequency range or when extrapolating
from lower frequency limits. Our faintest HzRG candidates with and without an in-band spectral
index measurement have a 1.28\,GHz flux density of 57 $\pm$ 8 $\mu$Jy and 68 $\pm$ 13 $\mu$Jy, respectively.
Although our study is not complete down to these flux densities, our results indicate that the sensitivity
and bandwidth of the MGCLS data makes them a powerful radio resource to search for H$z$RG candidates
in the Southern sky, with 20 of the MGCLS pointings having similar image quality as the Abell~2751
field and full coverage in both DECaLS and AllWISE. Data at additional radio frequencies will be
needed for the faintest source populations, which could be provided in the near future by the MeerKAT
UHF band (580 -- 1015 MHz) at a similar resolution ($\sim$ 8-10 arcsec).

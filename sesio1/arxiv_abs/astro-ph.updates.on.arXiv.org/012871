As part of our program to identify host galaxies of known z=2-3 MgII absorbers with the Keck Cosmic
Web Imager (KCWI), we discovered a compact group giving rise to a z=2.431 DLA with ultra-strong MgII
absorption in quasar field J234628+124859. The group consists of four star-forming galaxies within
8-28 kpc and $v\sim50-300$ km s$^{-1}$ of each other, where tidal streams are weakly visible in deep
HST imaging. The group geometric centre is D=25 kpc from the quasar (D=20-40 kpc for each galaxy).
Galaxy G1 dominates the group ($1.66L_{\ast}$, ${\rm SFR}_{\rm FUV}=11.6$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$)
while G2, G3, and G4 are less massive ($0.1-0.3L_{\ast}$, ${\rm SFR}_{\rm FUV}=1.4-2.0$ M$_{\odot}$
yr$^{-1}$). Using a VLT/UVES quasar spectrum covering the HI Lyman series and metal lines such as
MgII, SiIII, and CIV, we characterised the kinematic structure and physical conditions along the
line-of-sight with cloud-by-cloud multiphase Bayesian modelling. The absorption system has
a total $\log(N(HI)/{\rm cm}^{-2})=20.53$ and an $N(HI)$-weighted mean metallicity of $\log(Z/Z_{\odot})=-0.68$,
with a very large MgII linewidth of $\Delta v\sim700$ km s$^{-1}$. The highly kinematically complex
profile is well-modelled with 30 clouds across low and intermediate ionisation phases with values
${13\lesssim\log(N(HI)/{\rm cm}^{-2})\lesssim20}$ and $-3\lesssim\log(Z/Z_{\odot})\lesssim1$.
Comparing these properties to the galaxy properties, we infer a wide range of gaseous environments,
including metal-rich outflows, metal-poor IGM accretion, and tidal streams from galaxy--galaxy
interactions. This diversity of structures forms the intragroup medium around a complex compact
group environment at the epoch of peak star formation activity. Surveys of low redshift compact
groups would benefit from obtaining a more complete census of this medium for characterising evolutionary
pathways.

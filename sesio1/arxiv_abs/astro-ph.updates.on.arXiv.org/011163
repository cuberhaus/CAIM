We present high-fidelity cosmology results from a blinded joint analysis of galaxy-galaxy weak
lensing ($\Delta\!\Sigma$) and projected galaxy clustering ($w_{\rm p}$) measured from the Hyper
Suprime-Cam Year-1 (HSC-Y1) data and spectroscopic Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxy catalogs
in the redshift range $0.15<z<0.7$. We define luminosity-limited samples of SDSS galaxies to serve
as the tracers of $w_{\rm p}$ in three spectroscopic redshift bins, and as the lens samples for $\Delta\!\Sigma$.
For the $\Delta\!\Sigma$ measurements, we select a single sample of 4 million source galaxies over
140 deg$^2$ from HSC-Y1 with photometric redshifts (photo-$z$) greater than 0.75, enabling a better
handle of photo-$z$ errors by comparing the $\Delta\!\Sigma$ amplitudes for the three lens redshift
bins. For cosmological parameter inference, we use an input galaxy-halo connection model built
on the {\tt Dark Emulator} package with a halo occupation distribution that includes nuisance parameters
to marginalize over modeling uncertainties. We model the $\Delta\!\Sigma$ and $w_{\rm p}$ measurements
on scales from $R\simeq 3$ and $2\,h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$, respectively, up to $30\,h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$
assuming a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. With various tests using mock catalogs described in Miyatake
et al. (2021), we show that any bias in the clustering amplitude $S_8\equiv \sigma_8(\Omega_{\rm
m}/0.3)^{0.5}$ due to uncertainties in the galaxy-halo connection is less than $\sim50$\% of the
statistical uncertainty of $S_8$, {\it unless} the assembly bias effect is unexpectedly large.
Our best-fit models have $S_8=0.795^{+0.049}_{-0.042}$ (mode and 68\% credible interval) for
the flat $\Lambda$CDM model; we find tighter constraints on the quantity $S_8(\alpha=0.17)\equiv\sigma_8(\Omega_{\rm
m}/0.3)^{0.17} =0.745^{+0.039}_{-0.031}$. (abriged)

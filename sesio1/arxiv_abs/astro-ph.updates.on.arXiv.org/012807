OB stars powering stellar bowshock nebulae (SBNe) have been presumed to have large peculiar velocities.
We measured peculiar velocities of SBN central stars to assess their kinematics relative to the
general O star population using $Gaia$ EDR3 data for 267 SBN central stars and a sample of 455 Galactic
O stars to derive projected velocities $v_{\rm 2D}$. For a subset of each sample we obtained new optical
spectroscopy to measure radial velocities and identify multiple-star systems. We find a minimum
multiplicity fraction of 36$\pm$6% among SBN central stars, consistent with $>$28% among runaway
Galactic O stars. The large multiplicity fraction among runaways implicates very efficient dynamical
ejection rather than binary-supernova origins. The median $v_{\rm 2D}$ of SBN central stars is
$v_{\rm 2D}$=14.6 km s$^{-1}$, larger than the median $v_{\rm 2D}$=11.4 km s$^{-1}$ for non-bowshock
O stars. Central stars of SBNe have a runaway ($v_{\rm 2D}$$>$25 km s$^{-1}$) fraction of 24$^{+9}_{-7}$%,
consistent with the 22$^{+3}_{-3}$% for control-sample O stars. Most (76%) of SBNe central stars
are not runaways. Our analysis of alignment ($\Delta_{\rm PA}$) between the nebular morphological
and $v_{\rm 2D}$ kinematic position angles reveals two populations: a highly aligned ($\sigma_{PA}$=25$^\circ$)
population that includes stars with the largest $v_{\rm 2D}$ (31% of the sample) and a random (non-aligned)
population (69% of the sample). SBNe that lie within or near HII regions comprise a larger fraction
of this latter component than SBNe in isolated environments, implicating localized ISM flows as
a factor shaping their orientations and morphologies. We outline a new conceptual approach to computing
the Solar LSR motion, yielding [U$_\odot$, V$_\odot$, W$_\odot$]= [5.5, 7.5, 4.5] km s$^{-1}$.

This paper is the second part of a series of studies discussing a novel attitude determination method
for nano-satellites. Our approach is based on the utilization of thermal imaging sensors to determine
the direction of the Sun and the nadir with respect to the satellite with sub-degree accuracy. The
proposed method is planned to be applied during the Cubesats Applied for MEasuring and LOcalising
Transients (CAMELOT) mission aimed at detecting and localizing gamma-ray bursts with an efficiency
and accuracy comparable to large gamma-ray space observatories. In this paper we introduce a simulation
model aimed at testing the applicability of our attitude determination approach. Its first part
simulates the orbit and rotation of a satellite with arbitrary initial conditions while its second
part applies our attitude determination algorithm which is based on a multiplicative extended
Kalman filter. The simulated satellite is assumed to be equipped with a GPS system, MEMS gyroscopes
and the infrasensors. These instruments provide the required data input for the Kalman filter.
We demonstrate the applicability of our attitude determination algorithm by simulating the motion
of a nano-satellite on Low Earth Orbit. Our results show that the attitude determination may have
a 1$\sigma$ error of $\sim30'$ even with a large gyroscope drift during the orbital periods when
the infrasensors provide both the direction of the Sun and the Earth (the nadir). This accuracy is
an improvement on the point source detection accuracy of the infrasensors. However, the attitude
determination error can get as high as 25$^{\circ}$ during periods when the Sun is occulted by the
Earth. We show that following an occultation period the attitude information is immediately recovered
by the Kalman filter once the Sun is observed again.

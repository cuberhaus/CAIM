The physical origin of gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission is still subject to debate after five
decades (photosphere or synchrotron). Here, firstly we find that many observed characteristics
of 15 long GRBs, which have the highest prompt emission efficiency $\epsilon _{\gamma}$ ($\epsilon_{\gamma
}\gtrsim 80\%$), strongly support the photosphere (thermal) emission origin: (1) The relation
between $E_{\text{p}}$ and $E_{\text{iso}}$ is almost $E_{\text{p}}\propto (E_{\text{iso}})^{1/4}$
, and the dispersion is quite small. (2) The simple power-law shape of the X-ray afterglow light curves
and the significant reverse shock signals in the optical afterglow light curves. (3) Best-fitted
by the cutoff power-law model for the time-integrated spectrum. (4) The consistent efficiency
from observation (with $E_{\text{iso}}/E_{k}$) and the prediction of photosphere emission model
(with $\eta /\Gamma $). Then, we further investigate the characteristics of the long GRBs for two
distinguished samples ($\epsilon _{\gamma }\gtrsim 50\%$ and $\epsilon _{\gamma }\lesssim 50\%$).
It is found that the different distributions for $E_{\text{p}}$ and $E_{\text{iso}}$, and the
similar observed efficiency (from the X-ray afterglow) and theoretically predicted efficiency
(from the prompt emission or the optical afterglow) well follow the prediction of photosphere emission
model. Also, based on the same efficiency, we derive an excellent correlation of $\Gamma \propto
E_{\text{iso}}^{1/8}E_{\text{p}}^{1/2}/(T_{90})^{1/4}$ to estimate $\Gamma $. Finally,
the different distributions for $E_{\text{p}}$ and $E_{\text{iso}}$, and the consistent efficiency
exist for the short GRBs. Besides, we give a natural explanation of the extended emission ($\epsilon
_{\gamma }\lesssim 50\%$) and the main pulse ($\epsilon _{\gamma }\gtrsim 50\%$).

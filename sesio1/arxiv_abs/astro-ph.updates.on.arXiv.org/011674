Evidence is mounting that recent multi-wavelength detections of fast blue optical transients
(FBOTs) in star-forming galaxies comprise a new class of transients, whose origin is yet to be understood.
We show that hydrogen-rich collapsing stars that launch relativistic jets near the central engine
can naturally explain the entire set of FBOT observables. The jet-star interaction forms a mildly-relativistic
shocked jet (inner cocoon) component, which powers cooling emission that dominates the high velocity
optical signal during the first few weeks, with a typical energy of $ \sim 10^{50}-10^{51} $ erg.
During this time, the cocoon radial energy distribution implies that the optical lightcurve exhibits
a fast decay of $ L \propto t^{-2.4} $. After a few weeks, when the velocity of the emitting shell is
$ \sim 0.01 $ c, the cocoon becomes transparent, and the cooling stellar envelope governs the emission.
During this transition, discontinuities may emerge in the lightcurve and spectra, as have been
observed in a few FBOTs, such as AT2018cow. The interaction between the cocoon forward shock and
the dense circumstellar winds generates synchrotron self-absorbed emission in the radio bands,
featuring a steady rise on a month timescale. After a few months, if the jet successfully pierces
the stellar envelope, it decelerates, enters the observer's line of sight, and powers the peak of
the radio lightcurve, which rapidly decays thereafter. The jet (and the inner cocoon) become optically
thin to X-rays $ \sim $ day after the collapse, allowing X-ray photons to diffuse from the central
engine that launched the jet to the observer. Cocoon cooling emission is expected at higher volumetric
rates than gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) by a factor of a few, similar to FBOTs. We rule out uncollimated
outflows, however both GRB jets and failed collimated jets are compatible with all observables.

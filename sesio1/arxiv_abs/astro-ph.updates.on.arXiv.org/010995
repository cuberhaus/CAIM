[abridged] Measurements of relative isotope abundances can provide unique insights into the formation
and evolution histories of celestial bodies. The five stable isotopes of titanium are used to study
the early history of the solar system and constrain Galactic chemical models. The minor isotopes
of titanium are relatively abundant compared to those of other elements, making them more accessible
for challenging observations. We assessed the feasibility of performing titanium isotope measurements
in exoplanet atmospheres, and in particular, whether processing techniques used for high-resolution
spectroscopy affect the derived isotope ratios. We used an archival high-dispersion CARMENES
spectrum of the M-dwarf GJ 1002 as a proxy for an exoplanet observed at very high signal-to-noise.
Spectral retrievals using petitRADTRANS models were performed on both narrow (7045-7090 {\AA})
and wide (7045-7500 {\AA}) wavelength regions, resulting in isotope ratios and uncertainties.
These retrievals were repeated on the spectrum with its continuum removed to mimic typical high-dispersion
exoplanet observations. The relative abundances of all minor Ti isotopes are found to be slightly
enhanced compared to terrestrial values. Loss of continuum information from broadband spectral
filtering has little effect on the isotope ratios. The CARMENES spectrum was subsequently degraded
by adding varying levels of Gaussian noise to estimate the signal-to-noise requirements for future
exoplanet atmospheric observations. For the wide wavelength range, a spectrum with signal-to-noise
of 5 is required to determine the isotope ratios with relative errors $\lesssim$10%. Super Jupiters
at large angular separations from their host star are the most accessible exoplanets, requiring
about an hour of observing time on 8-meter-class telescopes, and less than a minute of observing
time with the future Extremely Large Telescope.

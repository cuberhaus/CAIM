[abridged] Probing the faint end of the number counts at mm wavelengths is important to identify
the origin of the extragalactic background light in this regime. Aided by strong gravitational
lensing, ALMA observations towards massive galaxy clusters have opened a window to disentangle
this origin, allowing to resolve sub-mJy dusty star-forming galaxies. We aim to derive number counts
at 1.1 mm down to flux densities fainter than 0.1 mJy, based on ALMA observations towards five Hubble
Frontier Fields (FF) galaxy clusters, following a statistical approach to correct for lensing
effects. We created a source catalog that includes 29 ALMA 1.1 mm continuum detections down to a 4.5sigma
significance. We derived source intrinsic flux densities using public lensing models. We folded
the uncertainties in both magnifications and source redshifts into the number counts through Monte
Carlo simulations. We derive cumulative number counts over two orders of magnitude down to 0.01
mJy after correction for lensing effects. Cosmic variance estimates are all exceeded by uncertainties
in our median combined cumulative counts that come from both our Monte Carlo simulations and Poisson
statistics. Our number counts are consistent to 1sigma with most of recent ALMA estimates and galaxy
evolution models. However, below 0.1 mJy, they are lower by 0.4 dex compared to all deep ALMA studies
but ASPECS-LP. Importantly, the flattening found for our cumulative counts extends further to
0.01 mJy. Our results bring further support in line of the flattening of the number counts reported
previously by us and ASPECS-LP, which has been interpreted by a recent galaxy evolution model as
a measurement of the "knee" of the infrared luminosity function at high redshift. Our estimates
of the contribution to the EBL in the FFs suggest that we may be resolving most of the EBL at 1.1mm down
to 0.01 mJy.

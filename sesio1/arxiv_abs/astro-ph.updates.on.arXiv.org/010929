Recent advances in deep dedicated imaging surveys over the past decade have uncovered a surprisingly
large number of extremely faint low surface brightness galaxies with large physical sizes called
ultra diffuse galaxies (UDGs) in clusters and, more recently, in lower density environments. As
part of the MATLAS survey, a deep imaging large program at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT),
our team has identified 2210 dwarf galaxies, 59 (~3%) of which qualify as UDGs. Averaging over the
survey area, we find ~0.4 UDG per square degree. They are found in a range of low to moderate density
environments, although 61% of the sample fall within the virial radii of groups. Based on a detailed
analysis of their photometric and structural properties, we find that the MATLAS UDGs do not show
significant differences from the traditional dwarfs, except from the predefined size and surface
brightness cut. Their median color is as red as the one measured in galaxy clusters, albeit with a
narrower color range. The majority of the UDGs are visually classified as dwarf ellipticals with
log stellar masses of ~6.5-8.7. The fraction of nucleated UDGs (~34%) is roughly the same as the nucleated
fraction of the traditional dwarfs. Only five (~8%) UDGs show signs of tidal disruption and only
two are tidal dwarf galaxy candidates. A study of globular cluster (GC) candidates selected in the
CFHT images finds no evidence of a higher GC specific frequency S_N for UDGs than for classical dwarfs,
contrary to what is found in most clusters. The UDG halo-to-stellar mass ratio distribution, as
estimated from the GC counts, peaks at roughly the same value as for the traditional dwarfs, but spans
the smaller range of ~10-2000. We interpret these results to mean that the large majority of the field-to-group
UDGs do not have a different formation scenario than traditional dwarfs.

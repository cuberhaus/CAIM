Large spectroscopic surveys of the Milky Way need to be calibrated against a sample of benchmark
stars to ensure the reliable determination of atmospheric parameters. We present new fundamental
stellar parameters of seven giant and subgiant stars that will serve as benchmarks. The aim is to
reach a precision of 1% in the effective temperature. This precision is essential for accurate determinations
of the full set of fundamental parameters and abundances of stars observed by the surveys. We observed
HD121370 (etaBoo), HD161797 (muHer), HD175955, HD182736, HD185351, HD188512 (betaAql), and
HD189349 using the high angular resolution optical interferometric instrument PAVO/CHARA. The
limb-darkening corrections were determined from 3D model atmospheres based on the STAGGER grid.
The Teff were determined directly from the Stefan-Boltzmann relation, with an iterative procedure
to interpolate over tables of bolometric corrections. We estimated surface gravities from comparisons
to Dartmouth stellar evolution model tracks. The spectroscopic observations were collected from
the ELODIE and FIES spectrographs. We estimated metallicities ([Fe/H]) from a 1D non-local thermodynamic
equilibrium (NLTE) abundance analysis of unblended lines of neutral and singly ionised iron. For
six of the seven stars we measure Teff to better than 1%. For one star, HD189349, the uncertainty in
Teff is 2% due to an uncertain bolometric flux. We do not recommend this star as a benchmark until this
measurement can be improved. Median uncertainties for all stars in logg and [Fe/H]} are 0.034dex
and 0.07dex, respectively. All the fundamental stellar parameters were based on consistently
combining interferometric observations, 3D limb-darkening modelling and spectroscopic analysis.
This paper follows our previous papers including dwarfs and metal-poor stars.

Multi-dimensional (magneto-)hydrodynamical simulations of physical processes in stellar interiors
depend on a multitude of uncalibrated free parameters, which set the spatial and time scales of their
computations. We aim to provide an asteroseismic calibration of the wave and convective Rossby
numbers, and of the stiffness at the interface between the convective core and radiative envelope
of intermediate-mass stars. We deduce these quantities for rotating dwarfs from the observed properties
of their identified gravity and gravito-inertial modes. We rely on near-core rotation rates and
asteroseismic models of 26 B- and 37 F-type dwarf pulsators derived from 4-year Kepler space photometry,
high-resolution spectroscopy and Gaia astrometry in the literature to deduce their convective
and wave Rossby numbers. We compute the stiffness at the convection/radiation interface from the
inferred maximum buoyancy frequency at the interface and the convective turnover frequency in
the core. We use those asteroseismically inferred quantities to make predictions of convective
penetration levels, local flux levels of gravito-inertial waves triggered by the convective core,
and of the cores' potential rotational and magnetic states. Our sample of 63 gravito-inertial mode
pulsators covers near-core rotation rates from almost zero up to the critical rate. The frequencies
of their identified modes lead to models with stiffness values between $10^{2.69}$ and $10^{3.60}$
for the B-type pulsators, while those of F-type stars cover the range from $10^{3.47}$ to $10^{4.52}$.
The convective Rossby numbers derived from the maximum convective diffusion coefficient in the
convective core, based on mixing length theory and a value of the mixing length coefficient relevant
for these pulsators, vary between $10^{-2.3}$ and $10^{-0.8}$ for B-type stars and $10^{-3}$ and
$10^{-1.5}$ for F-type stars. (abridged)

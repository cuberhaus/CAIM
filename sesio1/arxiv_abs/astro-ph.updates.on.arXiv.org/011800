Barium (Ba) stars are polluted by material enriched in the slow neutron capture (s-process) elements
synthesised in the interior of their former asymptotic giant branch (AGB) companion star, which
is now a white dwarf. We compare individual Ba star abundance patterns to AGB nucleosynthesis models
to verify if the AGB model mass is compatible with independently derived AGB mass. We selected a sample
of 28 Ba stars for which both self-consistent spectroscopic observation and analysis are available
and stellar mass determinations, via positioning the star on the HR diagram and comparing with evolutionary
tracks. For this sample stars we considered both previously and recently derived elemental abundances.
Then, we performed a detailed comparison of these s-process elemental abundances to different
AGB nucleosynthesis models from the Monash and the FRUITY theoretical data sets. We simplified
the binary mass transfer by calculating dilution factors to match the [Ce/Fe] value of each star
when using different AGB models, and we then compared the diluted model abundances to the complete
Ba-star abundance pattern. Our comparison confirms that low mass, non-rotating AGB stellar models
with 13C as the main neutron source are the polluters of the vast majority of the considered Ba stars.
Out of the 28 stars, in 21 cases the models are in good agreement with both the determined abundances
and the independently derived AGB mass, although in 16 cases higher observed abundances of Nb, Ru,
Mo and/or Nd, Sm than predicted. For 3 stars we obtain a match to the abundances only by considering
models with masses lower than those independently determined. Finally, 4 stars show much higher
first s-process peak abundance values than the model predictions, which may represent the signature
of a physical and/or nucleosynthetic process that is not represented in the set of models considered
here.

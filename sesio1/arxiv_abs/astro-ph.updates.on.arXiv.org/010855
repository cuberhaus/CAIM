The eFEDS survey is a proof-of-concept mini-survey designed to demonstrate the survey science
capabilities of SRG/eROSITA. It covers an area of 140 square degrees where 542 galaxy clusters have
been detected out to a redshift of 1.3. The eFEDS field is partly embedded in the Hyper Suprime-Cam
Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) S19A data release, which covers 510 square degrees, containing
approximately 36 million galaxies. This galaxy catalogue is used to construct a sample of 180 shear-selected
galaxy clusters. In the common area to both surveys, about 90 square degrees, we investigate the
effects of selection methods in the galaxy cluster detection by comparing the X-ray selected, eFEDS,
and the shear-selected, HSC-SSP S19A, galaxy cluster samples. There are 25 shear-selected clusters
in the eFEDS footprint. The relation between X-ray bolometric luminosity and weak-lensing mass
is investigated, and it is found that the normalization of the bolometric luminosity and mass relation
of the X-ray selected and shear-selected samples is consistent within $1\sigma$. Moreover, we
found that the dynamical state and merger fraction of the shear-selected clusters is not different
from the X-ray selected ones. Four shear-selected clusters are undetected in X-rays. A close inspection
reveals that one is the result of projection effects, while the other three have an X-ray flux below
the ultimate eROSITA detection limit. Finally, 43% of the shear-selected clusters lie in superclusters.
Our results indicate that the scaling relation between X-ray bolometric luminosity and true cluster
mass of the shear-selected cluster sample is consistent with the eFEDS sample. There is no significant
population of X-ray underluminous clusters, indicating that X-ray selected cluster samples are
complete and can be used as an accurate cosmological probe.

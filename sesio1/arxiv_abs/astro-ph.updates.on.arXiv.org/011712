The detection of the accelerated expansion of the Universe has been one of the major breakthroughs
in modern cosmology. Several cosmological probes (CMB, SNe Ia, BAO) have been studied in depth to
better understand the nature of the mechanism driving this acceleration, and they are being currently
pushed to their limits, obtaining remarkable constraints that allowed us to shape the standard
cosmological model. In parallel to that, however, the percent precision achieved has recently
revealed apparent tensions between measurements obtained from different methods. These are either
indicating some unaccounted systematic effects, or are pointing toward new physics. Following
the development of CMB, SNe, and BAO cosmology, it is critical to extend our selection of cosmological
probes. Novel probes can be exploited to validate results, control or mitigate systematic effects,
and, most importantly, to increase the accuracy and robustness of our results. This review is meant
to provide a state-of-art benchmark of the latest advances in emerging beyond-standard cosmological
probes. We present how several different methods can become a key resource for observational cosmology.
In particular, we review cosmic chronometers, quasars, gamma-ray bursts, standard sirens, lensing
time-delay with galaxies and clusters, cosmic voids, neutral hydrogen intensity mapping, surface
brightness fluctuations, secular redshift drift, and clustering of standard candles. The review
describes the method, systematics, and results of each probe in a homogeneous way, giving the reader
a clear picture of the available innovative methods that have been introduced in recent years and
how to apply them. The review also discusses the potential synergies and complementarities between
the various probes, exploring how they will contribute to the future of modern cosmology.

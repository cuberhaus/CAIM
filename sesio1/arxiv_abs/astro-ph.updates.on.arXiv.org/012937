About a third of the hot subdwarfs of spectral type B, which are mostly core-helium burning objects
on the extreme horizontal branch, are found in close binaries with cool, low-mass stellar, substellar,
or white dwarf companions. They can show light variations due to different phenomena. We used light
curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite and the \textit{K2} space mission to look
for more sdB binaries. Their light curves can be used to study the hot subdwarf primaries and their
companions and get orbital, atmospheric, and absolute parameters for those systems. By classifying
the light variations and combining this with the fit of the spectral energy distribution, the distance
derived by the parallaxes obtained by \textit{Gaia} and the atmospheric parameters, we could derive
the nature of the primary and secondary in 122 (75\%) of the known sdB binaries and 82 newly found reflection
effect systems. We derive absolute masses, radii, and luminosities for a total of 39 hot subdwarfs
with cool, low-mass companions, as well 29 known and newly found sdBs with white dwarf companions.
The mass distribution of hot subdwarfs with cool, low-mass stellar and substellar companions differs
from those with white dwarf companions, implying they come from different populations. By comparing
the period and minimum companion mass distributions, we find that there are several different populations
of hot subdwarfs with white dwarf binaries. We also derive the first orbital period distribution
for hot subdwarfs with cool, low-mass stellar or substellar systems selected from light variations
instead of radial velocity variations. It shows a period distribution from 1.5 hours to 35 hours
compared to the distribution of hot subdwarfs with white dwarfs, which ranges from 1 hour to 30 days.
These period distributions can be used to constrain the previous common envelope phase.

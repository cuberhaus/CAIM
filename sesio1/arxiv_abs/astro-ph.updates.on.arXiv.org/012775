With the most recent Gaia data release the number of sources with complete 6D phase space information
(position and velocity) has increased to well over 33 million stars, while stellar astrophysical
parameters are provided for more than 470 million sources, in addition to the identification of
over 11 million variable stars. Using the astrophysical parameters and variability classifications
provided in Gaia DR3, we select various stellar populations to explore and identify non-axisymmetric
features in the disc of the Milky Way in both configuration and velocity space. Using more about 580
thousand sources identified as hot OB stars, together with 988 known open clusters younger than
100 million years, we map the spiral structure associated with star formation 4-5 kpc from the Sun.
We select over 2800 Classical Cepheids younger than 200 million years, which show spiral features
extending as far as 10 kpc from the Sun in the outer disc. We also identify more than 8.7 million sources
on the red giant branch (RGB), of which 5.7 million have line-of-sight velocities, allowing the
velocity field of the Milky Way to be mapped as far as 8 kpc from the Sun, including the inner disc. The
spiral structure revealed by the young populations is consistent with recent results using Gaia
EDR3 astrometry and source lists based on near infrared photometry, showing the Local (Orion) arm
to be at least 8 kpc long, and an outer arm consistent with what is seen in HI surveys, which seems to
be a continuation of the Perseus arm into the third quadrant. Meanwhile, the subset of RGB stars with
velocities clearly reveals the large scale kinematic signature of the bar in the inner disc, as well
as evidence of streaming motions in the outer disc that might be associated with spiral arms or bar
resonances. (abridged)

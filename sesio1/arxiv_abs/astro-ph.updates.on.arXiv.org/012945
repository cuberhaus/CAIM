Recent local measurements of the Hubble constant made using supernovae have delivered a value that
differs by $\sim$5$\sigma$ (statistical error) from predictions using the Cosmic Microwave Background
(CMB), or using Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) constraints,
which are themselves consistent. The effective volume covered by the supernovae is small compared
to the other probes, and it is therefore interesting to consider whether sample variance (often
also called cosmic variance) is a significant contributor to the offset. We consider four ways of
calculating the sample variance: (i) perturbation theory applied to the luminosity distance,
which is the most common method considered in the literature; (ii) perturbation of cosmological
parameters, as is commonly used to alleviate super-sample covariance in sets of N-body simulations;
(iii) a new method based on the variance between perturbed spherical top-hat regions; (iv) using
numerical N-body simulations. All give consistent results showing that, for the Pantheon supernova
sample, sample variance can only lead to fluctuations in $H_0$ of order $\pm1$ km s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$
or less. While this is not in itself a new result, the agreement between the methods used adds to its
robustness. Furthermore, it is instructive to see how the different methods fit together. We also
investigate the internal variance of the $H_{0}$ measurement using SH0ES and Pantheon data. By
searching for an offset between measurements in opposite hemispheres, we find that the direction
coincident with the CMB dipole has a higher $H_{0}$ measurement than the opposite hemisphere by
roughly 4 km s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$. We compare this with a large number of simulations and find that
the size of this asymmetry is statistically likely, but the preference of direction may indicate
that further calibration is needed.

We investigate the conditions that facilitate galactic-scale outflows using a sample of 155 typical
star-forming galaxies at $z$~2 drawn from the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) survey. The
sample includes deep rest-frame UV spectroscopy from the Keck Low-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer
(LRIS), which provides spectral coverage of several low-ionisation interstellar (LIS) metal
absorption lines and Ly$\alpha$ emission. Outflow velocities are calculated from the centroids
of the LIS absorption and/or Ly$\alpha$ emission, as well as the highest-velocity component of
the outflow from the blue wings of the LIS absorption lines. Outflow velocities are found to be marginally
correlated or independent of galaxy properties, such as star-formation rate (SFR) and star-formation
rate surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$). Outflow velocity scales with SFR as a power-law with
index 0.24, which suggests that the outflows may be primarily driven by mechanical energy generated
by supernovae explosions, as opposed to radiation pressure acting on dusty material. On the other
hand, outflow velocity and $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ are not significantly correlated, which may be due
to the limited dynamic range of $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ probed by our sample. The relationship between
outflow velocity and $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ normalised by stellar mass ($\Sigma_{\rm sSFR}$), as
a proxy for gravitational potential, suggests that strong outflows (e.g., > 200 km s$^{-1}$) appear
ubiquitous above a threshold of log($\Sigma_{\rm sSFR}/\rm{yr}^{-1}\ \rm{kpc}^{-2}$) ~ -11.3,
and that above this threshold, outflow velocity uncouples from $\Sigma_{\rm sSFR}$. These results
highlight the need for higher resolution spectroscopic data and spatially resolved imaging to
test the driving mechanisms of outflows predicted by theory.

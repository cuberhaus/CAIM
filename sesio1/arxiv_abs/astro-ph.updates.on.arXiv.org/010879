Likelihood-free inference provides a rigorous approach to preform Bayesian analysis using forward
simulations only. The main advantage of likelihood-free methods is its ability to account for complex
physical processes and observational effects in forward simulations. Here we explore the potential
of likelihood-free forward modeling for Bayesian cosmological inference using the redshift evolution
of the cluster abundance combined with weak-lensing mass calibration. We use two complementary
likelihood-free methods, namely Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) and Density-Estimation
Likelihood-Free Inference (DELFI), to develop an analysis procedure for inference of the cosmological
parameters $(\Omega_\mathrm{m},\sigma_8)$ and the mass scale of the survey sample. Adopting
an eROSITA-like selection function and a 10-percent scatter in the observable-mass relation in
a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with $\Omega_\mathrm{m}=0.286$ and $\sigma_8=0.82$, we create
a synthetic catalog of observable-selected NFW clusters in a survey area of 50 deg$^2$. The stacked
tangential shear profile and the number counts in redshift bins are used as summary statistics for
both methods. By performing a series of forward simulations, we obtain convergent solutions for
the posterior distribution from both methods. We find that ABC recovers broader posteriors than
DELFI, especially for the $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ parameter. For a weak-lensing survey with a source
density of $n_\mathrm{g}=20$ arcmin$^{-2}$, we obtain posterior constraints on $S_8=\sigma_8(\Omega_\mathrm{m}/0.3)^{0.3}$
of $0.836 \pm 0.032$ and $0.810 \pm 0.019$ from ABC and DELFI, respectively. The analysis framework
developed in this study will be particularly powerful for cosmological inference with ongoing
cluster cosmology programs, such as the XMM-XXL survey and the eROSITA all-sky survey, in combination
with wide-field weak-lensing surveys.

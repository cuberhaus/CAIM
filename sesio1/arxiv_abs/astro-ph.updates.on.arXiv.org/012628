AGN bubbles could play an important role in accelerating high-energy CRs and galactic feedback.
Only in nearby galaxies could we have high enough angular resolution in multi-wavelengths to study
the sub-kpc environment of the AGN, where the bubbles are produced and strongly interact with the
surrounding ISM. In this paper, we present the latest Chandra observations of the Virgo cluster
galaxy NGC 4438, which hosts multi-scale bubbles detected in various bands. The galaxy also has
low current star formation activity, so these bubbles are evidently produced by the AGN rather than
a starburst. We present spatially resolved spectral analysis of the Chandra data of the $\sim3^{\prime\prime}\times5^{\prime\prime}$
($\sim200{\rm~pc}\times350\rm~pc$) nuclear bubble of NGC 4438. The power law tail in the X-ray
spectra can be most naturally explained as synchrotron emission from high-energy CR leptons. The
hot gas temperature increases, while the overall contribution of the non-thermal X-ray emission
decreases with the vertical distance from the galactic plane. We calculate the synchrotron cooling
timescale of the CR leptons responsible for the non-thermal hard X-ray emission to be only a few tens
to a few hundreds of years. The thermal pressure of the hot gas is about three times the magnetic pressure,
but the current data cannot rule out the possibility that they are still in pressure balance. The
spatially resolved spectroscopy presented in this paper may have important constraints on how
the AGN accelerates CRs and drives outflows. We also discover a transient X-ray source only $\sim5^{\prime\prime}$
from the nucleus of NGC 4438. The source was not detected in 2002 and 2008, but became quite X-ray bright
in March 2020, with an average 0.5-7 keV luminosity of $\sim10^{39}\rm~ergs~s^{-1}$.

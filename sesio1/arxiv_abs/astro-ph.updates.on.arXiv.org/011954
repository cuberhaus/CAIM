In the realm of massive stars, strong binary interaction is commonplace. One extreme case are overcontact
systems, which is expected to be part of the evolution of all stars evolving towards a merger, and
is hypothesized to play a role in the formation of binary black holes. However, important simplifications
are made to model the evolution of overcontact binaries, namely that tidal or rotational deformation
is frequently ignored. Yet, both observation and theory show that overcontact stars are heavily
tidally deformed, leaving a potentially important effect on the outer layers unaccounted for in
models. In this work we develop the methodology to represented tidally deformed stars. Using numerical
methods, we compute the structure correction factors to the 1D spherical stellar structure equations
due to the binary Roche potential, and compare them to existing results and the structure corrections
of single rotating stars. We implement the new structure correction factors into the stellar evolution
code MESA and explore several case studies. We compare the differences between our simulations
when no rotation is included, when we treat rotation using single star corrections (i.e. only accounting
for centrifugal deformation) or when we use tidal deformation. We find that ignoring rotation in
deformed detached eclipsing binaries can produce a radius discrepancy of up to 5%. The difference
between tidal and single star centrifugal distortion models is more benign at 1%, showing that single
rotating star models are a suitable approximation of tidally deformed stars in a binary system.
In overcontact configurations, we find a similar 5% variation in surface properties as a result
of tidal distortion with respect to non-rotating models, showing that it is inappropriate to model
binary stars that fill their Roche lobe significantly, as non-rotating.

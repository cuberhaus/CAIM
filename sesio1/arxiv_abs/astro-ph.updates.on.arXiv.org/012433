Winds from massive stars have recently been deemed promising sites for investigating relativistic
particle acceleration. Particularly, the resulting bow shock from the interaction of the winds
of runaway stars with interstellar matter has been observed at multiple wavelengths. Here we investigate
the O4If star, BD+433654, the bow shock of which is, so far, the only one proven to radiate both thermally
and non-thermally at radio frequencies. We also consider NGC7635 as a bow shock candidate and examine
its apex for indications of thermal and non-thermal radio emission. We observed both sources with
the VLA at 4-8 GHz and 8-12 GHz, and with the Effelsberg telescope at 4-8 GHz. We analysed data from
both telescopes individually and combined, obtained their spectral index maps and calculated
their Spectral Energy Distributions. We present the first high-resolution maps of radio emission
from NGC7635. We find that both emit non-thermal emission in the radio regime, with the clearest
evidence for NGC7635. Our results are less conclusive for BD+433654, as the emission from its bow
shock becomes weaker and fainter at higher radio frequencies. Our results extend the previous radio
results for the BD+433654 bow shock to higher frequencies. Modelling of our data for both sources
shows that accelerated electrons at the wind termination shock are a plausible source for the non-thermal
radio emission, but energetics arguments suggest that any non-thermal X-ray and $\gamma$-ray
emission could be significantly below existing upper limits. Enhanced synchrotron emission from
compressed Galactic cosmic rays in the radiative bow shock could also explain the radio emission
from the BD+433654 bow shock but not NGC7635. Non-detection of point-like radio emission from BD+433654
puts an upper limit on the mass-loss rate of the star that is lower than values quoted in the literature.

Context: We investigate the evolution of the sheath and leading edge (LE) structure of interplanetary
coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) as function of distance in the inner heliosphere. Results are related
both to the magnetic ejecta (ME) and to the ambient solar wind (SW). Aims: From a sample of 40 well-observed
Helios 1/2 events, we derive the average density separately for sheath, LE, and ME. The results are
placed into comparison with the upstream SW to investigate at which distance the sheath is formed.
Methods: We use plasma and magnetic field measurements from Helios 1/2 data in the distance range
0.3-1 au from the ICME list by Bothmer and Schwenn (1998). For comparison, we add a sample of four ICMEs
observed with PSP in 2019-2021 covering 0.32-0.62 au. Results. At the distance of ~13 Rs, the CME
sheath becomes denser than the ambient SW density. At ~38 Rs the sheath structure density starts
to dominate over the density within the ME. The ME density falls below the ambient SW density at ~230
Rs. Besides the well-known expansion of the ME, the sheath size shows a weak positive correlation
with distance, while the LE does not expand. We find a moderate anti-correlation between sheath
density and local SW plasma speed upstream of the ICME shock. An empirical relation is derived connecting
the ambient SW speed with sheath and LE density. Conclusions: The average starting distance for
actual sheath formation is found to be located at ~13 Rs. The ME expansion changes strongly at ~38
Rs, leading to a density dominance of the sheath structure. The LE can be understood as a structure
isolated from the ambient SW flow. The results allow for better interpretation of ICME evolution
and possibly mass increase due to sheath enlargement. The empirical results between sheath and
LE density and ambient SW speed can be used for more detailed modeling of ICME evolution in the inner
heliosphere.

NASA's Juno mission recently reported Jupiter's high-degree (degree $\ell$, azimuthal order
$m$ $=4,2$) Love number $k_{42}=1.289\pm0.063$ ($1\sigma$), an order of magnitude above the hydrostatic
$k_{42}$ obtained in a nonrotating Jupiter model. After numerically modeling rotation, the hydrostatic
$k_{42}=1.743\pm0.002$ is still $7\sigma$ away from the observation, raising doubts about our
understanding of Jupiter's tidal response. Here, we use first-order perturbation theory to explain
the hydrostatic $k_{42}$ result analytically. We use a simple Jupiter equation of state ($n=1$
polytrope) to obtain the fractional change in $k_{42}$ when comparing a rotating model with a nonrotating
model. Our analytical result shows that the hydrostatic $k_{42}$ is dominated by the tidal response
at $\ell=m=2$ coupled into the spherical harmonic $\ell,m=4,2$ by the planet's oblate figure.
The $\ell=4$ normalization in $k_{42}$ introduces an orbital factor $(a/s)^2$ into $k_{42}$,
where $a$ is the satellite semimajor axis and $s$ is Jupiter's average radius. As a result, different
Galilean satellites produce a different $k_{42}$. We conclude that high-degree tesseral Love
numbers ($\ell> m$, $m\geq2$) are dominated by lower-degree Love numbers and thus provide little
additional information about interior structure, at least when they are primarily hydrostatic.
Our results entail important implications for a future interpretation of the currently observed
Juno $k_{42}$. After including the coupling from the well-understood $\ell=2$ dynamical tides
($\Delta k_2 \approx -4\%$), Jupiter's hydrostatic $k_{42}$ requires an unknown dynamical effect
to produce a fractional correction $\Delta k_{42}\approx-11\%$ in order to fit Juno's observation
within $3\sigma$. Future work is required to explain the required $\Delta k_{42}$.

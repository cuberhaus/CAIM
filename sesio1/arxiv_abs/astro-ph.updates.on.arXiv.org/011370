Context: To quantitatively decode the information stored within an observed spectrum, detailed
modelling of the physical state and accurate radiative transfer solution schemes are required.
In the analysis of stellar spectra, the numerical model often needs to account for binary companions
and 3D structures in the stellar envelopes. The enigmatic binary (or multiple) system LB-1 constitutes
a perfect example of such a complex multi-D problem. Aims: To improve our understanding of the LB-1
system, we directly modelled the phase-dependent H-alpha line profiles of this system. To this
end, we developed a multi-purpose binary-object spectral-synthesis code in 3D (BOSS-3D). Methods:
BOSS-3D calculates synthetic line profiles for a given state of the circumstellar material. The
standard pz-geometry commonly used for single stars is extended by defining individual coordinate
systems for each involved object and by accounting for the appropriate coordinate transformations.
The code is then applied to the LB-1 system, considering two main hypotheses, a binary containing
a stripped star and Be star, or a B star and a black hole with a disc. Results: Comparing these two scenarios,
neither model can reproduce the detailed phase-dependent shape of the H-alpha line profiles. A
satisfactory match with the observations, however, is obtained by invoking a disc around the primary
object in addition to the Be-star disc or the black-hole accretion disc. Conclusions: The developed
code can be used to model synthetic line profiles for a wide variety of binary systems, ranging from
transit spectra of planetary atmospheres, to post-asymptotic giant branch binaries including
circumstellar and circumbinary discs and massive-star binaries with stellar winds and disc systems.
For the LB-1 system, our modelling provides strong evidence that each object in the system contains
a disc-like structure.

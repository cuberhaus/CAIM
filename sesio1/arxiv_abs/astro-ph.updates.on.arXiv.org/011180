Although observations of high-redshift quasars demonstrate that many supermassive black holes
(BHs) reached large masses within one billion years after the Big Bang, the origin of the first BHs
is still a mystery. A promising way to constrain the origin of the first BHs is to explore the average
properties of $z\gtrsim6$ BHs. However, typical BHs remain hidden from X-ray surveys, which is
due to their relatively faint nature and the limited sensitivity of X-ray telescopes. Gravitational
lensing provides an attractive way to study this unique galaxy population as it magnifies the faint
light from these high-redshift galaxies. Here, we study the X-ray emission originating from 155
gravitationally-lensed $z\gtrsim6$ galaxies that were detected in the RELICS survey. We utilize
Chandra X-ray observations to search for AGN in the individual galaxies and in the stacked galaxy
samples. We identify two potential AGN in the high-redshift galaxies, but due to the $\sim$$2''$
offset between the X-ray source and the galaxy, we speculate that the X-ray sources are not likely
to be associated with the galaxies. We stack the signal from all galaxies and do not find a statistically
significant detection. We split our sample based on stellar mass, star-formation rate, and lensing
magnification and stack these sub-samples. We obtain a $2.2\sigma$ detection for massive galaxies
with an X-ray luminosity of $(3.7\pm1.6)\times10^{42} \ \rm{erg \ s^{-1}}$, which corresponds
to a $(3.0\pm1.3)\times10^5 \ \rm{M_{\odot}}$ BH accreting at its Eddington rate. Other stacks
remain undetected and we place upper limits on the AGN emission. These limits imply that the bulk
of BHs at $z\gtrsim6$ either accrete at a few percent of their Eddington rate and/or are $1-2$ orders
of magnitude less massive than expected based on the stellar mass of their host galaxy.

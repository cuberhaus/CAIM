We report X-ray observations of the most distant known gravitationally lensed quasar, J0439+1634
at $z=6.52$, which is also a broad absorption line (BAL) quasar, using the XMM-Newton Observatory.
With a 130 ks exposure, the quasar is significantly detected as a point source at the optical position
with a total of 358$^{+19}_{-19}$ net counts using the EPIC instrument. By fitting a power-law plus
Galactic absorption model to the observed spectra, we obtain a spectral slope of $\Gamma=1.45^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$.
The derived optical-to-X-ray spectral slope $\alpha_{\rm{ox}}$ is $-2.07^{+0.01}_{-0.01}$,
suggesting that the X-ray emission of J0439+1634 is weaker by a factor of 18 than the expectation
based on its 2500 Angstrom luminosity and the average $\alpha_{\rm{ox}}$ vs. luminosity relationship.
This is the first time that an X-ray weak BAL quasar at $z>6$ has been observed spectroscopically.
Its X-ray weakness is consistent with the properties of BAL quasars at lower redshift. By fitting
a model including an intrinsic absorption component, we obtain intrinsic column densities of $N_{\rm{H}}=2.8^{+0.7}_{-0.6}\times10^{23}\,\rm{cm}^{-2}$
and $N_{\rm{H}}= 4.3^{+1.8}_{-1.5}\times10^{23}\,\rm{cm}^{-2}$, assuming a fixed $\Gamma$
of 1.9 and a free $\Gamma$, respectively. The intrinsic rest-frame 2--10 keV luminosity is derived
as $(9.4-15.1)\times10^{43}\,\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}$, after correcting for lensing magnification
($\mu=51.3$). The absorbed power-law model fitting indicates that J0439+1634 is the highest redshift
obscured quasar with a direct measurement of the absorbing column density. The intrinsic high column
density absorption can reduce the X-ray luminosity by a factor of $3-7$, which also indicates that
this quasar could be a candidate of intrinsically X-ray weak quasar.

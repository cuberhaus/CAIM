We report the discovery of a massive protostar M17 MIR embedded in a hot molecular core in M17. The
multi-wavelength data of M17 MIR during 1993 to 2019 show significant mid-IR (MIR) variations,
which can be split into three stages, the decreasing phase during 1993.03 to mid 2004, the quiescent
phase during mid 2004 to mid 2010, and the re-brightening phase since mid 2010 untill now. The H2O
maser emission variation toward M17 MIR, together with the MIR variation, indicate an enhanced
disk accretion rate onto M17 MIR during the decreasing and re-brightening phase. According to the
kinematics of H2O maser spots, accretion rate ~7x10^-4 Msun/yr is estimated in the initial stage
of the re-brightening phase, and a higher rate ~2x10^-3 Msun/yr is obtained in later stage, given
by the MIR flux increased by a factor of 3. Radiative transfer modeling of SEDs of M17~MIR in the 2005
(quiescent) and 2017 epoch (accretion outburst) constrains the basic stellar parameters of M17
MIR, which is an intermediate-mass protostar (M~5.4 Msun) with lower accretion rate ~1.1x10^-5
Msun in quiescent and two orders of magnitude higher rate ~1.7x10^-3 Msun/yr in outburst. The enhanced
accretion rate during outburst induces the luminosity outburst $\Delta L\approx7600 $Lsun, and
a larger stellar radius is required to produce accretion rate consistent with observations. The
decreasing and re-brightening phase reflect two accretion bursts ($\Delta t\sim 9-20$ yr) with
burst magnitudes of 2 mag, separated by a quiescent phase lasting $\sim6$ yr. The fraction time in
accretion ourbusrt is about 83\% over 26 yr. M17 MIR is the youngest one among the six confirmed sources
with accretion burst. The extreme youth of M17 MIR suggests that minor accretion bursts are frequent
at the earliest stages of massive star formation.

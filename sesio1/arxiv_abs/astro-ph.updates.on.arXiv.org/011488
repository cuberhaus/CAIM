Most general-purpose classification methods, such as support-vector machine (SVM) and random
forest (RF), fail to account for an unusual characteristic of astronomical data: known measurement
error uncertainties. In astronomical data, this information is often given in the data but discarded
because popular machine learning classifiers cannot incorporate it. We propose a simulation-based
approach that incorporates heteroscedastic measurement error into any existing classification
method to better quantify uncertainty in classification. The proposed method first simulates
perturbed realizations of the data from a Bayesian posterior predictive distribution of a Gaussian
measurement error model. Then, a chosen classifier is fit to each simulation. The variation across
the simulations naturally reflects the uncertainty propagated from the measurement errors in
both labeled and unlabeled data sets. We demonstrate the use of this approach via two numerical studies.
The first is a thorough simulation study applying the proposed procedure to SVM and RF, which are
well-known hard and soft classifiers, respectively. The second study is a realistic classification
problem of identifying high-$z$ $(2.9 \leq z \leq 5.1)$ quasar candidates from photometric data.
The data were obtained from merged catalogs of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the $Spitzer$ IRAC Equatorial
Survey, and the $Spitzer$-HETDEX Exploratory Large-Area Survey. The proposed approach reveals
that out of 11,847 high-$z$ quasar candidates identified by a random forest without incorporating
measurement error, 3,146 are potential misclassifications. Additionally, out of ${\sim}1.85$
million objects not identified as high-$z$ quasars without measurement error, 936 can be considered
candidates when measurement error is taken into account.

Dusty quasars might be in a young stage of galaxy evolution with prominent quasar feedback. We study
a population of luminous, extremely red quasars at $z\sim$~2--4 that has extreme spectral properties
that may be related to exceptionally powerful quasar-driven outflows. We present Keck/KCWI observations
of the reddest known ERQ, at $z=$\,2.3184, with extremely fast [\ion{O}{III}]~$\lambda$5007
outflow at $\sim$6000~km~s$^{-1}$. The Ly$\alpha$ halo spans $\sim$100~kpc. The halo is kinematically
quiet, with velocity dispersion $\sim$300~km~s$^{-1}$ and no broadening above the dark matter
circular velocity down to the spatial resolution $\sim$6~kpc from the quasar. We detect spatially-resolved
\ion{He}{II}~$\lambda$1640 and \ion{C}{IV}~$\lambda$1549 emissions with kinematics similar
to the Ly$\alpha$ halo and a narrow component in the [\ion{O}{III}]~$\lambda$5007. Quasar reddening
acts as a coronagraph allowing views of the innermost halo. A narrow Ly$\alpha$ spike in the quasar
spectrum is inner halo emission, confirming the broad \ion{C}{IV}~$\lambda$1549 in the unresolved
quasar is blueshifted by $2240$~km~s$^{-1}$ relative to the halo frame. We propose the inner halo
is dominated by past/moderate-speed outflow and the outer halo dominated by inflow. The high central
concentration of the surface brightness and the circularly symmetric morphology of the inner halo
are consistent with the ERQ being in earlier evolutionary stage than blue quasars. The \ion{He}{II}~$\lambda$1640/Ly$\alpha$
ratio of the inner halo and the asymmetry level of the overall halo are dissimilar to Type~II quasars,
suggesting unique physical conditions for this ERQ that are beyond orientation differences from
other quasar populations. We find no evidence of mechanical quasar feedback in the Ly$\alpha$-emitting
halo.

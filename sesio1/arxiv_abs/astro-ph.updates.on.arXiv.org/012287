The Javalambre-Physics of the Accelerating Universe Astrophysical Survey (J-PAS) is expected
to map thousands of square degrees of the northern sky with 56 narrowband filters in the upcoming
years. This will make J-PAS a very competitive and unbiased emission line survey compared to spectroscopic
or narrowband surveys with fewer filters. The miniJPAS survey covered 1 deg$^2$, and it used the
same photometric system as J-PAS, but the observations were carried out with the pathfinder J-PAS
camera. In this work, we identify and characterize the sample of emission line galaxies (ELGs) from
miniJPAS with a redshift lower than $0.35$. Using a method based on artificial neural networks,
we detect the ELG population and measure the equivalent width and flux of the $H\alpha$, $H\beta$,
[OIII], and [NII] emission lines. We explore the ionization mechanism using the diagrams [OIII]/H$\beta$
versus [NII]/H$\alpha$ (BPT) and EW(H$\alpha$) versus [NII]/H$\alpha$ (WHAN). We identify 1787
ELGs ($83$%) from the parent sample (2154 galaxies) in the AEGIS field. For the galaxies with reliable
EW values that can be placed in the WHAN diagram (2000 galaxies in total), we obtained that $72.8 \pm
0.4$%, $17.7 \pm 0.4$% , and $9.4 \pm 0.2$% are star-forming (SF), active galactic nucleus (Seyfert),
and quiescent galaxies, respectively. Based on the flux of $H\alpha$ we find that the star formation
main sequence is described as $\log$ SFR $[M_\mathrm{\odot} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}] = 0.90^{+ 0.02}_{-0.02}
\log M_{\star} [M_\mathrm{\odot}] -8.85^{+ 0.19}_{-0.20}$ and has an intrinsic scatter of $0.20^{+
0.01}_{-0.01}$. The cosmic evolution of the SFR density ($\rho_{\text{SFR}}$) is derived at three
redshift bins: $0 < z \leq 0.15$, $0.15 < z \leq 0.25$, and $0.25 < z \leq 0.35$, which agrees with previous
results that were based on measurements of the $H\alpha$ emission line.

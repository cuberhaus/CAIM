We perform spectral fitting for a set of O-type stars based on self-consistent wind solutions, which
provide mass-loss rate and velocity profiles directly derived from the initial stellar parameters.
The great advantage of this self-consistent spectral fitting is therefore the reduction of the
number of free parameters to be tuned. Self-consistent values for the line-force parameters (k,alpha,delta)
and subsequently for the mass-loss rate and terminal velocity are provided by the m-CAK prescription
introduced in Paper I, updated in this work with improvements such as a temperature structure for
the wind, self-consistently evaluated from the line-acceleration. Synthetic spectra are calculated
using the radiative transfer code FASTWIND, replacing the classical beta-law for our new calculated
velocity profiles. We found that self-consistent m-CAK solutions provide values for theoretical
mass-loss rates on the order of the most recent predictions of other studies. From here, we generate
synthetic spectra with self-consistent hydrodynamics to fit and obtain a new set of stellar and
wind parameters for our sample of O-type stars whose spectra was taken with the high resolution echelle
spectrograph HERMES (R=85000). We find a satisfactory global fit for our observations, with good
accuracy for photospheric He I and He II lines and a quite acceptable fit for H lines. Although this
self-consistent spectral analysis is currently constrained in the optical wavelength range only,
this is an important step towards the determination of stellar and wind parameters without using
a beta-law. Given these results, we expect that the values introduced here should be helpful for
future studies about the stars constituting this sample, together with the prospective that the
m-CAK self-consistent prescription be extended to numerous studies about massive stars in future.

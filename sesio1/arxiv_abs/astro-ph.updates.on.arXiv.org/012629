Fast Radio Bursts must be powered by uniquely energetic emission mechanisms. This requirement
has eliminated a number of possible source types, but several remain. Identifying the physical
nature of Fast Radio Burst (FRB) emitters arguably requires good localisation of more detections,
and broadband studies enabled by real-time alerting. We here present the Apertif Radio Transient
System (ARTS), a supercomputing radio-telescope instrument that performs real-time FRB detection
and localisation on the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) interferometer. It reaches
coherent-addition sensitivity over the entire field of the view of the primary dish beam. After
commissioning results verified the system performed as planned, we initiated the Apertif FRB survey
(ALERT). Over the first 5 weeks we observed at design sensitivity in 2019, we detected 5 new FRBs,
and interferometrically localised each of these to 0.4--10 sq. arcmin. All detections are broad
band and very narrow, of order 1 ms duration, and unscattered. Dispersion measures are generally
high. Only through the very high time and frequency resolution of ARTS are these hard-to-find FRBs
detected, producing an unbiased view of the intrinsic population properties. Most localisation
regions are small enough to rule out the presence of associated persistent radio sources. Three
FRBs cut through the halos of M31 and M33. We demonstrate that Apertif can localise one-off FRBs with
an accuracy that maps magneto-ionic material along well-defined lines of sight. The rate of 1 every
~7 days next ensures a considerable number of new sources are detected for such study. The combination
of detection rate and localisation accuracy exemplified by the 5 first ARTS FRBs thus marks a new
phase in which a growing number of bursts can be used to probe our Universe.

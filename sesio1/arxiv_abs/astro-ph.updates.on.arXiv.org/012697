Magnetars are isolated young neutron stars characterized by the most intense magnetic fields known
in the universe. The origin of their magnetic field is still a challenging question. In situ magnetic
field amplification by dynamo action is a promising process to generate ultra-strong magnetic
fields in fast-rotating progenitors. However, it is unclear whether the fraction of progenitors
harboring fast core rotation is sufficient to explain the entire magnetar population. To address
this point, we propose a new scenario for magnetar formation, in which a slow-rotating proto-neutron
star is spun up by the supernova fallback. We argue that this can trigger the development of the Tayler-Spruit
dynamo while other dynamo processes are disfavored. Using previous works done on this dynamo and
simulations to characterize the fallback, we derive equations modelling the coupled evolution
of the proto-neutron star rotation and magnetic field. Their time integration for different fallback
masses is successfully compared with analytical estimates of the amplification timescales and
saturation value of the magnetic field. We find that the magnetic field is amplified within $20$
to $40$s after the core bounce, and that the radial magnetic field saturates at intensities $10^{14}-10^{15}$G,
therefore spanning the full range of magnetar's dipolar magnetic fields. We also compare predictions
of two proposed saturation mechanisms showing that magnetar-like magnetic fields can be generated
for neutron star spun up to rotation periods $\lesssim8$ms and $\lesssim28$ms, corresponding
to fallback masses $\gtrsim4\times10^{-2}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ and $\gtrsim10^{-2}{\rm M}_{\odot}$.
Thus, our results suggest that magnetars can be formed from slow-rotating progenitors for fallback
masses compatible with recent supernova simulations and leading to plausible initial rotation
periods of the proto-neutron star.

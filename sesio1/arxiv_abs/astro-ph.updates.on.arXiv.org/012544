Gravitational waves (GW) creates correlations in the arrival times of pulses from different pulsars.
The expected correlation $\mu(\gamma)$ as a function of the angle $\gamma$ between the directions
to two pulsars was calculated by Hellings and Downs, for an isotropic and unpolarized GW background
with no long-range correlations. One may ask: given a set of noise-free observations, are they consistent
with that expectation? To answer this, we first calculate the expected variance $\sigma^2(\gamma)$
in the correlation (as pulsar pairs with fixed separation angle $\gamma$ are swept around the sky)
for a single unpolarized GW source. We then use this to derive a simple analytic expression for the
"cosmic variance" arising from a set of discrete point sources uniformly scattered in space. The
overall scale of the fractional fluctuation in the correlation is the ratio of the distance to the
closest (typical) source to the distance to the most distant (typical) source, which in our universe
is probably around 1%. We then compute the mean and variance of the Hellings and Downs correlation
for a general polarized point source. The mean follows the standard Hellings and Downs curve, and
the variance is the sum of an unpolarized term, a polarized term, and a cross term, for which we give
simple closed analytic forms. As examples, we compute the mean and variance of the correlation for
a circular binary inspiral signal, both with and without the "pulsar terms" that are often neglected.
The means are identical, but the inclusion of the pulsar terms increases the variance by about a factor
of four and changes the relative weights of the three variance terms. This shows that measurements
of the cosmic variance might provide further information about the nature of GW sources.

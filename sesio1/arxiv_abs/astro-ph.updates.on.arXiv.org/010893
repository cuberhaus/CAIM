We have studied the influence of an evolving gravitational potential of the Milky Way Galaxy on the
orbital motion of 152 globular clusters with proper motions from the Gaia EDR3 catalogue and mean
distances from Baumgardt and Vasiliev (2021). To construct a semicosmological evolving model
potential with changing masses and sizes of the Galactic components, we have used the algorithm
described in Haghi et al. (2015). The adopted axisymmetric three-component model potential of
the Galaxy includes a spherical bulge, a flat Miyamoto--Nagai disk, and a spherical Navarro--Frenk--White
dark matter halo.The orbits are integrated backward in time. We compare the orbital parameters
of globular clusters derived in static and evolving potentials when integrating the orbits for
5 and 12 Gyr backward. For the first time we have studied the influence of separately a change in the
masses and a change in the sizes of the Galactic components. The changes in the masses and sizes of
the components are shown to act on the orbital parameters in the opposite way. At small Galactocentric
distances this influence is maximally compensated for. The orbits of distant globular clusters
and those with a large apocenter distance undergo the biggest changes. We show that on time scales
up to $-5$~Gyr the orbits of globular clusters in the case of a potential with both changing masses
and changing sizes of the components undergo, on average, minor changes compared to the case of a
static potential. These changes fit into the limits of the statistical uncertainties caused by
the errors in the data. So, on these time scales the Galactic potential may be deemed static. We provide
tables with the orbital parameters of globular clusters derived in both static and evolving potentials.

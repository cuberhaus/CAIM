[Context.] Gaia is limited in the optical down to G~21 mag so it is essential to understand the biases
introduced by a magnitude-limited sample on spatial distribution studies. [Aims.] We ascertain
how sample incompleteness in Gaia observations of young clusters affects the local spatial analysis
tool INDICATE and subsequently the perceived spatial properties of these clusters. [Methods.]
We created a mock Gaia cluster catalogue from a synthetic dataset using the observation generating
tool MYOSOTIS. The effect of cluster distance, uniform and variable extinction, binary fraction,
population masking by the point spread function wings of high-mass members, and contrast sensitivity
limits on the trends identified by INDICATE are explored. A comparison of the typical index values
derived by INDICATE for members of the synthetic dataset and their corresponding mock Gaia catalogue
observations is made to identify any significant changes. [Results.] We typically find only small
variations in the pre- and post-observation index values of cluster populations, which can increase
as a function of incompleteness percentage and binarity. No significant strengthening, or false
signatures, of stellar concentrations are found but real signatures may be diluted. Conclusions
drawn about the spatial behaviour of Gaia-observed cluster populations that are, and are not, associated
with their natal nebulosity are reliable for most clusters but the perceived behaviours of individual
members can change so INDICATE should be used as a measure of spatial behaviours between members
as a function of their intrinsic properties (e.g. mass, age, object type), rather than to draw conclusions
about any specific observed member. [Conclusions.] INDICATE is a robust spatial analysis tool
to reliably study Gaia-observed young cluster populations within 1 kpc, up to a sample incompleteness
of 83.3% and binarity of 50%.

PKS 1413+135, a typical compact symmetric object (CSO) with a two-side pc-scale structure in its
miniature radio morphology, is spatially associated with the source 4FGL J1416.1+1320 and recently
is detected in the TeV band with the MAGIC telescopes. We present the analysis of its X-ray and gamma-ray
observations obtained with Swift, XMM-Newton, Chandra, and Fermi-LAT for revealing its high energy
radiation physics. No significant variation trend is observed in the X-ray band. Its gamma-ray
light curve derived from the Fermi-LAT 13.5-year observations shows that it is in a low gamma-ray
flux stage before MJD 58500 and experiences violent outbursts after MJD 58500. The confidence level
of the flux variability is much higher than 5\sigma, and the flux at 10 GeV varies ~3 orders of magnitude.
The flux variation is accompanied by the clearly spectral variation. The spectral shape displays
a log-parabola spectrum in low-flux state and a hard power-law spectrum in the gamma-ray flares.
The highest energy of the detected photons by the Fermi-LAT is ~236 GeV, which is detectable with
the MAGIC telescopes. Furthermore, we compile the broadband SED during an GeV gamma-ray outburst
and fit it with a two-zone leptonic model and emission in the X-ray-gamma-ray band is attributed
to the inverse Compton scattering processes. The result shows that the gamma-rays of PKS 1413+135
would be detectable with the MAGIC telescopes, whether the source is located at z=0.247 or z=0.5.
Based on our analysis and its CSO radio morphology, we suspect that the nuclear jet activity of PKS
1413+135 is episodic, the weak gamma-ray emission before MJD 58500 may be from its pc-scale jet structures
powered by previous activities, and the violent outbursts with short timescale variability after
MJD 58500 could be attributed to the recently re-started jet activity.

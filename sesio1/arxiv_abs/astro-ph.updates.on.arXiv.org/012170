Deuteration is a crucial tool to understand the complexity of interstellar chemical processes,
especially when they involve the interplay of gas-phase and grain-surface chemistry. In the case
of multiple deuteration, comparing observation with the results of chemical modelling is particularly
effective to study how molecules are inherited in the different stages within the process of star
and planet formation. We aim to study the the D/ H ratio in H2CS across the prototypical pre-stellar
core L1544. This study allows us to test current gas-dust chemical models involving sulfur in dense
cores. We present here single-dish observations of H2CS, HDCS and D2CS with the IRAM 30m telescope.
We analyse their column densities and distributions, and compare these observations with gas-grain
chemical models. The deuteration maps of H2CS in L1544 are compared with the deuteration maps of
methanol, H2CO, N2H+ and HCO+ towards the same source. Furthermore, the single and double deuteration
of H2CS towards the dust peak of L1544 is compared with H2CO and c-C3H2. The difference between the
deuteration of these molecules in L1544 is discussed and compared with the prediction of chemical
models. The maximum deuterium fractionation for the first deuteration of H2CS is N(HDCS)/N(H2CS)$\sim$30$\%$
and is located towards the north-east at a distance of about 10000 AU from the dust peak. While for
c-C3H2 the first and second deuteration have a similar efficiency, for H2CS and H2CO the second deuteration
is more efficient, leading to D2CX/HDCX$\sim$100$\%$ (with X= O or S). Our results imply that the
large deuteration of H2CO and H2CS observed in protostellar cores as well as in comets is likely inherited
from the pre-stellar phase. However, the comparison with state-of-the-art chemical models suggests
that the reaction network for the formation of the doubly deuterated H2CS and H2CO it is not complete
yet.

[Background] In our earlier work {\bf [Phys. Rev. C 104, 055804 (2021)]}, we studied the surface
properties of a neutron star, assuming it as a huge finite nucleus containing protons, neutrons,
electrons, and muons. For the first time, we reported these results of a neutron star for a few representative
masses. In the present paper, we give a detailed study of these quantities to draw definite conclusions.
[Method]To carry forward our earlier idea, the energy density functional of the momentum space
of neutron star matter is converted to the coordinate space in a local density approximation. This
functional is again used to derive the neutron star surface properties within the coherent density
fluctuation model using the weight function obtained from the density profile of the neutron star
using the recently developed G3 and widely used NL3 and IU-FSU parameter sets in the context of relativistic
mean-field formalism. [Results] The systematic surface properties of the neutron star, such as
incompressibility, symmetry energy, slope parameter, and curvature coefficient, is calculated.
The volume and surface components of the total symmetry energy are decomposed with the help of the
$\kappa$ factor obtained from the volume to surface ratio of the symmetry energies in the liquid
drop limit of Danielewicz. The magnitude of the computed surface quantities increases with the
neutron star's mass. [Conclusion] The incompressibility $K^{\rm star}$, symmetry energy $S^{\rm
star}$, slope parameter $L_{\rm sym}^{\rm star}$ and curvature coefficient $K_{\rm sym}^{\rm
star}$ of the neutron stars with different mass are analyzed and found to be model dependent. NL3
is the stiffest equation of state endue us with the higher magnitude of surface quantities as compared
to the G3 and IU-FSU forces.

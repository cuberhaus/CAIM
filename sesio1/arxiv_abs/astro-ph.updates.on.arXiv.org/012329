Context. Accurate detections of frequent small-scale extreme ultraviolet (EUV) brightenings
are essential to the investigation of the physical processes heating the corona. Aims. We detected
small-scale brightenings, termed campfires, using their morphological and intensity structures
as observed in coronal EUV imaging observations for statistical analysis. Methods. We applied
a method based on Zernike moments and a support vector machine classifier to automatically identify
and track campfires observed by Solar Orbiter/Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) and SDO/AIA. Results.
This method detected 8678 campfires (with length scales between 400 km and 4000 km) from a sequence
of 50 High Resolution EUV telescope (HRIEUV) 174{\AA} images. From 21 near co-temporal AIA images
covering the same field of view as EUI, we found 1131 campfires, 58% of which were also detected in
HRIEUV images. In contrast, about 16% of campfires recognized in HRIEUV were detected by AIA. We
obtain a campfire birthrate of 2*10-16m-2s-1. About 40% of campfires show a duration longer than
5 s, having been observed in at least two HRIEUV images. We find that 27% of campfires were found in
coronal bright points and the remaining 73% have occurred out of coronal bright points. We detected
23 EUI campfires with a duration greater than 245 s. We found that about 80% of campfires are formed
at supergranular boundaries, and the features with the highest total intensities are generated
at network junctions and intense H I Lyman-{\alpha} emission regions observed by EUI/HRILya. The
probability distribution functions for the total intensity, peak intensity, and projected area
of campfires follow a power law behavior with absolute indices between 2 and 3. This self-similar
behavior is a possible signature of self-organization, or even self-organized criticality, in
the campfire formation process.

Linking supernovae to their progenitors is a powerful method for furthering our understanding
of the physical origin of their observed differences, while at the same time testing stellar evolution
theory. In this second study of a series of three papers where we characterise SNe II to understand
their diversity, we derive progenitor properties (initial and ejecta masses, and radius), explosion
energy, $^{56}$Ni mass, and its degree of mixing within the ejecta for a large sample of SNe II. This
dataset was obtained by the Carnegie Supernova Project-I and is characterised by a high cadence
of their optical and NIR light curves and optical spectra that were homogeneously observed and processed.
A large grid of hydrodynamical models and a fitting procedure based on MCMC methods were used to fit
the bolometric light curve and the evolution of the photospheric velocity of 53 SNe II. We infer ejecta
masses between 7.9 and 14.8 $M_{\odot}$, explosion energies between 0.15 and 1.40 foe, and $^{56}$Ni
masses between 0.006 and 0.069 $M_{\odot}$. We define a subset of 24~SNe (the `gold sample') with
well-sampled bolometric light curves and expansion velocities for which we consider the results
more robust. Most SNe~II in the gold sample ($\sim$88%) are found with ejecta masses in the range
of $\sim$8-10 $M_{\odot}$, coming from low zero-age main-sequence masses (9-12 $M_{\odot}$).
The modelling of the initial-mass distribution of the gold sample gives an upper mass limit of 21.3$^{+3.8}_{-0.4}$
$M_{\odot}$ and a much steeper distribution than that for a Salpeter massive-star IMF. This IMF
incompatibility is due to the large number of low-mass progenitors found -- when assuming standard
stellar evolution. This may imply that high-mass progenitors lose more mass during their lives
than predicted. However, a deeper analysis of all stellar evolution assumptions is required to
test this hypothesis.

Gamma-ray observations have long been used to constrain the properties of dark matter (DM), with
a strong focus on weakly interacting massive particles annihilating through velocity-independent
processes. However, in the absence of clear-cut observational evidence for the simplest candidates,
the interest of the community in more complex DM scenarios involving a velocity-dependent cross-section
has been growing steadily over the past few years. We present the first systematic study of velocity-dependent
DM annihilation (in particular $p$-wave annihilation and Sommerfeld enhancement) in a variety
of astrophysical objects, not only including the well-studied Milky Way dwarf satellite galaxies,
but nearby dwarf irregular galaxies and local galaxy clusters as well. Particular attention is
given to the interplay between velocity dependence and DM halo substructure. Uncertainties related
to halo mass, phase-space and substructure modelling are also discussed in this velocity-dependent
context. We show that, for $s$-wave annihilation, extremely large subhalo boost factors are to
be expected, up to $10^{11}$ in clusters and up to $10^6-10^7$ in dwarf galaxies where subhalos are
usually assumed not to play an important role. Boost factors for $p$-wave annihilation are smaller
but can still reach $10^3$ in clusters. The angular extension of the DM signal is also significantly
impacted, with e.g. the cluster typical emission radius increasing by a factor of order 10 in the
$s$-wave case. We also compute the signal contrast of the objects in our sample with respect to annihilation
happening in the Milky Way halo. Overall, we find that the hierarchy between the brightest considered
targets depends on the specific details of the assumed particle-physics model.

Measurement of spin-precession in black hole binary mergers observed with gravitational waves
is an exciting milestone as it relates to both general relativistic dynamics and astrophysical
binary formation scenarios. In this study, we revisit the evidence for spin-precession in GW200129
and localize its origin to data in LIGO Livingston in the 20--50\,Hz frequency range where the signal
amplitude is lower than what expected from a non-precessing binary given all the other data. These
data are subject to known data quality issues as a glitch was subtracted from the detector's strain
data. The lack of evidence for spin-precession in LIGO Hanford leads to a noticeable inconsistency
between the inferred binary mass ratio and precessing spin in the two LIGO detectors, something
not expected from solely different Gaussian noise realizations. We revisit the LIGO Livingston
glitch mitigation and show that the difference between a spin-precessing and a non-precessing
interpretation for GW200129 is smaller than the statistical and systematic uncertainty of the
glitch subtraction, finding that the support for spin-precession depends sensitively on the glitch
modeling. We also investigate the signal-to-noise ratio $\sim7$ trigger in the less sensitive
Virgo detector. Though not influencing the spin-precession studies, the Virgo trigger is grossly
inconsistent with the ones in LIGO Hanford and LIGO Livingston as it points to a much heavier system.
We interpret the Virgo data in the context of further data quality issues. While our results do not
disprove the presence of spin-precession in GW200129, we argue that any such inference is contingent
upon the statistical and systematic uncertainty of the glitch mitigation. Our study highlights
the role of data quality investigations when inferring subtle effects such as spin-precession
for short signals such as the ones produced by high-mass systems.

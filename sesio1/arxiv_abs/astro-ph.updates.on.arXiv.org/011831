Context: Properly modelling scattering by interstellar dust grains requires a good characterisation
of the scattering phase function. The Henyey-Greenstein phase function has become the standard
for describing anisotropic scattering by dust grains, but it is a poor representation of the real
scattering phase function outside the optical range. Aims: We investigate alternatives for the
Henyey-Greenstein phase function that would allow the scattering properties of dust grains to
be described. Our goal is to find a balance between realism and complexity: the scattering phase
function should be flexible enough to provide an accurate fit to the scattering properties of dust
grains over a wide wavelength range, and it should be simple enough to be easy to handle, especially
in the context of radiative transfer calculations. Methods: We fit various analytical phase functions
to the scattering phase function corresponding to the BARE-GR-S model, one of the most popular and
commonly adopted models for interstellar dust. We weigh the accuracy of the fit against the number
of free parameters in the analytical phase functions. Results: We confirm that the Henyey-Greenstein
phase functions poorly describe scattering by dust grains, particularly at ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths,
with relative differences of up to 50%. The Draine phase function alleviates this problem at near-infrared
(NIR) wavelengths, but not in the UV. The two-term Reynolds-McCormick phase function, recently
advocated in the context of light scattering in nanoscale materials and aquatic media, describes
the BARE-GR-S data very well, but its five free parameters are degenerate. We propose a simpler phase
function, the two-term ultraspherical-2 (TTU2) phase function, that also provides an excellent
fit to the BARE-GR-S phase function over the entire UV-NIR wavelength range. (Abridged)

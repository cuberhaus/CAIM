On February 12, 2021 two subsequent eruptions occurred above the West limb, as seen along the Sun-Earth
line. The first event was a typical slow Coronal Mass Ejection (CME), followed $\sim 7$ hours later
by a smaller and collimated prominence eruption, originating Southward with respect to the CME,
followed by a plasma blob. These events were observed not only by SOHO and STEREO-A missions, but
also by the suite of remote sensing instruments on-board Solar Orbiter (SolO). This work shows how
data acquired by the Full Sun Imager (FSI), Metis coronagraph, and Heliospheric Imager (SoloHI)
from the SolO perspective can be combined to study the eruptions and the different source regions.
Moreover, we show how Metis data can be analyzed to provide new information about solar eruptions.
Different 3D reconstruction methods were applied to the data acquired by different spacecraft
including remote sensing instruments on-board SolO. Images acquired by both Metis channels in
the Visible Light (VL) and H I Lyman$-\alpha$ line (UV) were combined to derive physical information
on the expanding plasma. The polarization ratio technique was also applied for the first time to
the Metis images acquired in the VL channel. The two eruptions were followed in 3D from their source
region to their expansion in the intermediate corona. Thanks to the combination of VL and UV Metis
data, the formation of a post-CME Current Sheet (CS) was followed for the first time in the intermediate
corona. The plasma temperature gradient across a post-CME blob propagating along the CS was also
measured for the first time. Application of the polarization ratio technique to Metis data shows
that, thanks to the combination of four different polarization measurements, the errors are reduced
by $\sim 5-7$\%, thus better constraining the 3D distribution of plasma.

We present a comprehensive temporal and spectral analysis of the 'softer' variability classes
($i.e.$, $\theta$, $\beta$, $\delta$, $\rho$, $\kappa$, $\omega$ and $\gamma$) of the source
GRS 1915+105 observed by AstroSat during $2016-2021$ campaign. Wide-band ($3-60$ keV) timing
studies reveal the detection of High Frequency Quasi-periodic Oscillations (HFQPOs) with frequency
of $68.14-72.32$ Hz, significance of $2.75-11 \sigma$, and rms amplitude of $1.48-2.66\%$ in $\delta$,
$\kappa$, $\omega$ and $\gamma$ variability classes. Energy dependent power spectra impart that
HFQPOs are detected only in $6-25$ keV energy band and rms amplitude is found to increase ($1-8\%$)
with energy. The dynamical power spectra of $\kappa$ and $\omega$ classes demonstrate that HFQPOs
seem to be correlated with high count rates. We observe that wide-band ($0.7-50$ keV) energy spectra
can be described by the thermal Comptonization component (nthComp) with photon index ($\Gamma_{\rm
nth}$) of $1.83-2.89$ along with an additional steep ($\Gamma_{\rm PL}\sim3$) powerlaw component.
The electron temperature ($kT_e$) of $1.82 -3.66$ keV and optical depth ($\tau$) of $2-14$ indicate
the presence of a cool and optically thick corona. In addition, nthComp components ($1.97 \lesssim
\Gamma_{\rm nth} \lesssim 2.44$, $1.06 \times 10^{-8} \lesssim F_{\rm nth} ~({\rm erg} {\rm ~cm}^{-2}
{\rm ~s}^{-1}) \lesssim 4.46\times 10^{-8}$) are found to dominate in presence of HFQPOs. Overall,
these findings infer that HFQPOs are possibly resulted due to the modulation of the 'Comptonizing
corona'. Further, we find that the bolometric luminosity ($0.3-100$ keV) of the source lies within
the sub-Eddington ($3-34\%$ $L_{\rm Edd}$) regime. Finally, we discuss and compare the obtained
results in the context of existing models on HFQPOs.

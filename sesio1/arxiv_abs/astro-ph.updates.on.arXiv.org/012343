We present measurements of broad emission lines and virial estimates of supermassive black hole
masses ($M_{BH}$) for a large sample of ultra-hard X-ray selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs)
as part of the second data release of the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS/DR2). Our catalog includes
$M_{BH}$ estimates for a total 689 AGNs, determined from the H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, $MgII\lambda2798$,
and/or $CIV\lambda1549$ broad emission lines. The core sample includes a total of 512 AGNs drawn
from the 70-month Swift/BAT all-sky catalog. We also provide measurements for 177 additional AGNs
that are drawn from deeper Swift/BAT survey data. We study the links between $M_{BH}$ estimates
and line-of-sight obscuration measured from X-ray spectral analysis. We find that broad H$\alpha$
emission lines in obscured AGNs ($\log (N_{\rm H}/{\rm cm}^{-2})> 22.0$) are on average a factor
of $8.0_{-2.4}^{+4.1}$ weaker, relative to ultra-hard X-ray emission, and about $35_{-12}^{~+7}$\%
narrower than in unobscured sources (i.e., $\log (N_{\rm H}/{\rm cm}^{-2}) < 21.5$). This indicates
that the innermost part of the broad-line region is preferentially absorbed. Consequently, current
single-epoch $M_{BH}$ prescriptions result in severely underestimated ($>$1 dex) masses for
Type 1.9 sources (AGNs with broad H$\alpha$ but no broad H$\beta$) and/or sources with $\log (N_{\rm
H}/{\rm cm}^{-2}) > 22.0$. We provide simple multiplicative corrections for the observed luminosity
and width of the broad H$\alpha$ component ($L[{\rm b}{\rm H}\alpha]$ and FWHM[bH$\alpha$]) in
such sources to account for this effect, and to (partially) remedy $M_{BH}$ estimates for Type 1.9
objects. As key ingredient of BASS/DR2, our work provides the community with the data needed to further
study powerful AGNs in the low-redshift Universe.

Collective neutrino oscillations play a crucial role in transporting lepton flavor in astrophysical
settings like supernovae and neutron star binary merger remnants, which are characterized by large
neutrino densities. In these settings, simulations in the mean-field approximation show that
neutrino-neutrino interactions can overtake vacuum oscillations and give rise to fast collective
flavor evolution on time-scales $t\propto\mu^{-1}$, with $\mu$ proportional to the local neutrino
density. In this work, we study the full out-of-equilibrium flavor dynamics in simple multi-angle
geometries displaying fast oscillations in the mean field linear stability analysis. Focusing
on simple initial conditions, we analyze the production of pair correlations and entanglement
in the complete many-body-dynamics as a function of the number $N$ of neutrinos in the system, for
up to thousands of neutrinos. Similarly to simpler geometries with only two neutrino beams, we identify
three regimes: stable configurations with vanishing flavor oscillations, marginally unstable
configurations with evolution occurring on long time scales $\tau\approx\mu^{-1}\sqrt{N}$,
and unstable configurations showing flavor evolution on short time scales $\tau\approx\mu^{-1}\log(N)$.
We present evidence that these fast collective modes are generated by the same dynamical phase transition
which leads to the slow bipolar oscillations, establishing a connection between these two phenomena
and explaining the difference in their time scales. We conclude by discussing a semi-classical
approximation which reproduces the entanglement entropy at short to medium time scales and can
be potentially useful in situations with more complicated geometries where classical simulation
methods starts to become inefficient.

Far-ultraviolet (FUV; ~1200-2000 angstroms) spectra are fundamental to our understanding of
star-forming galaxies, providing a unique window on massive stellar populations, chemical evolution,
feedback processes, and reionization. The launch of JWST will soon usher in a new era, pushing the
UV spectroscopic frontier to higher redshifts than ever before, however, its success hinges on
a comprehensive understanding of the massive star populations and gas conditions that power the
observed UV spectral features. This requires a level of detail that is only possible with a combination
of ample wavelength coverage, signal-to-noise, spectral-resolution, and sample diversity that
has not yet been achieved by any FUV spectral database. We present the COS Legacy Spectroscopic SurveY
(CLASSY) treasury and its first high level science product, the CLASSY atlas. CLASSY builds on the
HST archive to construct the first high-quality (S/N_1500 >~ 5/resel), high-resolution (R~15,000)
FUV spectral database of 45 nearby (0.002 < z < 0.182) star-forming galaxies. The CLASSY atlas, available
to the public via the CLASSY website, is the result of optimally extracting and coadding 170 archival+new
spectra from 312 orbits of HST observations. The CLASSY sample covers a broad range of properties
including stellar mass (6.2 < logM_star(M_sol) < 10.1), star formation rate (-2.0 < log SFR (M_sol/yr)
< +1.6), direct gas-phase metallicity (7.0 < 12+log(O/H) < 8.8), ionization (0.5 < O_32 < 38.0),
reddening (0.02 < E(B-V < 0.67), and nebular density (10 < n_e (cm^-3) < 1120). CLASSY is biased to
UV-bright star-forming galaxies, resulting in a sample that is consistent with z~0 mass-metallicity
relationship, but is offset to higher SFRs by roughly 2 dex, similar to z >~2 galaxies. This unique
set of properties makes the CLASSY atlas the benchmark training set for star-forming galaxies across
cosmic time.

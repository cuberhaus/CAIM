To determine if the recently launched Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) can follow the
polarization variations induced by different particle acceleration mechanisms in blazars jets
we simulate observations of a high synchrotron peak (HSP) blazar variable in polarization degree
and angle according to the theoretical predictions of Tavecchio et al., 2020 (shock acceleration
model), Bodo et al., 2021 (magnetic reconnection model) and Marscher \& Jorstad, 2021 (Turbulent
Extreme Multi-Zone Model). We use the Monte Carlo tool ixpeobssim to create realistic IXPE data
products. We create simulated light-curves of polarization degree and angle by time-slicing the
simulated data into arbitrary short time bins. We use a $\chi^2$ test to assess the performance of
the observations in detecting the time variability of the polarization properties. A series of
10 ks long observations permits IXPE to follow the time variability of the polarization degree in
the case of the shock acceleration model. In the case of the magnetic reconnection model, the nominal
injected model provides the best fit of the simulated IXPE data for time bins of 5-10 ks, depending
on the tested flux level. For the TEMZ model, shorter time slices of 0.5 ks are needed for obtaining
a formally good fit of the simulated IXPE data with the injected model. On the other hand, we find that
a fit with a constant model provides a $\chi^2$ lower than the fit with the nominal injected model
when using time slices of 20 ks, 60/70 ks, and 5 ks for the case of the shock acceleration, magnetic
reconnection and TEMZ model, respectively. We conclude that, provided that the statistics of the
observation allows slicing of the data in adequately short time bins, IXPE observations of an HSP
blazar at a typical flux level can detect the time variability predicted by popular models for particle
acceleration in jets.

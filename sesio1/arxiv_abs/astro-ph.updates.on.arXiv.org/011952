Observations of the cosmic evolution of different gas phases across time indicate a marked increase
in the molecular gas mass density towards $z\sim 2-3$. Such a transformation implies an accompanied
change in the global distribution of molecular hydrogen column densities ($N_{\rm{H_2}}$). Using
observations by PHANGS-ALMA/SDSS and simulations by GRIFFIN/IllustrisTNG we explore the evolution
of this H$_2$ column density distribution function [$f(N_{\rm{H}_2})$]. The H$_2$ (and HI) column
density maps for TNG50 and TNG100 are derived in post-processing and are made available through
the IllustrisTNG online API. The shape and normalization of $f(N_{\rm{H}_2})$ of individual main-sequence
star-forming galaxies are correlated with the star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass (${M_*}$),
and H$_2$ mass ($M_{\rm{H}_2}$) in both observations and simulations. TNG100, combined with H$_2$
post-processing models, broadly reproduces observations, albeit with differences in slope and
normalization. Also, an analytically modelled $f(N)$, based on exponential gas disks, matches
well with the simulations. The GRIFFIN simulation gives first indications that the slope of $f(N_{\rm{H}_2})$
might not majorly differ when including non-equilibrium chemistry in simulations. The $f(N_{\rm{H}_2})$
by TNG100 implies that higher molecular gas column densities are reached at $z=3$ than at $z=0$.
Further, denser regions contribute more to the molecular mass density at $z=3$. Finally, H$_2$
starts dominating compared to HI only at column densities above log($N_{\rm{H}_2} / \rm{cm}^{-2})
\sim 21.8-22$ at both redshifts. These results imply that neutral atomic gas is an important contributor
to the overall cold gas mass found in the ISM of galaxies including at densities typical for molecular
clouds at $z=0$ and $z=3$.

Since the advent of $Gaia$ astrometry, it is possible to identify massive accreted systems within
the Galaxy through their unique dynamical signatures. One such system, $Gaia$-Sausage-Enceladus
(GSE), appears to be an early "building block" given its virial mass $> 10^{10}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$
at infall ($z\sim1-3$). In order to separate the progenitor population from the background stars,
we investigate its chemical properties with up to 30 element abundances from the GALAH+ Survey Data
Release 3 (DR3). To inform our choice of elements for purely chemically selecting accreted stars,
we analyse 4164 stars with low-$\alpha$ abundances and halo kinematics. These are most different
to the Milky Way stars for abundances of Mg, Si, Na, Al, Mn, Fe, Ni, and Cu. Based on the significance
of abundance differences and detection rates, we apply Gaussian mixture models to various element
abundance combinations. We find the most populated and least contaminated component, which we
confirm to represent GSE, contains 1049 stars selected via [Na/Fe] vs. [Mg/Mn] in GALAH+ DR3. We
provide tables of our selections and report the chrono-chemodynamical properties (age, chemistry,
and dynamics). Through a previously reported clean dynamical selection of GSE stars, including
$30 < \sqrt{J_R~/~\mathrm{kpc\,km\,s^{-1}}} < 55$, we can characterise an unprecedented 24 abundances
of this structure with GALAH+ DR3. Our chemical selection allows us to prevent circular reasoning
and characterise the dynamical properties of the GSE, for example mean $\sqrt{J_R~/~\mathrm{kpc\,km\,s^{-1}}}
= 26_{-14}^{+9}$. We find only $(29\pm1)\%$ of the GSE stars within the clean dynamical selection
region. We thus discuss chemodynamic selections (such as eccentricity and upper limits on [Na/Fe]).

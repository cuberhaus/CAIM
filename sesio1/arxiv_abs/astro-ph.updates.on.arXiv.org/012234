We study the genesis, environment and growth of supermassive black hole (SMBH) seeds from different
formation channels, from PopIII remnants to massive seeds, modeled within the L-Galaxies semi-analytic
code. We run the model on the merger trees of the Millennium-II simulation (MR-II), as its high halo-mass
resolution (Mvir~10^7 Msun/h) allows to study in a relatively large cosmological volume (Lbox=100
Mpc/h) the evolution of atomic-cooling halos where intermediate-mass and heavy seeds are expected
to form. We track the formation of these seeds according to the background and the local variations
of the chemical enrichment and the UV-flux produced by star formation. Not being able to resolve
the first mini-halos, we account for the formation of PopIII remnants in a sub-grid fashion, using
the results of the GQd model. We find that the descendants of light seeds numerically dominate among
the population of SMBHs at all masses and z. The much rarer intermediate-mass and heavy seeds form
in dense environments where close neighbors provide the required UV illumination. We also include
the formation of heavy seeds in the mergers of gas-rich massive galaxies, who are very rare in the
MR-II volume. We then track the evolution through gas accretion and mergers of this multi-flavour
population of BH seeds down to z=0. Our model produces a population of SMBHs whose statistical properties
at z=0 meet current constraints. In the dwarf-mass regime, we predict that the scaling relation
between BH and stellar mass is flatter than in the high-mass range. We also find that the BH occupation
fraction highly depends on the seeding efficiency. Finally, a fraction of BHs hosted in dwarf galaxies
at z=0 never grow since their formation at z>6. This supports the idea that some local low-mass systems
might harbor central compact objects which are remnant of high-z BH-formation processes.

We present new CO(2-1) observations of a representative sample of 24 local (z$<$0.02) luminous
infrared galaxies (LIRGs) obtained at high spatial resolution ($<$100 pc) from ALMA. We derive
the effective radii of the CO(2-1) and the 1.3 mm continuum emissions using the curve-of-growth
method. LIRGs show an extremely compact cold molecular gas distribution (median R$_{CO}$ $\sim$0.7
kpc), which is a factor 2 smaller than the ionized gas, and 3.5 times smaller than the stellar size.
The molecular size of LIRGs is similar to that of early-type galaxies (R$_{CO}\sim$1 kpc) and about
a factor of 6 more compact than local Spirals of similar stellar mass. Only the CO emission in low-z
ULIRGs is more compact than these local LIRGs by a factor of 2. Compared to high-z (1$<$z$<$6) systems,
the stellar sizes and masses of local LIRGs are similar to those of high-z MS star-forming galaxies
(SFG) and about a factor of 2-3 lower than sub-mm galaxies (SMG). The molecular sizes of high-z MS
SFGs and SMGs are larger than those derived for LIRGs by a factor of $\sim$3 and $\sim$8, respectively.
These results indicate that while low-z LIRGs and high-z MS-SFGs have similar stellar masses and
sizes, the regions of current star formation (traced by the ionized gas) and of potential star-formation
(traced by the molecular gas) are substantially smaller in LIRGs, and constrained to the central
kpc region. High-z galaxies represent a wider population but their star-forming regions are more
extended, even covering the overall size of the host galaxy. High-z galaxies have larger fractions
of gas than low-z LIRGs, and therefore the formation of stars could be induced by interactions and
mergers in extended disks or filaments with large enough molecular gas surface density involving
physical mechanisms similar to those identified in the central kpc of LIRGs.

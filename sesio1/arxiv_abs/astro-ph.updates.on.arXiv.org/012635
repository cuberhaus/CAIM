To understand the physical conditions of various gaseous systems, plasma diagnostics must be performed
properly. To that end, it is equally important to have extinction correction performed properly.
This means that the physical conditions of the target sources -- the very quantities to be derived
via plasma diagnostics -- must be known even before performing extinction correction, because
the degree of extinction is usually determined by comparing the observed spectra of the target sources
with their theoretically predicted counterparts. One way to resolve this conundrum is to perform
both extinction correction and plasma diagnostics together by iteratively seeking a converged
solution. In fact, if these analyses are performed self-consistently, a converged solution can
be found based solely on well-calibrated line intensities, given the adopted extinction law and
the R_V value. However, it is still rare to find these analyses done numerically rigorously from
start to finish. In this contribution for the APN 8e conference, we would like to review this convoluted
problem and sort out critical issues based on the results of our recent experiments. It appears that
the convoluted theoretical and observational progresses exacerbated by the highly numerical
nature of these analyses necessitated a number of analytical simplifications to make the problem
analytically tractable in the pre-computer era and that such analytical simplifications still
remain rampant in the literature today even after ample computational resources became readily
available. Hence, the community is encouraged to do away with this old habit of sidestepping numerical
calculations, which may have been a necessary evil in the past. This is especially true in the context
of spatially-resolved 2-D spectroscopy, which obviously conflicts with the uniformity assumption
often blindly inherited from 1-D spectroscopy.

We searched massive galaxy population in the known large-scale high-density structure of Lyman$~\alpha$
emitters (LAEs) at $z=2.39$ near the radio galaxy 53W002 by using $B,~V,~i^\prime,~J,~H,$ and
$~K_s$-bands imaging data taken with Suprime-Cam and MOIRCS on the Subaru telescope. We selected
62 protocluster member candidates by their $JHK_s$-band colors and photometric redshift analysis
($JHK_s$-selected galaxies) in our survey field of $70.2~{\rm{arcmin}}^{2}$, and compared their
physical properties estimated from the SED fitting with a comparison sample in the COSMOS field.
We found significant number density excesses for the $JHK_s$-selected galaxies in the 53W002 field
at $K_s<22.25,~J-K_s>2,$ or $V-K_s>4$. In particular the number density of the $JHK_s$-selected
galaxies with $K_s<22.25$ and $J-K_s>2$ in the 53W002 field is eight times higher than the comparison
sample. Most of those with $K_s<22.25$ and $J-K_s>2$ are massive galaxies with $M_s>10^{11}~M_\odot$,
and their sSFRs of $10^{-11}$--$10^{-10}~\rm{yr^{-1}}$ suggest that the star formation has not
yet stopped completely. We also found a density excess of quiescent galaxies with $M_s=5\times10^{10}$--$10^{11}~M_\odot$
and ${\rm{sSFR}}<10^{-11}~\rm{yr^{-1}}$ as well as that of low-mass galaxies with $M_s=10^{9.75}$--$10^{10}~M_\odot$
and various sSFRs. The massive galaxies with $M_s>10^{11}~M_\odot$ are not located at the density
peaks of LAEs, but they show a wide distribution along the similar direction with the structure of
LAEs over $\sim15$--$20$ comoving Mpc. On the other hand, the quiescent galaxies with ${\rm{sSFR}}<10^{-11}~\rm{yr^{-1}}$
clearly avoid the structure of LAEs. Our results suggest that massive galaxies also exist in this
protocluster discovered by the moderate overdensity of LAEs and their star formation activity
depends on location in the protocluster.

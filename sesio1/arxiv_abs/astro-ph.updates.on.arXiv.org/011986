Multi-field inflation models and non-Bunch-Davies vacuum initial conditions both predict sizeable
non-Gaussian primordial perturbations and anisotropic $\mu$-type spectral distortions of the
cosmic microwave background (CMB) blackbody. While CMB anisotropies allow us to probe non-Gaussianity
at wavenumbers $k\simeq 0.05\,{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$, $\mu$-distortion anisotropies are related to
non-Gaussianity of primordial perturbation modes with much larger wavenumbers, $k\simeq 740\,{\rm
Mpc^{-1}}$. Through cross-correlations between CMB and $\mu$-distortion anisotropies, one
can therefore shed light on the aforementioned inflation models. We investigate the ability of
a future CMB satellite imager like LiteBIRD to measure $\mu T$ and $\mu E$ cross-power spectra between
anisotropic $\mu$-distortions and CMB temperature and $E$-mode polarization anisotropies in
the presence of foregrounds, and derive LiteBIRD forecasts on ${f_{\rm NL}^\mu(k\simeq 740\,{\rm
Mpc^{-1}})}$. We show that $\mu E$ cross-correlations with CMB polarization provide more constraining
power on $f_{\rm NL}^\mu$ than $\mu T$ cross-correlations in the presence of foregrounds, and the
joint combination of $\mu T$ and $\mu E$ observables adds further leverage to the detection of small-scale
primordial non-Gaussianity. We find that LiteBIRD would detect ${f_{\rm NL}^\mu}=4500$ at $5\sigma$
significance after foreground removal, and achieve a minimum error of ${\sigma(f_{\rm NL}^\mu=0)
\simeq 800}$ at 68\% CL by combining CMB temperature and polarization. Due to the huge dynamic range
of wavenumbers between CMB and $\mu$-distortion anisotropies, such large $f^\mu_{\rm NL}$ values
would still be consistent with current CMB constraints in the case of very mild scale-dependence
of primordial non-Gaussianity. Anisotropic spectral distortions thus provide a new path, complementary
to CMB $B$-modes, to probe inflation with LiteBIRD.

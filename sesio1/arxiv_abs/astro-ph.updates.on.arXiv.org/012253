Surface brightness-colour relations (SBCRs) are largely used for general studies in stellar astrophysics
and for determining extragalactic distances. Based on simulated spectra of late-type stars using
MARCS model atmospheres, our aim is to analyse the effect of stellar fundamental parameters on the
surface brightness. We also compare theoretical and recent empirical SBCRs. We used MARCS model
atmospheres to compute spectra and the surface brightness of stars. We first explored the parameter
space of MARCS (i.e. effective temperature, $\log g$, $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}$, microturbulence, and
mass) in order to quantify their impact on the surface brightness. Then we considered a relation
between the effective temperature and $\log g$ for late dwarfs and giants, as well as a solar metallicity,
in order to allow a consistent comparison of theoretical and empirical SBCRs. We find that the SBCR
is not sensitive to the microturbulence and mass. The effect of metallicity on the SBCR is found to
be larger for dwarfs than for giants. It is also larger when considering larger $V-K_s$ values. We
also find that a difference of 0.5 dex in metallicity between Galactic and LMC SBCRs does not affect
the recent LMC distance determination, based on eclipsing binaries, by more than 0.4%. By comparing
theoretical with empirical SBCRs, we find a good agreement of less than 2$\sigma$ for F5-K7 dwarfs
and giants stars, while a larger discrepancy is found for M dwarfs and giants (about 4-6$\sigma$).
The surface gravity properties, as modelled in MARCS, explain the differences in the empirical
SBCRs in terms of class. We finally find that theoretical and empirical SBCRs for Cepheids are consistent.
Carefully considering metallicity and $\log g$ is mandatory when calibrating or using SBCRs.

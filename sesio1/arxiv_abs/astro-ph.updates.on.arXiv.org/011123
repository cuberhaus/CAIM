Metrewave solar type-III radio bursts offer a unique means to study the properties of turbulence
across the coronal heights.Theoretical models have shown that the apparent intensity and size
of the burst sources evolve at sub-second scales under the influence of local turbulence. The properties
of the evolution varies with observation frequency. However, observational studies remained
difficult due to the lack of high fidelity imaging capabilities at these fine temporal scales simultaneously
across wide spectral bands. I present a spectroscopic snapshot imaging (0.5 s, 160 kHz resolution)
study of a type-III burst event across 80 - 200 MHz band. By modelling the temporal variability of
the source sizes and intensity at every observation frequency, the characteristics of coronal
turbulence is studied across a heliocentric height range of ~1.54 - 1.75 $R_\odot$. To understand
the morphological evolution of the type-III source, a 2D Gaussian fitting procedure is used. The
observed trends in the source area and integrated flux density are analysed in the framework of theoretical
and data driven models.Results.The strength of density fluctuations ($\delta N/N$) in the corona
is derived as a function of height (R). Combined with the archival low frequency data, $\delta N/N$
values across ~1.5 - 2.2 $R_\odot$ agree within a few factors. The burst decay time ($\tau_{decay}$)
and the FWHM of the source showed a power-law dependency with frequency, roughly consistent with
the results from data driven models. However,the values of $\tau_{decay}$ across frequency are
higher than expected. The intrinsic sizes of the burst source were derived correcting for scatter
broadening. This roughly matched the expected size of flux tubes at the coronal heights explored.
I also report the observation of an intrinsic anti-phased pulsation in area and flux density of the
source.

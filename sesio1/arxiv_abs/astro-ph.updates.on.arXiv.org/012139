The physical origin of fast radio bursts (FRBs) remains unclear. Finding multiwavelength counterparts
of FRBs can be a breakthrough in understanding their nature. In this work, we perform a systematic
search for astronomical transients (ATs) whose positions are consistent with FRBs. We find an unclassified
optical transient AT2020hur ($\alpha=01^{\mathrm{h}} 58^{\mathrm{m}} 00.750^{\mathrm{s}}
\pm 1$ arcsec, $\delta=65^{\circ} 43^{\prime} 00.30^{\prime \prime} \pm 1$ arcsec) that is spatially
coincident with the repeating FRB 180916B ($\alpha=01^{\mathrm{h}} 58^{\mathrm{m}} 00.7502^{\mathrm{s}}
\pm 2.3$ mas, $\delta=65^{\circ} 43^{\prime} 00.3152^{\prime \prime} \pm 2.3$ mas). The chance
possibility for the AT2020hur-FRB 180916B association is about 0.04%, which corresponds to a significance
of $3.5\sigma$. We develop a giant flare afterglow model to fit AT2020hur. Although the giant flare
afterglow model can interpret the observations of AT2020hur, the derived kinetic energy of such
a GF is at least three orders of magnitude larger than that of the typical GF, and there is a lot of fine
tuning and coincidences required for this model. Another possible explanation is that AT2020hur
might consist of two or more optical flares originating from the FRB source, e.g. fast optical bursts
produced by the inverse Compton scattering of FRB emission. Besides, AT2020hur is located in one
of the activity windows of FRB 180916B, which is an independent support for the association. This
coincidence may be due to the reason that the optical counterpart is subject to the same periodic
modulation as FRB 180916B, as implied by the prompt FRB counterparts. Future simultaneous observations
of FRBs and their optical counterparts may help reveal their physical origin.

Many theoretical resolutions to the so-called "Hubble tension" rely on modifying the sound horizon
at recombination, $r_s$, and thus the acoustic scale used as a standard ruler in the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) and large scale structure (LSS) datasets. As shown in a number of recent works,
these observables can also be used to compute $r_s$-independent constraints on $H_0$ by making
use of the horizon scale at matter-radiation equality, $k_{\rm eq}$, which has different sensitivity
to high redshift physics than $r_s$. In this work, we present the tightest $k_{\rm eq}$-based constraints
on the expansion rate from current data, finding $H_0=64.8^{+2.2}_{-2.5}$ at 68$\%$ CL from a combination
of BOSS galaxy power spectra, Planck CMB lensing, and the newly released Pantheon+ supernova constraints,
as well as physical priors on the baryon density, neutrino mass, and spectral index (in $\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$
units). The BOSS and Planck measurements have different degeneracy directions, leading to the
improved combined constraints, with a bound of $H_0 = 67.1^{+2.5}_{-2.9}$ ($63.6^{+2.9}_{-3.6}$)
from BOSS (Planck) alone. The results show some dependence on the neutrino mass bounds, with the
constraint broadening to $H_0 = 68.0^{+2.9}_{-3.2}$ if we instead impose a weak prior on $\sum m_\nu$
from terrestrial experiments rather than assuming $\sum m_\nu<0.26\,\mathrm{eV}$, or shifting
to $H_0 = 64.6\pm2.4$ if the neutrino mass is fixed to its minimal value. Even without any dependence
on the sound horizon, our results are in $\approx 3\sigma$ tension with those obtained from the Cepheid-calibrated
distance ladder, providing evidence against new physics models that vary $H_0$ by changing acoustic
physics or the expansion history immediately prior to recombination.

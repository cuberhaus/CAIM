Spectral hole burning reduces sodium laser guide star efficiency. Due to photon recoil, atoms that
are initially resonant with the single-frequency laser get Doppler shifted out of resonance, which
reduces the return flux. Frequency-chirped (also known as frequency-swept) continuous-wave
lasers have the potential to mitigate the effect of spectral hole burning and even increase the laser
guide star efficiency beyond the theoretical limit of a single-frequency laser. On-sky measurements
of a frequency-chirped, single-frequency laser guide star are performed at the Roque de los Muchachos
Observatory on La Palma. In the experiment, a 35-cm telescope and a fast photon counting receiver
system are employed to resolve the return flux response during laser frequency sweeps gaining insights
into the population dynamics of the sodium layer. At a launched laser power of 16.5 W, we find a maximum
gain in return flux of 22\% compared to a fixed-frequency laser. Our results suggest a strong dependence
of chirping gain on power density at the mesosphere, i.e. laser power and seeing. Maximum gains are
recorded at a chirping amplitude on the order of 150 MHz and a chirping rate of 0.8 MHz $\mu$s$^{-1}$,
as predicted by theory. Time-resolved measurements during the chirping period confirm our understanding
of the population dynamics in the sodium layer. To our knowledge these are the first measurements
of return flux enhancement for laser guide stars excited by a single frequency-chirped continuous-wave
laser. For higher laser powers, the effectiveness of chirping is expected to increase, which could
be highly beneficial for telescopes equipped with high-power laser guide star adaptive optics
systems, also for emerging space awareness applications using laser guide stars such as satellite
imaging and ground-to-space optical communications.

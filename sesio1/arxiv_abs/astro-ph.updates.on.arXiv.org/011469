We present a simple model for the host mass dependence of the galaxy nucleation fraction ($f_{nuc}$),
the galaxy's nuclear star cluster (NSC) mass and the mass in its surviving globular clusters ($M_{GC,obs}$).
Considering the mass and orbital evolution of a GC in a galaxy potential, we define a critical mass
limit ($M_{GC,lim}$) above which a GC can simultaneously in-spiral to the galaxy centre due to dynamical
friction and survive tidal dissolution, to build up the NSC. The analytic expression for this threshold
mass allows us to model the nucleation fraction for populations of galaxies. We find that the slope
and curvature of the initial galaxy size-mass relation is the most important factor (with the shape
of the GC mass function a secondary effect) setting the fraction of galaxies that are nucleated at
a given mass. The well defined skew-normal $f_{nuc} - M_{gal}$ observations in galaxy cluster populations
are naturally reproduced in these models, provided there is an inflection in the {initial} size-mass
relation at $M_{gal} \sim 10^{9.5} {\rm M_{\odot}}$. Our analytic model also predicts limits to
the $M_{gal} - M_{GC,tot}$ and $M_{gal} - M_{NSC}$ relations which bound the scatter of the observational
data. Moreoever, we illustrate how these scaling relations and $f_{nuc}$ vary if the star cluster
formation efficiency, GC mass function, galaxy environment or galaxy size-mass relation are altered.
Two key predictions of our model are: 1) galaxies with NSC masses greater than their GC system masses
are more compact at fixed stellar mass, and 2) the fraction of nucleated galaxies at fixed galaxy
mass is higher in denser environments. That a single model framework can reproduce both the NSC and
GC scaling relations provides strong evidence that GC in-spiral is an important mechanism for NSC
formation.

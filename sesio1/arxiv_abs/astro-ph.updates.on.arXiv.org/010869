The active galactic nucleus 4C +28.07 is a flat spectrum radio quasar, one of the brightest at $\gamma$-ray
energies. We study its multi-wavelength emission by analysing $\sim12.3$ years of \textit{Fermi-LAT}
data in the $\gamma$-ray band and \textit{Swift-XRT/UVOT} available data in X-ray and Optical-to-Ultraviolet
bands. In the $\gamma$-ray band, five flaring periods have been detected, during which the flux
dramatically increases by several times (>5) compared with its average quiescent phase. Quasi-simultaneously
with the flaring times, the X-ray and UVOT data detected by \textit{Swift-XRT/UVOT} have also been
analysed. In one of the brightest flare periods (Flare 5; observed on Oct 12, 2018) the $\gamma$-ray
flux reached $(6.7\pm0.81)\times 10^{-6}$ photon/cm^2/s ($\sim31\times$ higher than the mean
flux over 12.3 years) with detection significance of $\sigma=6.1$. The apparent $\gamma$-ray
luminosity of this flaring corresponds to $3.6\times10^{49}$ erg/s (for a distance of 8.38 Gpc),
one of the highest $\gamma$-ray luminosities observed for blazars. Flare 5 has an estimated $\sim2$
hours time block, which can be considered the average $\gamma$-ray variability time. The variability
time constrains the $\gamma$-ray emitting region size to <9e14 cm, which is close to the black hole
radius. The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) in the $\gamma$-ray band for the $\sim12.3$ years
of data show an early cut-off at $\sim14$ GeV; beyond $\sim60$ GeV, however, the spectrum hardens
and is detected up to $\sim316$ GeV. Similar spectral behaviour is also noticeable for the SEDs of
flares, which can be linked to the photon absorption by the emitting region's internal and external
narrow-band radiation fields. Considering the significance of the obtained results from 4C\,+28.07,
we compared the parameters with 3C\,279 and M87, to motivate further studies.

We study stellar population and structural properties of massive $\log(M_{\star} / M_{\odot})
> 11$ galaxies at $z\sim2.7$ in the Magneticum (box 3) and IllustrisTNG (TNG100, TNG300) hydrodynamical
simulations. We find stellar mass functions broadly consistent with observations, with no scarcity
of massive, quiescent galaxies at $z\sim2.7$, but with a higher quiescent galaxy fraction at high
masses in IllustrisTNG. Average ages of simulated quiescent galaxies are between 0.8 and 1.0 Gyr,
older by a factor $\sim2$ than observed in spectroscopically-confirmed quiescent galaxies at
similar redshift. Besides being potentially indicative of issues with star-formation recipes
in simulations, this discrepancy might also be partly explained by limitations in the estimation
of observed ages. We investigate the purity of simulated UVJ rest-frame colorselected massive
quiescent samples with photometric uncertainties typical of deep surveys (e.g., COSMOS). We find
evidence for significant contamination (up to 60 percent) by dusty star-forming galaxies in the
UVJ region that is typically populated by older quiescent sources. Furthermore, simulations suggest
that the completeness of UVJ-selected quiescent samples at this redshift may be reduced by 30 percent
due to a high fraction of young quiescent galaxies not entering the UVJ quiescent region. Massive,
quiescent galaxies in simulations have on average lower angular momenta and higher projected axis
ratios and concentrations than star-forming counterparts. Average sizes of simulated quiescent
galaxies are relatively close to observed ones, and broadly consistent within the uncertainties.
The average size ratio of quiescent and star-forming galaxies in the probed mass range is formally
consistent with observations, although this result is partly affected by poor statistics.

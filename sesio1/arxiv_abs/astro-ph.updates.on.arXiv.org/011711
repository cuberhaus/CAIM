During the X-ray bursts of GS 1826$-$24, "clocked burster", the nuclear reaction flow that surges
through the rapid-proton capture process path has to pass through the NiCu cycles before reaching
the ZnGa cycles that moderate the further extent of hydrogen burning in the region above germanium
and selenium isotopes. The $^{57}$Cu(p,$\gamma$)$^{58}$Zn reaction located in the NiCu cycles
plays an important role in influencing the burst light curves as found by Cyburt et al. (2016). We
deduce the $^{57}$Cu(p,$\gamma$)$^{58}$Zn reaction rate based on the experimentally determined
important nuclear structure information, isobaric-multiplet-mass equation, and large-scale
shell model calculations. Based on the isobaric-multiplet-mass equation, we propose a possible
order of $1^+_1$ and $2^+_3$ dominant resonance states and constrain the resonance energy of the
$1^+_2$ state. The latter reduces the contribution of the $1^+_2$ dominant resonance state. The
new reaction rate is up to a factor of four lower than the Forstner et al. (2001) rate recommended by
JINA REACLIB v2.2 at the temperature regime sensitive to clocked bursts of GS 1826$-$24. Using the
simulation from the one-dimensional implicit hydrodynamic code, KEPLER, to model the thermonuclear
X-ray bursts of GS 1826$-$24 clocked burster, we find that the new $^{57}$Cu(p,$\gamma$)$^{58}$Zn
coupled with the latest $^{56}$Ni(p,$\gamma$)$^{57}$Cu and $^{55}$Ni(p,$\gamma$)$^{56}$Cu
reaction rates redistributes the reaction flow in the NiCu cycles and strongly influences the burst
ash composition, whereas the $^{59}$Cu(p,$\alpha$)$^{56}$Ni and $^{59}$Cu(p,$\gamma$)$^{60}$Zn
reactions suppress the influence of the $^{57}$Cu(p,$\gamma$)$^{58}$Zn reaction and diminish
the impact of nuclear reaction flow that by-passes the important $^{56}$Ni waiting point induced
by the $^{55}$Ni(p,$\gamma$)$^{56}$Cu reaction on burst light curve.

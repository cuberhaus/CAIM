Classic solar models put the Chromosphere-Corona Transition Region (CCTR} at $\sim2$Mm above
the $\tau_{5000} = 1$ level, whereas rMHD models place it in a wider range of heights. Observational
verification is scarce. We review and discuss recent results from various instruments and spectral
domains. In SDO and TRACE images spicules appear in emission in the 1600, 1700 and 304 A bands and in
absorption in the EUV bands; the latter is due to photo-ionization of H and He I. At the shortest available
AIA wavelength and taking into account that the photospheric limb is $\sim0.34$Mm above the $\tau_{5000}=1$
level, we found that CCTR emission starts at $\sim3.7$Mm; extrapolating to $\lambda=0$, where
there is no chromospheric absorption, we deduced a height of $3.0\pm 0.5$Mm, above the value of 2.14Mm
of the Avrett & Loeser model. Another indicator of the extent of the chromosphere is the height of
the network structures. Height differences produce a limbward shift of features with respect to
their counterparts in magnetograms. Using this approach, we measured heights of $0.14\pm0.04$Mm
(at 1700 A), $0.31\pm0.09$Mm (at 1600 A) and $3.31\pm 0.18$Mm (at 304 A) for the center of the solar
disk. A previously reported possible solar cycle variation is not confirmed. A third indicator
is the position of the limb in the UV, where IRIS observations of the Mg II triplet lines show that they
extend up to $\sim2.1$Mm above the 2832 A limb, while AIA/SDO images give a limb height of $1.4 \pm
0.2$Mm (1600 A) and $5.7\pm 0.2$Mm (304 A). Finally, ALMA mm-$\lambda$ full-disk images provide
useful diagnostics, though not very accurate; values of $2.4\pm0.7$Mm at 1.26mm and $4.2\pm2.5$Mm
at 3mm were obtained. Putting everything together, we conclude that the average chromosphere extends
higher than homogeneous models predict, but within the range of rMHD models.

We investigate the joint density-velocity evolution in $f(R)$ gravity using smooth, compensated,
spherical top-hats as a proxy for the non-linear regime. Using the Hu-Sawicki model as a working
example, we solve the coupled continuity, Euler and Einstein equations using an iterative hybrid
Lagrangian-Eulerian scheme. The novel aspect of this scheme is that the metric potentials are solved
for analytically in the Eulerian frame. The evolution is assumed to follow GR at very early epochs
and switches to $f(R)$ at a pre-determined epoch $a_{switch}$. Choosing $a_{switch}$ too early
is computationally expensive because of high frequency oscillations; choosing it too late potentially
destroys consistency with $\Lambda$CDM. To make an informed choice of $a_{switch}$ we perform
an eigenvalue analysis of the background model which gives a ballpark estimate of the magnitude
of oscillations. There are two length scales in the problem: the width of the top-hat and the comoving
Compton wavelength of the scalar field associated with the modification. The evolution is determined
by their ratio $Q$. We vary the top-hat width to consider three regimes: $Q>>1$ (strong), $Q \sim
1$ (intermediate) and $Q<<1$ (weak). Two values of the smoothing parameter are considered to capture
the profile-dependence of the results. When $Q>>1$, the evolution is scale-independent, the density-velocity
divergence relation (DVDR) is unique and we give a fitting formula for the same. When $Q<<1$, the
evolution is very close to GR, except for a formation of a spike near the top-hat edge, a feature which
has been noted in earlier literature in the context of the chameleon mechanism. We are able to qualitatively
explain this feature in terms of the analytic solution for the metric potential. When $Q \sim 1$,
the evolution is highly profile-dependent and no unique DVDR exists.

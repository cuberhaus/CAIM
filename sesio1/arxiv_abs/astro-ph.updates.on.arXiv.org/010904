(Abridged) Most massive protostars exhibit bipolar outflows. Nonetheless, there is no consensus
regarding the mechanism at the origin of these outflows, nor on the cause of the less-frequently
observed monopolar outflows. We aim to identify the origin of early massive protostellar outflows,
focusing on the combined effects of radiative transfer and magnetic fields in a turbulent medium.
We use four state-of-the-art radiation-magnetohydrodynamical simulations following the collapse
of massive 100 Msun pre-stellar cores with the Ramses code. Turbulence is taken into account via
initial velocity dispersion. We use a hybrid radiative transfer method and include ambipolar diffusion.
We find that turbulence delays the launching of outflows, which appear to be mainly driven by magnetohydrodynamical
processes. Magnetic tower flow and the magneto-centrifugal acceleration contribute to the acceleration
and the former operates on larger volumes than the latter. Our finest resolution, 5 AU, does not allow
us to get converged results on magneto-centrifugally accelerated outflows. Radiative acceleration
takes place as well, dominates in the star vicinity, enlarges the outflow extent, and has no negative
impact on the launching of magnetic outflows (up to M~17 Msun, L~1e5 Lsun). The associated opening
angles (20-30 deg when magnetic fields dominate) suggest additional (de-)collimating effects
to meet observational constraints. Outflows are launched nearly perpendicular to the disk and
are misaligned with the initial core-scale magnetic fields, in agreement with several observational
studies. In the most turbulent run, the outflow is monopolar. We conclude that magnetic processes
dominate the acceleration of massive protostellar outflows up to ~17 Msun, against radiative processes.
Turbulence perturbs the outflow launching and is a possible explanation for monopolar outflows.

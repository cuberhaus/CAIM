We present millimeter (80-230 GHz), radio (6-45 GHz), and X-ray (0.2-10 keV) observations of ZTF20acigmel
(AT2020xnd), a short-duration luminous optical transient at $z=0.2433$. The 100 GHz peak luminosity
is similar to that of long-duration gamma-ray bursts ($2\times10^{30}$ erg sec$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$)
but the light curve rises on a much longer timescale (one month). In the standard framework of synchrotron
self-absorption of electrons in a power-law energy distribution, the data imply a fast ($v\approx0.2c$)
shock with large energy ($U\gtrsim 10^{49}$ erg) propagating in a medium with a steep ($n_e \propto
r^{-3}$) density profile. The forward-shock properties are similar to those of the fast-luminous
transient AT2018cow, and in both cases the model for the late-time ($\Delta t>70$ d) low-frequency
($\nu<40$ GHz) data is not consistent with the early-time ($\Delta t<40$d) high-frequency ($\nu>70$
GHz) emission. Motivated by the observation of a steep spectral index ($f_\nu \propto \nu^{-2}$)
across the millimeter bands, we favor a thermal electron population (relativistic Maxwellian)
for the synchrotron emission, the first such inference for a cosmic explosion. We find that the X-ray
luminosity of $L_X\approx10^{43}$erg sec$^{-1}$ exceeds simple predictions from the radio and
UVOIR luminosity and likely has a separate physical origin, such as a central engine. Our work suggests
that luminous millimeter, radio, and X-ray emission are a generic feature of transients with fast
($\approx3$ days) and luminous ($M\approx-21$ mag) optical light curves. We estimate the rate
at which transients like AT2018cow and AT2020xnd will be detected by future wide-field millimeter
transient surveys like CMB-S4, and conclude that energetic explosions in dense environments may
represent a significant population of extragalactic transients in the 100 GHz sky.

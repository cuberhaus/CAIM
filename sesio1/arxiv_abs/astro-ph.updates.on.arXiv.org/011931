Forming planetesimals from pebbles is a major challenge in our current understanding of planet
formation. In a protoplanetary disk, pebbles drift inward near the disk midplane via gas drag and
they may enter a dead zone. In this context, we identified that the backreaction of the drag of pebbles
onto the gas could lead to a runaway pile-up of pebbles, the so-called no-drift mechanism. We improve
upon the previous study of the no-drift mechanism by investigating the nature and characteristics
of the resultant planetesimal belt. We performed 1D diffusion-advection simulations of drifting
pebbles in the outer region of a dead zone by including the backreaction to the radial drift of pebbles
and including planetesimal formation via the streaming instability. We considered the parameters
that regulate gas accretion and vertical stirring of pebbles in the disk midplane. In this study,
the pebble-to-gas mass flux ($F_{\rm p/g}$) was fixed as a parameter. We find that planetesimals
initially form within a narrow ring whose width expands as accumulating pebbles radially diffuse
over time. The system finally reaches a steady-state where the width of the planetesimal belt no
longer changes. A non-negligible total mass of planetesimals (more than one Earth mass) is formed
for a disk having $F_{\rm p/g} \gtrsim 0.1$ for more than $\sim 10-100$ kyr with nominal parameters:
a gas mass flux of $\gtrsim10^{-8} {\rm M}_\oplus$/yr, $\tau_{\rm s} \simeq 0.01-0.1$, $\alpha_{\rm
mid} \lesssim 10^{-4}$, and $\alpha_{\rm acc} \simeq 10^{-3}-10^{-2}$ at $r \lesssim 10$ au, where
$r$, $\tau_{\rm s}$, $\alpha_{\rm mid}$, and $\alpha_{\rm acc}$ are the heliocentric distance,
the Stokes number, and the parameters in a dead zone controlling the efficiencies of vertical turbulent
diffusion of pebbles (i.e., scale height of pebbles) and gas accretion of the $\alpha$-disk (i.e.,
gas surface density), respectively.

Context: the theory of stellar evolution presents shortcomings when confronted with asteroseismic
probes of interior physical properties. The differences between observations and theory are often
great because stellar models have mainly been calibrated from observables connected to the surface
of stars. Period-spacing patterns caused by gravity modes are a particularly powerful asteroseismic
tool that are useful for probing the near-core rotation and mixing of chemical elements in main-sequence
stars with convective cores. Aims: we aim to compose a catalog of intermediate-mass stars in the
TESS southern continuous viewing zone to reveal period-spacing patterns caused by gravity modes
for use in future asteroseismic modeling. Methods: TESS full frame images were inspected to select
stars of intermediate- and high-mass using color-magnitude criteria. Light curves were extracted
from custom masks per star, adopting stringent constraints on the aperture masks and contamination.
The extracted light curves were subject to iterative prewhitening to detect gravity modes. We developed
a method based on the assumption that period spacings are an approximately linear function of the
mode periods to build a template pattern. This template was used to extract the patterns and their
bootstrap uncertainties. Results: our TESS catalog of high-quality period-spacing patterns
is the first of its kind and contains 140 gravity-mode patterns in 106 Gamma Doradus stars and 2 slowly
pulsating B-type stars. Half of these patterns contain 7 or more measured mode periods and the longest
pattern contains 20 modes. We provide the community with a convenient software tool to search for
period-spacing patterns and to process the extracted light curves. Conclusions: our catalog offers
a fruitful starting point for future gravity-mode asteroseismology of rotating dwarfs with convective
cores in the southern hemisphere.

The primordial He abundance $Y_P$ is a powerful probe of cosmology. Currently, $Y_P$ is best determined
by observations of metal-poor galaxies, while there are only a few known local extremely metal-poor
($<0.1 Z_\odot$) galaxies (EMPGs) having reliable He/H measurements with HeI$\lambda$10830
near-infrared (NIR) emission. Here we present deep Subaru NIR spectroscopy and He/H determinations
for 10 EMPGs, combining the existing optical data and the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Adding
the existing 3 EMPGs and 51 moderately metal-poor ($0.1-0.4 Z_\odot$) galaxies with reliable He/H
estimates, we obtain $Y_P=0.2379^{+0.0031}_{-0.0030}$ by linear regression in the (He/H)-(O/H)
plane, where our observations increase the number of EMPGs from 3 to 13 anchoring He/H of the most
metal-poor gas in galaxies. Although our $Y_P$ measurement and previous measurements are consistent,
our result is slightly (~ 1$\sigma$) smaller due to our EMPGs. Including the existing primordial
deuterium $D_P$ constraints, we estimate the effective number of neutrino species to be $N_{eff}=2.41^{+0.19}_{-0.21}$
showing a > 2 $\sigma$ tension with the Standard Model value ($N_{eff}=3.046$), which may be a hint
of an asymmetry in electron-neutrino $\nu_e$ and anti-electron neutrino $\bar{\nu}_e$. Allowing
the degeneracy parameter of electron-neutrino $\xi_e$ to vary as well as $N_{eff}$ and the baryon-to-photon
ratio $\eta$, we obtain $\xi_e$ = $0.05^{+0.03}_{-0.03}$, $N_{eff}=3.22^{+0.33}_{-0.30}$,
and $\eta\times10^{10}=6.13^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$ from the $Y_P$ and $D_P$ measurements with a prior
of $\eta$ taken from Planck Collaboration et al. (2020). Our constraints suggest a $\nu_e - \bar{\nu}_e$
asymmetry and allow for a high value of $N_{eff}$ within the 1$\sigma$ level, which could mitigate
the Hubble tension.

MESSENGER observations suggest a magma ocean formed on proto-Mercury, during which evaporation
of metals and outgassing of C- and H-bearing volatiles produced an early atmosphere. Atmospheric
escape subsequently occurred by plasma heating, photoevaporation, Jeans escape, and photoionization.
To quantify atmospheric loss, we combine constraints on the lifetime of surficial melt, melt composition,
and atmospheric composition. Consideration of two initial Mercury sizes and four magma ocean compositions
determine the atmospheric speciation at a given surface temperature. A coupled interior-atmosphere
model determines the cooling rate and therefore the lifetime of surficial melt. Combining the melt
lifetime and escape flux calculations provide estimates for the total mass loss from early Mercury.
Loss rates by Jeans escape are negligible. Plasma heating and photoionization are limited by homopause
diffusion rates of $\sim10^{6}$ kg/s. Loss by photoevaporation depends on the timing of Mercury
formation and assumed heating efficiency and ranges from $\sim10^{6.6}$ to $\sim10^{9.6}$ kg/s.
The material for photoevaporation is sourced from below the homopause and is therefore energy-limited
rather than diffusion-limited. The timescale for efficient interior-atmosphere chemical exchange
is less than ten thousand years. Therefore, escape processes only account for an equivalent loss
of less than 2.3 km of crust ($0.3\%$ of Mercury's mass). Accordingly, $\leq0.02\%$ of the total
mass of H$_2$O and Na is lost. Therefore, cumulative loss cannot significantly modify Mercury's
bulk mantle composition during the magma ocean stage. Mercury's high core:mantle ratio and volatile-rich
surface may instead reflect chemical variations in its building blocks resulting from its solar-proximal
accretion environment.

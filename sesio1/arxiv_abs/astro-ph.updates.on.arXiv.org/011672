We present results from ALMA 1.2mm continuum observations of a sample of 27 star-forming galaxies
at z=2.1-2.5 from the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) survey. These galaxies have gas-phase
metallicity and star-formation rate measurements from Hb, [OIII], Ha, and [NII]. Using stacks
of Spitzer, Herschel, and ALMA photometry (rest-frame ~ 8-400$\mu$m), we examine the IR SED of high-redshift
subsolar metallicity (~0.5 $Z_{\odot}$) LIRGs. We find that the data agree well with an average
SED template of higher luminosity local low-metallicity dwarf galaxies (reduced $\chi^2$ of 1.8).
When compared with the commonly used templates for solar-metallicity local galaxies or high-redshift
LIRGs and ULIRGs, even in the most favorable case (with reduced $\chi^2$ of 2.8), the templates are
rejected at >98% confidence level. The broader and hotter IR SED of both the local dwarfs and high-redshift
subsolar metallicity galaxies may result from different grain properties, a clumpy dust geometry,
or a harder/more intense ionizing radiation field that heats the dust to higher temperatures. The
obscured SFR indicated by the FIR emission of the subsolar metallicity galaxies is only ~ 60% of the
total SFR, which is considerably lower than that of the local LIRGs with ~ 96-97% obscured fractions.
Due to the evolving IR SED shape, the local LIRG templates fit to mid-IR data can overestimate the
Rayleigh-Jeans tail measurements at z~2 by a factor of 2-20, and these templates underestimate
IR luminosities if fit to the observed ALMA fluxes by >0.4dex. At a given stellar mass or metallicity,
dust masses at z~2.3 are an order of magnitude higher than those at z~0. Given the predicted molecular
gas mass fractions, the observed z~2.3 dust-to-stellar mass ratios suggest lower dust-to-molecular
gas masses than in local galaxies at the same metallicity.

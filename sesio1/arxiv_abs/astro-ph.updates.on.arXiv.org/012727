The Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT) design consists of seven circular 8.4-m diameter mirror segments
that are separated by large > 30 cm gaps, creating the possibility of fluctuations in optical path
differences due to flexure, segment vibrations, wind buffeting, temperature effects, and atmospheric
seeing. In order to utilize the full diffraction-limited aperture of the GMT for natural guide star
adaptive optics (NGSAO) science, the seven mirror segments must be co-phased to well within a fraction
of a wavelength. The current design of the GMT involves seven adaptive secondary mirrors, an off-axis
dispersed fringe sensor (part of the AGWS), and a pyramid wavefront sensor (PyWFS; part of the NGWS)
to measure and correct the total path length between segment pairs, but these methods have yet to
be tested "end-to-end" in a lab environment. We present the design and working prototype of a "GMT
High-Contrast Adaptive Optics phasing Testbed" (p-HCAT) which leverages the existing MagAO-X
AO instrument to demonstrate segment phase sensing and simultaneous AO-control for GMT NGSAO science.
We present the first test results of closed-loop piston control with one GMT segment using MagAO-X's
PyWFS and a novel Holographic Dispersed Fringe Sensor (HDFS) with and without simulated atmospheric
turbulence. We show that the PyWFS alone was unsuccessful at controlling segment piston with generated
~ 0.6 arcsec and ~ 1.2 arcsec seeing turbulence due to non-linear modal cross-talk and poor pixel
sampling of the segment gaps on the PyWFS detector. We report the success of an alternate solution
to control piston using the novel HDFS while controlling all other modes with the PyWFS purely as
a slope sensor (piston mode removed). This "second channel" WFS method worked well to control piston
to within 50 nm RMS and $\pm$ 10 $\mu$m dynamic range under simulated 0.6 arcsec atmospheric seeing
conditions.

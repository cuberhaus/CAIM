We estimated the spectral evolution of white dwarfs with effective temperature using the Javalambre
Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS) second data release (DR2), that provides twelve photometric
optical passbands over 2176 deg2. We analysed 5926 white dwarfs with r <= 19.5 mag in common between
a white dwarf catalog defined from Gaia EDR3 and J-PLUS DR2. We performed a Bayesian analysis by comparing
the observed J-PLUS photometry with theoretical models of hydrogen (H) and helium (He) dominated
atmospheres. We estimated the PDF for effective temperature (Teff), surface gravity, parallax,
and spectral type; and the probability of having a H-dominated atmosphere (pH) for each source.
We applied a prior in parallax, using Gaia EDR3 measurements as reference, and derived a self-consistent
prior for the atmospheric composition as a function of Teff. We described the fraction of He-dominated
atmosphere white dwarfs (fHe) with a linear function of Teff at 5000 < Teff < 30000 K. We found fHe =
0.24 +- 0.01 at Teff = 10000 K, a change rate along the cooling sequence of 0.14 +- 0.02 per 10 kK, and
a minimum He-dominated fraction of 0.08 +- 0.02 at the high-temperature end. We tested the obtained
pH by comparison with spectroscopic classifications, finding that it is reliable. We estimated
the mass distribution for the 351 sources with distance d < 100 pc, mass M > 0.45 Msun, and Teff > 6000
K. The result for H-dominated white dwarfs agrees with previous work, with a dominant M = 0.59 Msun
peak and the presence of an excess at M ~ 0.8 Msun. This high-mass excess is absent in the He-dominated
distribution, which presents a single peak. The J-PLUS optical data provides a reliable statistical
classification of white dwarfs into H- and He-dominated atmospheres. We find a 21 +- 3 % increase
in the fraction of He-dominated white dwarfs from Teff = 20000 K to Teff = 5000 K.

Supernova remnants are believed to be the main sites where Galactic cosmic rays originate. This
scenario, however, fails to explain some of the features observed in the cosmic-ray spectrum. Microquasars
have been proposed as additional candidates, because their non-thermal emission indicates the
existence of efficient particle acceleration mechanisms in their jets. A promising scenario envisages
the production of relativistic neutrons in the jets, that decay outside the system injecting relativistic
protons to the surroundings. The first investigations of this scenario suggest that microquasars
might be fairly alternative cosmic-ray sources. We aim at assessing the role played by the degree
of collimation of the jet on the cosmic-ray energetics in the neutron-carrier scenario, as well
as the properties of the emission region. Our goals are to explain the Galactic component of the observed
proton cosmic-ray spectrum at energies higher than $\sim 10$ GeV and to relate the mentioned jet
properties with the power and spectral index of the produced cosmic rays. We find that collimated
jets, with compact acceleration regions close to the jet base, are very efficient sources that could
deliver a fraction of up to $\sim 0.01$ of their relativistic proton luminosity into cosmic rays.
Collimation is the most significant feature regarding efficiency; a well collimated jet might
be $\sim 4$ orders of magnitude more efficient than a poorly collimated one. The main feature of the
presented mechanism is the production of a spectrum with a steeper spectral index ($\sim 2.3$ at
energies up to $\sim 10$ TeV) than in the supernova scenario, and closer to what is observed. The predictions
of our model may be used to infer the total contribution of the population of Galactic microquasars
to the cosmic ray population, and therefore to quantitatively assess their significance as cosmic-ray
sources.

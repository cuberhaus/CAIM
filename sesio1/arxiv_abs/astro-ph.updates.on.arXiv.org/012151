The star formation and gas content of satellite galaxies around the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda
(M31) are depleted relative to more isolated galaxies in the Local Group (LG) at fixed stellar mass.
We explore the environmental regulation of gas content and quenching of star formation in $z=0$
galaxies at $M_{*}=10^{5-10}$ $\rm{M}_{\odot}$ around 14 MW-mass hosts from the FIRE-2 simulations.
Lower-mass satellites ($M_{*}\lesssim10^7$ $\rm{M}_{\odot}$) are mostly quiescent and higher-mass
satellites ($M_{*}\gtrsim10^8$ $\rm{M}_{\odot}$) are mostly star-forming, with intermediate-mass
satellites ($M_{*}\approx10^{7-8}$ $\rm{M}_{\odot}$) split roughly equally between quiescent
and star-forming. Hosts with more gas in their circumgalactic medium have a higher quiescent fraction
of massive satellites ($M_{*}=10^{8-9}$ $\rm{M}_{\odot}$). We find no significant dependence
on isolated versus paired (LG-like) host environments, and the quiescent fractions of satellites
around MW-mass and LMC-mass hosts from the FIRE-2 simulations are remarkably similar. Environmental
effects that lead to quenching can also occur as preprocessing in low-mass groups prior to MW infall.
Lower-mass satellites typically quenched before MW infall as central galaxies or rapidly during
infall into a low-mass group or a MW-mass galaxy. Intermediate- to high-mass satellites usually
require $\geq1-2$ pericentre passages ($\approx2.5-5$ Gyr) within a MW-mass halo to quench. Most
galaxies with $M_{*}\gtrsim10^{6.5}$ $\rm{M}_{\odot}$ did not quench before falling into a host,
indicating a possible upper mass limit for isolated quenching. The simulations are broadly consistent
with the quiescent fractions of satellites observed in the LG and the SAGA survey, because the simulation
average lies between them and the host-to-host scatter is large.

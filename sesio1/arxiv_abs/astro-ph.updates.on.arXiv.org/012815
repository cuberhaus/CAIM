Aims. To create a retrieval framework which encapsulates the 3D nature of exoplanet atmospheres,
and to apply it to observed emission phase curve and transmission spectra of hot Jupiter exoplanet
WASP-43b. Methods. We present our 3D framework, which is freely available as a stand-alone module
from GitHub. We use the atmospheric modelling and Bayesian retrieval package ARCiS (ARtful modelling
Code for exoplanet Science) to perform 8 3D retrievals on simultaneous transmission (HST/WFC3)
and phase-dependent emission (HST/WFC3, Spitzer/IRAC) observations of WASP-43b as a case study.
We assess how input assumptions affect our retrieval outcomes. In particular we look at constraining
equilibrium chemistry vs a free molecular retrieval, the case of no clouds vs parametrised clouds,
and using Spitzer phase data that have been reduced from two different literature sources. For the
free chemistry retrievals, we retrieve abundances of H2O, CH4, CO, CO2, AlO, and NH3 as a function
of phase, with many more species considered for the equilibrium chemistry retrievals. Results.
We find consistent super-solar C/O (0.6-0.9) and super-solar metallicities (1.7-2.9 dex) for
all retrieval setups that assume equilibrium chemistry. Atmospheric heat distribution, hotspot
shift (15.6 vs 4.5 for different Spitzer datasets), and temperature structure are influenced by
the Spitzer emission phase data. Comparisons are made with other studies of WASP-43b, including
available GCM simulations. Conclusions. The parametrised 3D setup we have developed provides
a valuable tool to analyse extensive observational datasets such as spectroscopic phase curves.
Near-future observations with missions such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Ariel
will greatly improve our understanding of the atmospheres of exoplanets such as WASP-43b.

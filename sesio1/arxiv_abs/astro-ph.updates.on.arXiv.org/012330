Growing evidence has indicated that the global composition distribution plays an indisputable
role in interpreting observational data. 3D general circulation models (GCMs) with a reliable
treatment of chemistry and clouds are particularly crucial in preparing for the upcoming observations.
In the effort of achieving 3D chemistry-climate modeling, the challenge mainly lies in the expensive
computing power required for treating a large number of chemical species and reactions. Motivated
by the need for a robust and computationally efficient chemical scheme, we devise a mini-chemical
network with a minimal number of species and reactions for H$_2$-dominated atmospheres. We apply
a novel technique to simplify the chemical network from a full kinetics model -- VULCAN by replacing
a large number of intermediate reactions with net reactions. The number of chemical species is cut
down from 67 to 12, with the major species of thermal and observational importance retained, including
H$_2$O, CH$_4$, CO, CO$_2$, C$_2$H$_2$, NH$_3$, and HCN. The size of the total reactions is greatly
reduced from $\sim$ 800 to 20. The mini-chemical scheme is validated by verifying the temporal evolution
and benchmarking the predicted compositions in four exoplanet atmospheres (GJ 1214b, GJ 436b,
HD 189733b, HD 209458b) against the full kinetics of VULCAN. It reproduces the chemical timescales
and composition distributions of the full kinetics well within an order of magnitude for the major
species in the pressure range of 1 bar -- 0.1 mbar across various metallicities and carbon-to-oxygen
(C/O) ratios. The small scale of the mini-chemical scheme permits simple use and fast computation,
which is optimal for implementation in a 3D GCM or a retrieval framework. We focus on the thermochemical
kinetics of net reactions in this paper and address photochemistry in a follow-up paper.

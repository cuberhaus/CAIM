We study the most precise light curves of the planet-host HAT-P-36 that we obtained from the ground
primarily with a brand-new 80 cm telescope very recently installed at Ankara University Kreiken
Observatory of Turkey and also from the space with Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. The main
objective of the study is to analyze the Transit Timing Variations (TTV) observed in the hot-Jupiter
type planet HAT-P-36 b, a strong candidate for orbital decay, based on our own observations as well
as that have been acquired by professional and amateur observers since its discovery. HAT-P-36
displays out-of-transit variability as well as light curve anomalies during the transits of its
planet due to stellar spots. We collected and detrended all the complete transit light curves we
had access to from these anomalies, which we modeled with EXOFAST and measured the mid-transit times
forming a homogeneous data set for a TTV analysis. We found an increase in the orbital period of HAT-P-36
b at a rate of 0.014 s per year from the best fitting quadratic function, which is only found in the TTV
constructed by making use of the mid-transit times measured from detrended light curves, against
an expectation of an orbital decay based on its parameters. We refined the values of these system
parameters by modeling the Spectral Energy Distribution of the host star, its archival radial velocity
observations from multiple instruments, and most precise transit light curves from the space and
the ground covering a wide range of wavelengths with EXOFASTV2. We also analyzed the out-of-transit
variability from TESS observations to search for potential rotational modulations through a frequency
analysis. We report a statistically significant periodicity in the TESS light curve at 4.22 +/-
0.02 d, which might have been caused by instrumental systematics but should be tracked in the future
observations of the target.

OAO 1657-415 is an accreting X-ray pulsar with a high mass companion that has been observed by several
telescopes over the years, in different orbital phases. Back in 1999, observations performed with
Beppo-SAX lead to the detection of a cyclotron-resonant-scattering feature, which has not been
found again with any other instrument. A recent NuSTAR X-ray observation, performed during the
brightest phase of the source, allows us to perform sensitive searches for cyclotron-resonant-scattering
features in the hard X-ray spectrum of the source. We aim to characterise the source by means of temporal
and spectral X-ray analysis, and to confidently search for the presence of cyclotron-resonant-scattering
features. The observation was divided into four time intervals in order to characterise each one.
Several timing analysis tools were used to obtain the pulse of the neutron star, and the light curves
folded into the time intervals. The NuSTAR spectrum in the energy range 3-79 keV was used, which was
modelled with a power-law continuum emission model with a high-energy cutoff. We find the pulsations
associated with the source in the full observation, which are shifted due to the orbital Doppler
effect. We show evidence that a cyclotron line at $35.6 \pm 2.5$ keV is present in the spectrum. We
use this energy to estimate the dipolar magnetic field at the pulsar surface to be $4.0\pm 0.2\,\times\,10^{12}$
G. We further estimate a lower limit in the distance to OAO 1657-415 of $\simeq 1$ kpc. And we also find
a possible positive correlation between the luminosity and the energy associated with the cyclotron
line. We conclude that the cyclotron line at $35.6\pm2.5$ keV is the same as that detected by Beppo-SAX.
Our detection has a significance of $\sim$ 3.4$\sigma$.

We present an Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) survey of CO(4--3) line emitting
galaxies in 17 quasar fields at $z\sim4$ aimed to perform the first systematic search of dusty galaxies
in high$-z$ quasar environments. Our blind search of galaxies around the quasars results in 5 CO
emitters with S/N$\geq5.6$ within a projected radius of $R\lesssim1.5\,h^{-1}\,$cMpc and a velocity
range of $\rm\Delta\,v=\pm1000\,$km\,s$^{-1}$ around the quasar. In blank fields, we expect
to detect only 0.28 CO emitters within the same volume, implying a total overdensity of $17.6^{+11.9}_{-7.6}$
in our fields, and indicating that quasars trace massive structures in the early universe. We quantify
this overdensity by measuring the small-scale clustering of CO emitters around quasars, resulting
in a cross-correlation length of $r_{\rm 0,QG}=8.37^{+2.42}_{-2.04}\,h^{-1}\,$cMpc, assuming
a fixed slope $\gamma=1.8$. This contradicts the reported mild overdensities (x1.4) of Lyman alpha
emitters (LAEs) in the same fields at scales of $R\lesssim7\,h^{-1}\,$cMpc which is well described
by a cross-correlation length 3 times lower than that measured for CO emitters. We discuss some possibilities
to explain this discrepancy, including low star formation efficiency, and excess of dust in galaxies
around quasars. Finally, we constrain, for the first time, the clustering of CO emitters at $z\sim4$,
finding an auto-correlation length of $r_{\rm 0,CO}=3.14\pm1.71\,h^{-1}\,$cMpc (with $\gamma=1.8$).
Our work together with the previous study of LAEs around quasars traces simultaneously the clustering
properties of both optical and dusty galaxy populations in quasars fields, stressing the importance
of multi-wavelength studies, and highlighting important questions about galaxy properties in
high$-z$ dense environments.

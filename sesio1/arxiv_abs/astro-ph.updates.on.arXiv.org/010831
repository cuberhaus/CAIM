Consideration of both low- and high-resolution transmission spectroscopy is key for obtaining
a comprehensive picture of exoplanet atmospheres. In studies of transmission spectra, the continuum
information is well established with low-resolution spectra, while the shapes of individual lines
are best constrained with high-resolution observations. In this work, we aim to merge high- with
low-resolution transmission spectroscopy. We present the analysis of three primary transits
of WASP-69b in the VIS channel of the CARMENES instrument and perform a combined low- and high-resolution
analysis using additional data from HARPS-N, OSIRIS/GTC, and WFC3/HST already available in the
literature. During the first CARMENES observing night, we detected the planet Na D$_{2}$ and D$_{1}$
lines at $\sim 7\sigma$ and $\sim 3\sigma$ significance levels, respectively. We measured a D$_{2}$/D$_{1}$
intensity ratio of 2.5$\pm$0.7, which is in agreement with previous HARPS-N observations. Our
modelling of WFC3 and OSIRIS data suggests strong Rayleigh scattering, solar to super-solar water
abundance, and a highly muted Na feature in the atmosphere of this planet, in agreement with previous
investigations of this target. We use the continuum information retrieved from the low-resolution
spectroscopy as a prior to break the degeneracy between the Na abundance, reference pressure, and
thermosphere temperature for the high-resolution spectroscopic analysis. We fit the Na D$_{1}$
and D$_{2}$ lines individually and find that the posterior distributions of the model parameters
agree with each other within 1$\sigma$. Our results suggest that local thermodynamic equilibrium
processes can explain the observed D$_{2}$/D$_{1}$ ratio because the presence of haze opacity
mutes the absorption features.

The final collapse of the cores of massive stars can lead to a wide variety of outcomes in terms of electromagnetic
and kinetic energies, nucleosynthesis, and remnants. The connection of this wide spectrum of explosion
and remnant types to the properties of the progenitors remains an open issue. Rotation and magnetic
fields in Wolf-Rayet stars of subsolar metallicity may explain extreme events such as superluminous
supernovae and gamma-ray bursts powered by proto-magnetars or collapsars. Continuing numerical
studies of magnetorotational core collapse including detailed neutrino physics, we focus on progenitors
with zero-age main-sequence masses in the range between 5 and 39 solar masses. The pre-collapse
stars are one dimensional models employing prescriptions for the effects of rotation and magnetic
fields. Eight of the ten stars we consider being the results of chemically homogeneous evolution
due to enhanced rotational mixing (Aguilera-Dena et al. 2018). All but one of them produce explosions
driven by neutrino heating (more likely for low mass progenitors up to 8 solar masses) and non-spherical
flows or by magnetorotational stresses (more frequent above 26 solar masses). In most of them and
for the one non-exploding model, ongoing accretion leads to black-hole formation. Rapid rotation
makes a subsequent collapsar activity plausible. Models not forming black holes show proto-magnetar
driven jets. Conditions for the formation of nickel are more favourable in magneto-rotationally
driven models, though our rough estimates fall short of the requirements for extremely bright events
if these are powered by radioactive decay. However, approximate light curves of our models suggest
that a proto-magnetar or black hole spin-down may fuel luminous transients (with peak luminosities
~ 10^{43...44} erg).

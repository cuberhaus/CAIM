Systematic uncertainties in the mass measurement of galaxy clusters limit the cosmological constraining
power of future surveys that will detect more than $10^5$ clusters. Previously, we argued that aperture
masses can be inferred more accurately and precisely than 3D masses without loss of cosmological
constraining power. Here, we use the Baryons and Haloes of Massive Systems (BAHAMAS) cosmological,
hydrodynamical simulations to show that aperture masses are also less sensitive to changes in mass
caused by galaxy formation processes. For haloes with $m_\mathrm{200m,dmo} > 10^{14} \, h^{-1}
\, \mathrm{M}_\odot$, binned by their 3D halo mass, baryonic physics affects aperture masses and
3D halo masses similarly when measured within apertures similar to the halo virial radius, reaching
a maximum reduction of $\approx 3 \, \%$. For lower-mass haloes, $10^{13.5} < m_\mathrm{200m,dmo}
/ (h^{-1} \, \mathrm{M}_\odot) < 10^{14}$, and aperture sizes $\sim 1 \, h^{-1} \, \mathrm{cMpc}$,
representative of weak lensing observations, the aperture mass is consistently reduced less ($\lesssim
5 \, \%$) than the 3D halo mass ($\lesssim 10 \, \%$ for $m_\mathrm{200m}$). The halo mass reduction
evolves only slightly, by up to $2$ percentage points, between redshift 0.25 and 1 for both the aperture
mass and $m_\mathrm{200m}$. Varying the strength of the simulated feedback so the mean simulated
hot gas fraction covers the observed scatter inferred from X-ray observations, we find that the
aperture mass is consistently less biased than the 3D halo mass, by up to $2 \, $ percentage points
at $m_\mathrm{200m,dmo} = 10^{14} \, h^{-1} \, \mathrm{M}_\odot$. Therefore, cluster aperture
mass calibrations provide a fruitful path forward for future cluster surveys to reduce their sensitivity
to systematic uncertainties.

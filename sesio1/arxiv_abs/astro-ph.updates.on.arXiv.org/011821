Contact binary star systems represent the long-lived penultimate phase of binary evolution. Population
statistics of their physical parameters inform understanding of binary evolutionary pathways
and end products. We use light curves and new optical spectroscopy to conduct a pilot study of ten
(near-)contact systems in the long-period (P>0.5 d) tail of close binaries in the Kepler field.
We couple PHOEBE light curve models with Markov-Chain Monte Carlo analyses to compute Bayesian
probabilities on inclinations, fillout factors, mass ratios, third-light fractions, and component
temperature ratios. Mass ratios and third-light contributions measured from spectra agree well
with those inferred from the light curves. Most binaries in the pilot study have extreme mass ratios
q<0.32. At least eight are probable triples. A Bayesian analysis of all 783 Kepler 0.15 d<P<2 d (near-)contact
binaries forming an unbiased sample of unprecedented size and photometric precision results in
178 probable contact systems, 114 probable detached systems, and 491 ambiguous systems. We report
best-fitting and 16th/50th/84th percentile parameters of modeled systems. Contact systems are
rare at periods P>0.5 d, as are systems with mass ratios near unity (q>0.8). There exists an empirical
mass ratio lower limit $q_{min}$(P)~0.05-0.15 below which contact systems are absent, in agreement
with a new set of theoretical predictions we obtain by modeling the evolution of contact systems
under the constraints of mass and angular momentum conservation. Pre-merger systems should be
found at at long periods and near this mass ratio lower limit, which rises from q=0.044 for P=0.74
d to q=0.15 at P=2.0 d. These findings support a scenario whereby mass transfer drives systems toward
extreme $q$ and larger $P$ until the onset of the Darwin instability at $q_{min}$ precipitates a
merger.

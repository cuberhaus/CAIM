Globular clusters contain a unique pulsar population, with many exotic systems that can form only
in their dense stellar environments. The leap in sensitivity of the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio
Telescope (uGMRT) in India, especially at low radio frequencies ($<$ 1 GHz) has motivated a new search
for radio pulsars in a group of eight Southern globular clusters. We discovered PSR J1835$-$3259B,
a 1.83-ms pulsar in NGC 6652; this is in a near-circular wide orbit of 28.7 hr with a low-mass ($ \sim
0.2 \, M_{\rm \odot}$) companion, likely a Helium white dwarf. We derived a 10-year timing solution
for this system. We also present measurements of scattering, flux densities and spectral indices
for some of the previously known pulsars in these GCs. A significant fraction of the pulsars in these
clusters have steep spectral indices. Additionally, we detected eight radio point sources not
associated with any known pulsar positions in the radio images. There are four newly identified
sources, three in NGC 6652 and one in NGC 6539, and one previously identified source each in NGC 1851,
NGC 6440, NGC 6544, and Terzan 5. Surprisingly, our images show that our newly discovered pulsar,
PSR J1835$-$3259B, is the brightest pulsar in all GCs we have imaged; like other pulsars with broad
profiles (Terzan 5 C and O), its flux density in the radio images is much larger than in its pulsations.
This indicates that their pulsed emission is only a fraction of their total emission. The detection
of radio sources outside the core radii but well within the tidal radii of these clusters show that
future GC surveys should complement the search analysis by using the imaging capability of interferometers,
and preferentially synthesize large number of search beams in order to obtain a larger field of view.

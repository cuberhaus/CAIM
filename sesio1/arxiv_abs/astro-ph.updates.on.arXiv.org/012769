Context. As part of the third Gaia data release, we present the contributions of the non-stellar
and classification modules from the eighth coordination unit (CU8) of the Data Processing and Analysis
Consortium, which is responsible for the determination of source astrophysical parameters using
Gaia data. This is the third in a series of three papers describing the work done within CU8 for this
release. Aims. For each of the five relevant modules from CU8, we summarise their objectives, the
methods they employ, their performance, and the results they produce for Gaia DR3. We further advise
how to use these data products and highlight some limitations. Methods. The Discrete Source Classifier
(DSC) module provides classification probabilities associated with five types of sources: quasars,
galaxies, stars, white dwarfs, and physical binary stars. A subset of these sources are processed
by the Outlier Analysis (OA) module, which performs an unsupervised clustering analysis, and then
associates labels with the clusters to complement the DSC classification. The Quasi Stellar Object
Classifier (QSOC) and the Unresolved Galaxy Classifier (UGC) determine the redshifts of the sources
classified as quasar and galaxy by the DSC module. Finally, the Total Galactic Extinction (TGE)
module uses the extinctions of individual stars determined by another CU8 module to determine the
asymptotic extinction along all lines of sight for Galactic latitudes |b| > 5 deg. Results. Gaia
DR3 includes 1591 million sources with DSC classifications; 56 million sources to which the OA clustering
is applied; 1.4 million sources with redshift estimates from UGC; 6.4 million sources with QSOC
redshift; and 3.1 million level 9 HEALPixes of size 0.013 squared degree, where the extinction is
evaluated by TGE.

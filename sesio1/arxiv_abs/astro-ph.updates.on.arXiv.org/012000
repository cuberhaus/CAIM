There is now ample evidence that dust is already present in abundance at high z. However, given the
faintness of distant galaxies in the optical and the NIR, datasets are still limited and how the dust
affects the emerging radiation of galaxies at very high redshift is not yet fully understood. Using
the ALPINE survey, our objective is to quantify the dust attenuation properties in galaxies at z=4.4-5.5,
and in particular the shape of their attenuation curve. Using the CIGALE code, we model the stellar
populations and their interaction with the dust in order to measure some of the physical properties
of a subsample of 23 main-sequence ALPINE galaxies. We find that the attenuation curves span a broad
range of properties, from curves that are much steeper than the SMC extinction curve, to shallower
than the starburst attenuation curve. The shape of the attenuation curves strongly depends on the
V-band attenuation. Galaxies with the lowest attenuation also present the steepest curves. The
steepness of such curves is probably the consequence of the combination of the intrinsic physical
properties of the dust, the relative distribution of stars and dust in the interstellar medium,
and the differential reddening. The broad range of attenuation curves found at z~5 shows that no
single attenuation curve is appropriate for main sequence galaxies and that assuming a fixed curve
can lead to large errors, for instance in the interpretation and use of the IRX-beta diagram, if SED
modeling is not feasible. Great caution should be exercised when correcting high redshift galaxies
for the presence of dust using the UV slope beta as it can affect the estimation of both SFR and stellar
mass even at low V-band attenuation due to the steepness of the attenuation curve. However, when
SED modeling can be used, the impact of the choice of the attenuation curve on the SFR and the stellar
mass is limited.

Context. Many questions on the nature of astrophysical counterparts of high-energy neutrinos
remain unanswered. There is increasing evidence of a connection between blazar jets and neutrino
events, with the flare of the gamma-ray blazar TXS0506+056 in spatial and temporal proximity of
IC170922A representing one of the most outstanding associations of high-energy neutrinos with
astrophysical sources reported so far. Aims. With the purpose of characterising potential blazar
counterparts to high-energy neutrinos, we analysed the parsec-scale regions of gamma-ray blazars
in spatial coincidence with neutrinos detected by IceCube. Specifically, we intended to investigate
peculiar radio properties of the candidate counterparts related to neutrino production, as radio
flares coincident to the neutrino detection or features in jets morphology (limb brightening,
transverse structures). Methods. We collected multi-frequency VLBI follow-up observations
of candidate counterparts of four high-energy neutrino events detected by IceCube between January
2019 and November 2020. We analysed their radio characteristics soon after the neutrino arrival
in comparison with archival VLBI observations and low-frequency radio observations. We discussed
our results with respect to previous statistical works and studies on the case of TXS 0506+056. Results.
We identified and analysed in detail five potential neutrino emitting blazars. Our results suggest
an enhanced state of radio activity for one source, PKS1725+123. However, the lack of adequate monitoring
prior to the neutrino events was a limitation in tracing radio activity and morphological changes
in all the sources. Conclusions. We suggest that PKS1725+123 is a promising neutrino source candidate.
For the other four sources, our results alone do not allow us to reveal a strong connection between
the radio activity state at neutrino arrival.

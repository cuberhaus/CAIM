Orbital characteristics based on Gaia Early Data Release 3 astrometric parameters are analyzed
for ${\sim} 4000$ metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] $\leq -0.8$) compiled from the Best $\&$ Brightest survey.
Selected as metal-poor candidates based on broadband near- and far-IR photometry, $43\%$ of these
stars had medium-resolution ($1200 \lesssim R \lesssim 2000$) validation spectra obtained over
a seven-year campaign from $2014$ to $2020$ with a variety of telescopes. The remaining stars were
chosen based on photometric metallicity determinations from the Huang et al. recalibration of
the Sky Mapper Southern Survey. Dynamical clusters of these stars are obtained from the orbital
energy and cylindrical actions using the \HDBSCAN ~unsupervised learning algorithm. We identify
$52$ Dynamically Tagged Groups (DTGs) with between $5$ and $21$ members; $18$ DTGs have at least
$10$ member stars. Milky Way (MW) substructures such as Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus, the Metal-Weak
Thick-Disk, Thamnos, the Splashed Disk, and the Helmi Stream are identified. Associations with
MW globular clusters are determined for $8$ DTGs; no recognized MW dwarf galaxies were associated
with any of our DTGs. Previously identified dynamical groups are also associated with our DTGs,
with emphasis placed on their structural determination and possible new identifications. Chemically
peculiar stars are identified as members of several DTGs, with $6$ DTGs that are associated with
\textit{r}-process-enhanced stars. We demonstrate that the mean carbon and $\alpha$-element
abundances of our DTGs are correlated with their mean metallicity in an understandable manner.
Similarly, we find that the mean metallicity, carbon, and $\alpha$-element abundances are separable
into different regions of the mean rotational-velocity space.

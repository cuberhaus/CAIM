Context. Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3), published in December 2020, features improved photometry
and astrometry over that published in the previous DR2 file, and includes a substantially larger
number of sources, of the order of 2,000 million, making it a paradigm of Big data Astronomy. Aims.
We demonstrate how Gaia data mining can effectively help to solve the issue of central star misidentification,
a problem that has plagued the field since its origin. As we did for DR2, our objective is to present
a catalogue of CSPNe with astrometric and photometric information in EDR3. Methods. Gaia G(BP)-G(RP)
colours allow us to select the sources with sufficient temperatures to ionize the nebula. In order
to estimate the real colour of a source, it is important to take into account interstellar extinction
and, in the case of compact nebulae, nebular extinction when available. In addition, distances
derived from EDR3 parallaxes (combined with consistent literature values) can be used to obtain
nebular intrinsic properties from those observed. With this information, CSPNe can be plotted
in an HR diagram. Results. We present a catalogue of 2035 PNe with their corresponding CS identification
from among Gaia EDR3 sources. We obtain the distances for those with known parallaxes in EDR3 (1725
PNe). In addition, for a subsample (405 PNe) with the most accurate distances, we obtain different
nebular properties such as their Galactic distribution, radius, kinematic age and morphology.
Furthermore, for a set of 74 CSPNe, we present the evolutionary state (mass and age) derived from
their luminosities and effective temperatures from evolutionary models. Finally, we highlight
the detection of several wide binary CSPNe through an analysis of the EDR3 astrometric parameters,
and we contribute to shedding some light on the relevance of close binarity in CSPNe.

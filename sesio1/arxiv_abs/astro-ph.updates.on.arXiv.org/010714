We study individual pulses of Vela (PSR\ B0833-45\,/\,J0835-4510) from daily observations of
over three hours (around 120,000 pulses per observation), performed simultaneously with the two
radio telescopes at the Argentine Institute of Radioastronomy. We select 4 days of observations
in January-March 2021 and study their statistical properties with machine learning techniques.
We first use density based DBSCAN clustering techniques, associating pulses mainly by amplitudes,
and find a correlation between higher amplitudes and earlier arrival times. We also find a weaker
(polarization dependent) correlation with the mean width of the pulses. We identify clusters of
the so-called mini-giant pulses, with $\sim10\times$ the average pulse amplitude. We then perform
an independent study, with Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) clustering techniques. We use Variational
AutoEncoder (VAE) reconstruction of the pulses to separate them clearly from the noise and select
one of the days of observation to train VAE and apply it to thre rest of the observations. We use SOM
to determine 4 clusters of pulses per day per radio telescope and conclude that our main results are
robust and self-consistent. These results support models for emitting regions at different heights
(separated each by roughly a hundred km) in the pulsar magnetosphere. We also model the pulses amplitude
distribution with interstellar scintillation patterns at the inter-pulses time-scale finding
a characterizing exponent $n_{\mathrm{ISS}}\sim7-10$. In the appendices we discuss independent
checks of hardware systematics with the simultaneous use of the two radio telescopes in different
one-polarization / two-polarizations configurations. We also provide a detailed analysis of
the processes of radio-interferences cleaning and individual pulse folding.

We study the influence of relativity on the chaotic properties and dynamical outcomes of an unstable
triple system; the Pythagorean three-body problem. To this end, we extend the Brutus N-body code
to include Post-Newtonian pairwise terms up to 2.5 order, and the first order Taylor expansion to
the Einstein-Infeld-Hoffmann equations of motion. The degree to which our system is relativistic
depends on the scaling of the total mass (the unit size was 1 parsec). Using the Brutus method of convergence,
we test for time-reversibility in the conservative regime, and demonstrate that we are able to obtain
definitive solutions to the relativistic three-body problem. It is also confirmed that the minimal
required numerical accuracy for a successful time-reversibility test correlates with the amplification
factor of an initial perturbation. When we take into account dissipative effects through gravitational
wave emission, we find that the duration of the resonance, and the amount of exponential growth of
small perturbations depend on the mass scaling. For a unit mass <= 10 MSun, the system behavior is
indistinguishable from the Newtonian case, and the resonance always ends in a binary and one escaping
body. For a mass scaling up to 1e7 MSun, relativity gradually becomes more prominent, but the majority
of the systems still dissolve. The first mergers start to appear for a mass of ~1e5 MSun, and between
1e7 MSun and 1e9 MSun all systems end prematurely in a merger. These mergers are preceded by a gravitational
wave driven in-spiral. For a mass scaling >= 1e9 MSun, all systems result in a gravitational wave
merger upon the first close encounter. Relativistic three-body encounters thus provide an efficient
pathway for resolving the final parsec problem. The onset of mergers at the characteristic mass
scale of 1e7 MSun potentially leaves an imprint in the mass function of supermassive black holes.

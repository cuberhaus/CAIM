The structure of the Kreutz system of sungrazing comets is shown to be much more complex than formerly
believed. Marsden's (1989) division into three subgroups (I, II, IIa) is now greatly expanded,
as new evidence is being offered on nine populations of fragments -- I, Ia, II, IIa, III, Pre-I, Pe
(side branch of I), IIIa, and IV, incorporating carefully screened data sets from a collection of
gravitational orbits for 1500 SOHO/STEREO dwarf Kreutz comets. Tight correlations between the
nominal perihelion latitude and nominal longitude of the ascending node are the result of ignored
effects of an outgassing-driven acceleration on the orbital motion. The average width of a gap between
adjacent populations in the corrected nodal longitude is near 9 deg; the overall range equals 66
deg. A self-consistent model postulates (i) an initial breakup, in general proximity of aphelion,
of a contact-binary parent (progenitor) into its two lobes and the neck (originally linking the
lobes), giving birth to, respectively, Population I (Lobe I; the main residual mass C/1843 D1),
Population II (Lobe II; C/1882 R1), and Population Ia (the neck); followed by (ii) progressive fragmentation
of the lobes (primarily Lobe II), mostly (but not exclusively) far from perihelion, giving successively
rise to the other populations and clusters of naked-eye Kreutz sungrazers and their debris. The
separation velocities were a few meters per second. Massive fragments of Populations Pre-I, IIIa,
and IV are yet to be discovered. Relations among the products of cascading fragmentation are depicted
in a pedigree chart. The age of the Kreutz system is estimated at two millennia and a mean orbital period
of Lobe I and its main residual mass at ~740 yr. The status is reviewed of the possible historical Kreutz
comets seen in AD 1106, AD 363, and 372 BC.

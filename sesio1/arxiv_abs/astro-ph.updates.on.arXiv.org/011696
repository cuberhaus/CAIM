Galactic dynamical structures are fossil records of the assembly histories of galaxies. By analyzing
the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation TNG50, we find that a dynamical structure that we call
the "hot inner stellar halo," defined by stars on dynamically hot orbits with circularity $\lambda_z
< 0.5$ at $3.5\,{\rm kpc}<r \lesssim 2\,R_e$, is a strong indicator of the mass of accreted satellite
galaxies. We find a strong correlation between the mass of this hot inner stellar halo and the total
ex situ stellar mass. There is a similarly strong correlation with the stellar mass of the most massive
secondary galaxy ever merged. These TNG50 correlations are compatible with those predicted by
other simulations, for example by TNG100 across the whole mass range under study (galaxy stellar
masses, $M_*$, in the $10^{10.3-11.6}$\,\Msun\, range) and by EAGLE for $M_* \gtrsim 10^{10.6}
$\,\Msun\, galaxies.\ This shows that our predictions are robust across different galaxy formation
and feedback models and hold across a wide range of numerical resolution. The hot inner stellar halo
is a product of massive and typically ancient mergers, with inner-halo stars exhibiting three main
physical origins: accreted and stripped from massive satellites, dynamically heated by mergers
from the bulge and/or disk in the main progenitor, and formed from star formation triggered during
mergers. The mass of the hot inner stellar halo defined in this paper is a quantity that can be robustly
obtained for real galaxies by applying a population-orbit superposition method to integral-field-unit
spectroscopy data, out to a distance of $\sim2\,R_e$, which is possible with current observations.
Hence, this paper shows that integral-field-unit observations and dynamical models of the inner
regions of galaxies provide a way to quantitatively determine the mass of ancient accreted satellites.

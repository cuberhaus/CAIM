We present a project to implement a national common strategy for the mitigation of the steadily deteriorating
Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) situation at the Italian radio telescopes. The project involves
the Medicina, Noto, and Sardinia dish antennas and comprised the definition of a coordinated plan
for site monitoring as well as the implementation of state-of-the-art hardware and software tools
for RFI mitigation. Coordinated monitoring of frequency bands up to 40 GHz has been performed by
means of continuous observations and dedicated measurement campaigns with fixed stations and
mobile laboratories. Measurements were executed on the frequency bands allocated to the radio
astronomy and space research service for shared or exclusive use and on the wider ones employed by
the current and under-development receivers at the telescopes. Results of the monitoring campaigns
provide a reference scenario useful to evaluate the evolution of the interference situation at
the telescopes sites and a case series to test and improve the hardware and software tools we conceived
to counteract radio frequency interference. We developed a multi-purpose digital backend for
high spectral and time resolution observations over large bandwidths. Observational results
demonstrate that the spectrometer robustness and sensitivity enable the efficient detection
and analysis of interfering signals in radio astronomical data. A prototype off-line software
tool for interference detection and flagging has been also implemented. This package is capable
to handle the huge amount of data delivered by the most modern instrumentation on board of the Italian
radio telecsopes, like dense focal plane arrays, and its modularity easen the integration of new
algorithms and the re-usability in different contexts or telescopes.

Recent work has demonstrated that exoplanetary system properties correlate strongly with ambient
stellar clustering in six-dimensional stellar position-velocity phase space, quantified by
dividing planetary systems into sub-samples with high or low phase space densities (`overdensity'
and `field' systems, respectively). We investigate the physical origins of the phase space overdensities
and, thereby, which environmental mechanisms may have impacted the planetary systems. We consider
the galactic-scale kinematic structure of the Milky Way observed with Gaia and show that the overdensities
correspond to the well-known, kpc-scale kinematic ripples and streams in the Galactic disk, which
are thought to be generated by bar and spiral arm-driven resonances and satellite galaxy passages.
We also find indications that the planet demographics may vary between individual phase space overdensities,
which potentially have differing physical origins and histories. Planetary systems associated
with the `phase space spiral' (a recent perturbation of the Galactic disk) have a hot Jupiter-to-cold
Jupiter ratio that is 10 times higher than in field systems. Finally, the hot Jupiter-to-cold Jupiter
ratio within overdensities may increase with host stellar age over Gyr timescales. Because the
overdensities persist for several Gyr, we argue that late-time perturbations of planetary systems
most likely explain these trends, although additional perturbations at birth may contribute too.
This suggests that planetary system properties are not just affected by stellar clustering in their
immediate surroundings, but by galaxy-scale processes throughout their evolution. We conclude
by discussing the main open questions towards understanding the diversity of physical processes
that together set planetary system architectures.

Early-type galaxies (ETGs) possess total density profiles close to isothermal, which can lead
to non-Gaussian line-of-sight velocity dispersion (LOSVD) under anisotropic stellar orbits.
However, recent observations of local ETGs in the MASSIVE Survey reveal outer kinematic structures
at $1.5 R_{\mathrm{eff}}$ (effective radius) that are inconsistent with fixed isothermal density
profiles; the authors proposed varying density profiles as an explanation. We aim to verify this
conjecture and understand the influence of stellar assembly on these kinematic features through
mock ETGs in IllustrisTNG. We create mock Integral-Field-Unit observations to extract projected
stellar kinematic features for 207 ETGs with stellar mass $M_{\ast}\geqslant 10^{11} \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$
in TNG100-1. The mock observations reproduce the key outer ($1.5R_{\mathrm{eff}}$) kinematic
structures in the MASSIVE ETGs, including the puzzling positive correlation between velocity
dispersion profile outer slope $\gamma_{\mathrm{outer}}$ and the kurtosis $h_{4}$'s gradient.
We find that $h_{4}$ is uncorrelated with stellar orbital anisotropy beyond $R_{\mathrm{eff}}$;
instead we find that the variations in $\gamma_{\mathrm{outer}}$ and outer $h_{4}$ (a good proxy
for $h_{4}$ gradient) are both driven by variations of the density profile at the outskirts across
different ETGs. These findings corroborate the proposed conjecture and rule out velocity anisotropy
as the origin of non-Gaussian outer kinematic structure in ETGs. We also find that the outer kurtosis
and anisotropy correlate with different stellar assembly components, with the former related
to minor mergers or flyby interactions while the latter is mainly driven by major mergers, suggesting
distinct stellar assembly origins that decorrelates the two quantities.

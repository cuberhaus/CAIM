The AMS-02 experiment has provided high-precision measurements of several cosmic-ray (CR) species.
The achieved percent-level accuracy gives access to small spectral differences among the different
species and, in turn, this allows scrutinizing the universality of CR acceleration, which is expected
in the standard scenario of CR shock acceleration. While pre-AMS-02 data already indicated a violation
of the universality between protons and helium, it is still an open question if at least helium and
heavier nuclei can be reconciled. To address this issue, we performed a joint analysis using the
AMS-02 CR measurements of antiprotons, protons, helium, helium 3, boron, carbon, nitrogen, and
oxygen. We explore two competing propagation scenarios, one with a break in the diffusion coefficient
at a few GVs and no reacceleration, and another one with reacceleration and with a break in the injection
spectra of primaries. Furthermore, we explicitly consider the impact of the uncertainties in the
nuclear production cross-sections of secondaries by including nuisance parameters in the fit.
The resulting parameter space is explored with the help of Monte Carlo methods. We find that, contrary
to the naive expectation, in the standard propagation scenarios CR universality is violated also
for He, on the one hand, and C, N, and O, on the other hand, i.e., different injection slopes (at the
level of $ \Delta \sim 0.05$) are required to explain the observed spectra. As an alternative, we
explore further propagation scenarios, inspired by non-homogeneous diffusion, which might save
universality. Finally, we also investigate the universality of CR propagation, i.e., we compare
the propagation properties inferred using only light nuclei ($\bar{p}$, p, He, $^3$He) with the
ones inferred using only heavier nuclei (B, C, N, O).

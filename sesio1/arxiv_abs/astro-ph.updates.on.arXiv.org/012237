High resolution (sub-)millimeter polarization observations have opened a new era in the understanding
of how B-fields are organized in star forming regions, unveiling an intricate interplay between
the B-fields and the gas in protostellar cores. However, to assess the role of the B-field in the process
of solar-type star formation, it is key to be able to understand to what extent these polarized dust
emission are good tracers of the B-field in the youngest protostellar objects. We present a thorough
investigation of the fidelity and limitations of using dust polarized emission to map the B-field
topologies in low-mass protostars. To assess the importance of these effects, we performed the
analysis of B-field properties in 27 realizations of MHD models of star-forming cores. Assuming
a uniform population of dust grains which sizes follow the standard MRN, we analyze the synthetic
polarized dust emission maps produced if these grains align with the local B-field thanks to B-RATs.
We find that (sub-)millimeter polarized dust emission is a robust tracer of the B-field topologies
in inner protostellar envelopes and is successful at capturing the details of the B-field spatial
distribution down to radii ~100 au. Measurements of the los averaged B-field orientation using
the polarized dust emission are precise to < 15{\deg} in about 75 - 95% of the independent lines of
sight peering through protostellar envelopes. Large discrepancies between the integrated B-field
mean orientation and the orientation reconstructed from the polarized dust emission are mostly
observed in (i) lines of sight where the B-field is highly disorganized and (ii) lines of sight probing
large column densities. Our analysis shows that high opacity of the thermal dust emission and low
polarization fractions could be used to avoid utilizing the small fraction of measurements affected
by large errors.

Palomar 6 (Pal~6) is a moderately metal-poor globular cluster projected towards the Galactic bulge.
A full analysis of the cluster can give hints on the early chemical enrichment of the Galaxy and a plausible
origin of the cluster. The aim of this study is threefold: a detailed analysis of high-resolution
spectroscopic data obtained with the UVES spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) at ESO,
the derivation of the age and distance of Pal~6 from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometric data,
and an orbital analysis to determine the probable origin of the cluster. High-resolution spectra
of six red giant stars in the direction of Palomar 6 were obtained at the $8$m VLT UT2-Kueyen telescope
equipped with the UVES spectrograph in FLAMES$+$UVES configuration. Spectroscopic parameters
were derived through excitation and ionisation equilibrium of \ion{Fe}{I} and \ion{Fe}{II} lines,
and the abundances were obtained from spectrum synthesis. From HST photometric data, the age and
distance were derived through a statistical isochrone fitting. Finally, a dynamical analysis
was carried out for the cluster assuming two different Galactic potentials. Four stars that are
members of Pal~6 were identified in the sample, which gives a mean radial velocity of $174.3\pm1.6$
km\,s$^{-1}$ and a mean metallicity of [Fe/H]$\,=-1.10\pm0.09$ for the cluster. We found an enhancement
of $\alpha$-elements (O, Mg, Si, and Ca) $0.29<\,$[X/Fe]$\,<0.38$ and the iron-peak element Ti
of [Ti/Fe]$\,\sim+0.3$. The odd-Z elements (Na and Al) show a mild enhancement of [X/Fe]$\,\sim
+0.25$. The abundances of both first- (Y and Zr) and second-peak (Ba and La) heavy elements are relatively
high, with $+0.4<\,$[X/Fe]$\,<+0.60$ and $+0.4<\,$[X/Fe]$\,<+0.5$, respectively. The r-element
Eu is also relatively high with [Eu/Fe]$\,\sim +0.6$. $\mathbf{\left[Truncated\right]}$

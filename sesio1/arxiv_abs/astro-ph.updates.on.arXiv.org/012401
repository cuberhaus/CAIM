The 6.4 keV Fe Ka emission line is a ubiquitous feature in X-ray spectra of AGN, and its properties
track the interaction between the variable primary X-ray continuum and the surrounding structure
from which it arises. We clarify the nature and origin of the narrow Fe Ka emission using X-ray spectral,
timing, and imaging constraints, plus possible correlations to AGN and host galaxy properties,
for 38 bright nearby AGN ($z<0.5$) from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey. Modeling Chandra and XMM-Newton
spectra, we computed line full-width half-maxima (FWHMs) and constructed Fe Ka line and 2-10 keV
continuum light curves. The FWHM provides one estimate of the Fe Ka emitting region size, RFeKa,
assuming virial motion. A second estimate comes from comparing the degree of correlation between
the variability of the continuum and line-only light curves, compared to simulated light curves.
Finally, we extracted Chandra radial profiles to place upper limits on RFeKa. We found that for 90%
(21/24) of AGN with FWHM measurements, RFeKa is smaller than the fiducial dust sublimation radius,
Rsub. Despite a wide range of variability properties, the constraints on the Fe Ka photon reprocessor
size independently confirm that RFeKa is smaller than Rsub in 83% of AGN. Finally, the imaging analysis
yields loose upper limits for all but two sources; notably, the Circinus Galaxy and NGC 1068 show
significant but subdominant extended Fe Ka emission out to $\sim$100 and $\sim$800 pc, respectively.
Based on independent constraints, we conclude that the majority of the narrow Fe Ka emission in typical
AGN predominantly arises from regions smaller than and presumably inside Rsub, and thus it is associated
either with the outer broad line region or outer accretion disk. However, the large diversity of
continuum and narrow Fe Ka variability properties are not easily accommodated by a universal scenario.

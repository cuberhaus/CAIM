We investigate the formation and morphological evolution of the first galaxies in the cosmic morning
($10>z>4$) using the Horizon Run 5 (HR5) cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. For galaxies
above the stellar mass $M_{\star} = 2\times10^9\,M_{\odot}$, we classify them into disk, spheroid,
and irregular types according to their asymmetry and stellar mass morphology. We find that 2/3 of
galaxies have a S\'{e}rsic index less than 1.5, reflecting the dominance of disk-type morphology
in the cosmic morning. The rest are evenly distributed as irregulars or spheroids. We also find that
these fractions are roughly independent of redshift and stellar mass up to $\sim10^{10}\,M_{\odot}$,
while irregular or spheroidal morphology appears incidental and transient. Almost all the first
galaxies with $M_{\star}>2\times10^9\,M_{\odot}$ at redshift 6 form at initial peaks of the matter
density field. Large-scale structures in the universe emerge and grow like cosmic rhizomes as the
underlying matter density fluctuations grow and form associations of galaxies in rare overdense
regions. The growth of the density field further stretches the realm of the galactic world into relatively
lower-density regions along evolving filaments. The cosmic web of galaxies forms at lower redshifts
when most rhizomes globally percolate. The primordial angular momentum produced by the induced
tidal torques on protogalactic regions is correlated with the internal kinematics of galaxies
and tightly aligned with the angular momentum of the total galaxy mass. However, the primordial
angular momentum only very weakly correlates with the instantaneous morphology and orientation
of the stellar component below $z=6$. The large-scale tidal field imprinted in the initial conditions
seems responsible for the dominance of disk morphology, and for the tendency of galaxies to re-acquire
a disk post-distortion.

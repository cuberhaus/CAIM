We test the hypothesis that the observed first-peak (Sr, Y, Zr) and second-peak (Ba) s-process elemental
abundances in low-metallicity Milky Way stars, and the abundances of the elements Mo and Ru, can
be explained by a pervasive r-process contribution originating in neutrino-driven winds from
highly-magnetic and rapidly rotating proto-neutron stars (proto-NSs). We construct chemical
evolution models that incorporate recent calculations of proto-NS yields in addition to contributions
from AGB stars, Type Ia supernovae, and two alternative sets of yields for massive star winds and
core-collapse supernovae. For non-rotating massive star yields from either set, models without
proto-NS winds underpredict the observed s-process peak abundances by $0.3$-$1\,\text{dex}$
at low metallicity, and they severely underpredict Mo and Ru at all metallicities. Models incorporating
wind yields from proto-NSs with spin periods $P \sim 2$-$5\,\text{ms}$ fit the observed trends
for all these elements well. Alternatively, models omitting proto-NS winds but adopting yields
of rapidly rotating massive stars, with $v_{\rm rot}$ between $150$ and $300\,\text{km}\,\text{s}^{-1}$,
can explain the observed abundance levels reasonably well for $\text{[Fe/H]}<-2$. These models
overpredict [Sr/Fe] and [Mo/Fe] at higher metallicities, but with a tuned dependence of $v_{\rm
rot}$ on stellar metallicity they might achieve an acceptable fit at all [Fe/H]. If many proto-NSs
are born with strong magnetic fields and short spin periods, then their neutrino-driven winds provide
a natural source for Sr, Y, Zr, Mo, Ru, and Ba in low-metallicity stellar populations. Conversely,
spherical winds from unmagnetized proto-NSs overproduce the observed Sr, Y, and Zr abundances
by a large factor.

The strong intervening absorption system at redshift 1.15 towards the very bright quasar HE 0515$-$4414
is the most studied absorber for measuring possible cosmological variations in the fine-structure
constant, $\alpha$. We observed HE 0515$-$4414 for 16.1$\,$h with the Very Large Telescope and
present here the first constraint on relative variations in $\alpha$ with parts-per-million (ppm)
precision from the new ESPRESSO spectrograph: $\Delta\alpha/\alpha = 1.3 \pm 1.3_{\rm stat} \pm
0.4_{\rm sys}\,{\rm ppm}$. The statistical uncertainty (1$\sigma$) is similar to the ensemble
precision of previous large samples of absorbers, and derives from the high S/N achieved ($\approx$105
per 0.4$\,$km$\,$s$^{-1}$ pixel). ESPRESSO's design, and calibration of our observations with
its laser frequency comb, effectively removed wavelength calibration errors from our measurement.
The high resolving power of our ESPRESSO spectrum ($R=145000$) enabled the identification of very
narrow components within the absorption profile, allowing a more robust analysis of $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$.
The evidence for the narrow components is corroborated by their correspondence with previously
detected molecular hydrogen and neutral carbon. The main remaining systematic errors arise from
ambiguities in the absorption profile modelling, effects from redispersing the individual quasar
exposures, and convergence of the parameter estimation algorithm. All analyses of the spectrum,
including systematic error estimates, were initially blinded to avoid human biases. We make our
reduced ESPRESSO spectrum of HE 0515$-$4414 publicly available for further analysis. Combining
our ESPRESSO result with 28 measurements, from other spectrographs, in which wavelength calibration
errors have been mitigated, yields a weighted mean $\Delta\alpha/\alpha = -0.5 \pm 0.5_{\rm stat}
\pm 0.4_{\rm sys}\,$ppm at redshifts 0.6-2.4.

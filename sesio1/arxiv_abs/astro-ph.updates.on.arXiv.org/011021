The question of what determines the width of Kuiper belt analogues (exoKuiper belts) is an open one.
If solved, this understanding would provide valuable insights into the architecture, dynamics,
and formation of exoplanetary systems. Recent observations by ALMA have revealed an apparent paradox
in this field, the presence of radially narrow belts in protoplanetary discs that are likely the
birthplaces of planetesimals, and exoKuiper belts nearly four times as wide in mature systems.
If the parent planetesimals of this type of debris disc indeed form in these narrow protoplanetary
rings via streaming instability where dust is trapped, we propose that this width dichotomy could
naturally arise if these dust traps form planetesimals whilst migrating radially, e.g. as caused
by a migrating planet. Using the dust evolution software DustPy, we find that if the initial protoplanetary
disc and trap conditions favour planetesimal formation, dust can still effectively accumulate
and form planetesimals as the trap moves. This leads to a positive correlation between the inward
radial speed and final planetesimal belt width, forming belts up to $\sim$100 au over 10 Myr of evolution.
We show that although planetesimal formation is most efficient in low viscosity ($\alpha = 10^{-4}$)
discs with steep dust traps to trigger the streaming instability, the large widths of most observed
planetesimal belts constrain $\alpha$ to values $\geq4\times 10^{-4}$ at tens of au, otherwise
the traps cannot migrate far enough. Additionally, the large spread in the widths and radii of exoKuiper
belts could be due to different trap migration speeds (or protoplanetary disc lifetimes) and different
starting locations, respectively. Our work serves as a first step to link exoKuiper belts and rings
in protoplanetary discs.

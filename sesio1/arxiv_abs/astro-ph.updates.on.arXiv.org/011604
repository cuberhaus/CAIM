In June 2021 the discovery of an unusual comet C/2014 UN271 Bernardinelli-Bernstein has been announced.
Its cometary activity beyond Uranus orbit also has refreshed interest in similar objects, including
C/2017K2 PanSTARRS. Another peculiarity of these objects is the long interval of positional data,
taken at large heliocentric distances. These two comets are suitable candidates for a detailed
investigation of their long-term motion outside the planetary zone. Using the selected orbital
solutions, we aim at estimating the orbital parameters of their orbits at the previous perihelion
passage. This might allow us to discriminate between dynamically old and new comets. To follow the
dynamical evolution of long-period comets far outside the planetary zone, it is necessary to take
into account both the perturbation caused by the overall Galactic gravitational potential and
the actions of individual stars appearing in the solar neighborhood. To this aim, we applied the
recently published methods based on stellar perturbers ephemerides. For C/2014 UN271 we obtained
a precise orbital solution that can be propagated to the past and to the future. For C/2017 K2 we have
to limit ourselves to study only the past motion since some signs of nongravitational effects can
be found in recent positional observations. Therefore, we use a specially selected orbital solution
suitable for past motion studies. Using these starting orbits, we propagated both comets to their
previous perihelia. We also investigated the future motion of C/2014 UN271. Orbital evolution
of these two comets appears to be sensitive to perturbations from several stars that closely approach
the Sun. Unfortunately, some of these stars have 6D data with uncertainties too large to obtain definitive
results for the studied comets; however, it appears that both comets were probably outside the planetary
zone in the previous perihelion.

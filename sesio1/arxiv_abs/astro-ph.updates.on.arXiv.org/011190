In the search for moons around extrasolar planets, astronomers are confronted with a stunning observation.
Although 3400 of the 4500 exoplanets were discovered with the transit method and although there
are well over 25 times as many moons than planets known in the Solar System (two of which are larger
than Mercury), no exomoon has been discovered. In the search for exoplanet transits, stellar light
curves are usually phase-folded over a range of trial epochs and periods. This approach, however,
is not applicable in a straightforward manner to exomoons. Planet-moon transits either have to
be modeled in great detail (including their orbital dynamics, mutual eclipses etc.), which is computationally
expensive, or key simplifications have to be assumed. One such simplification is to search for moon
transits outside of the planetary transits. The question we address in this report is how much in-transit
data of an exomoon remains uncontaminated by the near-simultaneous transits of its host planet.
We develop an analytical framework and test our results with a numerical planet-moon transit simulator.
For exomoons similar to the Galilean moons, only a small fraction of their in-transit data is uncontaminated
by planetary transits: 14% for Io, 20% for Europa, 42% for Ganymede, and 73% for Callisto. The S/N
of an out-of-planetary-transit folding technique is reduced compared to a full transit model to
about 38% (Io), 45% (Europa), 65% (Ganymede), and 85% (Callisto), respectively. For the Earth's
Moon, we find an uncontaminated data fraction of typically just 18% and a resulting S/N reduction
to 42%. These values are astonishingly small. The gain in speed for any exomoon transit search algorithm
that ignores the planetary in-transit data comes at the heavy price of losing a substantial fraction
of what is supposedly a tiny signal in the first place.

We present 3-D hydrodynamical models of the evolution of superbubbles powered by stellar winds
and supernovae from young coeval massive star clusters within low metallicity ($Z = 0.02$Z$_{\odot}$),
clumpy molecular clouds. We explore the initial stages of the superbubble evolution, including
the occurrence of pair-instability and core-collapse supernovae. Our aim is to study the occurrence
of dust grain growth within orbiting dusty clumps, and in the superbubble's swept-up supershell.
We also aim to address the survival of dust grains produced by sequential supernovae. The model accounts
for the star cluster gravitational potential and self-gravity of the parent cloud. It also considers
radiative cooling (including that induced by dust) and a state-of-the-art population synthesis
model for the coeval cluster. As shown before, a superbubble embedded into a clumpy medium becomes
highly distorted, expanding mostly due to the hot gas streaming through low density channels. Our
results indicate that in the case of massive ($\sim10^7$M$_{\odot}$) molecular clouds, hosting
a super star cluster ($\sim5.6\times10^5$M$_{\odot}$), grain growth increments the dust mass
at a rate $\sim4.8\times10^{-5}$M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ during the first $2.5$Myr of the superbubble's
evolution, while the net contribution of pair-instability and core-collapse supernovae to the
superbubble's dust budget is $\sim1200$M$_{\odot} (M_{SC}/5.6\times10^{5}$M$_{\odot})$,
where $M_{SC}$ is the stellar mass of the starburst. Therefore, dust grain growth and dust injection
by supernovae lead to create, without invoking a top-heavy initial mass function, massive amounts
of dust within low-metallicity star-forming molecular clouds, in accordance with the large dust
mass present in galaxies soon after the onset of cosmic reionization.

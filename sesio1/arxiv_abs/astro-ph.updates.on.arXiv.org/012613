Studies of the most distant AGNs allow us to test our current understanding of the physics present
in radio-jetted AGNs across a range of environments. The decrease in apparent luminosity with distance
is the primary difficulty to overcome in the study of these distant AGNs, which requires highly sensitive
instruments. Our goal is to employ new long wavelength radio data to better parametrise the broad-band
SED of GB 1508+5714, a high-redshift (z=4.30) AGN. Its high redshift, high intrinsic luminosity,
and classification as a blazar allow us to test emission models that consider the efficient cooling
of jet electrons via inverse Compton losses in interactions with the dense CMB photon field at high
redshifts. A significant detection of this effect in GB 1508+5714 may partly explain the apparent
sparsity of high-redshift radio galaxies in wide-field surveys; detections of this kind are only
becoming possible with the current generation of SKA precursors. We used international LOFAR telescope
to image the long wavelength radio emission around the high-redshift blazar GB 1508+5714 on arcsecond
scales at frequencies between 128 MHz and 160 MHz. This allowed us to compare the spatially resolved
structure with higher frequency observations, and to construct spectral index maps. The LOFAR
image shows a compact unresolved core and two resolved emission regions around 2 arcsec to the east
and to the west of the radio core. We find structure consistent with previous VLA observations, as
well as a previously unreported emission region to the east. We interpret the arcsecond-scale radio
structure of GB 1508+5714 as a FR II-like radio galaxy at a small viewing angle. Our SED modelling
shows that a scenario featuring significant quenching effects caused by interaction with the CMB
provides a good description of the data, and notably explains the suppressed radio emission.

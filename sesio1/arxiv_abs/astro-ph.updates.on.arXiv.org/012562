The ISM is a turbulent, multi-phase, and multi-scale medium following scaling relations. Analytical
models of galactic gaseous disks need to take into account the multi-scale and multi-phase nature
of the interstellar medium. They can be described as clumpy star-forming accretion disks in vertical
hydrostatic equilibrium, with the mid-plane pressure balancing the gravity of the gaseous and
stellar disk. ISM turbulence is taken into account by applying Galactic scaling relations to the
cold atomic and molecular gas phases. Turbulence is maintained through energy injection by supernovae.
With the determination of the gas mass fraction at a given spatial scale, the equilibrium gas temperature
between turbulent heating and line cooling, the molecular abundances, and the molecular line emission
can be calculated. The resulting model radial profiles of IR, H{\sc i}, CO, HCN, and HCO$^+$ emission
are compared to THINGS, HERACLES, EMPIRE, SINGS, and GALEX observations of 17 local spiral galaxies.
The Toomre parameter, which measures the stability against star formation (cloud collapse), exceeds
unity in the inner disk of a significant number of galaxies. In two galaxies it also exceeds unity
in the outer disk. Therefore, in spiral galaxies $Q_{\rm tot}=1$ is not ubiquitous. The model gas
velocity dispersion is consistent with the observed H{\sc i} velocity dispersion where available.
Within our model HCN and HCO$^+$ is already detectable in relatively low-density gas ($\sim 1000$~cm$^{-3}$).
CO and HCN conversion factors and molecular gas depletion time were derived. Both conversion factors
are consistent with values found in the literature. Whereas in the massive galaxies the viscous
timescale greatly exceeds the star formation timescale, the viscous timescale is smaller than
the star formation timescale within $\rm{R}~\sim~2~\rm{R}_{\rm d}$, the disk scale length, in
the low-mass galaxies.

Ultra-light dark matter (ULDM) refers to a class of theories, including ultra-light axions, in
which particles with mass $m_{\psi} < 10^{-20}\, \rm{eV}$ comprise a significant fraction of the
dark matter. A galactic scale de Broglie wavelength distinguishes these theories from cold dark
matter (CDM), suppressing the overall abundance of structure on sub-galactic scales, and producing
wave-like interference phenomena in the density profiles of halos. With the aim of constraining
the particle mass, we analyze the flux ratios in a sample of eleven quadruple-image strong gravitational
lenses. We account for the suppression of the halo mass function and concentration-mass relation
predicted by ULDM theories, and the wave-like fluctuations in the host halo density profile, calibrating
the model for the wave interference against numerical simulations of galactic-scale halos. We
show that the granular structure of halo density profiles, in particular, the amplitude of the fluctuations,
significantly impacts image flux ratios, and therefore inferences on the particle mass derived
from these data. We infer relative likelihoods of CDM to ULDM of 8:1, 7:1, 6:1, and 4:1 for particle
masses $\log_{10}(m_\psi/\rm{eV})\in[-22.5,-22.25], [-22.25,-22.0],[-22.0,-21.75], [-21.75,-21.5]$,
respectively. Repeating the analysis and omitting fluctuations associated with the wave interference
effects, we obtain relative likelihoods of CDM to ULDM with a particle mass in the same ranges of 98:1,
48:1, 26:1 and 18:1, highlighting the significant perturbation to image flux ratios associated
with the fluctuations. Nevertheless, our results disfavor the lightest particle masses with $m_{\psi}
< 10^{-21.5}\,\rm{eV}$, adding to mounting pressure on ultra-light axions as a viable dark matter
candidate.

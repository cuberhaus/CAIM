The coeval stars of young open clusters provide insights into the formation of the rotation-activity
relationship that elude studies of multi-age field populations. We measure the chromospheric
activity of cool stars in the 300 Myr old open cluster NGC 3532 in concert with their rotation periods
to study the mass-dependent morphology of activity for this transitional coeval population. Using
multi-object spectra of the Ca ii infrared triplet region obtained with the AAOmega spectrograph
at the Anglo- Australian Telescope, we measure the chromospheric emission ratios for 454 FGKM cluster
members of NGC 3532. The morphology of activity against colour appears to be a near-mirror image
of the cluster's rotational behaviour. In particular, we identify a group of 'desaturated transitional
rotators' that branches off from the main group of unsaturated FGK slow rotators, and from which
it is separated by an 'activity gap'. The few desaturated gap stars are identical to the ones in the
rotational gap. Nevertheless, the rotation-activity diagram is completely normal. In fact, the
relationship is so tight that it allows us to predict rotation periods for many additional stars.
We then precisely determine these periods from our photometric light curves. Our activity measurements
show that all fast rotators of near-solar mass have evolved to become slow rotators, demonstrating
that the absence of fast rotators in a colour-period diagram is not a detection issue but an astrophysical
fact. We also identify a new population of low-activity stars among the early M dwarfs, enabling
us to populate the extended slow rotator sequence in the colour-period diagram. The joint analysis
of chromospheric activity and photometric time series data thus enables comprehensive insights
into the evolution of the rotation and activity of stars during the transitional phase between the
Pleiades and Hyades age. (Abridged)

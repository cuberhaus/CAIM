Asteroseismology has revealed small core-to-the-surface rotation contrasts in stars in the whole
HR diagram. This is the signature of strong transport of angular momentum (AM) in stellar interiors.
One of the plausible candidates to efficiently carry AM is magnetic fields with various topologies
that could be present in stellar radiative zones. Among them, strong axisymmetric azimuthal magnetic
fields have received a lot of interest. Indeed, if they are subject to the so-called Tayler instability,
the accompanying triggered Maxwell stresses can transport AM efficiently. In addition, the electromotive
force induced by the fluctuations of magnetic and velocity fields could potentially sustain a dynamo
action that leads to the regeneration of the initial strong axisymmetric azimuthal magnetic field.
The key question we aim to answer is: can we detect signatures of these deep strong azimuthal magnetic
fields? The only way to answer this question is asteroseismology and the best laboratories of study
are intermediate-mass and massive stars. Most of these are rapid rotators during their main-sequence.
Therefore, we have to study stellar pulsations propagating in stably stratified, rotating, and
potentially strongly magnetised radiative zones. We generalise the traditional approximation
of rotation by taking simultaneously general axisymmetric differential rotation and azimuthal
magnetic fields into account in a non-perturbative way. Using this new formalism, we derive the
asymptotic properties of magneto-gravito-inertial (MGI) waves and their period spacings. We
find that toroidal magnetic fields induce a shift in the period spacings of MGI modes. An equatorial
azimuthal magnetic field with an amplitude of the order of $10^5\,\rm G$ leads to signatures that
can be detectable thanks to modern space photometry. More complex hemispheric configurations
are more difficult to observe.

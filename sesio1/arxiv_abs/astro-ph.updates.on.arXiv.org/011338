We study bulge formation in MW/M31-like galaxies in a $\Lambda$-cold dark matter scenario, focusing
on the origin of high- and low-Sersic index bulges. For this purpose we use TNG50, a simulation of
the IllustrisTNG project that combines a resolution of $\sim 8 \times 10^4 M_{\odot}$ in stellar
particles with a cosmological volume 52 cMpc in extent. We parametrize bulge surface brightness
profiles by the S\'ersic index and the bulge-to-total (B/T) ratio obtained from two-component
photometric decompositions. In our sample of 287 MW/M31-like simulated galaxies, $17.1\%$ of
photometric bulges exhibit high-S\'ersic indices and $82.9\%$ show low-S\'ersic indices. We
study the impact that the environment, mergers and bars have in shaping the surface brightness profiles.
We explore two different definitions for local environment and find no correlation between bulge
properties and the environment where they reside. Simulated galaxies with higher S\'ersic indices
show, on average, a higher fraction of ex-situ stars in their kinematically selected bulges. For
this bulge population the last significant merger (total mass ratio $m_{\rm sat}/m_{\rm host}
> 0.1$) occurs, on average, at later times. However, a substantial fraction of low-S\'ersic index
bulges also experience a late significant merger. We find that bars play an important role in the
development of the different types of photometric bulges. We show that the fraction of simulated
galaxies with strong bars is smaller for the high- than for the low-S\'ersic index population, reaching
differences of $20\%$ at $z > 1$. Simulated galaxies with high fractions of ex-situ stars in the bulge
do not develop strong bars. Conversely, simulated galaxies with long-lived strong bars have bulges
with ex-situ fractions, $f_{\rm ex-situ} < 0.2$.

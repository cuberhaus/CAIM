We study the merger rate of primordial black holes (PBHs) in self-interacting dark matter (SIDM)
halo models. To explore a numerical description for the density profile of SIDM halo models, we use
the result of a previously performed simulation for SIDM halo models with $\sigma/m=10~{\rm cm^{2}g^{-1}}$.
We also propose a concentration-mass-time relation that can explain the evolution of the halo density
profile related to SIDM models. Furthermore, we investigate the encounter condition of PBHs that
may have been randomly distributed in the medium of dark matter halos. Under these assumptions,
we calculate the merger rate of PBHs within each halo considering SIDM halo models and compare the
results with that obtained for cold dark matter (CDM) halo models. To do this, we employ the definition
of the time after halo virialization as a function of halo mass. We indicate that SIDM halo models
for $f_{\rm PBH}>0.32$ can generate sufficient PBH mergers in such a way that those exceed the one
resulted from CDM halo models. By considering the spherical-collapse halo mass function, we obtain
similar results for the cumulative merger rate of PBHs. Moreover, we calculate the redshift evolution
of the PBH total merger rate. To determine a constraint on the PBH abundance, we study the merger rate
of PBHs in terms of their fraction and masses and compare those with the black hole merger rate estimated
by the Advanced LIGO (aLIGO)-Advanced Virgo (aVirgo) detectors during the third observing run.
The results demonstrate that within the context of SIDM halo models, the merger rate of $10~M_{\odot}-10~M_{\odot}$
events can potentially fall within the aLIGO-aVirgo window. We also estimate a relation between
the fraction of PBHs and their masses, which is well consistent with our findings.

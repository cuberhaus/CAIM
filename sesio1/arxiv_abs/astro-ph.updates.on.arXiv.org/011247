While it is now well established that large carbon chain species and radiative electron attachment
(REA) are key ingredients triggering interstellar anion chemistry, the role played by smaller
molecular anions, for which REA appears to be an unlikely formation pathway, is as yet elusive. Advancing
this research undoubtedly requires the knowledge of their astronomical abundances which, for
the case of C$_{2}$N$^{-}$, is largely hindered by a lack of accurate spectroscopic signatures.
In this work, we provide such data for both ground $\ell$-CCN$^{-}$($^{3}\Sigma^{-}$) and low-lying
$c$-CNC$^{-}$($^{1}A_{1}$) isomers by means of state-of-the-art rovibrational quantum chemical
techniques. Their quartic force fields are herein calibrated using a high-level composite energy
scheme that accounts for extrapolations to both one-particle and (approximate) ${N}$-particle
basis set limits, in addition to relativistic effects, with the final forms being subsequently
subject to nuclear motion calculations. Besides standard spectroscopic attributes, the full
set of computed properties includes fine and hyperfine interaction constants and can be readily
introduced as guesses in conventional experimental data reduction analyses through effective
Hamiltonians. On the basis of benchmark calculations, the target accuracies are determined to
be better than 0.1% of experiment for rotational constants and 0.3% for vibrational fundamentals.
Apart from laboratory investigations, the results here presented are expected to also prompt future
astronomical surveys on C$_{2}$N$^{-}$. Using the theoretically-predicted spectroscopic constants,
the rotational spectra of both $\ell$-CCN$^{-}$($^{3}\Sigma^{-}$) and $c$-CNC$^{-}$($^{1}A_{1}$)
are also derived and their likely detectability in the interstellar medium is further explored
in connection with working frequency ranges of powerful astronomical facilities.

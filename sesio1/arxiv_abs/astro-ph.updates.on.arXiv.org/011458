Through the Backyard Worlds: Planet 9 citizen science project we discovered a late-type L dwarf
co-moving with the young K0 star BD+60 1417 at a projected separation of 37" or 1662 AU. The secondary
- CWISER J124332.12+600126.2 (W1243) - is detected in both the CatWISE2020 and 2MASS reject tables.
The photometric distance and CatWISE proper motion both match that of the primary within ~1sigma
and our estimates for chance alignment yield a zero probability. Follow-up near infrared spectroscopy
reveals W1243 to be a very red 2MASS color(J-Ks=2.72), low-surface gravity source that we classify
as L6 - L8gamma. Its spectral morphology strongly resembles that of confirmed late-type L dwarfs
in 10 - 150 Myr moving groups as well as that of planetary mass companions. The position on near- and
mid-infrared color-magnitude diagrams indicates the source is redder and fainter than the field
sequence, a telltale sign of an object with thick clouds and a complex atmosphere. For the primary
we obtained new optical spectroscopy and analyzed all available literature information for youth
indicators. We conclude that the Li I abundance, its loci on color-magnitude and color-color diagrams,
and the rotation rate revealed in multiple TESS sectors are all consistent with an age of 50 - 150 Myr.
Using our re-evaluated age of the primary, the Gaia parallax along with the photometry and spectrum
for W1243 we find a Teff=1303+/-31 K, logg=4.3+/-0.17 cm s-2, and a mass of 15+/-5 MJup. We find a physical
separation of ~1662 AU and a mass ratio of ~0.01 for this system. Placing it in context with the diverse
collection of binary stars, brown dwarf and planetary companions, the BD+60 1417 system falls in
a sparsely sampled area where the formation pathway is difficult to assess.

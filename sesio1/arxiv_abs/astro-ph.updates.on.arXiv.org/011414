The NASA InSight mission payload includes the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package HP^3 to
measure the surface heat flow. The package was designed to use a small penetrator - nicknamed the
mole - to implement a string of temperature sensors in the soil to a depth of 5m. The mole itself is equipped
with sensors to measure a thermal conductivity as it proceeds to depth. The heat flow would be calculated
from the product of the temperature gradient and the thermal conductivity. To avoid the perturbation
caused by annual surface temperature variations, the measurements would be taken at a depth between
3 m and 5 m. The mole was designed to penetrate cohesionless soil similar to Quartz sand which was expected
to provide a good analogue material for Martian sand. The sand would provide friction to the buried
mole hull to balance the remaining recoil of the mole hammer mechanism that drives the mole forward.
Unfortunately, the mole did not penetrate more than a mole length of 40 cm. The failure to penetrate
deeper was largely due to a few tens of centimeter thick cohesive duricrust that failed to provide
the required friction. Although a suppressor mass and spring in the hammer mechanism absorbed much
of the recoil, the available mass did not allow a system that would have eliminated the recoil. The
mole penetrated to 40 cm depth benefiting from friction provided by springs in the support structure
from which it was deployed. It was found in addition that the Martian soil provided unexpected levels
of penetration resistance that would have motivated to designing a more powerful mole. It is concluded
that more mass would have allowed to design a more robust system with little or no recoil, more energy
of the mole hammer mechanism and a more massive support structure.

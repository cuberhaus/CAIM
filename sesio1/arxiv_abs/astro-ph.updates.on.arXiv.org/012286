In this work, we probe the star formation history of the Universe using tomographic cross-correlation
between the cosmic infrared background (CIB) and galaxy samples. The galaxy samples are from the
Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), while the CIB maps are made from \planck\, sky maps. We measure the cross-correlation
in harmonic space with a significance of 43$\sigma$. We model the cross-correlation with a halo
model, which links CIB anisotropies to star formation rates (SFR) and galaxy abundance. We assume
that SFR has a lognormal dependence on halo mass, while galaxy abundance follows the halo occupation
distribution (HOD) model. The cross-correlations give a best-fit maximum star formation efficiency
of $\eta_{\mathrm{max}}= 0.41^{+0.09}_{-0.14}$ at a halo mass $\log_{10}(M_{\mathrm{peak}}/M_{\odot})=
{12.14\pm 0.36}$. The derived star formation rate density (SFRD) is well constrained up to $z\sim
1.5$. The constraining power at high redshift is mainly limited by the KiDS survey depth. A combination
with external SFRD measurements from previous studies gives $\log_{10}(M_{\mathrm{peak}}/M_{\odot})=12.42^{+0.35}_{-0.19}$.
This tightens the SFRD constraint up to $z=4$, yielding a peak SFRD of $0.09_{-0.004}^{+0.003}\,M_{\odot}
\mathrm { year }^{-1} \mathrm{Mpc}^{-3}$ at $z=1.74^{+0.06}_{-0.02}$, corresponding to a lookback
time of $10.05^{+0.12}_{-0.03}$ Gyr. Both constraints are consistent, and the derived SFRD agrees
with previous studies and simulations. Additionally, we estimate the galaxy bias $b$ of KiDS galaxies
from the constrained HOD parameters and yield an increasing bias from $b=1.1_{-0.31}^{+0.17}$
at $z=0$ to $b=1.96_{-0.64}^{+0.18}$ at $z=1.5$. Finally, we provide a forecast for future galaxy
surveys and conclude that, due to their considerable depth, future surveys will yield a much tighter
constraint on the evolution of the SFRD.

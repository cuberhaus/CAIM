Hot and Warm Jupiters (HJs\&WJs) are gas-giant planets orbiting their host stars at short orbital
periods, posing a challenge to an efficient in-situ formation of such planets. Most of the HJs/WJs
populations are thought to have migrated from an initially farther-out birth locations. Both disc-migration
(driven by gas-dissipation) and eccentric-migration (driven by tidal evolution) fail to produce
the occurrence rate and orbital properties of HJs/WJs. Here we study the role of the thermal evolution
and its coupling to tidal evolution. We use the AMUSE numerical environment and MESA planetary evolution
modeling to model in detail the coupled internal and orbital evolution of gas-giants during their
eccentric migration. In this paper we use a numerical full planetary evolution thermal-dynamical
model. In a companion paper, we use a simple semi-analytic model, validated by our numerical model,
and run a population synthesis study. We consider the initially inflated radii of gas-giants (expected
following their formation), as well study the effects of the potential slowed contraction and even
re-inflation of gas-giants (due to tidal and radiative heating) on the eccentric migration. Tidal
forces that drive eccentric-migration are highly sensitive to the planetary structure and radius.
Consequently, we find that this form of inflated eccentric-migration operates on significantly
(up to an order of magnitude) shorter timescales than previously studied eccentric migration models.
Thereby, inflated eccentric migration gives rise to more rapid formation of HJs/WJs and higher
occurrence rates of WJs, as well as higher rates of tidal disruptions, compared with previous eccentric
migration models which consider constant ~Jupiter radii for HJ/WJ progenitors. Coupled thermal-dynamical
evolution of eccentric gas-giants can therefore play a key-role in their evolution.

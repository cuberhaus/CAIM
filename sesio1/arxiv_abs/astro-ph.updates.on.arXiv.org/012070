One of the main scenarios to account for the multi-wavelength flux variability observed in relativistic
jets of AGNs is based on diffusive shock acceleration of a population of relativistic electrons
on internal shocks of various origins. Any complete AGN emission scenario has to be able to explain
the wide range of observed variability time scales between the radio and gamma-ray band. In addition
constraints are also provided by very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI), which shows a large
variety of moving and standing emission zones with distinct behaviors. We aim to characterize the
evolution of stationary and moving emission zones in the jet and to study their multi-wavelength
signatures through emission maps and light curves. We focus our study on flare events that occur
during strong interactions between moving ejecta and stationary recollimation shocks. We simulate
relativistic jets with the magneto-hydrodynamic code MPI-AMRVAC and inject non-thermal particle
distributions of electrons in shock regions. We follow the propagation of a moving shock and its
interactions with a structure of standing re-collimation shocks in the jet. Synchrotron emission
and radiative transfer are calculated in the post-processing code RIPTIDE for given observation
angles and frequencies. We demonstrate the appearance of trailing components behind the leading
moving shock. The latter destabilizes the jet, causing the emergence of oscillating standing shocks
and relaxation shocks. Emissions from these regions can dominate the overall flux or lead to flare
echos in the light curve. Another observational marker of relaxation shocks appears in time-distance
plots of bright VLBI components of the jet. Our scenario provides a plausible explanation for radio
VLBI observations of the radio-galaxy 3C 111 where trailing components have been observed during
a radio outburst event in 1997.

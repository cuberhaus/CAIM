Most of the hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM) was rapidly ionized at high-redshifts. While
observations have established that reionization occurred, observational constraints on the
emissivity of ionizing photons at high-redshift remains elusive. Here, we present a new analysis
of the Low-redshift Lyman Continuum Survey (LzLCS) and archival observations, a combined sample
of 89 star-forming galaxies at z~0.3 with Hubble Space Telescope observations of their ionizing
continua (or Lyman Continuum, LyC). We find a strong (6$\sigma$ significant) inverse correlation
between the continuum slope at 1550\r{A} (defined as F$_\lambda\propto\lambda^{\beta}$) and
both the LyC escape fraction (f$_{esc}$) and f$_{esc}$ times the ionizing photon production efficiency
($\xi_{ ion}$). On average, galaxies with redder continuum slopes have smaller f$_{esc}$ than
galaxies with bluer slopes. More than 5% (20%) of the LyC emission escapes galaxies with $\beta$<-2.1
(-2.6). We find strong correlations between $\beta$ and the gas-phase ionization ([OIII]/[OII]
flux ratio; at 7.5$\sigma$ significance), galaxy stellar mass (at 5.9$\sigma$), the gas-phase
metallicity (at 4.6$\sigma$), and the observed FUV absolute magnitude (at 3.4$\sigma$). Using
previous observations of $\beta$ at high-redshift, we estimate the evolution of f$_{esc}$ with
both redshift and galaxy magnitude. The LzLCS observations suggest that fainter and lower mass
galaxies dominate the ionizing photon budget at higher redshift, possibly due to their rapidly
evolving metal and dust content. Finally, we use our correlation between $\beta$ and f$_{ esc}\times\xi_{ion}$
to predict the ionizing emissivity of galaxies during the epoch of reionization. Our estimated
emissivities match IGM observations, and suggest that star-forming galaxies emit sufficient
LyC photons into the IGM to exceed recombinations near redshifts of 7-8.

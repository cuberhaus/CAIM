Complex organic molecules (COMs) are often observed toward embedded Class 0 and I protostars. However,
not all Class 0 and I protostars exhibit COMs emission. In this work, variations in methanol (CH$_3$OH)
emission are studied to test if absence of CH$_3$OH emission can be linked to source properties.
Combining both new and archival observations with ALMA and sources from the literature, a sample
of 184 low-mass and high-mass protostars is investigated. The warm (T > 100 K) gaseous CH$_3$OH mass,
$M_{\rm CH_3OH}$, is determined for each source using primarily optically thin isotopologues.
On average, Class I protostellar systems seem to have less warm $M_{\rm CH_3OH}$ ($<10^{-10}$ M$_\odot$)
than younger Class 0 sources ($\sim10^{-7}$ M$_\odot$). High-mass sources in our sample show higher
warm $M_{\rm CH_3OH}$ up to $10^{-7}-10^{-3}$ M$_\odot$. To take into account the effect of the
source's overall mass on $M_{\rm CH_3OH}$, a normalized CH$_3$OH mass is defined as $M_{\rm CH_3OH}/M_{\rm
dust,0}$, where $M_{\rm dust,0}$ is the cold + warm dust mass within a fixed radius. Excluding upper
limits, a simple power-law fit to the normalized warm CH$_3$OH masses results in $M_{\rm CH_3OH}/M_{\rm
dust,0}\propto L_{\rm bol}^{0.70\pm0.05}$. This is in good agreement with a simple hot core toy
model which predicts that the normalized $M_{\rm CH_3OH}$ increases with $L_{\rm bol}^{0.75}$
due to the snowline moving outward. Sources for which the size of the disk is equivalent or smaller
than the estimated 100 K radius agree well with the best-fit power-law model, whereas sources with
significantly larger disks show up to two orders of magnitude lower normalized warm CH$_3$OH masses.
Based on the latter results, we suggest that source structure such as a disk can result in colder gas
and thus fewer COMs in the gas phase. Additionally, optically thick dust can hide the emission of
COMs.

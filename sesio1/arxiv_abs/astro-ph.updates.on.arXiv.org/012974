Long-period transiting planets provide the opportunity to better understand the formation and
evolution of planetary systems. Their atmospheric properties remain largely unaltered by tidal
or radiative effects of the host star, and their orbital arrangement reflects a different, and less
extreme, migrational history compared to close-in objects. The sample of long-period exoplanets
with well determined masses and radii is still limited, but a growing number of long-period objects
reveal themselves in the TESS data. Our goal is to vet and confirm single transit planet candidates
detected in the TESS space-based photometric data through spectroscopic and photometric follow
up observations with ground-based instruments. We use the Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS)
to photometrically monitor the candidates in order to observe additional transits. We report the
discovery of two massive, warm Jupiter-size planets, one orbiting the F8-type star TOI-5153 and
the other orbiting the G1-type star NGTS-20 (=TOI-5152). From our spectroscopic analysis, both
stars are metal-rich with a metallicity of 0.12 and 0.15, respectively. Follow-up radial velocity
observations were carried out with CORALIE, CHIRON, FEROS, and HARPS. TOI-5153 hosts a 20.33 day
period planet with a planetary mass of 3.26 (+-0.18) Mj, a radius of 1.06 (+-0.04) Rj , and an orbital
eccentricity of 0.091 (+-0.026). NGTS-20 b is a 2.98 (+-0.16) Mj planet with a radius of 1.07 (+-0.04)
Rj on an eccentric (0.432 +- 0.023) orbit with an orbital period of 54.19 days. Both planets are metal-enriched
and their heavy element content is in line with the previously reported mass-metallicity relation
for gas giants. Both warm Jupiters orbit moderately bright host stars making these objects valuable
targets for follow-up studies of the planetary atmosphere and measurement of the spin-orbit angle
of the system.

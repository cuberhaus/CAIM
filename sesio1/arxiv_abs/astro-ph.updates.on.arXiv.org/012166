We introduce Magrathea-Pathfinder, a relativistic ray-tracing framework that can reconstruct
the past light cone of observers in cosmological simulations. The code directly computes the 3D
trajectory of light rays through the null geodesic equations, with the weak-field limit as its only
approximation. This approach offers high levels of versatility while removing the need for many
of the standard ray-tracing approximations such as plane-parallel, Born, or multiple-lens. Moreover,
the use of adaptive integration steps and interpolation strategies based on adaptive-mesh refinement
(AMR) grids allows Magrathea-Pathfinder to accurately account for the non-linear regime of structure
formation and fully take advantage of the small-scale gravitational clustering. To handle very
large N-body simulations, the framework has been designed as a high-performance computing post-processing
tool relying on a hybrid parallelization that combines MPI tasks with C++11 std::threads. In this
paper, we describe how realistic cosmological observables can be computed from numerical simulation
using ray-tracing techniques. We discuss in particular the production of simulated catalogues
and sky maps that account for all the observational effects considering first-order metric perturbations
(such as peculiar velocities, gravitational potential, integrated Sachs-Wolfe, time-delay,
and gravitational lensing). We perform convergence tests of our gravitational lensing algorithms
and conduct performance benchmarks of the null geodesic integration procedures. Magrathea-Pathfinder
introduces sophisticated ray-tracing tools to make the link between the space of N-body simulations
and light-cone observables. This should provide new ways of exploring existing cosmological probes
and building new ones beyond standard assumptions in order to prepare for the next generation of
large-scale structure surveys.

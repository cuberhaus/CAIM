The Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal (Sgr) is a dissolving galaxy being tidally disrupted by the Milky
Way (MW). Its stellar stream still poses serious modelling challenges, which hinders our ability
to use it effectively as a probe of the MW gravitational potential. Our goal is to construct the best
possible sample of stars with which we can advance our understanding of the Sgr-MW interaction,
focusing on the characterisation of the bifurcations. We improve on previous methods based on the
use of the wavelet transform to systematically search for the kinematic signature of the Sgr stream
in the Gaia data. We refine our selection via the use of a clustering algorithm on the statistical
properties of the colour-magnitude diagrams. Our final sample contains > 700k candidate stars,
3x larger than previous samples. We have been able to detect the bifurcation of the stream in both
the northern and southern hemispheres, requiring four branches to fully describe this system.
We present the detailed proper motion distribution of the trailing arm as a function of Lambda showing
the presence of a sharp edge (on the side of the small proper motions) beyond which there are no Sgr
stars. We also characterise the correlation between kinematics and distance. The chemical analysis
of our sample shows a significant difference between the faint and bright branches. We provide analytical
descriptions for the proper motion trends as well as for the sky distribution of the four branches
of the stream. We interpret the bifurcations as the misaligned overlap of the material stripped
at the antepenultimate pericentre (faint branches) with the stars ejected at the penultimate pericentre
(bright branch). The source of this misalignment is still unknown but we argue that models with some
internal rotation in the progenitor, at least during the time of stripping of the stars in the faint
branches, are worth exploring.

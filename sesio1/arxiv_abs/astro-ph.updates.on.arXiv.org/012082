We present a rest-frame UV-optical stacked spectrum representative of massive quiescent galaxies
at $1.0<z<1.3$ with log$(M_*/\rm{M_\odot})>10.8$. The stack is constructed using VANDELS survey
data, combined with new KMOS observations. We apply two independent full-spectral-fitting approaches,
measuring a total metallicity, [Z/H]=$-0.13\pm0.08$ with Bagpipes, and [Z/H]=$0.04\pm0.14$
with Alf, a fall of $\sim0.2-0.3$ dex compared with the local Universe. We also measure an iron abundance,
[Fe/H] =$-0.18\pm0.08$, a fall of $\sim0.15$ dex compared with the the local Universe. We measure
the alpha enhancement via the magnesium abundance, obtaining [Mg/Fe]=$0.23\pm$0.12, consistent
with similar-mass galaxies in the local Universe, indicating no evolution in the average alpha
enhancement of log$(M_*/\rm{M_\odot})=11$ quiescent galaxies over the last $\sim8$ Gyr. This
suggests the very high alpha enhancements recently reported for several bright $z\sim1-2$ quiescent
galaxies are due to their extreme masses, log$(M_*/\rm{M_\odot})\gtrsim11.5$, rather than being
typical of the $z\gtrsim1$ population. The metallicity evolution we observe with redshift (falling
[Z/H], [Fe/H], constant [Mg/Fe]) is consistent with recent studies. We recover a mean stellar age
of $2.5^{+0.6}_{-0.4}$ Gyr, corresponding to a formation redshift, $z_\rm{form}=2.4^{+0.6}_{-0.3}$.
Recent studies have obtained varying average formation redshifts for $z\gtrsim1$ massive quiescent
galaxies, and, as these studies report consistent metallicities, we identify different star-formation-history
models as the most likely cause. Larger spectroscopic samples from upcoming ground-based instruments
will provide precise constraints on ages and metallicities at $z\gtrsim1$. Combining these with
precise JWST $z>2$ quiescent-galaxy stellar-mass functions will provide an independent test
of formation redshifts derived from spectral fitting.

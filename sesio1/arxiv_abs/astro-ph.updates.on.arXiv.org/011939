Counts of galaxy clusters offer a high-precision probe of cosmology, but control of systematic
errors will determine the accuracy of this measurement. Using Buzzard simulations, we quantify
one such systematic, the triaxiality distribution of clusters identified with the redMaPPer optical
cluster finding algorithm, which was used in the Dark Energy Survey Year-1 (DES Y1) cluster cosmology
analysis. We test whether redMaPPer selection biases the clusters' shape and orientation and find
that it only biases orientation, preferentially selecting clusters with their major axes oriented
along the line of sight. Modeling the richness-mass relation as a log-linear relation, we find that
the log-richness amplitude $\ln(A)$ is boosted from the lowest to highest orientation bin with
a significance of $14\sigma$, while the orientation dependence of the richness-mass slope and
intrinsic scatter is minimal. We also find that the weak lensing shear-profile ratios of cluster-associated
dark halos in different orientation bins resemble a "bottleneck" shape that can be quantified with
a Cauchy function. We test the correlation of orientation with two other leading systematics in
cluster cosmology -- miscentering and projection -- and find a null correlation. Analytic templates
for the triaxiality bias of observed-richness and lensing profiles are mapped as corrections to
the observable of richness-binned lensing profiles for redMaPPer clusters. The resulting mass
bias confirms the DES Y1 finding that triaxiality is a leading source of bias in cluster cosmology.
However, the richness-dependence of the bias confirms that triaxiality does not fully resolve
the tension at low-richness between DES Y1 cluster cosmology and other probes. Our model can be used
for quantifying the impact of triaxiality bias on cosmological constraints for upcoming weak lensing
surveys of galaxy clusters.

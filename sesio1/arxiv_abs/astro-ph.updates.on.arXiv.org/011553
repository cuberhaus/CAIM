$H_0$ constraints from galaxy surveys are sourced by the geometric properties of two standardisable
rulers: the sound horizon scale, $r_s$, and the matter-radiation equality scale, $k_{\rm eq}$.
While most analyses over the last decade have focused on the first scale, recent work has emphasised
that the second can provide an independent source of information about the expansion rate of the
universe. Recent approaches to obtain a sound-horizon-independent measurement of $H_0$ from
the equality scale have avoided $r_s$-based information by removing the sound-horizon-calibrating
prior on the baryon density. We present a new method to marginalise over $r_s$; this allows baryon
information to be retained enabling tighter parameter constraints. For a Euclid-like spectroscopic
survey, we forecast sound-horizon-independent $H_0$ constraints of $\sigma_{H_0} = 0.7\rm{\
km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$ for our method using the equality scale, compared with $\sigma_{H_0} = 0.5\rm{\
km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$ from the sound horizon. Upcoming equality scale $H_0$ measurements thus
can be highly competitive, although we caution that the impact of observational systematics on
such measurements still needs to be investigated in detail. Applying our new approach to the BOSS
power spectrum gives $H_0 = 69.5^{+3.0}_{-3.5}\rm{\ km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$ from equality alone,
somewhat tighter than previous constraints. Consistency of $r_s$- and $k_{\rm eq}$-based $H_0$
measurements can provide a valuable internal consistency test of the cosmological model; as an
example, we consider the change in $H_0$ created by early dark energy. Assuming the \textit{Planck}+SH0ES
best-fit EDE model we find a $2.6\sigma$ shift ($\Delta H_0 = 2.6\rm{\ km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$) between
the two measurements for Euclid; if we instead assume the ACT best-fit model, this increases to $9.0\sigma$
($\Delta H_0 = 7.8\rm{\ km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$).

Exoplanetary properties depend on stellar properties: to know the planet with accuracy and precision
it is necessary to know the star as accurately and precisely as possible. Our immediate aim is to characterize
in a homogeneous and accurate way a sample of 27 transiting planet-hosting stars observed within
the GAPS program. We determined stellar parameters (effective temperature, surface gravity,
rotational velocity) and abundances of 26 elements (Li,C,N,O,Na,Mg,Al,Si,S,Ca,Sc,Ti,V,Cr,Fe,Mn,Co,Ni,Cu,Zn,Y,Zr,Ba,La,Nd,Eu).
Our study is based on high-resolution HARPS-N@TNG and FEROS@ESO spectra and uniform techniques.
We derived kinematic properties from Gaia data and estimated for the first time in exoplanet host
stars ages using elemental ratios as chemical clocks. Teff of our stars is of 4400-6700 K, while [Fe/H]
is within -0.3 and 0.4 dex. Lithium is present in 7 stars. [X/H] and [X/Fe] abundances vs [Fe/H] are
consistent with the Galactic Chemical Evolution. The dependence of [X/Fe] with the condensation
temperature is critically analyzed with respect to stellar and kinematic properties. All targets
with measured C and O abundances show C/O<0.8, compatible with Si present in rock-forming minerals.
Most of targets show 1.0<Mg/Si<1.5, compatible with Mg distributed between olivine and pyroxene.
HAT-P-26, the target hosting the lowest-mass planet, shows the highest Mg/Si ratio. From our chemo-dinamical
analysis we find agreement between ages and position within the Galactic disk. We note a tendency
for higher density planets to be around metal-rich stars and hints of higher stellar abundances
of some volatiles for lower mass planets. We cannot exclude that part of our results could be also
related to the location of the stars within the Galactic disk. We trace the planetary migration scenario
from the composition of the planets related to the chemical composition of the hosting stars

New ALMA observations of protoplanetary disks allow us to probe planet formation in other systems,
giving us new constraints on planet formation processes. Meanwhile, studies of our own Solar System
rely on constraints derived in a completely different way. However, it is still unclear what features
the Solar System's disk could have produced during its gas phase. By running 2D isothermal hydro-simulations
and a dust evolution model, we derive synthetic images at 1.3 mm wavelength using the radiative transfer
code RADMC3D. We find that the embedded multiple giant planets strongly perturb the radial gas velocities
of the disk, creating traffic jams in the dust. They produce over-densities different from the ones
created by pressure traps and located away from the planets' positions in the disk. By deriving the
images at 1.3mm from these dust distributions, we show that the traffic jams, observable with a high
resolution, further blur the link between the number of gaps and rings in disks and the number of embedded
planets. We additionally show that a system of 3 compact giant planets does not automatically produce
bright outer rings at large radii in the disk. This means that high resolution observations of disks
of various sizes are needed to distinguish between different giant planet formation scenarios
during the disk phase, where the giants form either in the outer regions of the disks or in the inner
regions. Finally, we find that, even when the dust temperature is determined self-consistently,
the dust masses derived observationally might be off by up to a factor of ten compared to the dust contained
in our simulations due to the creation of optically thick regions. Our study clearly shows that in
addition to the constraints from exoplanets and the Solar System, ALMA has the power to constrain
different stages of planet formation already during the first few million years.

We have developed a chemo-dynamical approach to assign 36,010 metal-poor SkyMapper stars to various
Galactic stellar populations. Using two independent techniques (velocity and action space behavior),
$Gaia$ EDR3 astrometry, and photometric metallicities, we selected stars with the characteristics
of the "metal-weak" thick disk population by minimizing contamination by the canonical thick disk
or other Galactic structures. This sample comprises 7,127 stars, spans a metallicity range of $-3.50<${\metal}~$<-0.8$,
and has a systematic rotational velocity of $\langle V_\phi\rangle=154$\,km\,s$^{-1}$ that
lags that of the thick disk. Orbital eccentricities have intermediate values between typical thick
disk and halo values. The scale length is $h_{R}=2.48^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$\,kpc and the scale height
is $h_{Z}=1.68^{+0.19}_{-0.15}$\,kpc. The metallicity distribution function is well fit by
an exponential with a slope of $\Delta\log{\rm N}/\Delta\metal=1.13\pm0.06$. Overall, we find
a significant metal-poor component consisting of 261 SkyMapper stars with \metal$<-2.0$. While
our sample contains only eleven stars with {\metal}~$\lesssim-3.0$, investigating the JINAbase
compilation of metal-poor stars reveals another 18 such stars (five have {\metal}$<-4.0$) that
kinematically belong to our sample. These distinct spatial, kinematic and chemical characteristics
strongly suggest this metal-poor, phase-mixed kinematic sample to represent an independent disk
component with an accretion origin in which a massive dwarf galaxy radially plunged into the early
Galactic disk. Going forward, we propose to call the metal-weak thick disk population as the Atari
disk, given its likely accretion origin, and in reference to it sharing space with the Galactic thin
and thick disks.

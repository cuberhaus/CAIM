The majority of exoplanets found to date have been discovered via the transit method, and transmission
spectroscopy represents the primary method of studying these distant worlds. Currently, in-depth
atmospheric characterization of transiting exoplanets entails the use of spectrographs on large
telescopes, requiring significant observing time to study each planet. Previous studies have
demonstrated trends for solar system worlds using color-color photometry of reflectance spectra,
as well as trends within transmission spectra for hot Jupiters. Building on these concepts, we have
investigated the use of transmission color photometric analysis for efficient, coarse categorization
of exoplanets and for assessing the nature of these worlds, with a focus on resolving the bulk composition
degeneracy to aid in discriminating super-Earths and sub-Neptunes. We present our methodology
and first results, including spectrum models, model comparison frameworks, and wave band selection
criteria. We present our results for different transmission "color" metrics, filter selection
methods, and numbers of filters. Assuming noise-free spectra of isothermal atmospheres in chemical
equilibrium, with our pipeline, we are able to constrain atmospheric mean molecular weight in order
to distinguish between super-Earth and sub-Neptune atmospheres with >90$\%$ overall accuracy
using as few as two specific low-resolution filter combinations. We also found that increasing
the number of filters does not substantially impact this performance. This method could allow for
broad characterization of large numbers of planets much more efficiently than current methods
permit, enabling population and system-level studies. Additionally, data collected via this
method could inform follow-up observing time by large telescopes for more detailed studies of worlds
of interest.

We study spatially resolved scaling relations among stars, dust, and gas in ten nearby spiral galaxies.
In a preceding paper Abdurro'uf et al. (2022), we have derived spatially resolved properties of
the stellar population and dust by panchromatic spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting using
piXedfit. Now, we investigate resolved star formation ($\Sigma_{\rm H_{2}}$--$\Sigma_{\rm
SFR}$--$\Sigma_{*}$) and dust scaling relations. While the relations with all sub-galactic regions
of the galaxies are reasonably tight ($\sigma \lesssim 0.3$ dex), we find that most of the scaling
relations exhibit galaxy-to-galaxy variations in normalization and shape. Only two relations
of $\Sigma_{\rm dust}$--$\Sigma_{\rm gas}$ and $\Sigma_{\rm dust}$--$\Sigma_{\rm H_{2}}$
do not show noticeable galaxy-to-galaxy variations among our sample galaxies. We further investigate
correlations among the scaling relations. We find significant correlations among the normalization
of the $\Sigma_{\rm H_{2}}$--$\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$--$\Sigma_{*}$ relations, which suggest that
galaxies with higher levels of resolved $\text{H}_{2}$ fraction ($f_{\rm H_{2}}$) tend to have
higher levels of resolved star formation efficiency (SFE) and specific star formation rate (sSFR).
We also observe that galaxies with higher levels of resolved dust-to-stellar mass ratios tend to
have higher levels of resolved sSFR, SFE, and $f_{\rm H_{2}}$. Moreover, we find that galaxies with
higher global sSFR and less compact morphology tend to have higher levels of the resolved sSFR, SFE,
and $f_{\rm H_{2}}$, which can explain the variations in the normalization of the $\Sigma_{\rm
H_{2}}$--$\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$--$\Sigma_{*}$ relationships. Overall, we observe indications
of the contributions of both global and local factors in governing the star formation process in
galaxies.

Brown dwarfs in close-in orbits around white dwarfs offer an excellent opportunity to investigate
properties of fast-rotating, tidally-locked, and highly-irradiated atmospheres. We present
Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 G141 phase-resolved observations of two brown dwarf-white
dwarf binaries: WD 0137-349 and EPIC 212235321. Their 1.1 to 1.7 $\mu$m phase curves demonstrate
rotational modulations with semi-amplitudes of $5.27\pm0.02$% and $29.1\pm0.1$%; both can be
well fit by multi-order Fourier series models. The high-order Fourier components have the same
phase as the first order and are likely caused by hot spots located at the substellar points, suggesting
inefficient day/night heat transfer. Both brown dwarfs' phase-resolved spectra can be accurately
represented by linear combinations of their day- and night-side spectra. Fitting the irradiated
brown dwarf model grids to the day-side spectra require a filling factor of ~50%, further supporting
a hot spot dominating the emission of the day-sides. The night-side spectrum of WD 0137-349B is reasonably
well fit by non-irradiated substellar models and the one of EPIC 212235321B can be approximated
by a Planck function. We find strong spectral variations in the brown dwarfs' day/night flux and
brightness temperature contrasts, which highlights the limitations of band-integrated measurements
in probing heat transfer in irradiated objects. On the color-magnitude diagram, WD 0137-349B evolves
along a cloudless model track connecting the early-L and mid-T spectral types, demonstrating that
clouds and disequilibrium chemistry have a negligible effect on this object. A full interpretation
of these high-quality phase-resolved spectra calls for new models that couple atmospheric circulation
and radiative transfer under high-irradiation conditions.

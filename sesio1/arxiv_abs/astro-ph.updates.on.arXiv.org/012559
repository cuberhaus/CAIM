HD163296 is a Herbig Ae star which drives a bipolar knotty jet with a total length of ~6000au. Strong
evidence exists that the disk of HD163296 harbors planets. Studies have shown that the presence
of companions around jet-driving stars could affect the morphology of the jets. This includes a
`wiggling' of the jet axis and a periodicity in the positions of the jet knots. In this study we investigate
the morphology (including the jet width and axis position) and proper motions of the HD163296 jets,
and use our results to better understand the whole system.This study is based on optical integral-field
spectroscopy observations obtained with VLT/MUSE in 2017. Using spectro-images and position
velocity diagrams extracted from the MUSE data cube, we investigated the number and positions of
the jet knots. A comparison was made to X-Shooter data collected in 2012 and the knot proper motions
were estimated. The jet width and jet axis position with distance from the star were studied from
the extracted spectro-images. We observe the merging of knots and identify two previously undetected
knots. Measurements of the jet axis position reveal a similar pattern of deviation in all forbidden
emission lines along the first 20 arc seconds of the jets. This result is interpreted as being due
to asymmetric shocks and not due to a wiggling of the jet axis. The number of new knots detected and
their positions challenge the 16-year knot ejection periodicity proposed in prior studies, arguing
for a more complicated jet system than was previously assumed. We use the non-detection of a jet axis
wiggling to rule out companions with a mass $>$0.1~\Msun\ and orbits between 1~au and 35~au. Any
object inferred at these distances using other methods must be a brown dwarf or planet, otherwise
it would have impacted the jet axis position. Both the precession and orbital motion scenarios are
considered.

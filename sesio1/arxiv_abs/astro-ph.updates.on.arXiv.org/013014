The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) archives constitute a rich dataset of high resolution images to
mine for strong gravitational lenses. While many HST programs specifically target strong lenses,
they can also be present by coincidence in other HST observations. We aim to identify non-targeted
strong gravitational lenses in almost two decades of images from the ESA it Hubble Space Telescope
archive (eHST), without any prior selection on the lens properties. We used crowdsourcing on the
Hubble Asteroid Hunter (HAH) citizen science project to identify strong lenses, alongside asteroid
trails, in publicly available large field-of-view HST images. We visually inspected 2354 objects
tagged by citizen scientists as strong lenses to clean the sample and identify the genuine lenses.
We report the detection of 252 strong gravitational lens candidates, which were not the primary
targets of the HST observations. 198 of them are new, not previously reported by other studies, consisting
of 45 A grades, 74 B grades and 79 C grades. The majority are galaxy-galaxy configurations. The newly
detected lenses are, on average, 1.3 magnitudes fainter than previous HST searches. This sample
of strong lenses with high resolution HST imaging is ideal to follow-up with spectroscopy, for lens
modelling and scientific analyses. This paper presents an unbiased search of lenses, which enabled
us to find a high variety of lens configurations, including exotic lenses. We demonstrate the power
of crowdsourcing in visually identifying strong lenses and the benefits of exploring large archival
datasets. This study shows the potential of using crowdsourcing in combination with artificial
intelligence for the detection and validation of strong lenses in future large-scale surveys such
as ESA's future mission Euclid or in JWST archival images.

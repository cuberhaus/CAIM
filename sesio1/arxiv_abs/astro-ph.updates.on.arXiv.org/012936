Context. In the current ever increasing data volumes of astronomical surveys, automated methods
are essential. Objects of known classes from the literature are necessary for training supervised
machine learning algorithms, as well as for verification/validation of their results. Aims.The
primary goal of this work is to provide a comprehensive data set of known variable objects from the
literature cross-matched with \textit{Gaia}~DR3 sources, including a large number of both variability
types and representatives, in order to cover as much as possible sky regions and magnitude ranges
relevant to each class. In addition, non-variable objects from selected surveys are targeted to
probe their variability in \textit{Gaia} and possible use as standards. This data set can be the
base for a training set applicable in variability detection, classification, and validation.
MethodsA statistical method that employed both astrometry (position and proper motion) and photometry
(mean magnitude) was applied to selected literature catalogues in order to identify the correct
counterparts of the known objects in the \textit{Gaia} data. The cross-match strategy was adapted
to the properties of each catalogue and the verification of results excluded dubious matches. Results.Our
catalogue gathers 7\,841\,723 \textit{Gaia} sources among which 1.2~million non-variable objects
and 1.7~million galaxies, in addition to 4.9~million variable sources representing over 100~variability
(sub)types. Conclusions.This data set served the requirements of \textit{Gaia}'s variability
pipeline for its third data release (DR3), from classifier training to result validation, and it
is expected to be a useful resource for the scientific community that is interested in the analysis
of variability in the \textit{Gaia} data and other surveys.

We introduce in this work the Solar System Object Search Service (SSOSS), a service aimed at providing
the scientific community with a search service for all potential detections of SSOs among the ESA
astronomy archival imaging data. We illustrate its functionalities using the case of asteroid
(16) Psyche, for which no information in the far-IR (70-500 {\mu}m) has previously been reported,
to derive its thermal properties in preparation for the upcoming NASA Psyche mission. This service
performs a geometrical cross-match of the orbital path of each object with respect to the public
high-level imaging footprints stored in the ESA archives. For this first release, three missions
were chosen: XMM-Newton, the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and Herschel Observatory. We present
a catalog listing all potential detections of asteroids within estimated limiting magnitude or
flux limit in Herschel, XMM-Newton, and HST archival imaging data, including 909 serendipitous
detections in Herschel images, 985 in XMM-Newton Optical Monitor camera images, and over 32,000
potential serendipitous detections in HST images. We also present a case study: the analysis of
the thermal properties of Psyche from four serendipitous Herschel detections, combined with previously
published thermal IR measurements. We see strong evidence for an unusual drop in (hemispherical
spectral) emissivity, from 0.9 at 100 {\mu}m down to about 0.6 at 350 {\mu}m, followed by a possible
but not well-constrained increase towards 500 {\mu}m, comparable to what was found for Vesta. The
combined thermal data set puts a strong constraint on Psyche's thermal inertia (between 20 to 80$J
m^{-2} s^{-1/2} K^{-1}$) and favours an intermediate to low level surface roughness (below 0.4
for the rms of surface slopes).

Outbursts from cataclysmic variables, such as dwarf novae (DNe), are prevalent throughout the
galaxy and are known to emit strongly in the ultraviolet (UV). However, the UV emission of DNe has
not been studied extensively compared with the optical. Characterising in detail the physical
processes responsible for DN outburst behaviour requires further UV data. Here we report, as part
of our recently launched Transient UV Objects Project (TUVO), the discovery of TUVO-21acq, a new
transient which we detected in the UV using data from the Ultraviolet Optical Telescope aboard Swift.
We detected two separate outbursts and used the UV data to constrain source properties, focusing
on the amplitudes and timescales of the outbursts. During the first outburst the source increased
in brightness by >4.1, >2.4, and >3.5 magnitudes and during the second outburst by >4.4, >3.4, and
>3.6 magnitudes in the UVW1, UVM2, and UVW2 bands, respectively. The outburst durations were in
the range 6-21 days and 11-46 days, and the recurrence time is <316 days. We additionally obtained
an optical spectrum during quiescence with SALT. The spectrum exhibited hydrogen Balmer series
and helium emission lines, and a flat overall spectral shape. We confirm the nature of the source
as an accreting white dwarf which underwent DN outburst based on photometric and spectroscopic
properties. This study serves as a proof-of-concept for the TUVO project strategy, demonstrating
its capability of discovering and classifying new, interesting UV transients. We discuss the implications
of our findings for our understanding of the physics underlying DN outbursts, in particular with
respect to the UV emission. We examine the need for simultaneous UV and optical observations during
the onset of DN outbursts in order to help answer remaining questions, for example in the characteristics
and implications of the UV delay.

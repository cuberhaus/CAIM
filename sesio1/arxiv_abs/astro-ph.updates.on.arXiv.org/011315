The routine detection of gravitational-wave events from compact binary coalescences has allowed
precise tests of gravity in strong field, dynamical field, and high energy regime. In this work,
we report the results of testing gravitational-wave birefringence using compact binary coalescence
events from the 3rd Open Gravitational-wave Catalog (3-OGC). Birefringence, an effect where the
left- and right-handed polarizations of gravitational waves follow different equations of motion,
occurs when the parity symmetry of gravity is broken. This arises naturally in the effective field
theory extension of general relativity. Using Bayesian inference and state-of-the-art waveform
modeling, we use all events in 3-OGC to constrain the lower limit of the energy scale at which parity
violation effects emerge. Overall we do not find evidence for a violation of general relativity,
and thus we constrain the parity-violating energy scale to $M_\mathrm{PV} > 0.11$ GeV at $90\%$
confidence level, which is an improvement over previous results by one order of magnitude. Intriguingly,
we find an outlier, GW190521, that supports the existence of birefringence over general relativity
with a higher match-filtering signal-to-noise ratio and Bayes factor. The inclusion of birefringence
for GW190521 gives consistent sky location estimation with a possible electromagnetic counterpart
reported Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF).However, the inferred $M_\mathrm{PV}$ from GW190521
is in tension with the combined constraints from other events, we thus hypothesize that the non-zero
deviation may be caused by the limitations of the existing waveform approximants. More gravitational
wave detections in the future from compact binary coalescence will further improve the constraints
on birefringence and shed light on possible systematics for GW190521-type events.

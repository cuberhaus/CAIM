The metallicity spread, or the metallicity trend along the evolutionary sequence of a globular
cluster, is a rich source of information to help understand the cluster physics (e.g. multiple populations)
and stellar physics (e.g. atomic diffusion). Low-resolution integral-field-unit spectroscopy
in the optical with the MUSE is an attractive prospect if it can provide these diagnostics because
it allows us to extract spectra of a large fraction of the cluster stars. We investigate the possibilities
of full-spectrum fitting to derive stellar parameters and chemical abundances at low spectral
resolution (R~2000). We reanalysed 1584 MUSE spectra of 1061 stars above the turn-off of NGC 6397
using FERRE and employing two different synthetic libraries. We derive the equivalent iron abundance
\fehe for fixed values of \afe. We find that (i) the interpolation schema and grid mesh are not critical
for the precision, metallicity spread, and trend; (ii) with the two grids, \fehe increases by ~0.2
dex along the sub-giant branch, starting from the turn-off of the main sequence; (iii) restricting
the wavelength range to the optical decreases the precision significantly; and (iv) the precision
obtained with the synthetic libraries is lower than the precision obtained previously with empirical
libraries. Full-spectrum fitting provides reproducible results that are robust to the choice
of the reference grid of synthetic spectra and to the details of the analysis. The \fehe increase
along the sub-giant branch is in stark contrast with the nearly constant iron abundance previously
found with empirical libraries. The precision of the measurements (0.05 dex on \fehe) is currently
not sufficient to assess the intrinsic chemical abundance spreads, but this may change with deeper
observations. Improvements of the synthetic spectra are still needed to deliver the full possibilities
of full-spectrum fitting.

The 3D fine structure of the solar atmosphere is still not fully understood as most of the available
observations are taken from a single vantage point. The goal of the paper is to study the 3D distribution
of small-scale brightening events ("campfires") discovered in the EUV quiet Sun by the Extreme
Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) aboard Solar Orbiter. We used a first commissioning data set acquired
by the EUI's High Resolution EUV telescope on 30 May 2020 in the 174 {\AA} passband and we combined
it with simultaneous data taken by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) aboard the Solar Dynamics
Observatory in a similar 171 {\AA} passband. The two-pixel spatial resolution of the two telescopes
is 400 km and 880 km, respectively, which is sufficient to identify the campfires in both data sets.
The two spacecraft had an angular separation of around 31.5 degrees (essentially in heliographic
longitude), which allowed for the 3D reconstruction of the campfire position. These observations
represent the first time that stereoscopy was achieved for brightenings at such a small scale. Manual
and automatic triangulation methods were used to characterize the campfire data. The height of
the campfires is located between 1000 km and 5000 km above the photosphere and we find a good agreement
between the manual and automatic methods. The internal structure of campfires is mostly unresolved
by AIA; however, for a particularly large campfire, we were able to triangulate a few pixels, which
are all in a narrow range between 2500 and 4500 km. The low height of EUI campfires suggests that they
belong to the previously unresolved fine structure of the transition region and low corona of the
quiet Sun. They are probably apexes of small-scale dynamic loops heated internally to coronal temperatures.
This work demonstrates that high-resolution stereoscopy of structures in the solar atmosphere
has become feasible.

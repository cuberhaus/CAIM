We propose a new method to determine the shape of the gravitational potential of the dark matter (DM)
halo of the Milky Way (MW) with the galactocentric tangential velocities of a sample of hypervelocity
stars (HVSs). We compute the trajectories of different samples of HVSs in a MW where the baryon distribution
is axisymmetric and the DM potential either is spherical or is spheroidal or triaxial with radial-dependent
axis ratios. We determine the shape of the DM potential with the distribution of the latitudinal
velocity $|v_{\vartheta}|$ in axisymmetric Galactic potentials, or with the distribution of
$|v_{\vartheta}|$ and of a function $\bar v_{\varphi}$ of the azimuthal velocity in non-axisymmetric
Galactic potentials. We recover the correct shape of the DM potential by comparing the distribution
of $|v_{\vartheta}|$ and $\bar v_{\varphi}$ against the corresponding distributions of mock
samples of HVSs that traveled in DM halos of different shapes. We use the largest possible sample
of $\sim 800$ HVSs of $4~M_\odot$ ejected with the Hills mechanism at a rate $\sim 10^{-4}$ yr$^{-1}$,
currently outgoing, and located at more than 10 kpc from the Galactic center. In our ideal case of
galactocentric velocities with null uncertainties and no observational limitations, our method
recovers the correct shape of the DM potential with a success rate $S\gtrsim 89\%$ in axisymmetric
Galactic potentials, and $S > 96\%$ in the explored non-axisymmetric cases. The unsuccessful cases
yield axis ratios of the DM potential that are off by $\pm 0.1$. The success rate decreases with decreasing
sample size: for example, for a spherical DM halo, $S$ drops from $\sim 98\%$ to $\sim 38\%$ when the
sample size decreases from $\sim 800$ to $\sim 40$ HVSs. A robust determination of the shape of the
DM potential thus requires the measure of the galactocentric velocity of a few hundred genuine HVSs.

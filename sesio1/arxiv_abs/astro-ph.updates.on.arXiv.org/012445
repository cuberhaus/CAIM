We review the tools and procedures for the analysis of the data collected by X-ray photoelectric
gas polarimeters, like the ones on-board the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). Although
many of such tools are in principle common with polarimeters working at other energy bands, the peculiar
characteristics and performance of these devices require a specific approach. We will start from
the analysis of the raw data read-out from this kind of instruments, that is, the image of the track
of the photoelectron. We will briefly present how such images are processed with highly-specialized
algorithms to extract all the information collected by the instrument. These include energy, time
of arrival and, possibly, absorption point of the photon, in addition to the initial direction of
emission of the photoelectron. The last is the quantity relevant for polarimetry, and we will present
different methods to obtain the polarization degree and angle from it. A simple method, used extensively
especially during the development phase of X-ray photoelectric gas polarimeters, is based on the
construction and fitting of the azimuthal distribution of the photoelectrons. We will discuss
that there are several reasons to prefer an analysis based on Stokes parameters, especially when
one wants to analyze measurements of real, i.e., not laboratory, sources. These are quantities
commonly used at all wavelengths because they are additive, and then operations like background
subtraction or the application of calibration are trivial to apply. We will summarize how Stokes
parameters can be used to adapt current spectroscopy software based on forward folding fitting
to perform spectro-polarimetry. Moreover, we will derive how to properly associate the statistical
uncertainty on a polarimetry measurement and the relation with another statistical indicator,
which is in the minimum detectable polarization.

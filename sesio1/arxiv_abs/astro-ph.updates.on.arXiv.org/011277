We present ALMA observations of a small but statistically complete sample of twelve 250 micron selected
galaxies at $z=0.35$ designed to measure their dust submillimeter continuum emission as well as
their CO(1-0) and atomic carbon [CI](3P1-3P0) spectral lines. This is the first sample of galaxies
with global measures of all three $H_2$-mass tracers and which show star formation rates (4-26 Msun
yr$^{-1}$) and infra-red luminosities ($1-6\times10^{11}$ Lsun) typical of star forming galaxies
in their era. We find a surprising diversity of morphology and kinematic structure; one-third of
the sample have evidence for interaction with nearby smaller galaxies, several sources have disjoint
dust and gas morphology. Moreover two galaxies have very high $L_{CI}/L_{CO}$ ratios for their
global molecular gas reservoirs; if confirmed, such extreme intensity ratios in a sample of dust
selected, massive star forming galaxies presents a challenge to our understanding of ISM. Finally,
we use the emission of the three molecular gas tracers, to determine the carbon abundance, $X_{ci}$,
and CO-$\rm{H_2}$ conversion $\alpha_{co}$ in our sample, using a weak prior that the gas-to-dust
ratio is similar to that of the Milky Way for these massive and metal rich galaxies. Using a likelihood
method which simultaneously uses all three gas tracer measurements, we find mean values and errors
on the mean of $\alpha_{co}=3.0\pm0.5\,\rm{Msun\,(K\,kms^{-1}\,pc^2)^{-1}}$ and $X_{ci}=1.6\pm0.1\times
10^{-5}$ (or $\alpha_{ci}=18.8\,K kms^{-1}\,pc^2 (Msun)^{-1}$) and $\delta_{GDR}=128\pm16$
(or $\alpha_{850}=5.9\times10^{12}\,\rm{W\,Hz^{-1}\, Msun^{-1}}$), where our starting assumption
is that these metal rich galaxies have an average gas-to-dust ratio similar to that of the Milky Way
centered on $\delta_{GDR}=135$.

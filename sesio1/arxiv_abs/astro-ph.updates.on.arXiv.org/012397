The substructures observed in protoplanetary disks may be the signposts of embedded planets carving
gaps or creating vortices. The inferred masses of these planets often fall in the Jovian regime despite
their low abundance compared to lower-mass planets, partly because previous works often assume
that a single substructure (a gap or vortex) is caused by a single planet. In this work, we study the
possible imprints of compact systems composed of Neptune-like planets ($\sim10-30\;M_\oplus$)
and show that long-standing vortices are a prevalent outcome when their inter-planetary separation
($\Delta a$) falls below $\sim8$ times $H_{{\rm p}}$ -- the average disk's scale height at the planets
locations. In simulations where a single planet is unable to produce long-lived vortices, two-planet
systems can preserve them for at least $5,000$ orbits in two regimes: i) fully-shared density gaps
with elongated vortices around the stable Lagrange points $L_4$ and $L_5$ for the most compact planet
pairs ($\Delta a \lesssim 4.6\; H_{{\rm p}}$); ii) partially-shared gaps for more widely spaced
planets ($\Delta a \sim 4.6 - 8\;H_{{\rm p}}$) forming vortices in a density ring between the planets
through the Rossby wave instability. The latter case can produce vortices with a wide range of aspect
ratios down to $\sim3$ and can occur for planets captured into the 3:2 (2:1) mean-motion resonances
for disk's aspects ratios of $h\gtrsim 0.033$ ($h\gtrsim 0.057$). We suggest that their long lifetimes
are sustained by the interaction of spiral density waves launched by the neighboring planets. Overall,
our results show that distinguishing imprint of compact systems with Neptune-mass planets are
long-lived vortices inside the density gaps, which in turn are shallower than single-planet gaps
for a fixed gap width.

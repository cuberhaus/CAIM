We constrain the planetary atmospheric mass fraction at the time of the dispersal of the protoplanetary
disk and the evolution of the stellar rotation rate for a dozen multi-planet systems that host sub-Neptunes
and/or super-Earths. We employ a custom-developed Python code that we have dubbed Pasta (Planetary
Atmospheres and Stellar roTation rAtes), which runs within a Bayesian framework to model the atmospheric
evolution of exoplanets. The code combines MESA stellar evolutionary tracks, a model describing
planetary structures, a model relating stellar rotation and activity level, and a model predicting
planetary atmospheric mass-loss rates based on the results of hydrodynamic simulations. Through
a MCMC scheme, we retrieved the posterior PDFs of all considered parameters. For ages older than
about 2 Gyr, we find a median spin-down (i.e. $P(t)\propto t^y$) of $\bar{y}=0.38_{-0.27}^{+0.38}$,
indicating a rotation decay slightly slower than classical literature values ($\approx$0.5),
though still within $1\sigma$. At younger ages, we find a median spin-down (i.e. $P(t)\propto t^x$)
of $\bar{x}=0.26_{-0.19}^{+0.42}$, which is below what is observed in young open clusters, though
within $1\sigma$. However, these two results are likely due to a selection bias as the systems suitable
to be analysed by Pasta contain at least one planet with a hydrogen-dominated atmosphere, implying
that the host star has more likely evolved as a slow rotator. We further look for correlations between
the initial atmospheric mass fraction of the considered planets and system parameters, but without
finding any. The TESS, CHEOPS, and PLATO missions are going to be instrumental in identifying and
precisely measuring systems amenable to Pasta's analysis and can thus potentially constrain planet
formation and stellar evolution.

We present a detailed analysis of SN 2020qmp, a nearby type IIP core-collapse supernova (CCSN),
discovered by the Palomar Gattini-IR (PGIR) survey in the galaxy UGC07125. We illustrate how the
multiwavelength study of this event helps our general understanding of stellar progenitors and
circumstellar medium (CSM) interactions in CCSNe. We also highlight the importance of near-infrared
(NIR) surveys for early detections of SNe in dusty environments. SN 2020qmp displays characteristic
hydrogen lines in its optical spectra, as well as a plateau in its optical LC, hallmarks of a type IIP
SN. We do not detect linear polarization during the plateau phase, with a 3 sigma upper limit of 0.78%.
Through hydrodynamical LC modeling and an analysis of its nebular spectra, we estimate a progenitor
mass of around 11 solar masses, and an explosion energy of around 0.8e51 erg. We find that the spectral
energy distribution cannot be explained by a simple CSM interaction model, assuming a constant
shock velocity and steady mass-loss rate, and the excess X-ray luminosity compared with the synchrotron
radio luminosity suggests deviations from equipartition. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages
of NIR surveys over optical surveys for the detection of dust-obscured CCSNe in the local universe.
Specifically, our simulations show that the Wide-Field Infrared Transient Explorer will detect
about 14 more CCSNe out of 75 expected in its footprint within 40 Mpc, over five years than an optical
survey equivalent to the Zwicky Transient Facility would detect. We have determined or constrained
the main properties of SN 2020qmp and of its progenitor, highlighting the value of multiwavelength
follow-up observations of nearby CCSNe. We have also shown that forthcoming NIR surveys will finally
enable us to do a nearly complete census of CCSNe in the local universe.

A high spectral resolution investigation of diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) in the near-infrared
($YJ$ band) is conducted to test new methods, to confirm and improve existing parameters, and to
search for new DIBs. Methods: The CRyogenic high-resolution InfraRed Echelle Spectrograph (CRIRES)
on the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope was employed to obtain spectra of four
reddened background supergiant stars (HD 183143, HD 165784, HD 92207, HD 111613) and an unreddened
comparison star (HD 87737) at the highest resolution of $R \approx 100000$ currently achievable
at near-infrared wavelengths. The correction for telluric absorption was performed by a modelling
approach. Non-local thermodynamic equilibrium spectral modelling of available optical and the
new near-infrared spectra facilitated a comprehensive characterisation of the atmospheric properties
of the background stars. A more precise and accurate determination of the reddening law along the
sight lines could be achieved than feasible before by comparison of the observed and model spectral
energy distributions. For DIBs that overlap with stellar lines the DIB profile shapes could be recovered.
Results: Seventeen known near-infrared DIBs were confirmed, and 12 previously unknown and generally
weaker DIBs were identified in the $YJ$ band. Three DIBs that show uniform profiles along all sight
lines were identified, possibly connected to transitions from a common lower state of the same carrier.
The divergent extinction curve towards the frequently discussed DIB standard star HD 183143 could
be reproduced for the first time, requiring extra absorption by $\sim$3.5 mag due to polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to match the ultraviolet extinction bump. This extra absorption
probably stems from a circumstellar bubble lying in front of the star which is intersected tangentially
by the line of sight.

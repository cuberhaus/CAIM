We present a study of the current state of knowledge concerning spacecraft operations and potential
hazards while operating near a comet nucleus. Starting from simple calculations comparing the
cometary coma environment to benign conditions on Earth, we progress to sophisticated engineering
models of spacecraft behavior, and then confront these models with recent spacecraft proximity
operations experience. Finally, we make recommendations from lessons learned for future spacecraft
missions that enter into orbit around a comet for long-term operations. All of these considerations
indicate that, with a proper spacecraft design and operations planning, the near-nucleus environment
can be a relatively safe region in which to operate, even for an active short period comet near perihelion
with gas production rates as high as 1e29 molecules/s. With gas densities similar to those found
in good laboratory vacuums, dust densities similar to Class 100 cleanrooms, dust particle velocities
of 10s of m/s, and microgravity forces that permit slow and deliberate operations, the conditions
around a comet are generally more benign than a typical day on Mars. Even in strong dust jets near the
nucleus surface, dust densities tend to be only a few grains/cm3, about the same as in a typical interior
room on Earth. Stochastic forces on a modern spacecraft with tens of square meters of projected surface
area can be accounted for using modern Attitude Control Systems to within tens of meters navigation
error; surface contamination issues are only important for spacecraft spending months to years
within a few kilometers of the nucleus surface; and the issues the Rosetta spacecraft faced, confusion
of celestial star trackers by sunlit dust particles flying past the spacecraft, will be addressed
using the next generation of star trackers implementing improved transient rejection algorithms.

Reliable extraction of cosmological information from observed cosmic microwave background (CMB)
maps requires accurate removal of foreground components. Since some regions of the sky are inevitably
contaminated by strong foreground signals, it may be desired to excise such strongly contaminated
regions even after a foreground subtraction has been performed. We employ an artificial neural
network (ANN) to predict the full sky CMB angular power spectrum from the partial sky spectrum obtained
from masked CMB anisotropy map, at a high pixel resolution. We use a simple ANN with one hidden layer
containing $895$ neurons. Using $1.2 \times 10^{5}$ training samples of full sky and corresponding
partial sky spectra at Healpix pixel resolution parameter $N_{side} = 256$, we show that predicted
spectrum by our ANN agrees well with the target spectrum at each realization for the multipole range
$2 \leq l \leq 512$. The predicted spectra are statistically unbiased and they preserve the cosmic
variance accurately. Statistically, the differences between the mean predicted and underlying
theoretical spectra are within $3\sigma$. Moreover, the probability densities obtained from
predicted spectra agree very well with those obtained from actual full sky spectra for each multipole.
Equally interesting is that the correlation matrix calculated from predicted spectra does not
show any signature of correlation between the spectrum of different multipoles. Our work shows
that the predicted spectra do not need to be binned even at high resolution to rid of correlations
due to mode-mode coupling introduced on the partial sky since the ANN learns to effectively recover
the lost information due to sky cut. The excellent agreement of statistical properties between
the predicted and the ground-truth demonstrates the importance of using artificial intelligence
systems in cosmological analysis more widely.

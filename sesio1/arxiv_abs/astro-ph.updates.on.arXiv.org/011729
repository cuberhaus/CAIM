We know little about the outermost exoplanets in planetary systems, because our detection methods
are insensitive to moderate-mass planets on wide orbits. However, debris discs can probe the outer-planet
population, because dynamical modelling of observed discs can reveal properties of perturbing
planets. We use four sculpting and stirring arguments to infer planet properties in 178 debris-disc
systems from the ISPY, LEECH and LIStEN planet-hunting surveys. Similar analyses are often conducted
for individual discs, but we consider a large sample in a consistent manner. We aim to predict the
population of wide-separation planets, gain insight into the formation and evolution histories
of planetary systems, and determine the feasibility of detecting these planets in the near future.
We show that a `typical' cold debris disc likely requires a Neptune- to Saturn-mass planet at 10-100
au, with some needing Jupiter-mass perturbers. Our predicted planets are currently undetectable,
but modest detection-limit improvements (e.g. from JWST) should reveal many such perturbers.
We find that planets thought to be perturbing debris discs at late times are similar to those inferred
to be forming in protoplanetary discs, so these could be the same population if newly formed planets
do not migrate as far as currently thought. Alternatively, young planets could rapidly sculpt debris
before migrating inwards, meaning that the responsible planets are more massive (and located further
inwards) than debris-disc studies assume. We combine self-stirring and size-distribution modelling
to show that many debris discs cannot be self-stirred without having unreasonably high masses;
planet- or companion-stirring may therefore be the dominant mechanism in many (perhaps all) debris
discs. Finally, we provide catalogues of planet predictions, and identify promising targets for
future planet searches.

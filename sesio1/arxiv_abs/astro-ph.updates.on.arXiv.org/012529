In this work we present the results of our analysis of 16,300 medium-resolution LAMOST spectra of
late-type stars in the Kepler field with the aim of determining the stellar parameters, activity
level, lithium atmospheric content, and binarity. We have used a version of the code ROTFIT specifically
developed for these spectra. We provide a catalog with the atmospheric parameters (Teff, log(g),
and [Fe/H]), radial velocity (RV), and projected rotation velocity (vsini). For cool stars (Teff
< 6500 K), we also calculated the H-alpha and LiI-6708 equivalent width, which are important indicators
of chromospheric activity and evolutionary stage, respectively. We have derived the RV and atmospheric
parameters for 14,300 spectra of 7443 stars. Literature data were used for a quality control of the
results. The Teff and log(g) values are in good agreement with the literature. The [Fe/H] values
appear to be overestimated for metal-poor stars. We propose a relation to correct the [Fe/H] values
derived with ROTFIT. We were able to identify double-lined binaries, stars with variable RVs, lithium-rich
giants, and emission-line objects. Based on the H-alpha flux, we found 327 active stars. We detected
the LiI-6708 line and measure its equivalent width for 1657 stars, both giants and stars on the main
sequence. Regarding the latter, we performed a discrete age classification based on the atmospheric
lithium abundance and the upper envelopes of a few open clusters. Among the giants, we found 195 Li-rich
stars, 161 of which are reported here for the first time. No relationship is found between stellar
rotation and lithium abundance, which allows us to rule out merger scenarios as the predominant
explanation of the enrichment of Li in our sample. The fraction of Li-rich giants, about 4%, is higher
than expected.

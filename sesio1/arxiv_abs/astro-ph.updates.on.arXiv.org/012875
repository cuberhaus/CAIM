Our goal is to characterise the physical properties of the metal-poor brown dwarf population. In
particular, we focus on the recently discovered peculiar dwarf WISE J1810055$-$1010023. We collected
optical iz and near-infrared J-band imaging on multiple occasions over 1.5 years to derive accurate
trigonometric parallax and proper motion of the metal-depleted ultra-cool dwarf candidate WISE1810.
We also acquired low-resolution optical spectroscopy (0.6$-$1.0 $\mu$m) and new infrared (0.9$-$1.3
$\mu$m) spectra of WISE1810 that were combined with our photometry, other existing data from the
literature and our trigonometric distance to determine the object's luminosity from the integration
of the observed spectral energy distribution covering from 0.6 through 16$\mu$m. We compared the
full optical and infrared spectrum with state-of-the-art atmosphere models to further constrain
its effective temperature, surface gravity and metallicity. WISE1810 is detected in the $iz$ bands
with AB magnitudes of $i$=23.871$\pm$0.104 and $z$=20.147$\pm$0.083 mag in the PanSTARRS system.
It does not show any obvious photometric variability beyond 0.1$-$0.2 mag in any of the $z$- and $J$-band
filters. The very red $z-J \approx 2.9$ mag colour is compatible with an ultra-cool dwarf nature.
Fitting for parallax and proper motion, we measure a trigonometric parallax of 112.5$^{+8.1}_{-8.0}$
mas for WISE1810, placing the object at only 8.9$^{+0.7}_{-0.6}$ pc, about three times closer than
previously thought. We employed Monte Carlo methods to estimate the error on the parallax and proper
motion. The object's luminosity was determined at log$L/L_\odot$=$-$5.78$\pm$0.11 dex. From
the comparison to atmospheric models, we infer a likely metallicity of [Fe/H] $\approx -1.5$ and
an effective temperature cooler than 1000K. Abridged

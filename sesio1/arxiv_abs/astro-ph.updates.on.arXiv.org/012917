(abridged) Context: Late-type stars such as the Sun rotate differentially due to the interaction
of turbulent convection and rotation. Aims: The aim of the study is to investigate the effects of
the thermal Prandtl number on the transition from anti-solar (slow equator, fast poles) to solar-like
(fast equator, slow poles) differential rotation. Methods: Three-dimensional hydrodynamic
and magnetohydrodynamic simulations in semi-global spherical wedge geometry are used to model
convection zones of solar-like stars. Results: The overall convective velocity amplitude increases
as the Prandtl number decreases in accordance with earlier studies. The transition from anti-solar
to solar-like differential rotation is insensitive to the Prandtl number for Prandtl numbers below
unity but for Prandtl numbers greater than unity, solar-like differential rotation becomes significantly
harder to excite. Magnetic fields and more turbulent regimes with higher fluid and magnetic Reynolds
numbers help in achieving solar-like differential rotation in near-transition cases. Solar-like
differential rotation occurs only in cases with radially outward angular momentum transport at
the equator. The dominant contribution to such outward transport near the equator is due to prograde
propagating thermal Rossby waves. Conclusions: The differential rotation is sensitive to the
Prandtl number only for large Prandtl numbers in the parameter regime explored in the current study.
Magnetic fields have a greater effect on the differential rotation, although the inferred presence
of a small-scale dynamo does not lead to drastically different results in the present study. The
dominance of the thermal Rossby waves in the simulations is puzzling given the non-detection in
the Sun. The current simulations are shown to be incompatible with the currently prevailing mean-field
theory of differential rotation.

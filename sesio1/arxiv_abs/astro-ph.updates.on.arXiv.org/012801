The circumgalactic medium (CGM) is the location where the interplay between large-scale outflows
and accretion onto galaxies occurs. Metals in different ionization states flowing between the
circumgalactic and intergalactic mediums are affected by large galactic outflows and low-ionization
state inflowing gas. Observational studies on their spatial distribution and their relation with
galaxy properties may provide important constraints on models of galaxy formation and evolution.
To provide new insights into the spatial distribution of the circumgalactic of star-forming galaxies,
we select a sample of 238 close pairs at $1.5 < z <4.5$ ($\langle z\rangle\sim$2.6) from the VIMOS
Ultra Deep Survey. We then generate composite spectra by co-adding spectra of $background$ galaxies
that provide different sight-lines across the CGM to examine the spatial distribution of the gas
located around these galaxies and investigate possible correlations between the strength of the
low- and high-ionization absorption features with different galaxy properties. We detect C II,
Si II, Si IV and C IV) up to separations $\langle b \rangle=$ 172 kpc and 146 kpc. Our $W_{0}$ radial
profiles suggest a potential redshift evolution for the CGM gas content producing these absorptions.
We find a correlation between C II and C IV with star formation rate, stellar mass and trends with galaxy
size estimated by the effective radius and azimuthal angle. Galaxies with high star formation rate
show stronger C IV absorptions compared with star-forming galaxies with low SFR and low stellar
mass. These results could be explained by stronger outflows, softer radiation fields unable to
ionize high-ionization state lines or by the galactic fountain scenario where metal-rich gas ejected
from previous star-formation episodes fall back to the galaxy.

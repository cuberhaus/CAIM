In the disks of spiral galaxies, diffuse soft X-ray emission is known to be strongly correlated with
star-forming regions. However, this emission is not simply from a thermal-equilibrium plasma
and its origin remains greatly unclear. In this work, we present an X-ray spectroscopic analysis
of the emission from a star-forming enhanced region off the nucleus of the spiral galaxy M51, named
as the northern hot spot (NHS) hereafter. We analyze the high spectral resolution data from XMM-Newton/RGS
observations and unambiguously detect an abnormally high G-ratio ($3.2^{+6.9}_{-1.5}$) of the
O VII K$\alpha$ triplet emission from the NHS, which is spatially confirmed by oxygen emission line
maps from the RGS data. A physical model consisting of a thermal plasma and its charge exchange (CX)
with cold gas gives an excellent description of the high G-ratio and the entire RGS spectra. Complementary
to the RGS data, the Chandra/ACIS-S data are also analyzed because its high spatial resolution is
beneficial for decomposing the diffuse and discrete source contributions. Its imaging spectra
of the diffuse emission either from the NHS or other parts of the M51 disk can be well interpreted by
the same physical model. Though the surface brightness of the diffuse emission from the NHS is about
twice that from other parts of the disk, the hot plasma has the similar temperature of ~0.34 keV and
approximately solar metallicity. For both parts of the disk, the CX contributes ~50% to the diffuse
soft X-ray emission in the 7-30 angstrom band, and has an interface area of about five times the geometric
area of the M51 disk. Our results suggest that the hot plasma can interact with the cold interstellar
medium efficiently, and have strong implications for our understanding of soft X-ray emission
as a tracer of the stellar feedback in active star-forming galaxies.

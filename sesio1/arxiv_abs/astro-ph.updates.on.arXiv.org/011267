We present \textsc{Magrathea-Pathfinder}, a ray-tracing framework which accurately reconstructs
the past light-cone of an observer in numerical simulations. Our code directly computes the 3D trajectory
of light rays through the null geodesic equations, with the weak-field limit as its only approximation.
Therefore, it does not rely on any other standard ray-tracing approximations such as plane-parallel,
Born or multiple-lens. \textsc{Magrathea-Pathfinder} fully takes advantage of the small-scale
clustering of matter by using adaptive integration steps and interpolation within an Adaptive-Mesh
Refinement (AMR) structure to accurately account for the non-linear regime of structure formation.
It uses MPI parallelization, C\texttt{++}11 \texttt{std::thread} multithreading, and is optimised
for High-Performance Computing (HPC) as a post-processing tool for very large $N$-body simulations.
In this paper, we describe how to produce realistic cosmological observables from numerical simulation
using ray-tracing techniques, in particular the production of simulated catalogues and maps which
accounts for all the effects at first order in metric perturbations (such as peculiar velocities,
gravitational potential, Integrated Sachs-Wolfe, time delay, gravitational lensing, etc\ldots).
We perform convergence tests of our gravitational lensing algorithms and conduct performance
tests of the null geodesic integration procedures. \textsc{Magrathea-Pathfinder} provides
sophisticated ray-tracing tools to make the link between real space ($N$-body simulations) and
light-cone observables. This should be useful to refine existing cosmological probes and to build
new ones beyond standard assumptions in order to prepare for next-generation large-scale structure
surveys.

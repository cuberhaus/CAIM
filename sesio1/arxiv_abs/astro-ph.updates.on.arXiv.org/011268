General Relativistic effects on the clustering of matter in the universe provide a sensitive probe
of cosmology and gravity theories that can be tested with the upcoming generation of galaxy surveys.
Here, we present a suite of large volume high-resolution N-body simulations specifically designed
to generate light-cone data for the study of relativistic effects on lensing-matter observables.
RayGalGroupSims (or in short RayGal) consists of two N-body simulations of $(2625\,h^{-1}\,{\rm
Mpc})^3$ volume with $4096^3$ particles of a standard flat $\Lambda$CDM model and a non-standard
$w$CDM phantom dark energy model. Light-cone data from the simulations have been generated using
a parallel ray-tracing algorithm that has accurately solved billion geodesic equations. Catalogues
and maps with relativistic weak-lensing which include post-Born effects, magnification bias
(MB) and redshift space distortions (RSD) due to gravitational redshift, Doppler, transverse
Doppler, Integrated Sachs-Wolfe/Rees-Sciama effects, are publicly released. Using this dataset,
we are able to reproduce the linear and quasi-linear predictions from the Class relativistic code
for the 10 (cross-)power spectra (3$\times$2 points) of the matter density fluctuation field and
the gravitational convergence at $z=0.7$ and $z=1.8$. We find 1-30\% level contribution from both
MB and RSD to the matter power spectrum, while the Fingers-of-God effect is visible at lower redshift
in the non-linear regime. MB contributes at the $10-30\%$ level to the convergence power spectrum
leading to a deviation between the shear power-spectrum and the convergence power-spectrum. MB
also plays a significant role in the galaxy-galaxy lensing by decreasing the density-convergence
spectra by $20\%$, while coupling non-trivial configurations (such as the one with the convergence
at the same or even lower redshift than the density field).

Although first considered as too diluted for the formation of molecules in-situ and too harsh an
environment for their survival, the interstellar medium has turned out to host a rich palette of
molecular species: to date, 256 species have been identified. The last decade has seen an explosion
of new detections, including those of a number of complex organic species, which may be dubbed as
prebiotic. Organic molecules have been discovered not just in interstellar clouds from the Solar
neighbourhood, but also throughout the Milky-Way, as well as in nearby galaxies, or some of the most
distant quasars. These discoveries were made possible by the completion of large sub-millimetre
and radio facilities. Equipped with new generation receivers, those instruments have provided
the orders of magnitude leap in sensitivity required to detect the weak rotational lines that allowed
the molecule identifications. Last two years, 30 prebiotic molecules have been detected in TMC-1,
a dust-enshrouded gaseous cloud located at 400 light-years from the Sun in the Taurus constellation.
Ten new molecular species, have been identified in the arm of a spiral galaxy 6 billion light-yr distant,
and 12 molecular species observed in a quasar at 11 billion light-yr. We present the latest spectral
observations of this outlying quasar and discuss the implications of those detections in these
3 archetypal sources. The basic ingredients involved in the Miller-Urey experiment and related
experiments appeared early after the formation of the first galaxies and are widespread throughout
the Universe. The chemical composition of the gas in distant galaxies seems not much different from
that in the nearby interstellar clouds. It presumably comprises, like for TMC-1, aromatic rings
and complex organic molecules putative precursors of the RNA nucleobases, except the lines of such
species are too weak to be detected that far.

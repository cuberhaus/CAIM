Context: R Coronae Borealis (RCB) variables and their non-variable counterparts, the dustless
Hydrogen-Deficient Carbon (dLHdC) stars have been known to exhibit enhanced s-processed material
on their surfaces, especially Sr, Y, and Ba. No comprehensive work has been done to explore the s-process
in these types of stars, however one particular RCB star, U Aqr, has been under scrutiny for its extraordinary
Sr enhancement. Aims: We aim to identify RCB and dLHdC stars that have significantly enhanced Sr
abundances, such as U Aqr, and use stellar evolution models to begin to estimate the type of neutron
exposure that occurs in a typical HdC star. Methods: We compare the strength of the Sr II 4077 $\AA$
spectral line to Ca II H to identify the new subclass of Sr-rich HdCs. We additionally use the structural
and abundance information from existing RCB MESA models to calculate the neutron exposure parameter,
$\tau$ Results: We identify six stars in the Sr-rich class. Two are RCBs, and four are dLHdCs. We additionally
find that the preferred RCB MESA model has a neutron exposure $\tau$ ~ 0.1 mb$^{-1}$, which is lower
than the estimated $\tau$ between 0.15 and 0.6 mb$^{-1}$ for the Sr-rich star U Aqr found in the literature.
We find trends in the neutron exposure corresponding to He-burning shell temperature, metallicity,
and assumed s-processing site. Conclusions: We have found a sub-class of 6 HdCs known as the Sr-rich
class, which tend to lie in the halo, outside the typical distribution of RCBs and dLHdCs. We find
that dLHdC stars are more likely to be Sr-rich than RCBs, with an occurrence rate of ~13\% for dLHdCs
and ~2\% for RCBs. This is one of the first potential spectroscopic differences between RCBs and
dLHdCs, along with dLHdCs having stronger surface abundances of $^{18}$O.

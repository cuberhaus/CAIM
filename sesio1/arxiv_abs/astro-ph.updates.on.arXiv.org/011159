We obtained an axi-symmetric model for the large-scale distribution of stars and dust in the Milky
Way (MW) using a radiative transfer code that can account for the existing near-infrared (NIR)/mid-infrared/submm
all-sky emission maps of our Galaxy. We find that the MW has a star-formation rate of ${ SFR}=1.25\pm0.2\,{
M}_{\odot}$/yr, a stellar mass $M_{*}=(4.9\pm 0.3)\times10^{10}\,{ M}_{\odot}$, and a specific
SFR that is relatively constant with radius (except for the inner 1 kpc). We identified an inner radius
$R_{ in}= 4.5$\,kpc beyond which the stellar emissivity and dust distribution fall exponentially.
For $R<R_{ in}$ the emissivities fall linearly towards the centre. The old stellar populations
in the disk have an exponential scalelength that increases monotonically from $h_{ s}^{ disk}(K)=2.2\pm
0.6$\,kpc in the NIR, to $h_{ s}^{ disk}(B)=3.2\pm 0.9$\,kpc at the shorter optical bands, and a
scaleheight that varies with radial distance, from $z_{ s}^{ disk}(0)=140\pm 20$\,pc in the centre
to $z_{ s}^{ disk}(R_{\odot})=300\pm 20$\,pc at the solar radius. The young stellar populations
have a scalelength of $h_{ s}^{ tdisk}=3.2\pm 0.9$\,kpc and a scaleheight that varies from $z_{
s}^{ tdisk}(0)=50\pm 10$\,pc in the centre to $z_{ s}^{ tdisk}(R_{\odot})=90\pm 10$\,pc at the
solar radius. We discovered an inner stellar disk within the central 4.5 kpc, which we associate
with the extended long bar of the MW. Most of the obscured star formation happens within this inner
thin disk. The diffuse dust is mainly distributed in a disk with scalelength $h_{ d}^{ disk}=5.2\pm
0.8$\,kpc and scaleheight $z_{ d}^{ disk}=0.14\pm 0.02$\,kpc. We give the first derivation of
the MW attenuation curve and present it as a functional fit to the model data. We find the MW to lie in
the Green Valley of the main sequence relation for spiral galaxies.

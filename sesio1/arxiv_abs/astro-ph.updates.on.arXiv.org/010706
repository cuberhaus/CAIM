We present the characteristics of DH type II bursts for the Solar Cycles 23 and 24. The bursts are classified
according to their end frequencies into three categories, i.e. Low Frequency Group (LFG; 20 kHz
$\leq$ $f$ $\leq$ 200 kHz), Medium Frequency Group (MFG; 200 kHz $<$ $f$ $\leq$ 1 MHz), and High Frequency
Group (HFG; 1 MHz $<$ $f$ $\le$ 16 MHz). We find that the sources for LFG, MFG, and HFG events are homogeneously
distributed over the active region belt. Our analysis shows a drastic reduction of the DH type II
events during Solar Cycle 24 which includes only 35% of the total events (i.e. 179 out of 514). Despite
having smaller number of DH type II events in the Solar Cycle 24, it contains a significantly higher
fraction of LFG events compared to the previous cycle (32% $versus$ 24%). However, within the LFG
group the cycle 23 exhibits significant dominance of type II bursts that extend below 50 kHz, suggesting
rich population of powerful CMEs travelling beyond half of the Sun-Earth distance. The events of
LFG group display strongest association with faster and wider (more than 82% events are halo) CMEs
while at the source location they predominantly trigger large M/X class flares (in more than 83%
cases). Our analysis also indicates that CME initial speed or flare energetics are partly related
with the duration of type II burst and that survival of CME associated shock is determined by multiple
factors/parameters related to CMEs, flares, and state of coronal and interplanetary medium. The
profiles relating CME heights with respect to the end frequencies of DH type II bursts suggest that
for HFG and MFG categories, the location for majority of CMEs ($\approx$65%-70%) is in well compliance
with ten-fold Leblanc coronal density model, while for LFG events a lower value of density multiplier
($\approx$3) seems to be compatible.

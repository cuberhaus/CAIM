The separable analytical solution in standard perturbation theory for an Einstein de Sitter (EdS)
universe can be generalized to the wider class of such cosmologies ("generalized EdS", or gEdS)
in which a fraction of the pressure-less fluid does not cluster. We derive the corresponding kernels
in both Eulerian perturbation theory (EPT) and Lagrangian perturbation theory, generalizing
the canonical EdS expressions to a one parameter family where the parameter can be taken to be the
exponent $\alpha$ of the growing mode linear amplification $D(a) \propto a^{\alpha}$. Calculating
the power spectrum (PS) at one loop in EPT, we find that the expected condition for infra-red convergence
of the $\alpha$-dependent terms is recovered for each of the two contributing integrals ( `22' and
`13' terms) separately i.e. without a requirement of cancellation of divergences between integrals.
The conditions on the PS for ultraviolet convergence are the same as for $\alpha=1$, except at a specific
value ($\alpha \approx 0.16$) where the coefficient of the leading divergent contribution vanishes.
In the second part of the paper we show that the calculation of cosmology dependent corrections in
perturbation theory in standard (e.g. LCDM-like) models can be considerably simplified, and their
magnitude and parameter dependence better understood, by relating them to our analytic results
for gEdS models. At second order in perturbation theory results at each redshift $z$ can be mapped
exactly to a gEdS model with an effective growth exponent, $\alpha_2(z)$, determined by the cosmological
parameters. For the PS at loop order, which requires going to third order, such a mapping is not exact
but provides a very good approximation. We provide simplified expressions for the cosmological
corrections to the PS in terms of only two redshift dependent functions and four infra-red safe integrals.

A recent study suggests that the observed multiplicity of super-Earth (SE) systems is correlated
with stellar overdensities: field stars in high phase-space density environments have an excess
of single-planet systems compared to stars in low density fields. This correlation is puzzling
as stellar clustering is expected to influence mostly the outer part of planetary systems. Here
we examine the possibility that stellar flybys indirectly excite the mutual inclinations of initially
coplanar SEs, breaking their co-transiting geometry. We propose that flybys excite the inclinations
of exterior substellar companions, which then propagate the perturbation to the inner SEs. Using
analytical calculations of the secular coupling between SEs and companions, together with numerical
simulations of stellar encounters, we estimate the expected number of "effective" flybys per planetary
system that lead to the destruction of the SE co-transiting geometry. Our analytical results can
be rescaled easily for various SE and companion properties (masses and semi-major axes) and stellar
cluster parameters (density, velocity dispersion and lifetime). We show that for a given SE system,
there exists an optimal companion architecture that leads to the maximum number of effective flybys;
this results from the trade-off between the flyby cross section and the companion's impact on the
inner system. Subject to uncertainties in the cluster parameters, we conclude that this mechanism
is inefficient if the SE system has a single exterior companion, but may play an important role in
"SE + two companions" systems that were born in dense stellar clusters. Whether this effect causes
the observed correlation between planet multiplicity and stellar overdensities remains to be
confirmed.

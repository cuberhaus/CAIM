The cold dark matter (CDM) scenario predicts that galactic halos should host a huge amount of subhalos
possibly lighter than planets, depending on the nature of dark matter. Predicting their abundance
and distribution has important implications for dark matter searches and searches for subhalos
themselves, as they could provide a decisive test of the CDM paradigm. A major difficulty in subhalo
population model building is to account for the gravitational stripping induced by baryons, which
strongly impact on the overall dynamics inside galaxies. In this paper, we focus on these "baryonic"
tides from analytical perspectives, summarizing previous work on galactic disk shocking, and
thoroughly revisiting the impact of individual encounters with stars. For the latter, we go beyond
the reference calculation of Gerhard and Fall (1983) to deal with penetrative encounters, and provide
new analytical results. Based upon a full statistical analysis of subhalo energy change during
multiple stellar encounters possibly occurring during disk crossing, we show that subhalos lighter
than $\sim 1$~M$_\odot$ are very efficiently pruned by stellar encounters. This modifies their
mass function in a stellar environment. In contrast, disk shocking is more efficient at pruning
massive subhalos. In short, if reasonably resilient, subhalos surviving disk crossing have lost
all their mass but an inner cuspy part, with a tidal mass function strongly departing from the cosmological
one. If fragile, stellar encounters make their number density drop by an additional order of magnitude
with respect to disk-shocking effects only (e.g., at the solar position in the Milky Way). Our results
can be incorporated to any analytical or numerical subhalo population model, as we show for illustration.
This study complements those based on cosmological simulations, which cannot resolve dark matter
subhalos on such small scales.

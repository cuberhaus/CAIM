This work characterises the sky localization and early warning performance of networks of third
generation gravitational wave detectors, consisting of different combinations of detectors
with either the Einstein Telescope or Cosmic Explorer configuration in sites in North America,
Europe and Australia. Using a Fisher matrix method which includes the effect of earth rotation,
we estimate the sky localization uncertainty for $1.4\text{M}\odot$-$1.4\text{M}\odot$ binary
neutron star mergers at distances $40\text{Mpc}$, $200\text{Mpc}$, $400\text{Mpc}$, $800\text{Mpc}$,
$1600\text{Mpc}$, and an assumed astrophysical population up to redshift of 2 to characterize
its performance for binary neutron star observations. We find that, for binary neutron star mergers
at $200\text{Mpc}$ and a network consisting of the Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer and an extra
Einstein Telescope-like detector in Australia(2ET1CE), the upper limit of the size of the 90% credible
region for the best localized 90% signals is $0.25\text{deg}^2$. For the simulated astrophysical
distribution, this upper limit is $91.79\text{deg}^2$. If the Einstein Telescope-like detector
in Australia is replaced with a Cosmic Explorer-like detector(1ET2CE), for $200\text{Mpc}$ case,
the upper limit is $0.18\text{deg}^2$, while for astrophysical distribution, it is $56.77\text{deg}^2$.
We note that the 1ET2CE network can detect 7.2% more of the simulated astrophysical population than
the 2ET1CE network. In terms of early warning performance, we find that a network of 2ET1CE and 1ET2CE
networks can both provide early warnings of the order of 1 hour prior to merger with sky localization
uncertainties of 30 square degrees or less. Our study concludes that the 1ET2CE network is a good
compromise between binary neutron stars detection rate, sky localization and early warning capabilities.

The prospect of combining integral field spectroscopy with the solar gravitational lens (SGL)
to spectrally and spatially resolve the surfaces and atmospheres of extrasolar planets is investigated.
The properties of hyperbolic orbits visiting the focal region of the SGL are calculated analytically,
demonstrating trade offs between departure velocity and time of arrival, as well as gravity assist
maneuvers and heliocentric angular velocity. Numerical integration of the solar barycentric
motion demonstrates that navigational acceleration of $\textrm{d}v \lesssim 80 \frac{\textrm{m}}{\textrm{s}}
+ 6.7 \frac{\textrm{m}}{\textrm{s}} \frac{t}{\textrm{year}}$ is needed to obtain and maintain
alignment. Obtaining target ephemerides of sufficient precision is an open problem. The optical
properties of an oblate gravitational lens are reviewed, including calculations of the magnification
and the point-spread function that forms inside a telescope. Image formation for extended, incoherent
sources is discussed when the projected image is smaller than, approximately equal to, and larger
than the critical caustic. Sources of contamination which limit observational SNR are considered
in detail, including the sun, the solar corona, the host star, and potential background objects.
A noise mitigation strategy of spectrally and spatially separating the light using integral field
spectroscopy is emphasized. A pseudoinverse-based image reconstruction scheme demonstrates
that direct reconstruction of an Earth-like source from \textit{single} measurements of the Einstein
ring is possible when the critical caustic and observed SNR are sufficiently large. In this arrangement,
a mission would not require multiple telescopes or navigational symmetry breaking, enabling continuous
monitoring of the atmospheric composition and dynamics on other planets.

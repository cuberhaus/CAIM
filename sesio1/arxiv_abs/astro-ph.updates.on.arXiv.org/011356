Models of the zodiacal cloud's thermal emission and sporadic meteoroids suggest Jupiter-family
comets (JFCs) as the dominant source of interplanetary dust. However, comet sublimation is insufficient
to sustain the quantity of dust presently in the inner solar system, suggesting that spontaneous
disruptions of JFCs may supply the zodiacal cloud. We present a model for the dust produced in comet
fragmentations and its evolution. Using results from dynamical simulations, the model follows
individual comets drawn from a size distribution as they evolve and undergo recurrent splitting
events. The resulting dust is followed with a kinetic model which accounts for the effects of collisional
evolution, Poynting-Robertson drag, and radiation pressure. This allows to model the evolution
of both the size distribution and radial profile of dust, and we demonstrate the importance of including
collisions (both as a source and sink of dust) in zodiacal cloud models. With physically-motivated
free parameters this model provides a good fit to zodiacal cloud observables, supporting comet
fragmentation as the plausibly dominant dust source. The model implies that dust in the present
zodiacal cloud likely originated primarily from disruptions of $\sim$ 50 km comets, since larger
comets are ejected before losing all their mass. Thus much of the dust seen today was likely deposited
as larger grains $\sim$ 0.1 Myr in the past. The model also finds the dust level to vary stochastically;
e.g., every $\sim$ 50 Myr large (>100 km) comets with long dynamical lifetimes inside Jupiter cause
dust spikes with order of magnitude increases in zodiacal light brightness lasting $\sim$ 1 Myr.
If exozodiacal dust is cometary in origin, our model suggests it should be similarly variable.

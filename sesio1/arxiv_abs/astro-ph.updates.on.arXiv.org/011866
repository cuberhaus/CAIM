Clouds play a major role in Earth's energy budget and hydrological cycle. Clouds dynamical structure
and mixing with the ambient air have a large impact on their vertical mass and energy fluxes and on
precipitation. Most of the cloud evolution and mixing occurs at scales smaller than presently observable
from geostationary orbit, which is less than 1 km. A satellite mission is planned for bridging this
gap, named "Cluster for Cloud evolution, ClImatE and Lightning" (C3IEL). The mission is a collaboration
between the Israeli (ISA) and French (CNES) space agencies, which is presently at the end of its Phase
A. The planned mission will be constituted of a constellation of 2 to 3 nanosatellites in a sun synchronous
early afternoon polar orbit, which will take multi-stereoscopic images of the field of view during
an overpass. C3IEL will carry 3 instruments: (1) CLOUD visible imager at a spatial resolution of
20 m. The multi-stereoscopic reconstruction of the evolution of cloud envelops at a resolution
better than 100 m and velocity of few m/s will provide an unprecedented information on the clouds
dynamics and evolution. (2) WATER VAPOR imagers at 3 wavebands with different vapor absorption
will provide vertically integrated water vapor around the cloud and possibly a 3-dimensional structure
of the vapor around the clouds due to their mixing and evaporation with the ambient air. (3) Lightning
Optical Imagers and Photometers (LOIP). The lightning sensors will provide a link between cloud
dynamics and electrification at higher spatial resolution than previously available. C3IEL will
provide presently missing observational evidence for the role of clouds at sub-km scale in redistributing
the energy and water in the atmosphere, and of the relation between storm vigor and frequency of lightning
activity.

We derived radial velocities and CaT metallicity of more than 150 red giants stars in six SMC star
clusters and their surrounding fields, with the instrument GMOS on GEMINI-S. The mean cluster radial
velocity and metallicity were obtained with mean errors of 2.2 km\,s$^{-1}$ and 0.03 dex, while
the mean field metallicities have a mean error of 0.13 dex. We add this information to that available
for another 51 clusters and 30 fields with CaT metallicities on the same scale. Using this expanded
sample we analize the chemical properties of the SMC Main Body, defined as the inner 3.4 degrees in
semimajor axis. We found a high probability that the metallicity distribution of the Main Body clusters
is bimodal with a metal-rich and a metal-poor cluster group, having mean metallicities with a dispersion
of $\mu = -0.80$, $\sigma = 0.06$ and $\mu = -1.15$, $\sigma = 0.10$ dex, respectively. On the other
hand, Main Body field stars show a unimodal metallicity distribution peaking at $[Fe/H] \sim -1$
and dispersion of $0.3$. Neither metal-rich nor metal-poor clusters present a metallicity gradient.
However the full Main Body cluster sample and field stars have a negative metallicity gradient consistent
with each other, but the one corresponding to clusters has a large error due to the large metallicity
dispersion present in the clusters studied in that region. Metal-rich clusters present a clear
age-metallicity relation, while metal-poor clusters present no chemical enrichment throughout
the life of the galaxy. We present observational evidence that the chemical enrichment is complex
in the SMC Main Body. Two cluster groups with potential different origins could be coexisting in
the Main Body. More data with precise and homogeneous metallicities and distances are needed and
dynamical simulations are required to understand possible different origins for the two possible
cluster groups.

Continued observations of the Double Pulsar, PSR J0737-3039A/B, consisting of two radio pulsars
(A and B) that orbit each other with a period of 2.45hr in a mildly eccentric (e=0.088) binary system,
have led to large improvements in the measurement of relativistic effects in this system. With a
16-yr data span, the results enable precision tests of theories of gravity for strongly self-gravitating
bodies and also reveal new relativistic effects that have been expected but are now observed for
the first time. These include effects of light propagation in strong gravitational fields which
are currently not testable by any other method. We observe retardation and aberrational light-bending
that allow determination of the pulsar's spin direction. In total, we have detected seven post-Keplerian
(PK) parameters, more than for any other binary pulsar. For some of these effects, the measurement
precision is so high that for the first time we have to take higher-order contributions into account.
These include contributions of A's effective mass loss (due to spin-down) to the observed orbital
period decay, a relativistic deformation of the orbit, and effects of the equation of state of super-dense
matter on the observed PK parameters via relativistic spin-orbit coupling. We discuss the implications
of our findings, including those for the moment of inertia of neutron stars. We present the currently
most precise test of general relativity's (GR's) quadrupolar description of gravitational waves,
validating GR's prediction at a level of $1.3 \times 10^{-4}$ (95% conf.). We demonstrate the utility
of the Double Pulsar for tests of alternative theories by focusing on two specific examples and discuss
some implications for studies of the interstellar medium and models for the formation of the Double
Pulsar. Finally, we provide context to other types of related experiments and prospects for the
future.

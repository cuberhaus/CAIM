The relative abundance of cosmic ray nickel nuclei with respect to iron is by far larger than for all
other trans-iron elements, therefore it provides a favorable opportunity for a low background
measurement of its spectrum. Since nickel, as well as iron, is one of the most stable nuclei, the nickel
energy spectrum and its relative abundance with respect to iron provide important information
to estimate the abundances at the cosmic ray source and to model the Galactic propagation of heavy
nuclei. However, only a few direct measurements of cosmic-ray nickel at energy larger than $ \sim$
3 GeV/n are available at present in the literature and they are affected by strong limitations in
both energy reach and statistics. In this paper we present a measurement of the differential energy
spectrum of nickel in the energy range from 8.8 to 240 GeV/n, carried out with unprecedented precision
by the Calorimetric Electron Telescope (CALET) in operation on the International Space Station
since 2015. The CALET instrument can identify individual nuclear species via a measurement of their
electric charge with a dynamic range extending far beyond iron (up to atomic number $ Z $ = 40). The
particle's energy is measured by a homogeneous calorimeter (1.2 proton interaction lengths, 27
radiation lengths) preceded by a thin imaging section (3 radiation lengths) providing tracking
and energy sampling. This paper follows our previous measurement of the iron spectrum [O. Adriani
et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 241101 (2021).], and it extends our investigation on the energy dependence
of the spectral index of heavy elements. It reports the analysis of nickel data collected from November
2015 to May 2021 and a detailed assessment of the systematic uncertainties. In the region from 20
to 240 GeV$ /n $ our present data are compatible within the errors with a single power law with spectral
index $ -2.51 \pm 0.07 $.

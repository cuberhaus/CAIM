Outflows play a central role in galaxy evolution shaping the properties of galaxies. Understanding
outflows and their effects in low luminosity AGNs, such as LINERs, is essential (e.g. they are a numerous
AGN population in the local Universe). We obtained VLT/MUSE and GTC/MEGARA optical IFS-data for
NGC1052, the prototypical LINER. The stars are distributed in a dynamically hot disc, with a centrally
peaked velocity dispersion map and large observed velocity amplitudes. The ionised gas, probed
by the primary component is detected up to $\sim$30arcsec ($\sim$3.3 kpc) mostly in the polar direction
with blue and red velocities ($\mid$V$\mid$$<$250 km/s). The velocity dispersion map shows a notable
enhancement ($\sigma$$>$90 km/s) crossing the galaxy along the major axis of rotation in the central
10arcsec. The secondary component has a bipolar morphology, velocity dispersion larger than 150
km/s and velocities up to 660 km/s. A third component is detected but not spatially resolved. The
maps of the NaD absorption indicate optically thick neutral gas with a velocity field consistent
with a slow rotating disc ($\Delta$V = 77$\pm$12 km/s) but the velocity dispersion map is off-centred
without any counterpart in the flux map. We found evidence of an ionised gas outflow with mass of 1.6$\pm$0.6
$\times$ 10$^{5}$ Msun, and mass rate of 0.4$\pm$0.2 Msun/yr. The outflow is propagating in a cocoon
of gas with enhanced turbulence and might be triggering the onset of kpc-scale buoyant bubbles (polar
emission). Taking into account the energy and kinetic power of the outflow (1.3$\pm$0.9 $\times$
10$^{53}$ erg and 8.8$\pm$3.5 $\times$ 10$^{40}$ erg/s, respectively) as well as its alignment
with both the jet and the cocoon, and that the gas is collisionally ionised, we consider that the outflow
is jet-powered, although some contribution from the AGN is possible.

N-body simulation is an invaluable tool to understand cosmic velocity field. However, simulation
samples velocity only at particle locations that leads to information loss when projecting particle
fields onto structured grid. Here we extract two-point statistics without field projection. These
statistics, i.e. correlation, structure, dispersion functions in real space and spectrum functions
in Fourier space, are modeled on both small and large scales. Kinematic relations between statistical
measures are developed for incompressible, constant divergence, and irrotational flow. The nature
of dark matter flow is identified by these relations. Much more complex than incompressible flow,
peculiar velocity of dark matter flow is of constant divergence on small scale and irrotational
on large scale. Incompressible and constant divergence flow share same kinematic relations for
even order correlations. The limiting correlation of velocity $\rho_L=1/2$ on the smallest scale
($r=0$) is a unique feature of collisionless flow ($\rho_L=1$ for incompressible flow). Assuming
gravity is the only interaction and no radiation produced, this leads to an increase in particle
mass converted from kinetic energy upon "annihilation". On large scale, transverse velocity correlation
has an exponential form $T_2\propto e^{-r/r_2}$ with a comoving scale $r_2$=21.3Mpc/h that maybe
related to the size of sound horizon. All other correlation, structure, dispersion and spectrum
functions for velocity, density, and potential are derived analytically from kinematic relations
for irrotational flow. On small scale, structure function follows one-fourth law of $S^l_2\propto
r^{1/4}$. All other statistical measures can be derived for constant divergence flow. Vorticity
is negatively correlated for scale $r$ between 1 and 7Mpc/h. Divergence is negatively correlated
for $r$>30Mpc/h that leads to negative density correlation.

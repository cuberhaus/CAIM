Impulsive short term variations occur in all kinds of solar-type stars. They are the results of complex
phenomena such as the stellar magnetic field reconnection, low-level variability or in some cases
even star-planet interactions. The radiation arising from these events is often highly energetic
and, in stars hosting planets, may interact with the planetary atmospheres. Studying the rate of
these energetic phenomena is fundamental to understand their role in modifying the chemical composition
or, in some extreme cases, to the disruption of the planetary atmospheres. Here, we present a new
procedure developed to identify the impulsive events in TESS light curves. Our goal is to have a simple
and effective tool to study the short-term activity of a star using only its light curve, in order
to derive its distribution and energetic. As our first case, we studied the system DS Tuc. Our technique
consists of fitting the TESS light curves using iteratively Gaussian processes in order to remove
all the long-term stellar activity contributions. Then, we identify the impulsive events and,
derive amplitudes, time scales and the amount of energy emitted. We validate our procedure using
the AU Mic TESS light curves obtaining results consistent with those presented in the literature.
We estimate the frequency distribution of energetic events for DS Tuc. In particular, we find that
there are approx 2 events per day with energy greater than 2x10^32 erg. We find evidence for a favoured
stellar phase for short term activity on AU Mic, and also indications of short term activity in phase
with the planetary orbit. For DS Tuc we find that the events distribution is not equally spaced in
time but often grouped. The resulting distribution may be used to estimate the impact of short term
variability on planetary atmosphere chemical compositions.

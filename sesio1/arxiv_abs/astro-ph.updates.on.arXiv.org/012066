We present a spatially-resolved HII region study of the gas-phase metallicity, ionization parameter,
and ISM pressure maps of 6 local star-forming and face-on spiral galaxies from the TYPHOON program.
Self-consistent metallicity, ionization parameter, and pressure maps are calculated simultaneously
through an iterative process to provide useful measures of the local chemical abundance and its
relation to localized ISM properties. We constrain the presence of azimuthal variations in metallicity
by measuring the residual metallicity offset $\Delta$(O/H) after subtracting the linear fits
to the radial metallicity profiles. We however find weak evidence of azimuthal variations in most
of the galaxies, with small (mean 0.03 dex) scatter. The galaxies instead reveal that HII regions
with enhanced and reduced abundances are found distributed throughout the disk. While the spiral
pattern plays a role in organizing the ISM, it alone does not establish the relatively uniform azimuthal
variations we observe. Differences in the metal abundances are more likely driven by the strong
correlations with the local physical conditions. We find a strong and positive correlation between
the ionization parameter and the local abundances as measured by the relative metallicity offset
$\Delta$(O/H), indicating a tight relationship between local physical conditions and their localized
enrichment of the ISM. Additionally, we demonstrate the impact of unresolved observations on the
measured ISM properties by rebinning the datacubes to simulate low-resolution (1 kpc) observations,
typical of large IFU surveys. We find that the ionization parameter and ISM pressure diagnostics
are impacted by the loss of resolution such that their measured values are larger relative to the
measured values on sub-HII region scales.

Most massive stars belong to multiple systems, yet the formation process leading to such high multiplicity
remains insufficiently understood. To help constrain the different formation scenarios that
exist, insights on the low-mass end of the companion mass function of such stars is crucial. However,
this is a challenging endeavour as (sub-)solar mass companions at angular separations ($\rho$)
below 1" (corresponding to 1000-3000 au in nearby young open clusters and OB associations) are difficult
to detect due to the large brightness contrast with the central star. With the Carina High-contrast
Imaging Project of massive Stars (CHIPS), we aim to obtain statistically significant constraints
on the presence and properties of low-mass companions around massive stars at a previously unreachable
observing window ($\Delta \mathrm{mag} \gtrsim 10$ at $\rho \lesssim$ 1"). In this second paper
in the series, we focus on the Trumpler 14 cluster, which harbours some of the youngest and most massive
O-type stars in the Milky Way. We obtained VLT-SPHERE observations of seven O-type objects in Trumpler
14 using the IRDIFS_EXT mode. These allow us to search for companions at separations larger than
0."15 (approx. 360 au) and down to magnitude contrast $>10 \mathrm{mag}$ in the near-infrared.
We used angular and spectral differential imaging along with PSF fitting to detect sources and measure
their flux relative to that of the central object. We detected 211 sources with near-infrared magnitude
contrast in the range of 2 to 12. The closest companion, at only 0."26, is characterised as a 1.4M$_{\odot}$
stars with an age of 0.6Myr, in excellent agreement with previous age estimates for Tr 14. The mass
function peaks at about 0.4M$_{\odot}$ and presents a dearth of stars in the 0.5 to 0.8M$_{\odot}$
mass range compared to previous estimates of the initial mass function in Tr 14.

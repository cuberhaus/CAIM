We present simple stellar population models based on the empirical X-shooter Spectral Library
(XSL) from near-ultraviolet (NUV) to near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths. The unmatched characteristics
of relatively high resolution and extended wavelength coverage (350-2480 nm, R ~ 10 000) of the XSL
population models bring us closer to bridging optical and NIR studies of intermediate and old stellar
populations. It is now common to find good agreement between observed and predicted NUV and optical
properties of stellar clusters due to our good understanding of the main-sequence and early giant
phases of stars. However, NIR spectra of intermediate-age and old stellar populations are sensitive
to cool K and M giants. The asymptotic giant branch, especially the thermally pulsing asymptotic
giant branch (TP-AGB), shapes the NIR spectra of 0.5-2 Gyr old stellar populations; the tip of the
red giant branch defines the NIR spectra of populations with ages larger than that. We therefore
construct sequences of the average spectra of static giants, variable O-rich giants, and C-rich
giants to include in the models separately. The models span the metallicity range $-2.2<\mathrm{[Fe/H]}<+0.2$
and ages above 50 Myr, a broader range in the NIR than in other models based on empirical spectral libraries.
We focus on the behaviour of colours and absorption line indices as a function of age and metallicity.
Our models reproduce the integrated optical and NIR colours of the Coma cluster galaxies. Furthermore,
the XSL models expand the range of predicted values of NIR indices compared to other models based
on empirical libraries. Our models make it possible to perform in-depth studies of colours and spectral
features consistently throughout the optical and the NIR range to clarify the role of evolved cool
stars in stellar populations.

Scatterings of galactic dark matter (DM) particles with the constituents of celestial bodies could
result in their accumulation within these objects. Nevertheless, the finite temperature of the
medium sets a minimum mass, the evaporation mass, that DM particles must have in order to remain trapped.
DM particles below this mass are very likely to scatter to speeds higher than the escape velocity,
so they would be kicked out of the capturing object and escape. Here, we compute the DM evaporation
mass for all spherical celestial bodies in hydrostatic equilibrium, spanning the mass range $[10^{-10}
- 10^2]~M_\odot$, for constant scattering cross sections and $s$-wave annihilations. We illustrate
the critical importance of the exponential tail of the evaporation rate, which has not always been
appreciated in recent literature, and obtain a robust result: for the geometric value of the scattering
cross section and for interactions with nucleons, at the local galactic position, the DM evaporation
mass for all spherical celestial bodies in hydrostatic equilibrium is approximately given by $E_c/T_\chi
\sim 30$, where $E_c$ is the escape energy of DM particles at the core of the object and $T_\chi$ is
their temperature. In that case, the minimum value of the DM evaporation mass is obtained for super-Jupiters
and brown dwarfs, $m_{\rm evap} \simeq 0.7$ GeV. For other values of the scattering cross section,
the DM evaporation mass only varies by a factor smaller than three within the range $10^{-41}~\textrm{cm}^2
\leq \sigma_p \leq 10^{-31}~\textrm{cm}^2$, where $\sigma_p$ is the spin-independent DM-nucleon
scattering cross section. Its dependence on parameters such as the galactic DM density and velocity,
or the scattering and annihilation cross sections is only logarithmic, and details on the density
and temperature profiles of celestial bodies have also a small impact.

The forthcoming Stage-IV experiments aim to map the large scale structure of the Universe at high
precision. The scales explored require a relativistic description, in addition to statistical
tools for their analysis. In this thesis, we study the effects of adding relativistic and primordial
non-Gaussianity contributions to the power spectrum. We begin by reviewing the standard cosmology,
then we present the cosmological and Newtonian perturbation theory, which are necessary mathematical
tools in the computation of our main results. Afterwards we present the main contributions to this
thesis. First, we present solutions to the Einstein equations in the long-wavelength approximation,
this allow us to obtain expressions for the relativistic density power spectrum at second and third
order, these expressions also include contributions from primordial non-Gaussianity, in terms
of the parameters $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ and $g_{\mathrm{NL}}$. These results are complemented with
the well known Newtonian solutions for the density contrast and are used in the computation of the
total (relativistic + Newtonian) one-loop power spectrum. For completeness we also calculate
the bispectrum at tree-level. We discuss the possibility of these relativistic effects being detectable
with the future surveys considering different limiting values for $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ and $g_{\mathrm{NL}}$.
Subsequently, we compute the real space galaxy power spectrum, including relativistic and primordial
non-Gaussianity effects. These effects come from the relativistic one-loop power spectrum terms
and from factors of the non-linear bias parameter $b_{\mathrm{NL}}$. We use our modelling to assess
the ability of Stage-IV surveys to constrain primordial non-Gaussianity. Finally, we show how
this non-linear bias parameter can effectively renormalize diverging relativistic contributions
at large scales.

Context. Active galactic nuclei (AGN) of galaxies play an important role in the life and evolution
of galaxies due to the impact they exert on certain properties and the evolutionary path of galaxies.
It is well known that infrared (IR) emission is useful for selecting galaxies with AGNs, although
it has been observed that there is contamination by star-forming galaxies. Aims. In this work we
investigate galaxy properties hosting AGNs identified at mid and near-IR wavelengths. The sample
of AGNs selected at IR wavelengths was confirmed using optical spectroscopy and X-ray photometry.
We study the near-UV, optical, near and mid-IR (MIR) properties, as well as [O III] {\lambda}5007
luminosity, black hole mass and morphology properties of optical and IR colour selected AGNs. Methods.
We selected AGN candidates using two mid-IR colour selection techniques, a power-law emission
method and a combination of mid and near-IR selection techniques. We confirm the AGN selection with
two line diagnostic diagrams that use the ratio [O III]/H\b{eta} and the emission line width {\sigma}
[O III] (kinematics-excitation diagram, KEx) and the host galaxy stellar mass (mass-excitation
diagram, MEx), as well as X-ray photometry. Results. According to the diagnostic diagrams, the
methods with the greatest success in selecting AGNs are those that use a combination of a mid and near-IR
selection technique and a power-law emission. The method that use a combination of mid and near-IR
observation selects a large number of AGNs, and is reasonably efficient in both the success rate
(61%) and total number of AGN recovered. We also find that the KEx method presents contamination
of SF galaxies within the AGN selection box. According to morphological studies based on the S\'ersic
index, AGN samples have higher percentages of galaxy morphologies with bulge+disk components
compared to galaxies without AGNs.

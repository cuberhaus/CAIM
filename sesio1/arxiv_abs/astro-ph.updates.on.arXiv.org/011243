The Vera Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected to process ${\sim}10^6$
transient detections per night. For precision measurements of cosmological parameters and rates,
it is critical to understand the detection efficiency, magnitude limits, artifact contamination
levels, and biases in the selection and photometry. Here we rigorously test the LSST Difference
Image Analysis (DIA) pipeline using simulated images from the Rubin Observatory LSST Dark Energy
Science Collaboration (DESC) Data Challenge (DC2) simulation for the Wide-Fast-Deep (WFD) survey
area. DC2 is the first large-scale (300 deg$^2$) image simulation of a transient survey that includes
realistic cadence, variable observing conditions, and CCD image artifacts. We analyze ${\sim}$15
deg$^2$ of DC2 over a 5-year time-span in which artificial point-sources from Type Ia Supernovae
(SNIa) light curves have been overlaid onto the images. We measure the detection efficiency as a
function of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and find a $50\%$ efficiency at $\rm{SNR}=5.8$. The magnitude
limits for each filter are: $u=23.66$, $g=24.69$, $r=24.06$, $i=23.45$, $z=22.54$, $y=21.62$
$\rm{mag}$. The artifact contamination is $\sim90\%$ of detections, corresponding to $\sim1000$
artifacts/deg$^2$ in $g$ band, and falling to 300 per deg$^2$ in $y$ band. The photometry has biases
$<1\%$ for magnitudes $19.5 < m <23$. Our DIA performance on simulated images is similar to that of
the Dark Energy Survey pipeline applied to real images. We also characterize DC2 image properties
to produce catalog-level simulations needed for distance bias corrections. We find good agreement
between DC2 data and simulations for distributions of SNR, redshift, and fitted light-curve properties.
Applying a realistic SNIa-cosmology analysis for redshifts $z<1$, we recover the input cosmology
parameters to within statistical uncertainties.

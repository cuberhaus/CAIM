Narrowband bursts (spikes) appear on dynamic spectra from microwave to decametric frequencies.
They are believed to be manifestations of small-scale energy release through magnetic reconnection.
We study the position of the spike-like structures relative to the front of type-II bursts and their
role in the burst emission. We used high-sensitivity, low-noise dynamic spectra obtained with
the acousto-optic analyzer (SAO) of the ARTEMIS-JLS radiospectrograph, in conjunction with images
from the Nan\c{c}ay Radioheliograph (NRH) in order to study spike-like bursts near the front of
a type-II radio burst during the November 3, 2003 extreme solar event. The spike-like emission in
the dynamic spectrum was enhanced by means of high-pass-time filtering. We identified a number
of spikes in the NRH images. Due to the lower temporal resolution of the NRH, multiple spikes detected
in the dynamic spectrum appeared as single structures in the images. These spikes had an average
size of ~200" and their observed brightness temperature was 1.4-5.6x10^9K, providing a significant
contribution to the emission of the type-II burst front. At variance with a previous study on the
type-IV associated spikes, we found no systematic displacement between the spike emission and
the emission between spikes. At 327.0 MHz, the type II emission was located about 0.3 RSUN above the
pre-existing continuum emission, which, was located 0.1 RSUN above the western limb. This study
indicates that the spike-like chains aligned along the type II burst MHD shock front are not a perturbation
of the type II emission, as in the case of type IV spikes, but a manifestation of the type II emission
itself. The preponderance of these chains, together with the lack of isolated structures or irregular
clusters, points towards some form of small-scale magnetic reconnection, organized along the
type-II propagating front.

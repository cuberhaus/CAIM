One of the fundamental factors regulating the evolution of galaxies is stellar feedback. However,
we still do not have strong observational constraints on the relative importance of the different
feedback mechanisms (e.g. radiation, ionised gas pressure, stellar winds) in driving HII region
evolution and molecular cloud disruption. In this letter, we constrain the relative importance
of the various feedback mechanisms from young massive star populations by resolving HII regions
across the disk of the nearby star-forming galaxy NGC 1672. We combine measurements of ionised gas
nebular lines obtained by PHANGS-MUSE, with high-resolution imaging from the HST in both the narrow-band
H{\alpha} and broad-band filters. We identify a sample of 40 isolated, compact HII regions in the
HST H{\alpha} image, for which we measure the sizes that were previously unresolved in seeing-limited
ground-based observations. Additionally, we identify the ionisation source(s) for each HII region
from catalogues produced as part of the PHANGS-HST survey. We find that the HII regions investigated
are mildly dominated by thermal or wind pressure, yet their elevation above the radiation pressure
is within the expected uncertainty range. We see that radiation pressure provides a substantially
higher contribution to the total pressure than previously found in the literature over similar
size scales. In general, we find higher pressures within more compact HII regions, which is driven
by the inherent size scaling relations of each pressure term, albeit with significant scatter introduced
by the variation in the stellar population properties (e.g. luminosity, mass, age, metallicity).
For nearby galaxies, here we provide a promising approach that could yield the statistics required
to map out how the importance of different stellar feedback mechanisms evolve over the lifetime
of an HII region.

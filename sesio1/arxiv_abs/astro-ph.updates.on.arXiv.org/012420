Polar faculae (PFe) are the footpoints of magnetic field lines near the Sun's poles that are seen
as bright regions along the edges of granules. The time variation in the number of PFe has been shown
to correlate with the strength of the polar magnetic field and to be a predictor of the subsequent
solar cycle. Due to the small size and transient nature of these features, combined with different
techniques and observational factors, previous counts of PFe differ in magnitude. Further, there
were no scalable techniques to measure the statistical properties of faculae. Using data from the
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), we present
two new methods for tracking faculae and measuring their properties. In the first, we calculate
the standard deviation of the HMI images over one day, visualizing the faculae as streaks. The facular
lifetime is found by dividing the angular streak length by the latitude-dependent rotation rate.
We apply this method to 134 days of data over 11 years. The distribution of facular lifetimes has a
mean of 6.0 hours, a FWHM of 5.4 hours, and a skew towards longer lifetimes, with some lasting up to
1 day. In the second method, we overlay images of the progressive standard deviation with the HMI
magnetogram to show the close relationship between facular candidates and the magnetic field.
The results allow us to distinguish between motion due to the Sun's rotation and "proper motion"
due to faculae moving across the Sun's surface, confirming that PFe participate in convective motions
at the poles. Counts of PFe using both methods agree with previous counts in their variation with
the solar cycle and the polar magnetic field. These methods can be extended to automate the identification
and measurement of other properties of of PFe, which would allow for daily measurements of all faculae
since SDO began operation in 2010.

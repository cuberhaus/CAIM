Cross-correlating 21cm and Ly$\alpha$ intensity maps of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) promises
to be a powerful tool for exploring the properties of the first galaxies. Next-generation intensity
mapping experiments such as the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) and SPHEREx will individually
probe reionization through the power spectra of the 21cm and Ly$\alpha$ lines respectively, but
will be limited by bright foregrounds and instrumental systematics. Cross-correlating these
measurements could reduce systematics, potentially tightening constraints on the inferred astrophysical
parameters. In this study, we present forecasts of cross-correlation taking into account the effects
of exact uv-sampling and foreground filtering to estimate the feasibility of HERAxSPHEREx making
a detection of the 21cm-Ly$\alpha$ cross-power spectrum. We also project the sensitivity of a cross-power
spectrum between HERA and the proposed next-generation Cosmic Dawn Intensity Mapper. By isolating
the sources of uncertainty, we explore the impacts of experimental limitations such as foreground
filtering and Ly$\alpha$ thermal noise uncertainty have on making a detection of the cross-power
spectrum. We then implement this strategy in a simulation of the cross-power spectrum and observational
error to identify redshifts where fiducial 21cmFAST models predict the highest signal-to-noise
detection ($z \sim 8$). We conclude that detection of the SPHEREx-HERA cross-correlation will
require an optimistic level of 21cm foreground filtering, as well as deeper thermal noise integrations
due to a lack of overlapping sensitive modes but for CDIM with its larger range of scales and lower
noise forecast detection levels, may be possible even with stricter 21cm foreground filtering.

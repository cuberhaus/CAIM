Aim: We aim to refine the orbital and physical parameters and determine the sky-projected planet
orbital obliquity of five eccentric transiting planetary systems: HAT-P-15, HAT-P-17, HAT-P-21,
HAT-P-26, and HAT-P-29. Each of the systems hosts a hot Jupiter, except for HAT-P-26 that hosts a
Neptune-mass planet. Methods: We observed transit events of these planets with the HARPS-N spectrograph,
obtaining high-precision radial velocity measurements that allow us to measure the Rossiter-McLaughlin
effect for each of the target systems. We used these new HARPS-N spectra and archival data, including
those from Gaia, to better characterise the stellar atmospheric parameters. The photometric parameters
for four of the hot Jupiters were recalculated using 17 new transit light curves, obtained with an
array of medium-class telescopes, and data from the TESS space telescope. HATNet time-series photometric
data were checked for the signatures of rotation periods of the target stars and their spin axis inclination.
Results: From the analysis of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect we derived a sky-projected obliquity
of 13, -26.3, -0.7, -26 degree for HAT-P-15b, HAT-P-17b, HAT-P-21b and HAT-P-29b, respectively.
Due to the quality of the data, we were not able to well constrain the sky-projected obliquity for
HAT-P-26b, although a prograde orbit is favoured. The stellar activity of HAT-P-21 indicates a
rotation period of 15.88 days, which allowed us to determine its true misalignment angle 25 degree.
Our new analysis of the physical parameters of the five exoplanetary systems returned values compatible
with those existing in the literature. Using TESS and the available transit light curves, we reviewed
the orbital ephemeris for the five systems and confirmed that the HAT-P-26 system shows transit
timing variations, which may tentatively be attributed to the presence of a third body.

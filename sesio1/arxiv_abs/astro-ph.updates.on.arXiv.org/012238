We investigate the orientation of the magnetic field deflections in switchbacks (SB) to determine
if they are characterised by a possible preferential orientation. We compute the deflection angles
of the magnetic field relative to the Parker spiral direction for encounters 1 to 9 of the PSP mission.
We first characterize the distribution of these deflection angles for calm solar wind intervals,
and assess the precision of the Parker model as a function of distance to the Sun. We then assume that
the solar wind is composed of two populations, the background calm solar wind and the population
of SB, characterized by larger fluctuations. We model the total distribution of deflection angles
we observe in the solar wind as a weighed sum of two distinct normal distributions, each corresponding
to one of the populations. We fit the observed data with our model using a MCMC algorithm and retrieve
the most probable mean vector and covariance matrix coefficients of the two Gaussian functions,
as well as the population proportion. We first observe that the accuracy of the spiral direction
in the ecliptic is a function of radial distance, in a manner that is consistent with PSP being near
the solar wind acceleration region. We then find that the fitted switchback population presents
a systematic bias in its deflections compared to the calm solar wind population. This result holds
for all encounters but E6, and regardless of the magnetic field main polarity. This implies a marked
preferential orientation of SB in the clockwise direction in the ecliptic plane, and we discuss
this result and its implications in the context of the existing switchback formation theories.
Finally, we report the observation of a 12-hour patch of SB that systematically deflect in the same
direction, so that the magnetic field vector tip within the patch deflects and returns to the Parker
spiral within a given plane.

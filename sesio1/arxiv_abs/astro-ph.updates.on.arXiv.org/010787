In the framework of a systematic ALMA study of IR-selected main-sequence and starburst galaxies
at z~1-1.7 at typical ~1" resolution, we report on the effects of mid-IR- and X-ray-detected active
galactic nuclei (AGN) on the reservoirs and excitation of molecular gas in a sample of 55 objects.
We find detectable nuclear activity in ~30% of the sample. The presence of dusty tori influences
the IR SED of galaxies, as highlighted by the strong correlation among the AGN contribution to the
total IR luminosity budget (fAGN = LIR,AGN/LIR), its hard X-ray emission, and the Rayleigh-Jeans
to mid-IR (S1.2mm/S24um) observed color, with consequences on the empirical SFR estimates. Nevertheless,
we find only marginal effects of AGN on the CO (J=2,4,5,7) or neutral carbon ([CI](1-0), [CI](2-1))
line luminosities and on the derived molecular gas excitation as gauged by line ratios and the full
SLEDs. The [CI] and CO emission up to J=5,7 thus primarily traces the properties of the host in typical
IR luminous galaxies. However, we highlight the existence of a large variety of line luminosities
and ratios despite the homogeneous selection. In particular, we find a sparse group of AGN-dominated
sources with the highest LIR,AGN/LIR,SFR ratios, >3, that are more luminous in CO(5-4) than what
is predicted by the L'CO(5-4)-LIR,SFR relation, which might be the result of the nuclear activity.
For the general population, our findings translate into AGN having minimal effects on quantities
such as gas and dust fractions and SFEs. If anything, we find hints of a marginal tendency of AGN hosts
to be compact at far-IR wavelengths and to display 1.8x larger dust optical depths. In general, this
is consistent with a marginal impact of the nuclear activity on the gas reservoirs and star formation
in average star-forming AGN hosts with LIR>5e11 Lsun, typically underrepresented in surveys of
quasars and SMGs.

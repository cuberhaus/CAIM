NGC1850 is the nearest Young Massive Cluster of the Local Group with a mass similar to those of Galactic
globular clusters. Recent studies have revealed an extended morphology of its MSTO, which can be
interpreted as a spread in either age or internal rotation. An accurate spectroscopic determination
of its chemical properties is still missing. We analyse spectra obtained with MUSE in adaptive optics
mode of 1167 stars in both components of this cluster (NGC1850A and NGC1850B). Thanks to this dataset,
we measure an average metallicity of <[M/H]>=-0.31 +/- 0.01, a mean Ba abundance of <[Ba/Fe]>=+0.40
+/- 0.02 and a systemic radial velocity of <v_{LOS}>=251.1 +/- 0.3 km/s. The dispersion of the radial
velocities suggests a dynamical mass of log(M/Ms)=4.84 +/- 0.1, while no significant systemic
rotation is detected. We detect a significant bimodality in OI line strength among the TO stars of
NGC1850A with ~66% of stars with [O/Fe]~-0.16 and the rest with no detectable line. The majority
of O-weak stars populate preferentially the red side of the MSTO and show H lines in emission, suggesting
that they are Be stars rotating close to their critical velocity. Among normal MSTO stars, red stars
have on average broader line profiles than blue ones, suggesting a correlation between colour and
rotational velocity. The mean metallicity of this cluster lies at the metal-rich side of the metallicity
distribution of the LMC following its age-metallicity relation. The Ba and O abundances agree with
those measured in the bar of this galaxy. The observed spread in OI line width among its MS stars can
be interpreted as an effect of rotational mixing occurring in the envelopes of O-weak stars. The
correlation between line broadening and colour suggests that the observed colour spread among
turn-off stars can be due to a wide range in rotational velocity covered by these stars.

We present VLT/MUSE spectroscopy, along with archival Gemini/GMOS spectroscopy, Magellan/Megacam
imaging, and Chandra X-ray emission for SPT-CLJ0305-6225, a z=0.58 galaxy cluster. A large BCG-SZ
centroid separation and a highly disturbed X-ray morphology classifies SPT-CLJ0307-6225 as a
major merging cluster. Furthermore, the galaxy density distribution shows two main overdensities
with separations of 0.144' and 0.017' to their respective BCGs. We characterize the central regions
of the two colliding structures, namely 0307-6225N and 0307-6225S. We find velocity derived masses
of $M_{200,N}=$ 2.42 $\pm$ 1.40 $\times10^{14}$ M$_\odot$ and $M_{200,S}=$ 3.13 $\pm$ 1.87 $\times10^{14}$
M$_\odot$, with a line-of-sight velocity difference between the two structures of $|\Delta v|
= 342$ km s$^{-1}$. The total dynamically derived mass is consistent with the SZ derived mass of 7.63
h$_{70}^{-1}$ $\pm$ 1.36 $\times10^{14}$ M$_\odot$. We model the merger using the Monte Carlo
Merger Analysis Code, estimating a merging angle of 36$^{+14}_{-12}$ degrees with respect to the
plane of the sky. Comparing with simulations of a merging system with a mass ratio of 1:3, we find that
the best scenario is that of an ongoing merger that began 0.96$^{+0.31}_{-0.18}$ Gyr ago, which
could be close to turnaround. We also characterize the galaxy population using the H$\delta$ and
[OII] $\lambda 3727$ \AA \ lines. We find that most of the emission-line galaxies belong to 0307-6225S,
close to the X-ray peak position, with a third of them corresponding to red-cluster sequence galaxies,
and the rest to blue galaxies with velocities consistent with recent periods of accretion. Moreover,
we suggest that 0307-6225S suffered a previous merger, evidenced through the two equally bright
BCGs at the center with a velocity difference of $\sim$674 km s$^{-1}$.

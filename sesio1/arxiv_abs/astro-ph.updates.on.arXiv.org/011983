(Abridged) Surveys of protoplanetary disks in nearby star-forming regions (SFRs) have provided
important information on their demographics, but due to their sample sizes, they cannot be used
to study how disk properties vary with the environment. We conduct a survey of the unresolved millimeter
continuum emission of 873 protoplanetary disks identified by Spitzer in the L1641 and L1647 regions
of the Orion A cloud. This is the largest such survey yet, allowing us to identify even weak trends
in the median disk mass as a function of position in the cloud and cluster membership. The sample detection
rates and median masses are also compared to those of nearby (<300 pc) SFRs. The sample was observed
with ALMA at 225 GHz, with a median rms of 0.08 mJy/beam (1.5 M$_{\oplus}$). The data were reduced
and imaged using an innovative parallel data processing approach. We detect 58% (502/873) of the
observed disks. This includes 20 disks with dust masses >100 M$_{\oplus}$, and two objects associated
with extended dust emission. We infer a median disk dust mass in the full sample of $2.2^{+0.2}_{-0.2}$
M$_{\oplus}$. In L1641 and L1647 median dust masses are $2.1^{+0.2}_{-0.2}$ M$_{\oplus}$ and
$2.6^{+0.4}_{-0.5}$ M$_{\oplus}$, respectively. The disk mass distribution of the full sample
is similar to that of nearby low-mass SFRs at similar ages of 1-3 Myr. We find only weak trends in disk
(dust) masses with galactic longitude and between the YSO clusters identified in the sample, with
median masses varying by $\lesssim$ 50%. Age differences may explain these median disk mass variations.
Apart from this, disk masses are essentially constant at scales of ~100 pc. This also suggests that
the majority of disks, even in different SFRs, are formed with similar initial masses and evolve
at similar rates, assuming no external irradiation, with disk mass loss rates of $\sim 10^{-8}$
M$_{\odot}$/yr.

We image the spatial extent of a cool galactic outflow with resonant Mg II emission in a gravitationally
lensed star-forming galaxy at $z \sim 1.7$ using VLT/MUSE observations. We observe Mg II residual
(continuum-subtracted) emission out to an observed radial distance of $26.5_{-0.4}^{+0.5}$
kpc from the galaxy, with an observed maximum spatial extent of $\approx39_{-0.6}^{+0.8}$ kpc
($30_{-0.5}^{+0.7}$ kpc after correcting for seeing). Mg II residual emission is patchy and covers
a total area of ${\rm 184_{-10}^{+5} kpc^2}$, constraining the minimum area covered by the outflowing
gas to be $13.27_{-1.02}^{+0.55}$ % of the total area. The spatial extent of the Mg II emission is
asymmetric and shows an observed $27.6_{-0.7}^{+0.8}$ % ($20.9_{-0.6}^{+0.7}$ % after seeing
correction) larger extent along the declination direction. We constrain the covering fraction
of the Mg II emission as a function of radial distance and characterize it with a power-law model convolved
with the seeing with an index $\gamma= -1.25_{-0.02}^{+0.02}$. We find two kinematically distinct
Mg II emission components ($\Delta v \approx400\ {\rm km\ s^{-1}}$) which extend out to similar
distances, and may correspond to two distinct shells of outflowing gas. By using multiple images
with different magnifications of the galaxy in the image plane, we trace the Mg II residual emission
in three individual star-forming regions inside the galaxy out to $6.0_{- 0.2 }^{+0.2}$ , $7.0_{-0.2}^{+0.3}$
, and $8.5_{-0.1}^{+0.1}$ kpc. Both the Fe II* fine structure emission, and the nebular [O II] emission
are not spatially extended relative to the stellar continuum. These findings provide robust constraints
on the spatial extent of the outflowing gas and combined with outflow velocity and column density
measurements will give stringent constraints on mass outflow rates of the galaxy.

A significant fraction of nearby late-type galaxies are lopsided. We study the asymmetry of the
stellar component in a sample of well-resolved disky galaxies selected from the last snapshot of
the Illustris TNG100 simulation based on their flatness and rotational support. Among 1912 disks,
we identify 161 objects with significant asymmetry in terms of the m=1 Fourier mode of the stellar
component within (1-2) stellar half-mass radii and describe their properties using three representative
examples. The profiles of the m=1 mode typically increase with radius, and the corresponding phase
is constant in the asymmetric region, signifying a global distortion. Following the evolution
of the lopsided disks over time, we find that their history is rather uneventful and the occurrence
of the asymmetry is fairly recent. Only about 1/3 of the lopsided disks experienced any strong interaction
recently that could have led to the distortion of their shape: 24% were affected by a more massive
object and 9% underwent a gas-rich merger. Still, a majority of lopsided disks show a significant
increase in their recent star formation rate. The most frequent mechanism for the formation of lopsided
disks thus seems to be asymmetric star formation probably related to gas accretion, although the
distortions in the gas and stars are not strongly correlated. This picture is supported by the finding
that the lopsided population on average contains more gas, has higher star formation rate, lower
metallicity and bluer color than the remaining disks. These correlations are similar to those seen
in real galaxies, even though the fraction of simulated lopsided disks (8%) is much lower than in
observations (30%). The observed correlation between the presence of the asymmetry and a bar is
not reproduced either. These discrepancies may be due to overquenching or insufficient resolution
of IllustrisTNG simulations.

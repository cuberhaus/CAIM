We present our lens mass model of SMACS J0723, the first strong gravitational lens observed by the
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We use data from the Hubble Space Telescope and Multi Unit Spectroscopic
Explorer (MUSE) to build our 'pre-JWST' lens model, and refine it with newly available JWST near-infrared
imaging in our JWST model. To reproduce the positions of all multiple lensed images with good accuracy,
the adopted mass parameterization consists of one cluster-scale component, accounting mainly
for the dark matter distribution, the galaxy cluster members and an external shear component. The
pre-JWST model has, as constraints, 19 multiple images from six background sources, of which four
have secure spectroscopic redshift measurements from this work. The JWST model has more than twice
the number of constraints, 27 additional multiple images from another ten lensed sources. Both
models can reproduce very well the multiple image positions with a $\delta_{rms}$ of $0.39''$ and
$0.51''$, for the pre-JWST and JWST models, respectively. The total mass estimates within a radius
of 128~kpc (~ the Einstein radius) are $7.9_{-0.2}^{+0.3}\times 10^{13}\rm M_{\odot}$ and $8.6_{-0.2}^{+0.2}\times
10^{13}\rm M_{\odot}$, for the pre-JWST and JWST models, respectively. We predict with our mass
models the redshifts of the newly detected JWST sources, which are crucial information for systems
without spectroscopic measurements for further studies and follow-up observations. Interestingly,
one family detected with JWST is found to be at a very high redshift, $z>7.5$ (68% confidence level)
and with one image having lensing magnification of $|\mu|=9.8_{-1.1}^{+0.9}$, making it an interesting
case for future studies. The lens models, including magnification maps and redshifts estimated
from the model are made publicly available, along with the full spectroscopic redshift catalogue
from MUSE.

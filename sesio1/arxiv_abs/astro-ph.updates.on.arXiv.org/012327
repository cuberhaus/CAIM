[Abridged] Most disks observed at high angular resolution show substructures. Knowledge about
the gas surface density and temperature is essential to understand these. The aim of this work is
to constrain the gas temperature and surface density in two transition disks: LkCa15 and HD 169142.
We use new ALMA observations of the $^{13}$CO $J=6-5$ transition together with archival $J=2-1$
data of $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O to observationally constrain the gas temperature and
surface density. Furthermore, we use the thermochemical code DALI to model the temperature and
density structure of a typical transition disk. The $6-5/2-1$ line ratio in LkCa15 constrains the
gas temperature in the emitting layers inside the dust cavity to be up to 65 K, warmer than in the outer
disk at 20-30 K. For the HD 169142, the peak brightness temperature constrains the gas in the dust
cavity of HD 169142 to be 170 K, whereas that in the outer disk is only 100 K. Models also show that a more
luminous central star, a lower abundance of PAHs and the absence of a dusty inner disk increase the
temperature of the emitting layers and hence the line ratio in the gas cavity. The gas column density
in the LkCa15 dust cavity drops by a factor >2 compared to the outer disk, with an additional drop of
an order of magnitude inside the gas cavity at 10 AU. In the case of HD 169142, the gas column density
drops by a factor of 200$-$500 inside the gas cavity, which could be due to a massive companion of several
M$_{\mathrm{J}}$. The broad dust-depleted gas region from 10-68 AU for LkCa15 may imply several
lower mass planets. This work demonstrates that knowledge of the gas temperature is important to
determine the gas surface density and thus whether planets, and if so what kind of planets, are the
most likely carving the dust cavities.

UNIONS is an ongoing collaboration that will provide the largest deep photometric survey of the
Northern sky in four optical bands to date. As part of this collaboration, CFIS is taking $r$-band
data with an average seeing of 0.65 arcsec, which is complete to magnitude 24.5 and thus ideal for
weak-lensing studies. We perform the first weak-lensing analysis of CFIS $r$-band data over an
area spanning 1700 deg$^2$ of the sky. We create a catalogue with measured shapes for 40 million galaxies,
corresponding to an effective density of 6.8 galaxies per square arcminute, and demonstrate a low
level of systematic biases. This work serves as the basis for further cosmological studies using
the full UNIONS survey of 4800 deg$^2$ when completed. Here we present ShapePipe, a newly developed
weak-lensing pipeline. This pipeline makes use of state-of-the-art methods such as Ngmix for accurate
galaxy shape measurement. Shear calibration is performed with metacalibration. We carry out extensive
validation tests on the Point Spread Function (PSF), and on the galaxy shapes. In addition, we create
realistic image simulations to validate the estimated shear. We quantify the PSF model accuracy
and show that the level of systematics is low as measured by the PSF residuals. Their effect on the
shear two-point correlation function is sub-dominant compared to the cosmological contribution
on angular scales <100 arcmin. The additive shear bias is below 5x$10^{-4}$, and the residual multiplicative
shear bias is at most $10^{-3}$ as measured on image simulations. Using COSEBIs we show that there
are no significant B-modes present in second-order shear statistics. We present convergence maps
and see clear correlations of the E-mode with known cluster positions. We measure the stacked tangential
shear profile around Planck clusters at a significance higher than $4\sigma$.

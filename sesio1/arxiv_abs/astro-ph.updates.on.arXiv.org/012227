Galaxy clusters are promising probes of precision cosmology. Their ability to deliver precise,
unbiased, results depends on a better understanding of the intracluster medium (ICM). Active galactic
nuclei (AGN) powered by the central Super-Massive Black Holes (SMBHs) play a major role in modifying
the thermal properties of the ICM. Therefore, understanding the AGN feedback mechanism is essential
for cluster cosmology. In this work, we implement two AGN heating models: (i) by buoyant cavities
rising through stratified ICM (Effervescent model) and, (ii) by viscous and conductive dissipation
of sound waves (Acoustic model). Our aim is to determine whether these heating models are consistent
with ICM observables and if one is preferred over the other. We study the evolution of ICM thermal
profiles with effervescent and acoustic models of AGN heating. We assume an initial entropy profile
of ICM expected from the purely gravitational infall of the gas in the potential of the dark matter
halo. We then incorporate heating, radiative cooling, and thermal conduction over the age of the
clusters. Our results are: (i) We find that both heating processes match well with observations,
with some tuning of relevant parameters. (ii) Thermal conduction is crucially important, even
at the level of 10\% of the Spitzer values, in transferring the injected energy beyond the central
regions, and without which the temperature/entropy profiles do not match with observations. (iii)
We show that the required injected AGN power scales with cluster mass as $M_{\rm vir}^{1.5}$ for
both models. (iv) Moreover, the required AGN luminosity is comparable with the observed radio jet
power, reinforcing the idea that AGNs provide the most dominant heating sources in clusters. (v)
Finally, we estimate that the fraction of the total AGN luminosity available as the AGN mechanical
luminosity at $0.02r_{500}$ is less than 0.05\%.

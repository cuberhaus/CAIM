Small scale processes are thought to be important for the dynamics of the solar atmosphere. While
numerical resolution fundamentally limits their inclusion in MHD simulations, real observations
at the same nominal resolution should still contain imprints of sub-resolution effects. This means
that the synthetic observables from a simulation of given resolution might not be directly comparable
to real observables at the same resolution. It is thus of interest to investigate how inferences
based on synthetic spectra from simulations with different numerical resolutions compare, and
whether these differences persist after the spectra have been spatially degraded to a common resolution.
We aim to compare synthetic spectra obtained from realistic 3D radiative magnetohydrodynamic
(rMHD) simulations run at three different numerical resolutions from the same initial atmosphere,
using very simple methods for inferring line-of-sight velocities and magnetic fields. Additionally
we examine how the differing spatial resolution impacts the results retrieved from the STiC inversion
code. We find that while the simple inferences for all three simulations reveal the same large-scale
tendencies, the higher resolutions yield more fine-grained structures and more extreme line-of-sight
velocities/magnetic fields in concentrated spots even after spatial smearing. We also see indications
that the imprints of sub-resolution effects on the degraded spectra result in systematic errors
in the inversions, and that these errors increase with the amount of sub-resolution effects included.
Fortunately, however, we find that including successively more sub-resolution yields smaller
additional effects; i.e. there is a clear trend of diminishing importance for progressively finer
sub-resolution effects.

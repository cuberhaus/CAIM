Neutron stars are known to show accelerated spin-up of their rotational frequency called a glitch.
A glitch in an isolated neutron star can excite the fundamental (\textit{f})-mode oscillations
which can lead to gravitational wave generation. This gravitational wave signal associated with
stellar fluid oscillations has a damping time of a few seconds and occurs at the frequency range between
$1.5 -3$\,kHz, which is within the detectable range of the current generation of ground-based detectors.
Electromagnetic observations of pulsars (and hence pulsar glitches) require the pulsar to be oriented
so that the jet is pointed towards the detector, but this is not a requirement for gravitational wave
emission which is more isotropic and not jet-like. Hence, gravitational wave observations have
the potential to uncover nearby neutron stars where the jet is not pointed towards the earth. In this
work, we study the prospects of finding glitching neutron stars using a generic all-sky search for
short-duration gravitational wave transients. We set upper limits for the third observing run
of the LIGO--Virgo detectors and present the prospects for upcoming observing runs of LIGO, Virgo,
KAGRA, and LIGO India. We find the detectable glitch size will be around $10^{-5}$\,Hz for the fifth
observing run for pulsars with spin frequency and distance comparable to the Vela pulsar. We also
present the prospects of localizing the direction in the sky of these sources with gravitational
waves alone, which can facilitate electromagnetic follow-up. We find that for the five detector
configuration, the localization capability for a glitch size of $10^{-5}$\,Hz is around 200 square
degrees at $1\sigma$ confidence for $50\%$ of events with distance and spin frequency as that of
Vela.

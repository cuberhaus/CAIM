Pre-main sequence models with inflated radii are needed to simultaneously reproduce the colour-magnitude
diagram and the lithium depletion pattern in young open clusters. We tested a new set of PMS models
including radius inflation due to starspots or magnetic inhibition of convection, using five clusters
observed by the Gaia-ESO Survey, spanning the age range ~10-100 Myr where such effects could be important.
Gaia-ESO radial velocities were combined with Gaia EDR3 astrometry to obtain clean lists of high-probability
members for the five clusters. A Bayesian maximum likelihood method was adopted to derive the best
model parameters and the cluster reddening and age. Models were calculated for different values
of the mixing length parameter ($\alpha_{ML}=2.0$, 1.5 and 1.0), without spots or with effective
spot coverage $\beta_{spot}=0.2$ and 0.4. To reproduce the CMD and the Li depletion pattern in Gamma
Vel A and B and in 25 Ori we need both a reduced convection efficiency $\alpha_{ML}=1.0$ and an effective
spot coverage of ~20%. We obtained ages of 18 Myr and 21 Myr for Gamma Vel A and B, respectively, and
19 Myr for 25 Ori. However, a single isochrone is not sufficient to account for the Li dispersion,
and an increasing level of spot coverage as mass decreases seems to be required. The older clusters
(NGC2451B at 30 Myr, NGC2547 at 35 Myr, and NGC2516 at 138 Myr) are consistent with standard models
($\alpha_{ML}=2.0$ and no spots) except at low masses: a 20% spot coverage seems to reproduce the
sequence of M-type stars better and might explain the observed abundance spread. The quality of
Gaia-ESO data combined with Gaia allows us to gain important insights on PMS evolution. Models including
starspots can provide a consistent explanation of the cluster sequences and Li abundances of young
clusters, although a range of starspot coverage is required to fully reproduce the data.

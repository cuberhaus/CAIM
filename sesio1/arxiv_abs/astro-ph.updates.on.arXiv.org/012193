Any new vector boson with non-zero mass (a `dark photon' or `Proca boson') that is present during
inflation is automatically produced at this time from vacuum fluctuations and can comprise all
or a substantial fraction of the observed dark matter density, as shown by Graham, Mardon, and Rajendran.
We demonstrate, utilising both analytic and numerical studies, that such a scenario implies an
extremely rich dark matter substructure arising purely from the interplay of gravitational interactions
and quantum effects. Due to a remarkable parametric coincidence between the size of the primordial
density perturbations and the scale at which quantum pressure is relevant, a substantial fraction
of the dark matter inevitably collapses into gravitationally bound solitons, which are fully quantum
coherent objects. The central densities of these `dark photon star', or `Proca star', solitons
are typically a factor $10^6$ larger than the local background dark matter density, and they have
characteristic masses of $10^{-16} M_\odot (10^{-5}{\rm eV}/m)^{3/2}$, where $m$ is the mass
of the vector. During and post soliton production a comparable fraction of the energy density is
initially stored in, and subsequently radiated from, long-lived quasi-normal modes. Furthermore,
the solitons are surrounded by characteristic `fuzzy' dark matter halos in which quantum wave-like
properties are also enhanced relative to the usual virialized dark matter expectations. Lower
density compact halos, with masses a factor of $\sim 10^5$ greater than the solitons, form at much
larger scales. We argue that, at minimum, the solitons are likely to survive to the present day without
being tidally disrupted. This rich substructure, which we anticipate also arises from other dark
photon dark matter production mechanisms, opens up a wide range of new direct and indirect detection
possibilities, as we discuss in a companion paper.

W43-MM1 is a young region, very rich in terms of high-mass star formation. We aim to systematically
identify the massive cores which contain a hot core and compare their molecular composition. We
used ALMA high-spatial resolution (2500 au) data of W43-MM1 to identify line-rich protostellar
cores and make a comparative study of their temperature and molecular composition. The identification
of hot cores is based on both the spatial distribution of the complex organic molecules and the contribution
of molecular lines relative to the continuum intensity. We rely on the analysis of CH3CN and CH3CCH
to estimate the temperatures of the selected cores. Finally, we rescale the spectra of the different
hot cores based on their CH3OCHO line intensities to directly compare the detections and line intensities
of the other species. W43-MM1 turns out to be a region rich in massive hot cores with at least 1 less
massive and 7 massive hot cores. The excitation temperature of CH3CN is of the same order for all of
them (120-160 K). There is a factor of up to 30 difference in the intensity of the complex organic molecules
(COMs) lines. However the molecular emission of the hot cores appears to be the same within a factor
2-3. This points towards both a similar chemical composition and excitation of most of the COMs over
these massive cores, which span about an order of magnitude in core mass. In contrast, CH3CCH emission
is found to preferentially trace more the envelope, with a temperature ranging from 50 K to 90 K. Core
1, the most massive hot core of W43-MM1, shows a richer line spectrum than the other cores. In core
2, the emission of O-bearing molecules does not peak at the dust continuum core center; the blue and
red shifted emission correspond to the outflow lobes, suggesting a formation via the sublimation
of the ice mantles through shocks or UV irradiation on the walls of the cavity.

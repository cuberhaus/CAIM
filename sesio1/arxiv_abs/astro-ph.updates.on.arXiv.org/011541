We investigate the final collapse of rotating and non-rotating pulsational pair-instability
supernova progenitors with zero-age-main-sequence masses of 60, 80, and 115$\mathrm{M}_\odot$
and iron cores between 2.37$\mathrm{M}_\odot$ and 2.72$\mathrm{M}_\odot$ by 2D hydrodynamics
simulations. Using the general relativistic NADA-FLD code with energy-dependent three-flavor
neutrino transport by flux-limited diffusion allows us to follow the evolution beyond the moment
when the transiently forming neutron star (NS) collapses to a black hole (BH), which happens within
350$-$580 ms after bounce in all cases. Because of high neutrino luminosities and mean energies,
neutrino heating leads to shock revival within $\lesssim$250 ms post bounce in all cases except
the rapidly rotating 60$\mathrm{M}_\odot$ model. In the latter case, centrifugal effects support
a 10% higher NS mass but reduce the radiated neutrino luminosities and mean energies by $\sim$20%
and $\sim$10%, respectively, and the neutrino-heating rate by roughly a factor of two compared
to the non-rotating counterpart. After BH formation, the neutrino luminosities drop steeply but
continue on a 1$-$2 orders of magnitude lower level for several 100 ms because of aspherical accretion
of neutrino and shock-heated matter, before the ultimately spherical collapse of the outer progenitor
shells suppresses the neutrino emission to negligible values. In all shock-reviving models BH
accretion swallows the entire neutrino-heated matter and the explosion energies decrease from
maxima around 1.5$\times$10$^{51}$erg to zero within a few seconds latest. Nevertheless, the
shock or a sonic pulse moves outward and may trigger mass loss, which we estimate by long-time simulations
with the PROMETHEUS code. We also provide gravitational-wave signals.

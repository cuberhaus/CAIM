The origin of the variable X-ray emission in the $(0.3-30)\,$keV energy range of ultraluminous
X-ray sources (ULXs) remains unclear, making it difficult to constrain the mass of the central compact
object. X-ray luminosities of bright ULXs can be explained with sub-critical accretion ($L<L_{\rm
Edd}$) on to an intermediate-mass BH, with the alternative being super-critical accretion on to
a stellar-mass BH. Broadband X-ray emission in the former scenario can be explained using the canonical
disk plus Comptonizing corona model, whereas in the latter scenario radiation pressure driven
massive winds lead to complex spectra that are inclination angle dependent. Here we fit the broadband
(optical/UV to X-ray) spectrum of the persistently bright ULX Holmberg IX X-1 with the disk-corona
plus irradiated outer disk model in an effort to constrain the BH mass. We use a one-zone time-dependent
numerical code to exactly solve for the steady-state properties of the optically thick coronal
photon-electron-positron plasma. Our modelling suggests that Holmberg IX X-1 hosts a stellar
mass BH, with mass $4\lesssim(\hat M_{\rm BH}\equiv\alpha M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot)\lesssim10$ where
$1/6\leq\alpha<1$ for a spinning (Kerr) BH, undergoing super-critical accretion ($L_{\rm Bol}/L_{\rm
Edd}\sim20\alpha$). In our model, the X-ray spectrum below $10\,$keV is explained with an absorbed
multi-colour disk spectrum having inner disk temperature $k_BT_{\rm in}\sim(2.2-2.9)\,$keV.
An additional cooler thermal spectral component, as found in many works and not included in our modeling,
is required. The hard excess above $10\,$keV, as seen by NuSTAR, arises in a photon-rich optically-thick
Comptonizing spherical corona with optical depth $\tau_T\sim3.5$ and particle temperature $k_BT_e\sim14\,$keV.

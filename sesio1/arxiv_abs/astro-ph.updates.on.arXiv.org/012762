(Abridged) In this paper, we use the Tuffs et al. attenuation - inclination models in ultraviolet
(UV), optical, and near-infrared (NIR) bands to investigate the average global dust properties
in galaxies as a function of stellar mass $M_{*}$, stellar mass surface density $\mu_{*}$, star-formation
rate $SFR$, specific star-formation rate $sSFR$, star-formation main-sequence offset $dMS$,
and star-formation rate surface density $\Sigma_{SFR}$ at redshifts $z \sim 0$ and $z \sim 0.7$.
We use star-forming galaxies from SDSS ($\sim$ 20000) and GAMA ($\sim$ 2000) to form our low-z sample
at $0.04 < z < 0.1$ and star-forming galaxies from COSMOS ($\sim$ 2000) for the sample at $0.6 <z < 0.8$.
We find that galaxies at $z \sim 0.7$ have higher optical depth $\tau_{B}^{f}$ and clumpiness $F$
than galaxies at $z \sim 0$. The increase in $F$ hints that the stars of $z \sim 0.7$ galaxies are less
likely to escape their birth cloud, which might indicate that the birth clouds are larger. We also
found that $\tau_{B}^{f}$ increases with $M_{*}$ and $\mu_{*}$independent of sample and therefore
redshift. We found no clear trends in $\tau_{B}^{f}$ or $F$ with $SFR$, which could imply that the
dust mass distribution is independent of $SFR$. In turn, this would imply that the balance of dust
formation and destruction is independent of the $SFR$. Based on an analysis of the inclination-dependence
of the Balmer decrement, we find that reproducing the Balmer line emission requires not only a completely
optically thick dust component associated with star forming regions, as in the standard Tuffs et
al. model, but an extra component of optically thin dust within the birth clouds. This new component
implies the existence of dust inside HII regions that attenuates the Balmer emission before it escapes
through gaps in the birth cloud and we find it is more important in high-mass galaxies.

We present the results from a systematic X-ray analysis of Subaru optically-selected clusters
with high cluster richness in the eROSITA Final Equatorial-Depth Survey (eFEDS) field. By a joint
analysis of SRG(Spectrum Roentgen Gamma)/eROSITA and Subaru/HSC surveys, we aim to investigate
the dynamical status of the optically-selected clusters and derive the cluster scaling relations.
The sample consists of 43 optically-selected galaxy clusters with richness $>40$ in the redshift
range of 0.16--0.89. We systematically analyzed X-ray images and emission spectra using the eROSITA
data. We identified the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) using the optical and far-infrared databases
and measured the offset between X-ray peak and BCG position as an indicator of the dynamical status.
We investigated the luminosity-temperature and mass-luminosity relations based on eROSITA X-ray
spectra and HSC weak-lensing data analyses. The fraction of relaxed clusters is estimated to be
$2(<39)$\%, which is smaller than that of the X-ray-selected cluster samples. After correcting
for a selection bias due to the richness cut, we obtained a shallow $L-T$ slope of $2.0\pm0.4$, which
is consistent with the predictions of the self-similar model and the new baseline model by Fujita
& Aung (2019). The $L-M$ slope of $1.5\pm0.3$ agrees with the above theoretical models and that of
the shear-selected clusters in the eFEDs field. Our analysis of the high-richness optical clusters
yielded a small fraction of relaxed clusters and a shallow slope of the luminosity-temperature
relation. This suggests that the average X-ray properties of the optical clusters are likely to
be different from those observed in the X-ray samples. Thus, the joint eROSITA and HSC observations
are powerful in extending the analysis to a larger sample and understanding the selection effect
towards establishing the cluster scaling relations.

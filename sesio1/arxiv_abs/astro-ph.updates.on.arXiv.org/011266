Early-type galaxies (ETGs) possess total radial density profiles that are largely described by
singular isothermal spheres, which can lead to non-Gaussian line-of-sight velocity dispersion
(LOSVD) under anisotropic stellar orbits. However, recent observations of local ETGs in the MASSIVE
Survey reveal outer kinematic structures at $1.5 R_{eff}$ that are inconsistent with fixed isothermal
density profiles; the authors proposed varying density profiles as an explanation. We aim to verify
this conjecture and understand the influence of stellar assembly on the formation of these non-canonical
kinematic features through mock ETGs with well-studied density profiles in IllustrisTNG. We create
2D maps mimicking integral-field-unit (IFU) observations to extract projected stellar kinematic
features for 207 ETGs in the TNG100-1 box with stellar mass $M_{\ast} > 10^{11} M_{\odot}$. The mock
observations reproduce the key outer ($1.5R_{eff}$) kinematic structures in the MASSIVE ETGs,
including the puzzling positive correlation between velocity dispersion profile outer slope
$\gamma_{outer}$ and the kurtosis $h_4$'s gradient. We find that $h_4$ is uncorrelated with stellar
orbital anisotropy beyond $R_{eff}$; instead we find that the variations in $\gamma_{outer}$
and outer $h_4$ (which dominates the $h_4$ gradient) are both driven by variations of the density
profile at the outskirts across different ETGs. These findings corroborate the proposed conjecture
and rule out velocity anisotropy as the dominant driver of non-Gaussian outer kinematic structure
in ETGs. We also find that the outer kurtosis and anisotropy correlate with different stellar assembly
components, with the former related to minor mergers or flyby interactions while the latter is mainly
driven by major mergers, suggesting distinct stellar assembly origins that decorrelates these
two properties.

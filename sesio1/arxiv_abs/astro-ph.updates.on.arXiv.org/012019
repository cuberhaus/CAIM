The atmospheres of a large proportion of white dwarf stars are polluted by heavy elements that are
expected to sink out of visible layers on short timescales. This has been interpreted as a signature
of ongoing accretion of debris from asteroids, comets, and giant planets. This scenario is supported
by the detection of debris discs and transits of planetary fragments around some white dwarfs. However,
photospheric metals are only indirect evidence for ongoing accretion, and the inferred accretion
rates and parent body compositions heavily depend on models of diffusion and mixing processes within
the white dwarf atmosphere. Here we report a 4.4$\sigma$ detection of X-rays from a polluted white
dwarf, G29$-$38, using a 106 ks exposure with the Chandra X-ray Observatory, demonstrating directly
that the star is currently accreting. From the measured X-ray luminosity, we find an instantaneous
accretion rate of $\dot{M_{\rm X}}=1.63^{+1.29}_{-0.40}\times 10^{9}\mathrm{\,g\,s^{-1}}$.
This is the first direct measurement of the accretion rate onto the white dwarf, which is independent
of stellar atmosphere models. This rate exceeds estimates based on past studies of the photospheric
abundances by more than a factor two, and implies that convective overshoot has to be accounted for
in modelling the spectra of debris-accreting white dwarfs. We measure a low plasma temperature
of $kT=0.5\pm0.2\,\mathrm{keV}$, corroborating the predicted bombardment solution for white
dwarfs accreting at low accretion rates. Offering a new method for studying evolved planetary systems,
these observations provide the opportunity to independently measure the instantaneous accretion
rate of planetary material, and therefore investigate the timescale of accretion onto white dwarfs,
and the evolution and replenishment of debris disks.

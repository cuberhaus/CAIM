[Abridged] We present a novel method that takes advantage of the unique capabilities of the Gaia
satellite to obtain large and reliable samples of dual or lensed AGN candidates with sub-arcsec
separations, by selecting targets showing multiple peaks in the Gaia scans. With this method, we
have identified 260 multiple system candidates, 26 of which have archival Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) images. All these images show two or more point-sources at sub-arcsec separations, thus confirming
that the proposed technique can be extremely efficient at small separations. Thirteen out of these
26 systems are known gravitational lenses, and two have been previously classified as dual AGNs.
One of these two systems has an HST/STIS spatially resolved spectrum showing two distinct AGNs at
z=2.95 with 3.6 kpc (0.46 arcsec) separation, confirming the previous identification as dual AGN.
Dedicated adaptive-optics (AO) assisted high-resolution imaging at the Large Binocular Telescope
(LBT) of 5 systems also detected multiple components in all the targets, further confirming the
selection method. The measured separations are between 0.33 and 0.66 arcsec (2.7 - 5.6 kpc at the
distance of the primary AGN). The nature of the unclassified sources is uncertain. Several tests
demonstrate that contamination from foreground stars can only account for ~30% of these multiple
systems, and the analysis of the observed colours suggests that most of the selected systems are
expected to be dual/lensed AGNs with physical separations between 3 and 5 kpc. Our results show that
this is a very efficient technique to select compact dual/lensed AGN systems with sub-arcsec separations,
complementing other methods. This method samples separation down to 2 kpc at z>1 and thus allows
us to probe the physical processes driving the inspiralling of the pairs of SMBH inside a single galaxy.

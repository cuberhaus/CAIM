In this paper we report the first identification of jellyfish galaxies in the Perseus cluster (Abell
426). We identified four jellyfish galaxies (LEDA 2191078, MCG +07-07-070, UGC 2654, UGC 2665)
within the central $2^\circ \times 2^\circ$ ($2.6\,\mathrm{Mpc} \times 2.6\,\mathrm{Mpc}$)
of Perseus based on the presence of one-sided radio continuum tails that were detected at $144\,\mathrm{MHz}$
by the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR). The observed radio tails, as well as the orientation of morphological
features in the rest-frame optical, are consistent with these four galaxies being impacted by ram
pressure stripping as they orbit through the Perseus intracluster medium. By combining the LOFAR
imaging at 144 MHz with 344 MHz imaging from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, we derived spectral
indices for the disks and the stripped tails of these jellyfish galaxies. We show that the spectral
indices over the galaxy disks are quite flat, while the indices of the stripped tails are substantially
steeper. We also identified a number of compact $\mathrm{H\alpha + [NII]}$ sources with narrowband
imaging from the Isaac Newton Telescope. These sources are brighter along the leading side of the
galaxy (i.e., opposite to the direction of the stripped tail), which is consistent with ram pressure
induced star formation. Lastly, consistent with previous works in other clusters, we find that
these jellyfish galaxies show enhanced radio luminosities for their observed star formation rates.
Given the small distance to the Perseus cluster ($D \sim 70\,\mathrm{Mpc}$, $1'' \simeq 340\,\mathrm{pc}$),
these galaxies are excellent candidates for multiwavelength follow-up observations to probe
the impact of ram pressure stripping on galaxy star formation at subkiloparsec scales.

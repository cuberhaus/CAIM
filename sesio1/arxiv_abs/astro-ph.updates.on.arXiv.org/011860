Oscillating red-giant stars in binary systems are an ideal testbed for investigating the structure
and evolution of stars in the advanced phases of evolution. With 83 known red-giants in binary systems,
of which only about 40 have determined global seismic parameters and orbital parameters, the sample
is slender compared to the numerous known oscillating stars. The detection of red-giant binary
systems is typically obtained from the signature of stellar binarity in space photometry. The time
base of such data biases the detection towards systems with shorter periods and orbits of insufficient
size to allow a red-giant to fully extend as it evolves up the red-giant branch. Consequently, the
sample shows an excess of H-shell burning giants while being sparse of stars in the He-core burning
phase. From the ninth catalogue of spectroscopic binary orbits (SB9), we identified candidate
systems hosting a red-giant primary component. Searching space photometry from the NASA missions
Kepler, K2, and TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) as well as the BRITE (BRIght Target
Explorer) constellation mission, we found 99 systems, which were previously unknown of hosting
an oscillating giant component. The revised search strategy allowed us to extend the range of orbital
periods of systems hosting oscillating giants up to 26000 days. Such wide orbits allow for a rich
population of He-core burning primaries, which are required for a complete view on stellar evolution
from binary studies. Tripling the size of known oscillating red-giant stars in binary systems is
an important step towards an ensemble approach for seismology and tidal studies. While for non-eclipsing
binaries the inclination is unknown, such a seismically well-characterized sample will be a treasure
trove in combination with Gaia astrometric orbits for binary systems.

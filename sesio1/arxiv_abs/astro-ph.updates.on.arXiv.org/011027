In the context of a Hubble tension problem that is growing in its statistical significance, we reconsider
the effectiveness of non-parametric reconstruction techniques which are independent of prescriptive
cosmological models. By taking cosmic chronometers, Type Ia Supernovae and baryonic acoustic
oscillation data, we compare and contrast two important reconstruction approaches, namely Gaussian
processes (GP) and the \textbf{Lo}cally w\textbf{e}ighted \textbf{S}catterplot \textbf{S}moothing
together with \textbf{Sim}ulation and \textbf{ex}trapolation method (LOESS-Simex or LS). In
the context of these methods, besides not requiring a cosmological model, they also do not require
physical parameters in their approach to their reconstruction of data (but they do depend on statistical
hyperparameters). We firstly show how both GP and LOESS-Simex can be used to successively reconstruct
various data sets to a high level of precision. We then directly compare both approaches in a quantitative
manner by considering several factors, such as how well the reconstructions approximate the data
sets themselves to how their respective uncertainties evolve. In light of the puzzling Hubble tension,
it is important to consider how the uncertain regions evolve over redshift and the methods compare
for estimating cosmological parameters at current times. For cosmic chronometers and baryonic
acoustic oscillation compiled data sets, we find that GP generically produce smaller variances
for the reconstructed data with a minimum value of $\sigma_{\rm GP-min} = 1.1$, while the situation
for LS is totally different with a minimum of $\sigma_{\rm LS-min} = 50.8$. Moreover, some of these
characteristics can be alleviate at low $z$, where LS presents less underestimation in comparison
to GP.

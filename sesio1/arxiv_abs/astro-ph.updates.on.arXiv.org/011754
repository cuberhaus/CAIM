In 2017, the California-Kepler Survey (CKS) published its first data release (DR1) of high-resolution
optical spectra of 1305 planet hosts. Refined CKS planet radii revealed that small planets are bifurcated
into two distinct populations: super-Earths (smaller than 1.5 $R_E$) and sub-Neptunes (between
2.0 and 4.0 $R_E$), with few planets in between (the "Radius Gap.") Several theoretical models of
the Radius Gap predict variation with stellar mass, but testing these predictions are challenging
with CKS DR1 due to its limited $M_\star$ range of 0.8-1.4 $M_\odot$. Here, we present CKS DR2 with
411 additional spectra and derived properties focusing on stars of 0.5-0.8 $M_\odot$. We found
the Radius Gap follows $R_p \propto P^m$ with $m = -0.10 \pm 0.03$, consistent with predictions of
XUV- and core-powered mass-loss mechanisms. We found no evidence that $m$ varies with $M_\star$.
We observed a correlation between the average sub-Neptune size and $M_\star$. Over 0.5 to 1.4 $M_\odot$,
the average sub-Neptune grows from 2.1 to 2.6 $R_E$, following $R_p \propto M_\star^\alpha$ with
$\alpha = 0.25 \pm 0.03$. In contrast, there is no detectable change for super-Earths. These $M_\star$-$R_p$
trends suggests that protoplanetary disks can efficiently produce cores up to a threshold mass
of $M_c$, which grows linearly with stellar mass according to $M_c \approx 10 M_E~(M_\star / M_\odot)$.
There is no significant correlation between sub-Neptune size and stellar metallicity (over $-$0.5
to $+$0.5 dex) suggesting a weak relationship between planet envelope opacity and stellar metallicity.
Finally, there is no significant variation in sub-Neptune size with stellar age (over 1 to 10 Gyr),
which suggests that the majority of envelope contraction concludes after $\sim$1 Gyr.

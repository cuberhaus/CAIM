Observations and models of giant planets indicate that such objects are enriched in heavy elements
compared to solar abundances. The prevailing view is that giant planets accreted multiple Earth
masses of heavy elements after the end of core formation. Such late solid enrichment is commonly
explained by the accretion of planetesimals. Planetesimals are expected to form at the edges of
planetary gaps, and here we address the question of whether these planetesimals can be accreted
in large enough amounts to explain the inferred high heavy element contents of giant planets. We
perform a series of N-body simulations of the dynamics of planetesimals and planets during the planetary
growth phase, taking into account gas drag as well as the enhanced collision cross-section caused
by the extended envelopes. We consider the growth of Jupiter and Saturn via gas accretion after reaching
the pebble isolation mass and we include their migration in an evolving disk. We find that the accretion
efficiency of planetesimals formed at planetary gap edges is very low: less than 10% of the formed
planetesimals are accreted even in the most favorable cases, which in our model corresponds to a
few Earth-masses. When planetesimals are assumed to form beyond the feeding zone of the planets,
extending to a few Hill radii from a planet, accretion becomes negligible. Furthermore, we find
that the accretion efficiency increases when the planetary migration distance is increased and
that the efficiency does not increase when the planetesimal radii are decreased. Based on these
results we conclude that it is difficult to explain the large heavy element content of giant planets
with planetesimal accretion during the gas accretion phase. Alternative processes most likely
are required, e.g. accretion of vapor deposited by drifting pebbles.

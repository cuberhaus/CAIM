Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the solar corona have become more popular with the increased
availability of computational power. Modern computational plasma codes, relying upon Computational
Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods, allow for resolving the coronal features using solar surface magnetograms
as inputs. These computations are carried out in a full 3D domain and thus selection of the right mesh
configuration is essential to save computational resources and enable/speed up convergence.
In addition, it has been observed that for MHD simulations close to the hydrostatic equilibrium,
spurious numerical artefacts might appear in the solution following the mesh structure, which
makes the selection of the grid also a concern for accuracy. The purpose of this paper is to discuss
and trade off two main mesh topologies when applied to global solar corona simulations using the
unstructured ideal MHD solver from the COOLFluiD platform. The first topology is based on the geodesic
polyhedron and the second on UV mapping. Focus will be placed on aspects such as mesh adaptability,
resolution distribution, resulting spurious numerical fluxes and convergence performance.
For this purpose, firstly a rotating dipole case is investigated, followed by two simulations using
real magnetograms from the solar minima (1995) and solar maxima (1999). It is concluded that the
most appropriate mesh topology for the simulation depends on several factors, such as the accuracy
requirements, the presence of features near the polar regions and/or strong features in the flow
field in general. If convergence is of concern and the simulation contains strong dynamics, then
grids which are based on the geodesic polyhedron are recommended compared to more conventionally
used UV-mapped meshes.

As a completely independent method, the measurement of time delay of strongly lensed quasars (TDSL)
are crucial to resolve the Hubble tension. Extensive monitoring is required but so far limited to
a small sample of strongly lensed quasars. Together with several partner institutes, Beijing Normal
University is constructing a 1.93m reflector telescope at the Muztagh-Ata site in west China, which
has the world class observing conditions. The telescope will be equipped with both a three-channel
imager/photometer which covers $3500-11000$ Angstrom wavelength band, and a low-medium resolution
($\lambda/\delta\lambda=500/2000/7500$) spectrograph. In this paper, we investigate the capability
of Muztagh-Ata 1.93m telescope in measuring time delays of strongly lensed quasars. We generate
mock strongly lensed quasar systems and light curves with microlensing effects based on five known
strongly lensed quasars, i.e., RX J1131-1231, HE 0435-1223, PG 1115+080, WFI 2033-4723 and SDSS
1206+4332. In particular, RX J1131-1231 is generated with lens modeling in this work. Due to lack
of enough information, we simulate the other 4 systems with the public data without lens modeling.
According to simulations, for RX J1131-like systems (wide variation in time delay between images)
the TDSL measurement can be achieved with the precision about $\Delta t=0.5$ day with 4 seasons campaign
length and 1 day cadence. This accuracy is comparable to the up-coming TDCOSMO project. And it would
be better when the campaign length keeps longer and with high cadence. As a result, the capability
of Muztagh-Ata 1.93m telescope allows it to join the network of TDSL observatories. It will enrich
the database for strongly lensed quasar observations and make more precise measurements of time
delays, especially considering the unique coordinate of the site.

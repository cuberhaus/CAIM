We investigate how the X-ray circumgalactic medium (CGM) of present-day galaxies depends on galaxy
morphology and azimuthal angle using mock observations generated from the EAGLE cosmological
hydrodynamic simulation. By creating mock stacks of {\it eROSITA}-observed galaxies oriented
to be edge-on, we make several observationally-testable predictions for galaxies in the stellar
mass range $M_\star=10^{10.7-11.2}\;$M$_{\odot}$. The soft X-ray CGM of disc galaxies is between
60 and 100\% brighter along the semi-major axis compared to the semi-minor axis, between 10-30 kpc.
This azimuthal dependence is a consequence of the hot ($T>10^6$ K) CGM being non-spherical: specifically
it is flattened along the minor axis such that denser and more luminous gas resides in the disc plane
and co-rotates with the galaxy. Outflows enrich and heat the CGM preferentially perpendicular
to the disc, but we do not find an observationally-detectable signature along the semi-minor axis.
Spheroidal galaxies have hotter CGMs than disc galaxies related to spheroids residing at higher
halos masses, which may be measurable through hardness ratios spanning the $0.2-1.5$ keV band.
While spheroids appear to have brighter CGMs than discs for the selected fixed $M_\star$ bin, this
owes to spheroids having higher stellar and halo masses within that $M_\star$ bin, and obscures
the fact that both simulated populations have similar total CGM luminosities at the exact same $M_\star$.
Discs have brighter emission inside 20 kpc and more steeply declining profiles with radius than
spheroids. We predict that the {\it eROSITA} 4-year all-sky survey should detect many of the signatures
we predict here, although targeted follow-up observations of highly inclined nearby discs after
the survey may be necessary to observe some of our azimuthally-dependent predictions.

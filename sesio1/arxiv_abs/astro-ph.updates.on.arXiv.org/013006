We present photometric, astrometric, and kinematic studies of the old open star clusters NGC 1193
and NGC 1798. Both of the clusters are investigated by combining data sets from Gaia EDR3 and CCD UBV
observational data. Analysis of the radial distribution of stars through the cluster regions indicates
that the cluster limit radii are $r_{\rm lim}=8'$ for both of the clusters. We determine the membership
probabilities of stars considering Gaia EDR3 proper motion and trigonometric parallax data, resulting
in 361 stars in NGC 1193 and 428 in NGC 1798 being identified as most likely cluster members, having
membership probabilities greater than P>0.5. Mean proper motion components are estimated as ($\mu_{\alpha}\cos
\delta$, $\mu_{\delta}) = (-0.207(0.009), -0.431(0.008)$) for NGC 1193 and ($\mu_{\alpha}\cos
\delta$, $\mu_{\delta})=(0.793(0.006), -0.373(0.005)$) mas/yr for NGC 1798. E(B-V) color excesses
were derived for NGC 1193 as $0.150(0.037)$ and for NGC 1798 as 0.505(0.100) mag through the use of
two-color diagrams. Photometric metallicities are also determined from two-color diagrams with
the results of [Fe/H] = -0.30(0.06) dex for NGC 1193 and [Fe/H]=-0.20(0.07) dex for NGC 1798. The
isochrone fitting distance and age of NGC 1193 are 5562(381) pc and 4.6(1) Gyr, respectively. For
NGC 1798, these parameters are 4451(728) pc and 1.3(0.2) Gyr. These ages indicate that NGC 1193 and
NGC 1798 are old open clusters. The overall present-day mass function slopes for main-sequence
stars are found as 1.38(2.16) for NGC 1193 and 1.30(0.21) for NGC 1798, which are in fair agreement
with the value of Salpeter (1955). Kinematic and dynamic orbital calculations indicate that NGC
1193 and NGC 1798 belong to the thick-disk and thin-disk populations, respectively. In addition,
both of the clusters were born outside the solar circle, and both orbit in the metal-poor region of
the Galactic disk.

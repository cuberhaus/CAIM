The intensity mapping of the [CII] 158um line redshifted to the sub-mm window is a promising probe
of the z>4 star formation and its spatial distribution into the large-scale structure. To prepare
the first-generation experiments (e.g., CONCERTO), we need realistic simulations of the sub-mm
extragalactic sky in spectroscopy. We present a new version of the SIDES simulation including the
main sub-mm lines around 1mm (CO, [CII], [CI]). This approach successfully reproduces the observed
line luminosity functions. We then use our simulation to generate CONCERTO-like cubes (125-305GHz)
and forecast the power spectra of the fluctuations caused by the various astrophysical components
at those frequencies. Depending on our assumptions on the relation between star formation rate
and [CII] luminosity, and the star formation history, our predictions of the z~6 [CII] power spectrum
vary by two orders of magnitude. This highlights how uncertain the predictions are and how important
future measurements will be to improve our understanding of this early epoch. SIDES can reproduce
the CO shot noise recently measured at ~100 GHz by the mmIME experiment. Finally, we compare the contribution
of the different astrophysical components at various redshift to the power spectra. The continuum
is by far the brightest, by a factor of 3 to 100 depending on the frequency. At 300GHz, the CO foreground
power spectrum is higher than the [CII] one for our base scenario. At lower frequency, the contrast
between [CII] and extragalactic foregrounds is even worse. Masking the known galaxies from deep
surveys should allow to reduce the foregrounds to 20% of the [CII] power spectrum up to z~6.5. However,
this masking method will not be sufficient at higher redshifts. The code and the products of our simulation
are released publicly and can be used for both intensity mapping experiments and sub-mm continuum
and line surveys.

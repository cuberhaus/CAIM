Hydrogen Ly${\alpha}$ haloes (LAHs) are commonly used as a tracer of the circumgalactic medium
(CGM) at high redshifts. In this work, we aim to explore the existence of Ly${\alpha}$ haloes around
individual UV-selected galaxies, rather than around Ly${\alpha}$ emitters (LAEs), at high redshifts.
Our sample was continuum-selected with F775W<=27.5, and spectroscopic redshifts were assigned
or constrained for all the sources thanks to the deepest (100- to 140-hour) existing Very Large Telescope
(VLT)/Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) data with adaptive optics. The final sample includes
21 galaxies that are purely F775W-magnitude selected within the redshift range z=2.9-4.4 and within
a UV magnitude range -20<=M1500<= -18, thus avoiding any bias toward LAEs. We tested whether galaxy's
Ly${\alpha}$ emission is significantly more extended than the MUSE PSF-convolved continuum component.
We find 17 LAHs and four non-LAHs. We report the first individual detections of extended Ly${\alpha}$
emission around non-LAEs. The Ly${\alpha}$ halo fraction is thus as high as $81.0^{+10.3}_{-11.2}$%,
which is close to that for LAEs at z=3-6 in the literature. This implies that UV-selected galaxies
generally have a large amount of hydrogen in their CGM. We derived the mean surface brightness (SB)
profile for our LAHs with cosmic dimming corrections and find that Ly${\alpha}$ emission extends
to 5.4 arcsec (~40 physical kpc at the midpoint redshift z=3.6) above the typical 1${\sigma}$ SB
limit. The incidence rate of surrounding gas detected in Ly${\alpha}$ per one-dimensional line
of sight per unit redshift, dn/dz, is estimated to be $0.76^{+0.09}_{-0.09}$ for galaxies with
M1500<= -18 mag at z~3.7. Assuming that Ly${\alpha}$ emission and absorption arise in the same gas,
this suggests, based on abundance matching, that LAHs trace the same gas as damped Ly${\alpha}$
systems (DLAs) and sub-DLAs.

A currently unsolved question in supernova research is the origin of stripped-envelope supernovae
(SESNe). Such SNe lack spectral signatures of hydrogen (Type Ib), or hydrogen and helium (Type Ic),
indicating that the outer stellar layers have been stripped during their evolution. The mechanism
for this is not well understood, and to disentangle the different scenarios determination of nucleosynthesis
yields from observed spectra can be attempted. However, the interpretation of observations depends
on the adopted spectral models. A previously missing ingredient in these is the inclusion of molecular
effects, which can be significant. We aim to investigate how the molecular chemistry in stripped-envelope
supernovae affects physical conditions and optical spectra and produces ro-vibrational emission
in the mid-infrared (MIR). We also aim to assess the diagnostic potential of observations of such
MIR emission with JWST. We couple a chemical kinetic network including carbon, oxygen, silicon,
and sulfur-bearing molecules into the NLTE spectral synthesis code SUMO. We let four species - CO,
SiO, SiS and SO - participate in the NLTE cooling of the gas to achieve self-consistency between the
molecule formation and the temperature. We apply the new framework to model the spectrum of a Type
Ic supernova in the 100-600d time range. Molecules are predicted to form in SESN ejecta in significant
quantities (typical mass $10^{-3}$ $M_\odot$) throughout the 100-600d interval. The impact on
the temperature and optical emission depends on the density of the oxygen zones and varies with epoch.
For example, the [O I] 6300, 6364 feature can be quenched by molecules from 200 to 450d depending on
density. The MIR predictions show strong emission in the fundamental bands of CO, SiO, and SiS, and
in the CO and SiO overtones.

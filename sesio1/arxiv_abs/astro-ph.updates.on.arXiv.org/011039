The feedback from young stars (i.e. pre-supernova) is thought to play a crucial role in molecular
cloud destruction. In this paper, we assess the feedback mechanisms acting within a sample of 5810
HII regions identified from the PHANGS-MUSE survey of 19 nearby ($<$ 20 Mpc) star-forming, main
sequence spiral galaxies (log($M_\star$/M$_\odot$)= 9.4 $-$ 11). These optical spectroscopic
maps are essential to constrain the physical properties of the HII regions, which we use to investigate
their internal pressure terms. We estimate the photoionised gas ($P_\mathrm{therm}$), direct
radiation ($P_\mathrm{rad}$), and mechanical wind pressure ($P_\mathrm{wind}$), which we compare
to the confining pressure of their host environment ($P_\mathrm{de}$). The HII regions remain
unresolved within our ${\sim}50{-}100$ pc resolution observations, so we place upper ($P_\mathrm{max}$)
and lower ($P_\mathrm{min}$) limits on each of the pressures by using a minimum (i.e. clumpy structure)
and maximum (i.e. smooth structure) size, respectively. We find that the $P_\mathrm{max}$ measurements
are broadly similar, and for $P_\mathrm{min}$ the $P_\mathrm{therm}$ is mildly dominant. We find
that the majority of HII regions are over-pressured, $P_\mathrm{tot}/P_\mathrm{de} = (P_\mathrm{therm}+P_\mathrm{wind}+P_\mathrm{rad})/P_\mathrm{de}
> 1$, and expanding, yet there is a small sample of compact HII regions with $P_\mathrm{tot,max}/P_\mathrm{de}
< 1$ ($\sim$1% of the sample). These mostly reside in galaxy centres ($R_\mathrm{gal}<1$kpc),
or, specifically, environments of high gas surface density; log($\Sigma_\mathrm{gas}/\mathrm{M_\odot}
\mathrm{pc}^{-2}$)$\sim$2.5 (measured on kpc-scales). Lastly, we compare to a sample of literature
measurements for $P_\mathrm{therm}$ and $P_\mathrm{rad}$ to investigate how dominant pressure
term transitions over around 5dex in spatial dynamic range and 10 dex in pressure.

Bright, high redshift ($z>6$) QSOs are powerful probes of the ionisation state of the intervening
intergalactic medium (IGM). The detection of Ly$\alpha$ damping wing absorption imprinted in
the spectrum of high-z QSOs can provide strong constraints on the epoch of reionisation (EoR). In
this work, we perform an independent Ly$\alpha$ damping wing analysis of two known $z>7$ QSOs; DESJ0252-0503
at $z=7.00$ (Wang et al.) and J1007+2115 at $z=7.51$ (Yang et al.). For this, we utilise our existing
Bayesian framework which simultaneously accounts for uncertainties in: (i) the intrinsic Ly$\alpha$
emission profile (reconstructed from a covariance matrix of measured emission lines; extended
in this work to include NV) and (ii) the distribution of ionised (H\,{\scriptsize II}) regions within
the IGM using a $1.6^3$ Gpc$^3$ reionisation simulation. This approach is complementary to that
used in the aforementioned works as it focuses solely redward of Ly$\alpha$ ($1218 < \lambda < 1230$\AA)
making it more robust to modelling uncertainties while also using a different methodology for (i)
and (ii). We find, for a fiducial EoR morphology, $\bar{x}_{\rm HI} = 0.64\substack{+0.19 \\ -0.23}$
(68 per cent) at $z=7$ and $\bar{x}_{\rm HI} = 0.27\substack{+0.21 \\ -0.17}$ at $z=7.51$ consistent
within $1\sigma$ to the previous works above, though both are slightly lower in amplitude. Following
the inclusion of NV into our reconstruction pipeline, we perform a reanalysis of ULASJ1120+0641
at $z=7.09$ (Mortlock et al.) and ULASJ1342+0928 at $z=7.54$ (Ba\~nados et al.) finding $\bar{x}_{\rm
HI} = 0.44\substack{+0.23 \\ -0.24}$ at $z=7.09$ and $\bar{x}_{\rm HI} = 0.31\substack{+0.18
\\ -0.19}$ at $z=7.54$. Finally, we combine the QSO damping wing constraints for all four $z\gtrsim7$
QSOs to obtain a single, unified constraint of $\bar{x}_{\rm HI} = 0.49\substack{+0.11 \\ -0.11}$
at $z=7.29$.

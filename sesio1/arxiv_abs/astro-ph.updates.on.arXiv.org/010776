We present and analyze a near infrared(NIR) spectrum of the under-luminous Type Ia supernova SN~2020qxp/ASASSN-20jq
obtained with NIRES at the Keck Observatory 191 days after B-band maximum. The spectrum is dominated
by a number of broad emission features including the [FeII] at 1.644mu which is highly asymmetric
with a tilted top and a peak red-shifted by ~2,000km/s. In comparison with 2-D non-LTE synthetic
spectra computed from 3-D simulations of off-center delayed-detonation Chandrasekhar-mass
white-dwarf(WD) models, we find good agreement between the observed lines and the synthetic profiles,
and are able to unravel the structure of the progenitor's envelope. We find that the size and tilt
of the [Fe II] 1.644mu-profile (in velocity space) is an effective way to determine the location
of an off-center delayed-detonation transition (DDT) and the viewing angle, and it requires a WD
with a high central density of ~4E9$g/cm^3$. We also tentatively identify a stable Ni feature around
1.9mu characterized by a `pot-belly' profile that is slightly offset with respect to the kinematic
center. In the case of SN~2020qxp/ASASSN-20jq, we estimate that the location of the DDT is ~0.3M(WD)
off-center, which gives rise to an asymmetric distribution of the underlying ejecta. We also demonstrate
that low-luminosity and high-density WD SNIa progenitors exhibit a very strong overlap of Ca and
56Ni in physical space. This results in the formation of a prevalent [Ca II] 0.73mu emission feature,
which is sensitive to asymmetry effects. Our findings are discussed within the context of alternative
scenarios, including off-center C/O detonations in He-triggered sub-M(Ch)-WDs and the direct
collision of two WDs. Snapshot programs with Gemini/Keck/VLT/ELT class instruments and our spectropolarimetry
program are complementary to mid-IR spectra by JWST.

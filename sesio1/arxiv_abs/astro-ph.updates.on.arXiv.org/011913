Interest rises to exploit the full shape information of the galaxy power spectrum, as well as pushing
analyses to smaller non-linear scales. Here I use the halo model to quantify the information content
in the tomographic angular power spectrum of galaxies, for future high resolution surveys : Euclid
and SKA2. I study how this information varies as a function of the scale cut applied, either with angular
cut $\ell_{max}$ or physical cut kmax. For this, I use analytical covariances with the most complete
census of non-Gaussian terms, which proves critical. I find that the Fisher information on most
cosmological and astrophysical parameters follows a striking behaviour. Beyond the perturbative
regime we first get decreasing returns : the information keeps rising but the slope slows down until
reaching a saturation. The location of this plateau is a bit beyond the reach of current modeling
methods : k $\sim$ 2 Mpc$^{-1}$ and slightly depends on the parameter and redshift bin considered.
I explain the origin of this plateau, which is due to non-linear effects both on the power spectrum,
and more importantly on non-Gaussian covariance terms. Then, pushing further we see the information
rising again in the highly non-linear regime, with a steep slope. This is the small scale miracle,
for which I give interpretation and discuss the properties. Hints are shown that this information
should be disentanglable from the astrophysical content, and could improve Dark Energy constraints.
Finally, more hints are shown that high order statistics may yield significant improvements over
the power spectrum in this regime, with the improvements increasing with kmax. Data and notebooks
reproducing all plots and results will be made available at \url{https://github.com/fabienlacasa/SmallScaleMiracle}

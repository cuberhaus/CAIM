Gas accretion and stellar feedback processes link metal content, star formation, and gas and stellar
mass (and the potential depth) in star-forming galaxies. Constraining this hypersurface has been
challenging because of the need for measurements of HI and HII gas masses spanning a broad parameter
space. A recent step forward has been achieved through the "Metallicity And Gas for Mass Assembly"
(MAGMA) sample of local star-forming galaxies, which consists of homogeneously-determined parameters
and a significant quantity of dwarf galaxies, with stellar masses as low as $\sim 10^5 - 10^{6}\,
M_{\odot}$. Here, we adopt a "standard" galactic chemical evolution model, with which we can quantify
stellar-driven outflows. In particular, we constrain the difference between the mass-loading
in accretion and outflows and the wind metal-loading factor. The resulting model reproduces very
well the local mass-metallicity relation, and the observed trends of metallicity with gas fraction.
Although the difference in mass loading between accreted and expelled gas is extremely difficult
to constrain, we find indications that, on average, the amount of gas acquired through accretion
is roughly the same as the gas lost through bulk stellar outflows, corresponding to a "gas equilibrium"
scenario. In agreement with previous work, the wind metal-loading factor shows a steep increase
toward lower mass and circular velocity, indicating that low-mass galaxies are more efficient
at expelling metals, thus shaping the mass-metallicity relation. Effective yields are found to
increase with mass up to an inflection mass threshold, with a mild decline at larger masses and circular
velocities. A comparison of our results for metal loading in outflows with the expectations for
their mass loading favors momentum-driven winds at low masses, rather than energy-driven ones.

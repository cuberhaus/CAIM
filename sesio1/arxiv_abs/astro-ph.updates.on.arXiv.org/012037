The purpose of this paper is to study the Tsallis agegraphic dark energy with an interaction term
between dark energy and dark matter in the DGP brane-world scenario. For this, we assume some initial
conditions to obtain the dark energy density, deceleration, dark energy EoS, and total EoS parameters.
Then, we analyze the statefinder parameters, $\omega'{}_{DE}-\omega_{DE}$ plots, and classical
stability features of the model. The results state that the deceleration parameter provides the
phase transition from decelerated to accelerated phase. The $\omega_{DE}$ graphs show the phantom
behavior, while the $\omega_{tot}$ exhibits the quintessence and phantom during the evolution
of the Universe. Following the graphs, the Statefinder analysis shows the quintessence behavior
of the model for the past and present. However, it tends to the $\Lambda CDM$ in the following era.
The $\omega'{}_{DE}-\omega_{DE}$ plot indicates the thawing or freezing area depending on the
type of era and different values of $b^{2}$, $\delta$, and $m$. By the square of the sound speed, we
see the model is stable in the past, stable or unstable at the current time, and unstable in the future
for selected values of $b^{2}$, $\delta$, and $m$. To test the model, we use the recent Hubble data.
We also employ Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to
compare the model with the $\Lambda CDM$ as the reference model. In addition, we test the model using
the $H-z$ plot, and we see a turning point in the future time. The results from the best fit values for
the $\omega_{tot}$ plot emphasize that the Universe is in the quintessence region in the current
time. It will enter the phantom phase, and then it will approach the $\Lambda$ state in the future.
But, the $\omega_{DE}$ always stays on the phantom region. The model is unstable in the present and
progressive era.

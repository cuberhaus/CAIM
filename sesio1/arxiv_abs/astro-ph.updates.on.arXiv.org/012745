We use the APOSTLE suite of cosmological simulations to examine the role of the cosmic ionizing background
in regulating star formation (SF) in low-mass LCDM halos. In agreement with earlier work, we find
that, after reionization, SF can only proceed in halos whose mass exceeds a redshift-dependent
``critical'' virial mass determined by the structure of LCDM halos and the thermal pressure of UV-heated
gas. This critical mass increases from M_crit 10^8 Msun at z~10 to 10^9.7 Msun at z=0, roughly following
the average mass growth history of halos in that mass range. This implies that most halos above or
below critical at present have remained so since early times. The halos of most galaxies today were
already above-critical (and thus forming stars) at high redshift, explaining the ubiquitous presence
of ancient stellar populations in dwarfs, regardless of luminosity. Sub-critical halos may still
host luminous galaxies if they were above-critical at some point in the past. SF ceases if a halo falls
into the sub-critical regime; depending on each halo's accretion history this can occur over a wide
range of times, explaining why SF in many dwarfs seems to continue well past the reionization epoch.
The episodic nature of SF in some dwarfs, in this interpretation, would be linked to temporary halo
excursions above and below the critical boundary. In the simulations, M_crit(z) cleanly separates
star-forming from non-star-forming systems at all redshifts, indicating that the ionizing UV
background, and not stellar feedback, is what regulates the end of SF in the faintest field dwarfs.
Galaxies in sub-critical halos should make up a sizable population of faint field dwarfs, distinct
from those in more massive halos because of their lack of ongoing star formation. Few such galaxies
are known at present, the discovery of this population would provide strong support for our results.

Joint analyses of cross-correlations between measurements of galaxy positions, galaxy lensing,
and lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) offer powerful constraints on the large-scale
structure of the Universe. In a forthcoming analysis, we will present cosmological constraints
from the analysis of such cross-correlations measured using Year 3 data from the Dark Energy Survey
(DES), and CMB data from the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and Planck. Here we present two key ingredients
of this analysis: (1) an improved CMB lensing map in the SPT-SZ survey footprint, and (2) the analysis
methodology that will be used to extract cosmological information from the cross-correlation
measurements. Relative to previous lensing maps made from the same CMB observations, we have implemented
techniques to remove contamination from the thermal Sunyaev Zel'dovich effect, enabling the extraction
of cosmological information from smaller angular scales of the cross-correlation measurements
than in previous analyses with DES Year 1 data. We describe our model for the cross-correlations
between these maps and DES data, and validate our modeling choices to demonstrate the robustness
of our analysis. We then forecast the expected cosmological constraints from the galaxy survey-CMB
lensing auto and cross-correlations. We find that the galaxy-CMB lensing and galaxy shear-CMB
lensing correlations will on their own provide a constraint on $S_8=\sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_{\rm
m}/0.3}$ at the few percent level, providing a powerful consistency check for the DES-only constraints.
We explore scenarios where external priors on shear calibration are removed, finding that the joint
analysis of CMB lensing cross-correlations can provide constraints on the shear calibration amplitude
at the 5 to 10% level.

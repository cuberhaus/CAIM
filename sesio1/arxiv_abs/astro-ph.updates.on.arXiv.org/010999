Extended Lyman-alpha emission is now commonly detected around high redshift galaxies through
stacking and even on individual basis. Despite recent observational advances, the physical origin
of these Lyman-alpha halos (LAHs), as well as their relationships to galaxies, quasars, circumgalactic
gas, and other environmental factors remains unclear. We present results from our new Lyman-alpha
full radiative transfer code voroILTIS which runs directly on the unstructured Voronoi tessellation
of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We make use of the TNG50 simulation and simulate LAHs
from redshift $z=2$ to $z=5$, focusing on star-forming galaxies with $8.0 < \log_{10}{(M_\star/\rm{M}_\odot)}
< 10.5$. While TNG50 does not directly follow ionizing radiation, it includes an on-the-fly treatment
for active galactic nuclei and ultraviolet background radiation with self-shielding, which are
important processes impacting the cooling and ionization of the gas. Based on this model, we present
the predictions for the stacked radial surface brightness profiles of Ly$\alpha$ as a function
of galaxy mass and redshift. Comparison with data from the MUSE UDF at $z>3$ reveals a promising level
of agreement. We measure the correlations of LAH size and central brightness with galaxy properties,
finding that at the masses of $8.5 \leq \log_{10} \left(M_\star/\rm{M}_\odot\right) \leq 9.5$,
physical LAH sizes roughly double from $z=2$ to $z=5$. Finally, we decompose the profiles into contributions
from diffuse emission and scattered photons from star-forming regions. In our simulations, we
find rescattered photons from star-forming regions to be the major source in observed LAHs. Unexpectedly,
we find that the flattening of LAH profiles at large radii becomes dominated by photons originating
from other nearby halos rather than diffuse emission itself.

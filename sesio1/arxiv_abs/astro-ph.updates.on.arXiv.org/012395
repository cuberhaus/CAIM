We calculate the integrated galactic initial stellar mass function (IGIMF) in the presence of IMF
variations in clusters. IMF Variations for a population of clusters are taken into account in the
form of Gaussian distributions of the IMF parameters. For the tapered power law function used here,
these are the slopes at the high and low mass ends, $\Gamma$ and $\gamma$, and the characteristic
mass $M_{ch}$. Variations are modeled by varying the width of the Gaussian distributions. The reference
values are the standard deviations of the parameters observed for young clusters in the present-day
Milky Way $\sigma_{\Gamma}=0.6$, $\sigma_{\gamma}=0.25$, and $\sigma_{M_{ch}}=0.27$ M$_{\odot}$.
Increasing the dispersions of $\gamma$ and $\Gamma$ moderately flattens the IGIMF at the low and
high mass ends. Increasing $\sigma_{M_{ch}}$ shifts the peak of the IGIMF to lower masses, rendering
the IGIMF more bottom heavy. This can explain the bottom heavy stellar mass function of Early-type
galaxies as they are the result of the merger of disk galaxies where the physical conditions of the
star forming gas vary significantly both in time and space. The effect of IMF variations is compared
to that due to other effects such as variations in the shape of the initial cluster mass function,
metallicity, and galactic SFR. We find that the effect of IMF variations is a dominant factor that
always affects the characteristic mass of the IGIMF. We compare our results to a sample of ultra-faint
dwarf satellite galaxies (UFDs). Their present-day stellar mass function is an analog to their
IGIMF at the time their stellar populations have formed. We show that the slope of the IGIMF of the
UFDs can only be reproduced when IMF variations of the same order as those measured in the present-day
Milky Way are included. (Abridged)

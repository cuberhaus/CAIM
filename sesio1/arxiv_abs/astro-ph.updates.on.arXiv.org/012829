A unified multi scalar field model with three flat regions is discussed. The three flat regions are
the inflation, early and late dark energy epochs. The potential is obtained by a spontaneous breaking
of scale invariance generated by Non Riemannian Measures of integration (or Two Measures Theories
(TMT)).We define the scale invariant couplings of the scalar fields to the different measures through
exponential potentials. Spontaneous breaking of scale invariance takes place when integrating
the fields that define the measures. When going to the Einstein frame we obtain: (i) An effective
potential for the scalar fields with three flat regions which allows for a unified description of
both early universe inflation (in the higher energy density flat region) as well as of present dark
energy epoch which can be realized with a double phase, i.e., in two flat regions. (ii) In the slow
roll inflation, only one field combination the ``dilaton", which transforms under scale transformations,
has non trivial dynamics, the orthogonal one, which is scale invariant remains constant. (iv) In
the late universe we define scale invariant couplings of Dark Matter to the dilaton. These couplings
define a matter induced potential for the dilaton and extremizing this potential determines the
scale invariant scalar field, while all exotic non canonical behavior of the Dark Matter as well
as any possible $5^{th}$ force disappear. (v) We calculate the evolution of the late universe under
these conditions with the realization of two different possible realizations of $\Lambda$CDM
type scenarios depending of the flat region in the late universe. These two phases could appear at
different times in the history of the universe.(vi) From the Planck data, we find the constraints
on the parameters during the inflationary epoch and these values are used to obtain constraints
relevant to the present epoch.

We report the detection and characterization of the transiting sub-Neptune TOI-1759 b, using photometric
time-series from TESS and near infrared spectropolarimetric data from SPIRou on the CFHT. TOI-1759
b orbits a moderately active M0V star with an orbital period of $18.849975\pm0.000006$ d, and we
measure a planetary radius and mass of $3.06\pm0.22$ R$_\oplus$ and $6.8\pm2.0$ M$_\oplus$. Radial
velocities were extracted from the SPIRou spectra using both the CCF and the LBL methods, optimizing
the velocity measurements in the near infrared domain. We analyzed the broadband SED of the star
and the high-resolution SPIRou spectra to constrain the stellar parameters and thus improve the
accuracy of the derived planet parameters. A LSD analysis of the SPIRou Stokes $V$ polarized spectra
detects Zeeman signatures in TOI-1759. We model the rotational modulation of the magnetic stellar
activity using a GP regression with a quasi-periodic covariance function, and find a rotation period
of $35.65^{+0.17}_{-0.15}$ d. We reconstruct the large-scale surface magnetic field of the star
using ZDI, which gives a predominantly poloidal field with a mean strength of $18\pm4$ G. Finally,
we perform a joint Bayesian MCMC analysis of the TESS photometry and SPIRou RVs to optimally constrain
the system parameters. At $0.1176\pm0.0013$ au from the star, the planet receives $6.4$ times the
bolometric flux incident on Earth, and its equilibrium temperature is estimated at $433\pm14$
K. TOI-1759 b is a likely gas-dominated sub-Neptune with an expected high rate of photoevaporation.
Therefore, it is an interesting target to search for neutral hydrogen escape, which may provide
important constraints on the planetary formation mechanisms responsible for the observed sub-Neptune
radius desert.

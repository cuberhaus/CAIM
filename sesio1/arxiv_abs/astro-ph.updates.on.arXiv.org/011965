With the aim of investigating how the magnetic field in solar active regions (ARs) controls flare
activity, i.e., whether a confined or eruptive flare occurs, we analyze 106 flares of Geostationary
Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) class $\geq$M1.0 during 2010$-$2019. We calculate
mean characteristic twist parameters $\alpha$$_{FPIL}$ within the "flaring polarity inversion
line" region and $\alpha$$_\mathrm{HFED}$ within the area of high photospheric magnetic free
energy density, which both provide measures of the nonpotentiality of AR core region. Magnetic
twist is thought to be related to the driving force of electric current-driven instabilities, such
as the helical kink instability. We also calculate total unsigned magnetic flux ($\Phi$$_\mathrm{AR}$)
of ARs producing the flare, which describes the strength of the background field confinement. By
considering both the constraining effect of background magnetic fields and the magnetic non-potentiality
of ARs, we propose a new parameter $\alpha$/$\Phi$$_\mathrm{AR}$ to measure the probability for
a large flare to be associated with a coronal mass ejection (CME). We find that in about 90\% of eruptive
flares, $\alpha$$_\mathrm{FPIL}$/$\Phi$$_\mathrm{AR}$ and $\alpha$$_\mathrm{HFED}$/$\Phi$$_\mathrm{AR}$
are beyond critical values (2.2$\times$$10^{-24}$ and 3.2$\times$$10^{-24}$ Mm$^{-1}$ Mx$^{-1}$),
whereas they are less than critical values in $\sim$ 80\% of confined flares. This indicates that
the new parameter $\alpha$/$\Phi$$_\mathrm{AR}$ is well able to distinguish eruptive flares
from confined flares. Our investigation suggests that the relative measure of magnetic nonpotentiality
within the AR core over the restriction of the background field largely controls the capability
of ARs to produce eruptive flares.

The formation of planetesimals is expected to occur via particle-gas instabilities that concentrate
dust into self-gravitating clumps. Triggering these instabilities requires the prior pileup
of dust in the protoplanetary disk. Until now, this has been successfully modeled exclusively at
the disk's snowline, whereas rocky planetesimals in the inner disk were obtained only by assuming
either unrealistically large particle sizes or an enhanced global disk metallicity. However,
planetesimal formation solely at the snowline is difficult to reconcile with the early and contemporaneous
formation of iron meteorite parent bodies with distinct oxidation states and isotopic compositions,
indicating formation at different radial locations in the disk. Here, by modeling the evolution
of a disk with ongoing accretion of material from the collapsing molecular cloud, we show that planetesimal
formation may have been triggered within the first 0.5 million years by dust pileup at both the snowline
(at approximately 5 au) and the silicate sublimation line (at approximately 1 au), provided turbulent
diffusion was low. Particle concentration at approximately 1 au is due to the early outward radial
motion of gas and is assisted by the sublimation and recondensation of silicates. Our results indicate
that, although the planetesimals at the two locations formed about contemporaneously, those at
the snowline accreted a large fraction of their mass (approximately 60 percent) from materials
delivered to the disk in the first few 10,000 yr, whereas this fraction is only 30 percent for the planetesimals
formed at the silicate line. Thus, provided that the isotopic composition of the delivered material
changed with time, these two planetesimal populations should have distinct isotopic compositions,
consistent with observations.

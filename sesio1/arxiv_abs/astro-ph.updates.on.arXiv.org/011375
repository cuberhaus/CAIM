The collection of high-quality photometric data by space telescopes is revolutionizing the area
of white-dwarf asteroseismology. Among the different kinds of pulsating white dwarfs, there are
those that have He-rich atmospheres, and they are called DBVs or V777 Her variable stars. The archetype
of these pulsating white dwarfs, GD~358, is the focus of the present paper. We report a thorough asteroseismological
analysis of the DBV star GD~358 (TIC~219074038) based on new high-precision photometric data gathered
by the {\it TESS} space mission combined with data taken from the Earth. In total, we detected 26 periodicities
from the {\it TESS} light curve of this DBV star using a standard pre-whitening. The oscillation
frequencies are associated with nonradial $g$(gravity)-mode pulsations with periods from $\sim
422$ s to $\sim 1087$ s. Moreover, we detected 8 combination frequencies between $\sim 543$ s and
$\sim 295$ s. We combined these data with a huge amount of observations from the ground. We found a
constant period spacing of $39.25\pm0.17$ s, which helped us to infer its mass ($M_{\star}= 0.588\pm0.024
M_{\sun}$) and constrain the harmonic degree $\ell$ of the modes. We carried out a period-fit analysis
on GD~358, and we were successful in finding an asteroseismological model with a stellar mass ($M_{\star}=
0.584^{+0.025}_{-0.019} M_{\sun}$), in line with the spectroscopic mass ($M_{\star}= 0.560\pm0.028
M_{\sun}$). We found that the frequency splittings vary according to the radial order of the modes,
suggesting differential rotation. Obtaining a seismological made it possible to estimate the
seismological distance ($d_{\rm seis}= 42.85\pm 0.73$ pc) of GD~358, which is in very good accordance
with the precise astrometric distance measured by {\it GAIA} EDR3 ($\pi= 23.244\pm 0.024, d_{\rm
GAIA}= 43.02\pm 0.04$~pc).

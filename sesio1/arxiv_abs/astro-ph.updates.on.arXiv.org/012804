We present a catalog of 1.4 million photometrically-selected quasar candidates in the southern
hemisphere over the $\sim 5000\,{\rm deg^2}$ Dark Energy Survey (DES) wide survey area. We combine
optical photometry from the DES second data release (DR2) with available near-infrared (NIR) and
the all-sky unWISE mid-infrared photometry in the selection. We build models of quasars, galaxies,
and stars with multivariate Skew-t distributions in the multi-dimensional space of relative fluxes
as functions of redshift (or color for stars) and magnitude. Our selection algorithm assigns probabilities
for quasars, galaxies, and stars, and simultaneously calculates photometric redshifts (photo-$z$)
for quasar and galaxy candidates. Benchmarking on spectroscopically confirmed objects, we successfully
classify (with photometry) 94.7% of quasars, 99.3% of galaxies, and 96.3% of stars when all IR bands
(NIR $YJHK$ and WISE $W1W2$) are available. The classification and photo-$z$ regression success
rates decrease when fewer bands are available. Our quasar (galaxy) photo-$z$ quality, defined
as the fraction of objects with the difference between the photo-$z$ $z_p$ and the spectroscopic
redshift $z_s$, $|\Delta z| = |z_s - z_p|/(1 + z_s)\le 0.1$, is 92.2% (98.1%) when all IR bands are
available, decreasing to 72.2% (90.0%) using optical DES data only. Our photometric quasar catalog
achieves estimated completeness of 89% and purity of 79% at $r<21.5$ (0.68 million quasar candidates),
with reduced completeness and purity at $21.5<r\lesssim 24$. Among the 1.4 million quasar candidates,
87,857 have existing spectra and 84,978 (96.7%) of them are spectroscopically confirmed quasars.
Finally, we provide quasar, galaxy, and star probabilities for all (0.69 billion) photometric
sources in the DES DR2 coadded photometric catalog.

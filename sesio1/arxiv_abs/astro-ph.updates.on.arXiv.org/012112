We report the discovery and characterization of a new symbiotic star of the accreting-only variety,
which we observed in the optical/near-infrared (NIR) with VLT/X-Shooter and in the X-rays/ultraviolet
with Swift/UVOT+XRT. The new symbiotic star, THA 15-31, was previously described as a pre-main
sequence star belonging to the Lupus~3 association. Our observations, ancillary data, and Gaia
EDR3 parallax indicate that THA 15-31 is a symbiotic star composed of an M6III red giant and an accreting
companion, is subject to E(B-V)=0.38 reddening, and is located at a distance of ~12 kpc and at 1.8
kpc above the Galactic plane in the outskirts of the Bulge. The luminosity of the accreting companion
is ~100 Lsun, placing THA 15-31 among the symbiotic stars accreting at a high rate (2.5e-08 Msun/yr
if the accretion is occurring on a white dwarf of 1 Msun). The observed emission lines originate primarily
from HI, HeI, and FeII, with no HeII or other high-excitation lines observed; a sharp central absorption
superimposed on the Balmer emission lines is observed, while all other lines have a simple Gaussian-like
profile. The emission from the companion dominates over the M6III red giant at $U$ and $B$-band wavelengths,
and is consistent with an origin primarily in an optically thick accretion disk. No significant
photometric variability is observed at optical or NIR wavelengths, suggesting either a face-on
orbital orientation and/or that the red giant is far from Roche-lobe filling conditions. The profile
of emission lines supports a low orbital inclination if they form primarily in the accretion disk.
An excess emission is present in AllWISE W3 (12 micron) and W4 (22 micron) data, radiating a luminosity
~35 Lsun, consistent with thermal emission from optically thin circumstellar dust.

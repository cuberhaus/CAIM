The TESS space mission provides us with high-precision photometric observations of bright stars
over more than 70% of the entire sky, allowing us to revisit and characterise well-known stars. We
aim to conduct an asteroseismic analysis of the gamma Doradus star HD112429 using both the available
ground-based spectroscopy and TESS photometry, and assess the conditions required to measure
the near-core rotation rate and buoyancy travel time. We collect and reduce the available five sectors
of short-cadence TESS photometry of this star, as well as 672 legacy observations from six medium-
to high-resolution ground-based spectrographs. We determine the stellar pulsation frequencies
from both data sets using iterative prewhitening, do asymptotic g mode modelling of the star and
investigate the corresponding spectral line profile variations using the pixel-by-pixel method.
We validate the pulsation frequencies from the TESS data up to $S/N \geq 5.6$, confirming recent
reports in the literature that the classical criterion $S/N \geq 4$ does not suffice for space-based
observations. We identify the pulsations as prograde dipole g modes and r-mode pulsations, and
measure a near-core rotation rate of $1.536(3) d^{-1}$ and a buoyancy travel time $\Pi_0$ of 4190(50)
s. These results are in agreement with the observed spectral line profile variations, which were
qualitatively evaluated using a newly developed toy model. We establish a set of conditions that
have to be fulfilled for an asymptotic asteroseismic analysis of g-mode pulsators. In the case of
HD112429, two TESS sectors of space photometry suffice. Although a detailed asteroseismic modelling
analysis is not viable for g-mode pulsators with only short or sparse light curves of space photometry,
we find that it is possible to determine global asteroseismic quantities for a subset of these stars.

Using the exquisite MUSE eXtremely Deep Field data, we report the discovery of an MgII emission nebula
with an area above a 2$\sigma$ significance level of 1000 proper kpc$^2$, providing the first panoramic
view of the spatial distribution of magnesium in the intragroup medium of a low mass group of five
star-forming galaxies at z=1.31. The galaxy group members are separated by less than 50 physical
kpc in projection and $\approx$120 km/s in velocity space. The most massive galaxy has a stellar
mass of 10$^{9.35}$ M$_\odot$ and shows an MgII P-Cygni line profile indicating the presence of
an outflow, which is consistent with the spatially resolved spectral analysis showing $\approx+$120
km/s shift of the MgII emission lines with respect to the systemic redshift. The other galaxies are
less massive and only show MgII in emission. The detected MgII nebula has a maximal projected extent
of $\approx$70 kpc including a low surface brightness (2 $\times$ 10$^{-19}$ erg/s/cm$^{2}$/arcsec$^{2}$)
gaseous bridge between two subgroups of galaxies. The presence of absorption features in the spectrum
of a background galaxy located at an impact parameter of 19 kpc from the closest galaxy of the group
indicates the presence of gas enriched in magnesium even beyond the detected nebula seen in emission,
suggesting that we are observing the tip of a larger intragroup medium. The observed MgII velocity
gradient suggests an overall rotation of the structure along the major axis of the most massive galaxy.
Our MUSE data also reveal extended Fe II* emission in the vicinity of the most massive galaxy, aligned
with its minor axis. Extended [OII] emission is found around the galaxy group members and at the location
of the MgII bridge. Our results suggest that both tidal stripping effects from galaxy interactions
and outflows are enriching the intragroup medium of this system.

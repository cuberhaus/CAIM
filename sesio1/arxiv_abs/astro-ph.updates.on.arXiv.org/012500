Virtually all known exoplanets reside around stars with $M<2.3~M_\odot$; to clarify if the dearth
of planets around more massive stars is real, we launched the direct-imaging B-star Exoplanet Abundance
STudy (BEAST) survey targeting B stars ($M>2.4~M_\odot$) in the young (5-20 Myr) Scorpius-Centaurus
association (Sco-Cen). Here we present the case of a massive ($M \sim 9~M_\odot$) BEAST target,
$\mu^2$ Sco. Based on kinematic information, we found that $\mu^2$ Sco is a member of a small group
which we label Eastern Lower Scorpius, refining in turn the precision on stellar parameters. Around
this star we identified a robustly detected substellar companion ($14.4\pm 0.8 M_J$) at a projected
separation of $290\pm 10$ au, and a probable second object ($18.5\pm 1.5 M_J$) at $21\pm 1$ au. The
planet-to-star mass ratios of these objects are similar to that of Jupiter to the Sun, and their irradiation
is similar to those of Jupiter and Mercury, respectively. The two companions of $\mu^2$ Sco are naturally
added to the giant planet b Cen b recently discovered by BEAST; although slightly more massive than
the deuterium burning limit, their properties resemble those of giant planets around less massive
stars and they are better reproduced by a formation under a planet-like, rather than a star-like
scenario. Irrespective of the (needed) confirmation of the inner companion, $\mu^2$ Sco is the
first star that would end its life as a supernova that hosts such a system. The tentative high frequency
of BEAST discoveries shows that giant planets or small-mass brown dwarfs can form around B stars.
When putting this finding in the context of core accretion and gravitational instability, we conclude
that the current modeling of both mechanisms is not able to produce this kind of companion. BEAST
will pave the way for the first time to an extension of these models to intermediate and massive stars.

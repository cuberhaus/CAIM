We present a spectroscopic analysis of Type I superluminous supernova (SLSN-I), SN 2018bsz. While
it closely resembles SLSNe-I, the multi-component H$\alpha$ line appearing at $\sim30$ d post-maximum
is the most atypical. The H$\alpha$ is characterised by two emission components, one at $+3000$
km/s and a second at $-7500$ km/s, with a third, near-zero velocity component appearing after a delay.
The blue and central components can be described by Gaussian profiles of intermediate width, but
the red component is significantly broader and Lorentzian. The blue component evolves towards
lower velocity before fading at $100$ d post-peak, concurrently with a light curve break. Multi-component
profiles are observed in other hydrogen lines including Pa$\beta$, and in lines of Ca II and He I.
Spectropolarimetry obtained before (10.2 d) and after (38.4 d) the appearance of the H lines show
a large shift on the Stokes $Q$ -- $U$ plane consistent with SN 2018bsz undergoing radical changes
in its geometry. Assuming the SN is almost unpolarised at 10.2 d, the continuum polarisation at 38.4
d reaches $P \sim1.8\%$ implying a highly asymmetric configuration. We propose that the observed
evolution of SN 2018bsz can be explained by highly aspherical CSM. After the SN explosion, the CSM
is quickly overtaken by the ejecta, but as the photosphere starts to recede, the different CSM regions
re-emerge producing the peculiar line profiles. Based on the first appearance of H$\alpha$, we
can constrain the distance of the CSM to be less than $430$ AU, or even lower ($<87$ AU) if the pre-peak
plateau is related to an eruption that created the CSM. The presence of CSM has been inferred for other
SLSNe-I. However, it is not clear whether the rare properties of SN 2018bsz can be generalised for
SLSNe-I or whether they are the result of an uncommon evolutionary path, possibly involving a binary
companion.

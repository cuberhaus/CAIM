Context: Broadband optical constants of astrophysical ice analogues in the infrared (IR) and terahertz
(THz) ranges are required for modeling the dust continuum emission and radiative transfer in dense
and cold regions, where thick icy mantles are formed on the surface of dust grains. Aims: In this paper,
the THz time-domain spectroscopy (TDS) and the Fourier-transform IR spectroscopy (FTIR) are combined
to study optical constants of CO and CO$_2$ ices in the broad THz-IR spectral range. Methods: The
measured ices are grown at cryogenic temperatures by gas deposition on a cold Si window. A method
to quantify the broadband THz-IR optical constants of ices is developed based on the direct reconstruction
of the complex refractive index of ices in the THz range from the TDS data, and the use of the Kramers-Kronig
relation in the IR range for the reconstruction from the FTIR data. Uncertainties of the Kramers-Kronig
relation are eliminated by merging the THz and IR spectra. The reconstructed THz-IR response is
then analyzed using classical models of complex dielectric permittivity. Results: The complex
refractive index of CO and CO$_2$ ices deposited at the temperature of $28$ K is obtained in the range
of 0.3--12.0 THz. Based on the measured dielectric constants, opacities of the astrophysical dust
with CO and CO$_2$ icy mantles are computed. Conclusions: The developed method can be used for a model-independent
reconstruction of optical constants of various astrophysical ice analogs in a broad THz-IR range.
Such data can provide important benchmarks to interpret the broadband observations from the existing
and future ground-based facilities and space telescopes. The reported results will be useful to
model sources that show a drastic molecular freeze-out, such as central regions of prestellar cores
and mid-planes of protoplanetary disks, as well as CO and CO$_2$ snow lines in disks.

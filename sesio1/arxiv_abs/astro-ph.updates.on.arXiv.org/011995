Presolar stardust grains found in primitive meteorites are believed to retain the isotopic composition
of stellar outflows at the time of grain condensation. Therefore, laboratory measurements of their
isotopic ratios represent sensitive probes for investigating open questions related to stellar
evolution, stellar explosions, nucleosynthesis, mixing mechanisms, dust formation, and galactic
chemical evolution. For a few selected presolar grains, classical novae have been discussed as
a potential source. For SiC, silicate, and graphite presolar grains, the association is based on
the observation of small $N(^{12}$C)/$N(^{13}$C) and $N(^{14}$N)/$N(^{15}$N) number abundance
ratios compared to solar values, and abundance excesses in $^{30}$Si relative to $^{29}$Si, as
previously predicted by models of classical novae. We report on a direct measurement of the $^{29}$Si(p,$\gamma$)$^{30}$P
reaction, which strongly impacts simulated $\delta ^{29}$Si values from classical novae. Our
new experimental $^{29}$Si(p,$\gamma$)$^{30}$P thermonuclear reaction rate differs from previous
results by up to 50\% in the classical nova temperature range ($T$ $=$ $100$ $-$ $400$~MK), while
the rate uncertainty is reduced by up to a factor of $3$. Using our new reaction rate in Monte Carlo
reaction network and hydrodynamic simulations of classical novae, we estimate $\delta ^{29}$Si
values with much reduced uncertainties. Our results establish $\delta ^{29}$Si values measured
in presolar grains as a sensitive probe for assessing their classical nova paternity. We also demonstrate
that $\delta ^{30}$Si values from nova simulations are presently not a useful diagnostic tool unless
the large uncertainty of the $^{30}$P(p,$\gamma$)$^{31}$S reaction rate can be significantly
reduced.

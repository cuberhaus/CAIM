The radio emission from very inclined air showers (with zenith angles $\theta \gtrsim 65^\circ$)
illuminates large footprints from a few up to hundreds of square kilometers. Inclined air showers
can be detected with kilometer-spaced radio-antenna arrays, suitable to measure cosmic rays up
to the highest energies ($10^{18.4}\,\text{eV} \lesssim E \sim 10^{20}\,\text{eV}$). Radio
antennas are sensitive to the electromagnetic particle cascades of the showers, which are absorbed
in the atmosphere before reaching the ground. Hence, combining radio antennas with particle detectors,
which, in turn, measure the muons reaching the ground, offers the unique potential to discriminate
between showers initiated by light and heavy nuclei and study hadronic interactions. A precise
understanding and description of the radio-emission footprint of inclined air showers is indispensable
for any analyses of radio data. Such a model has to master the description of complex asymmetry patterns
imprinted in the radio-emission. We propose a model that describes the radio-emission from inclined
air showers by explicitly describing the dominant, rotationally symmetric geomagnetic emission
in combination with additional effects which disturb the symmetric emission pattern. We use a comprehensive
set of CoREAS simulations to exploit correlations between the radio emission and air shower properties.
We find a description which is based on two observables only: the geometrical distance $d_\mathrm{max}$
between the shower core at the ground and the shower maximum and the geomagnetic radiation energy
$E_\mathrm{geo}$. Hence, this model can be used in a robust and efficient reconstruction algorithms.
We demonstrate that with this model, the electromagnetic shower energy can be reconstructed by
sparse antenna arrays with an intrinsic resolution of only 5\% and a negligible bias.

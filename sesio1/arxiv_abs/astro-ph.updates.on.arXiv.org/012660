Measurements of the atomic hydrogen (HI) properties of high-redshift galaxies are critical to
understanding the decline in the star-formation rate (SFR) density of the Universe after its peak
$\approx8-11$ Gyr ago. Here, we use $\approx510$ hours of observations with the upgraded Giant
Metrewave Radio Telescope to measure the dependence of the average HI mass of star-forming galaxies
at $z=0.74-1.45$ on their average stellar mass and redshift, by stacking their HI 21 cm emission
signals. We divide our sample of 11,419 main-sequence galaxies at $z=0.74-1.45$ into two stellar-mass
($M_*$) subsamples, with $M_*>10^{10} M_\odot$ and $M_*<10^{10} M_\odot$, and obtain clear detections,
at $>4.6\sigma$ significance, of the stacked HI 21 cm emission in both subsamples. We find that galaxies
with $M_*>10^{10} M_\odot$, which dominate the decline in the cosmic SFR density at $z\lesssim1$,
have HI reservoirs that can sustain their SFRs for only a short period, $0.86\pm0.20$ Gyr, unless
their HI is replenished via accretion. We also stack the HI 21 cm emission from galaxies in two redshift
subsamples, at $z=0.74-1.25$ and $z=1.25-1.45$, again obtaining clear detections of the stacked
HI 21 cm emission signals, at $>5.2\sigma$ significance in both subsamples. We find that the average
HI mass of galaxies with $\langle M_* \rangle\approx10^{10} M_\odot$ declines steeply over a period
of $\approx1$ billion years, from $(33.6\pm6.4) \times 10^9 M_\odot$ at $\langle z\rangle\approx1.3$
to $(10.6\pm1.9)\times10^9 M_\odot$ at $\langle z\rangle\approx1.0$, i.e. by a factor $\gtrsim3$.
We thus find direct evidence that accretion of HI onto star-forming galaxies at $z\approx1$ is insufficient
to replenish their HI reservoirs and sustain their SFRs, thus resulting in the decline in the cosmic
SFR density 8 billion years ago.

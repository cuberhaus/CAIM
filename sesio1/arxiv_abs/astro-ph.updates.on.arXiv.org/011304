Accreting planets have been seen at Ha (H alpha), but targeted searches have not been fruitful. For
planets, accretion tracers should come from the shock itself, exposing them to extinction by the
accreting material. High-resolution (R>5e4) spectrographs at Ha should soon allow studying how
the incoming material shapes the line profile. We calculate how much the gas and dust accreting onto
a planet reduce the Ha flux from the shock at the planetary surface and how they affect line shapes.
We also study the absorption-modified relationship between Ha luminosity and Mdot. We compute
the high-resolution radiative transfer of the Ha line using a 1D velocity-density-temperature
structure for the inflowing matter in three representative accretion geometries: spherical symmetry,
polar inflow, and magnetospheric accretion. For each, we explore wide ranges of Mdot and planet
mass M. We use detailed gas opacities and estimate dust opacities. At Mdot<3e-6 MJ/yr, gas extinction
is negligible for spherical or polar inflow and at most A_Ha<0.5 mag for magnetospheric accretion.
Up to Mdot~3e-4 MJ/yr, the gas has A_Ha<4 mag. This decreases with M. We estimate realistic dust opacities
at Ha as ~0.01-10 cm^2/g, i.e., 10-1e4 times lower than in the ISM. Extinction flattens the L_Ha-Mdot
relationship, which becomes non-monotonic with a maximum L_Ha~1e-4 LSun near Mdot~1e-4 MJ/yr
for M~10 MJ. In magnetospheric accretion, the gas can introduce features in line profiles, but the
velocity gradient smears them out in other geometries. For most of parameter space, extinction
by the accreting matter should be negligible, simplifying interpretation of observations, especially
for planets in gaps. At high Mdot, strong absorption reduces the Ha flux, and some measurements can
be interpreted as two Mdot values. Line profiles at R~1e5 can provide complex constraints on the
accretion flow's thermal-dynamical structure.

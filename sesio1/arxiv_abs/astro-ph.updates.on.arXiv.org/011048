The morphology of the Milky Way is still a matter of debate. In order to shed light on uncertainties
surrounding the structure of the Galaxy, in this paper, we study the imprint of spiral arms on the
distribution and properties of its molecular gas. To do so, we take full advantage of the SEDIGISM
survey that observed a large area of the inner Galaxy in the $^{13}$CO(2-1) line at an angular resolution
of 28". We analyse the influences of the spiral arms by considering the features of the molecular
gas emission as a whole across the longitude-velocity map built from the full survey. Additionally,
we examine the properties of the molecular clouds in the spiral arms compared to the properties of
their counterparts in the inter-arm regions. Through flux and luminosity probability distribution
functions, we find that the molecular gas emission associated with the spiral arms does not differ
significantly from the emission between the arms. On average, spiral arms show masses per unit length
of $\sim10^5-10^6$ M$_{\odot} $kpc$^{-1}$. This is similar to values inferred from data sets in
which emission distributions were segmented into molecular clouds. By examining the cloud distribution
across the Galactic plane, we infer that the molecular mass in the spiral arms is a factor of 1.5 higher
than that of the inter-arm medium, similar to what is found for other spiral galaxies in the local
Universe. We observe that only the distributions of cloud mass surface densities and aspect ratio
in the spiral arms show significant differences compared to those of the inter-arm medium; other
observed differences appear instead to be driven by a distance bias. By comparing our results with
simulations and observations of nearby galaxies, we conclude that the measured quantities would
classify the Milky Way as a flocculent spiral galaxy, rather than as a grand-design one.

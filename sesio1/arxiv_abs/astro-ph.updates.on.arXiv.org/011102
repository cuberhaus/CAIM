We present a cosmological analysis using the second and third moments of the weak lensing mass (convergence)
maps from the first three years of data (Y3) data of the Dark Energy Survey (DES). The survey spans
an effective area of 4139 square degrees and uses the images of over 100 million galaxies to reconstruct
the convergence field. The second moment of the convergence as a function of smoothing scale contains
information similar to standard shear 2-point statistics. The third moment, or the skewness, contains
additional non-Gaussian information. The data is analysed in the context of the $\Lambda$CDM model,
varying 5 cosmological parameters and 19 nuisance parameters modelling astrophysical and measurement
systematics. Our modelling of the observables is completely analytical, and has been tested with
simulations in our previous methodology study. We obtain a 1.7\% measurement of the amplitude of
fluctuations parameter $S_8\equiv \sigma_8 (\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5} = 0.784\pm 0.013$. The measurements
are shown to be internally consistent across redshift bins, angular scales, and between second
and third moments. In particular, the measured third moment is consistent with the expectation
of gravitational clustering under the $\Lambda$CDM model. The addition of the third moment improves
the constraints on $S_8$ and $\Omega_{\rm m}$ by $\sim$15\% and $\sim$25\% compared to an analysis
that only uses second moments. We compare our results with {\it Planck} constraints from the Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB), finding a $2.2$ \textendash $2.8\sigma$ tension in the full parameter
space, depending on the combination of moments considered. The third moment independently is in
$2.8\sigma$ tension with {\it Planck}, and thus provides a cross-check on analyses of 2-point correlations.

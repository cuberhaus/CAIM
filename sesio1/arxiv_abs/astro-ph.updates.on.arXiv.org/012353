We apply the theory of nonlinear resonance capture to the problem of a black hole binary (BHB) orbiting
a supermassive black hole (SMBH) while embedded in the accretion disk of an active galactic nucleus
(AGN). If successful, resonance capture can trigger dramatic growth in the BHB eccentricity, with
important consequences for the BHB merger timescale, as well as for the gravitational wave (GW)
signature of such an eccentric merger. This resonance capture may occur when the orbital period
around the SMBH (the "outer binary") and the apsidal precession of the BHB (the "inner binary") are
in a 1:1 commensurability. This effect is analogous to the phenomenon of lunar evection resonance
in the early Sun-Earth-Moon system, with the distinction that in the present case, the BHB apsidal
precession is due to general relativity, rather than rotationally-induced distortion. In contrast
to the case of lunar evection, however, the inner binary undergoes orbital decay driven by GW emission,
rather than orbital expansion driven by tidal dissipation. This distinction fundamentally alters
the three-body dynamics, forbidding resonance capture, and limiting eccentricity growth. However,
if the BHB migrates through of a gaseous AGN disk, the change in the outer binary can counterbalance
the suppressing effect of BHB decay, permitting evection resonance capture and the production
of eccentric BHB mergers. We compute the likelihood of resonance capture assuming an agnostic distribution
of parameters for the three bodies involved and for the properties of the AGN disk. We find that intermediate-mass
ratio BHBs (involving an intermediate-mass black hole and a stellar-mass black hole) are the most
likely to be captured into evection resonance and thus undergo an eccentric merger. We also compute
the GW signature of these mergers, showing that they can enter the LISA band while eccentric.

We review how the "cusp" predicted in the nuclear symmetry energy generated by a topology change
at density $n_{1/2}\gsim 2 n_0$ can have a surprising consequence, so far unrecognized in nuclear
physics and astrophysics communities, on the structure of dense compact-star matter. The topology
change, when translated into nuclear EFT with "effective" QCD degrees of freedom in terms of hidden
local and scale symmetries duly taken into account, predicts an EoS that is soft below and stiff above
$n\gsim n_{1/2}$, involving no low-order phase transitions, and yields the macrophysical properties
of neutron stars consistent -- so far with no tension -- with the astrophysical observations, including
the maximum mass $ 2.0\lsim M/ M_\odot\lsim 2.2$ as well as the GW data. Furthermore it describes
the interior core of the massive stars populated by baryon-charge-fractionalized quasi-fermions
that are neither baryonic nor quarkonic. It is argued that the cusp "buried" in the symmetry energy
resulting from strong correlations with hidden heavy degrees of freedom leads, at $n\gsim n_{1/2}$,
to what we dubbed "pseudo-conformal" sound speed, $v^2_{pcs}/c^2\approx 1/3$, precociously
converged from below at $n_{1/2}$. It is not strictly conformal since the trace of energy-momentum
tensor is not zero even in the chiral limit. This observation with the topology change identified
with the putative hadron-quark continuity, taking place at at density $\gsim 2 n_0$, implies that
the quantities accurately measured at $\sim n_0$ cannot give a stringent constraint for what takes
place at the core density of compact stars $\sim (3-7) n_0$. This is because the change of degrees
of freedom in effective field theory is involved. We discuss the implication of this on the recent
PREX-II "dilemma" in the measured skin thickness of $^{208}$Pb.

The 21cm line refers to a forbidden transition in neutral hydrogen associated with alignment of
spins of the proton and electron. It is a very low energy transition that is emitted whenever there
is neutral hydrogen in the Universe. Since baryons are mostly (~75%) hydrogen, one can in principle
detect this emission throughout much of the history of the Universe. The dominant emission mechanism
is different across cosmic ages. Before the photons decouple from matter, hydrogen is in an ionized
state and does not emit in 21cm. After recombination and during the Dark Ages, at z ~ 30-1000, the 21cm
emission is associated with density fluctuations in the neutral hydrogen medium. After the first
stars turn on and galaxies begin to form, the 21cm emission traces bubbles of ionized hydrogen in
the sea of the neutral medium. This epoch, spanning z ~ 6-30, is often referred to as cosmic dawn and
the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). At redshifts below z<6, the intergalactic medium is largely ionized,
but pockets of self-shielded neutral gas form in dense galactic environments and 21cm emission
traces the distribution of galaxies. The vastly different emission mechanisms allow us to probe
very different physics at different redshifts, corresponding to different observational frequencies.
The instrumental challenges, namely building very sensitive and exquisitely calibrated radio
telescopes, however, share many commonalities across frequency bands. The potential of the 21cm
probe has been recognized by the Decadal Survey of Astronomy & Astrophysics, whose Panel on Cosmology
identified the Dark Ages as its sole discovery area. We argue that HEP should recognize the potential
of 21cm as a probe of fundamental physics across many axes and invest in the technology development
that will enable full exploitation of this rich technique.

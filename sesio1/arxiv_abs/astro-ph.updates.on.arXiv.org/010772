The X-ray and extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) emissions from the low-mass stars significantly affect
the evolution of the planetary atmosphere. However, it is, observationally difficult to constrain
the stellar high-energy emission because of the strong interstellar extinction of EUV photons.
In this study, we simulate the XUV (X-ray+EUV) emission from the Sun-like stars by extending the
solar coronal heating model that self-consistently solves, with sufficiently high resolution,
the surface-to-coronal energy transport, turbulent coronal heating, and coronal thermal response
by conduction and radiation. The simulations are performed with a range of loop lengths and magnetic
filling factors at the stellar surface. With the solar parameters, the model reproduces the observed
solar XUV spectrum below the Lyman edge, thus validating its capability of predicting the XUV spectra
of other Sun-like stars. The model also reproduces the observed nearly-linear relation between
the unsigned magnetic flux and the X-ray luminosity. From the simulation runs with various loop
lengths and filling factors, we also find a scaling relation, namely $\log L_{\rm EUV} = 9.93 + 0.67
\log L_{\rm X}$, where $L_{\rm EUV}$ and $L_{\rm X}$ are the luminosity in the EUV and X-ray range,
respectively, in cgs. By assuming a power-law relation between the Rossby number and the magnetic
filling factor, we reproduce the renowned relation between the Rossby number and the X-ray luminosity.
We also propose an analytical description of the energy injected into the corona, which, in combination
with the conventional Rosner-Tucker-Vaiana scaling law, semi-analytically explains the simulation
results. This study refines the concepts of solar and stellar coronal heating and derives a theoretical
relation for estimating the hidden stellar EUV luminosity from X-ray observations.

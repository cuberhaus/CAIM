$ $Weak gravitational lensing is a powerful probe which is used to constrain the standard cosmological
model and its extensions. With the enhanced statistical precision of current and upcoming surveys,
high accuracy predictions for weak lensing statistics are needed to limit the impact of theoretical
uncertainties on cosmological parameter constraints. For this purpose, we present a comparison
of the theoretical predictions for the nonlinear matter and weak lensing power spectra, based on
the widely used fitting functions ($\texttt{mead}$ and $\texttt{rev-halofit}$), emulators
($\texttt{EuclidEmulator}$, $\texttt{EuclidEmulator2}$, $\texttt{BaccoEmulator}$ and
$\texttt{CosmicEmulator}$) and N-body simulations ($\texttt{Pkdgrav3}$). We consider the
forecasted constraints on the $\Lambda \texttt{CDM}$ and $\texttt{wCDM}$ models from weak lensing
for stage III and stage IV surveys. We study the relative bias on the constraints and their dependence
on the assumed prescriptions. Assuming a $\Lambda \texttt{CDM}$ cosmology, we find that the relative
agreement on the $S_8$ parameter is between $0.2-0.3\sigma$ for a stage III-like survey between
the above predictors. For a stage IV-like survey the agreement becomes $1.4-3.0\sigma$. In the
$\texttt{wCDM}$ scenario, we find broader $S_8$ constraints, and agreements of $0.18-0.26\sigma$
and $0.7-1.7\sigma$ for stage III and stage IV surveys, respectively. The accuracies of the above
predictors therefore appear adequate for stage III surveys, while the fitting functions would
need improvements for future stage IV weak lensing surveys. Furthermore, we find that, of the fitting
functions, $\texttt{mead}$ provides the best agreement with the emulators. We discuss the implication
of these findings for the preparation of the future weak lensing surveys.

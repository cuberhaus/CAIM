We investigate the origins of cold sub-Saturns (CSS), an exoplanetary population inferred from
microlensing surveys. If confirmed, these planets would rebut a theorised gap in planets' mass
distribution between those of Neptune and Jupiter caused by the rapid runaway accretion of super-critical
cores. In an attempt to resolve this theoretical-observational disparity, we examine the outcomes
of giant collisions between sub-critical protoplanets. Due to the secular interaction among protoplanets,
these events may occur in rapidly depleting discs. We show that impactors ~ 5% the mass of near-runaway
envelopes around massive cores can efficiently remove these envelopes entirely via a thermally-driven
super-Eddington wind emanating from the core itself, in contrast with the stellar Parker winds
usually considered. After a brief cooling phase, the merged cores resume accretion. But, the evolution
timescale of transitional discs is too brief for the cores to acquire sufficiently massive envelopes
to undergo runaway accretion despite their large combined masses. Consequently, these events
lead to the emergence of CSS without their transformation into gas giants. We show that these results
are robust for a wide range of disc densities, grain opacities and silicate abundance in the envelope.
Our fiducial case reproduces CSS with heavy (>= 30 M_Earth) cores and less massive (a few M_Earth)
sub-critical envelopes. We also investigate the other limiting cases, where continuous mergers
of comparable-mass cores yield CSS with wider ranges of core-to-envelope mass ratios and envelope
opacities. Our results indicate that it is possible for CSS and Uranus and Neptune to emerge within
the framework of well studied processes and they may be more common than previously postulated.

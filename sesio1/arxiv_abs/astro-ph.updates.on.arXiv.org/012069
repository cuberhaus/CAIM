Context: Late on 2013 August 19, a coronal mass ejection (CME) erupted from an active region located
near the far-side central meridian from Earth's perspective. The event and its accompanying shock
were remotely observed by the STEREO-A, STEREO-B and SOHO spacecraft. The interplanetary counterpart
(ICME) was intercepted by MESSENGER near 0.3 au, and by both STEREO-A and STEREO-B, near 1 au, which
were separated by 78{\deg} in heliolongitude. The main objective of this study is to follow the radial
and longitudinal evolution of the ICME throughout the inner heliosphere, and to examine possible
scenarios for the different magnetic flux-rope configuration observed on the solar disk, and measured
in situ at the locations of MESSENGER and STEREO-A, separated by 15{\deg} in heliolongitude, and
at STEREO-B, which detected the ICME flank. Results: We find that the magnetic flux-rope structure
detected at STEREO-B belongs to the same ICME detected at MESSENGER and STEREO-A. The opposite helicity
deduced at STEREO-B, might be due to the spacecraft intercepting one of the legs of the structure
far from the flux-rope axis, while STEREO-A and MESSENGER are crossing through the core of the magnetic
flux rope. The different flux-rope orientations measured at MESSENGER and STEREO-A arise probably
because the two spacecraft measure a curved, highly distorted and rather complex magnetic flux-rope
topology. The ICME may have suffered additional distortion in its evolution in the inner heliosphere,
such as the west flank is propagating faster than the east flank when arriving 1 au. Conclusions:
This work illustrates how the ambient conditions can significantly affect the expansion and propagation
of the CME/ICME, introducing additional irregularities to the already asymmetric eruption, and
how these complex structures cannot be directly reconstructed with the current models available.

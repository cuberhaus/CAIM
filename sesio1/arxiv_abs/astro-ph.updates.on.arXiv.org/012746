Astrometric discovery of sub-stellar mass companions orbiting stars is exceedingly hard due to
the required sub-milliarcsecond precision, limiting the application of this technique to only
a few instruments on a target-per-target basis as well as the global astrometry space missions Hipparcos
and Gaia. The third Gaia data release includes the first Gaia astrometric orbital solutions, whose
sensitivity in terms of estimated companion mass extends down into the planetary-mass regime.
We present the contribution of the `exoplanet pipeline' to the Gaia DR3 sample of astrometric orbital
solutions by describing the methods used for fitting the orbits, the identification of significant
solutions, and their validation. We then present an overview of the statistical properties of the
solution parameters. Using both a Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Genetic Algorithm we fit the 34 months
of Gaia DR3 astrometric time series with a single Keplerian astrometric-orbit model. Verification
and validation steps are taken using significance tests, internal consistency checks using the
Gaia radial velocity measurements (when available), as well as literature radial velocity and
astrometric data, leading to a subset of candidates that are labelled as 'validated'. We determined
astrometric-orbit solutions for 1162 sources and 198 solutions have been assigned the 'validated'
label. Precise companion mass estimates are presented elsewhere. From internal and external verification
and validation we estimate the level of spurious/incorrect solutions in our sample to be of the order
of ~5-10% in our non-'validated' candidate samples. We demonstrate that Gaia is able to confirm
and sometimes refine known orbital companion orbits as well as identify new candidates, providing
us with a positive outlook of the expected harvest from the full mission data in future data releases.

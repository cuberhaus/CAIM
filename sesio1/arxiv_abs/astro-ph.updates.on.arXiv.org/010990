A transformative science case for the proposed next-generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) is resolving
the surfaces of nearby stars, both spatially and temporally, enabled by the combination of milliarcsecond-scale
resolution and unprecedented sensitivity to thermal radio emission. In a previous study, we demonstrated
the feasibility of stellar imaging with simulated observations of nearby stars, using both traditional
CLEAN techniques and newly developed regularized maximum likelihood (RML) imaging methods for
image reconstruction. In this memo, we present a continued study of stellar imaging with the ngVLA,
evaluating the imaging capability of the Revision D (henceforth Rev D) Main Array configuration
compared to the previous Revision C (henceforth Rev C) configuration. We find that the Rev D configuration,
with more uniform coverage and better circular symmetry, improves the synthesized beam, resulting
in better CLEAN reconstructions of simulated images of evolved stars with complex morphology,
especially with robust weighting. However, the highly non-Gaussian nature of the synthesized
beam still persists with both robust and natural weightings in the Rev D configuration and continues
to limit the image fidelity of image reconstructions with non-uniform weighting. The RML methods
show stable performance that is resilient to different array configurations with image quality
comparable to or better than CLEAN methods in the presented simulation, consistent with our previous
work. Our simulation results suggest that the Rev D configuration will provide a better deconvolution
beam compared with the Rev C configuration, which would enhance the imaging capability for non-uniform
weighting, and they continue to demonstrate that RML methods are an attractive choice, even for
the improved array configuration.

Forthcoming cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarized anisotropy experiments have the potential
to revolutionize our understanding of the Universe and fundamental physics. The sought-after,
tale-telling signatures will be however distributed over voluminous data sets which these experiments
will collect. These data sets will need to be efficiently processed and unwanted contributions
due to astrophysical, environmental, and instrumental effects characterized and efficiently
mitigated in order to uncover the signatures. This poses a significant challenge to data analysis
methods, techniques, and software tools which will not only have to be able to cope with huge volumes
of data but to do so with unprecedented precision driven by the demanding science goals posed for
the new experiments. A keystone of efficient CMB data analysis are solvers of very large linear systems
of equations. Such systems appear in very diverse contexts throughout CMB data analysis pipelines,
however they typically display similar algebraic structures and can therefore be solved using
similar numerical techniques. Linear systems arising in the so-called map-making problem are
one of the most prominent and common ones. In this work we present a massively parallel, flexible
and extensible framework, comprised of a numerical library, MIDAPACK, and a high level code, MAPPRAISER,
which provide tools for solving efficiently such systems. The framework implements iterative
solvers based on conjugate gradient techniques: enlarged and preconditioned using different
preconditioners. We demonstrate the framework on simulated examples reflecting basic characteristics
of the forthcoming data sets issued by ground-based and satellite-borne instruments, executing
it on as many as 16,384 compute cores. The software is developed as an open source project freely available

In star-forming galaxies, the far-infrared (FIR) and radio-continuum luminosities obey a tight
empirical relation over a large range of star-formation rates (SFR). We examine magneto-hydrodynamic
galaxy simulations with cosmic rays (CRs), accounting for their advective and anisotropic diffusive
transport. We show that gravitational collapse of the proto-galaxy generates a corrugated accretion
shock, which injects turbulence and drives a small-scale magnetic dynamo. As the shock propagates
outwards and the associated turbulence decays, the large velocity shear between the supersonically
rotating cool disc with respect to the (partially) pressure-supported hot circumgalactic medium
excites Kelvin-Helmholtz surface and body modes. Those inject turbulence and drive multiple small-scale
dynamos, which exponentially amplify magnetic fields. They grow in scale to reach equipartition
with thermal and CR energies in Milky Way-mass galaxies. In small galaxies, the magnetic energy
saturates at the turbulent energy while it fails to reach equipartition with thermal and CR energies.
We solve for steady-state spectra of CR protons, secondary electrons/positrons from hadronic
CR-proton interactions with the interstellar medium, and primary shock-accelerated electrons
at supernovae. The radio-synchrotron emission is dominated by primary electrons, irradiates
the magnetised disc, bulge, and bubble-shaped magnetically-loaded outflows of our simulated
Milky Way-mass galaxy. Our star-forming and star-bursting galaxies with saturated magnetic fields
match the global FIR-radio correlation (FRC) across four orders of magnitude. Its intrinsic scatter
arises due to (i) different magnetic saturation levels that result from different seed magnetic
fields, (ii) different radio synchrotron luminosities for different specific SFRs at fixed SFR
and (iii) a varying radio intensity with galactic inclination. (abridged)

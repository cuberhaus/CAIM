Context: TOI-2076 is a transiting three-planet system of sub-Neptunes orbiting a bright (G = 8.9
mag), young ($340\pm80$ Myr) K-type star. Although a validated planetary system, the orbits of
the two outer planets were unconstrained as only two non-consecutive transits were seen in TESS
photometry. This left 11 and 7 possible period aliases for each. Aims: To reveal the true orbits of
these two long-period planets, precise photometry targeted on the highest-probability period
aliases is required. Long-term monitoring of transits in multi-planet systems can also help constrain
planetary masses through TTV measurements. Methods: We used the MonoTools package to determine
which aliases to follow, and then performed space-based and ground-based photometric follow-up
of TOI-2076 c and d with CHEOPS, SAINT-EX, and LCO telescopes. Results: CHEOPS observations revealed
a clear detection for TOI-2076 c at $P=21.01538^{+0.00084}_{-0.00074}$ d, and allowed us to rule
out three of the most likely period aliases for TOI-2076 d. Ground-based photometry further enabled
us to rule out remaining aliases and confirm the $P=35.12537\pm0.00067$ d alias. These observations
also improved the radius precision of all three sub-Neptunes to $2.518\pm0.036$, $3.497\pm0.043$,
and $3.232\pm0.063$ $R_\oplus$. Our observations also revealed a clear anti-correlated TTV signal
between planets b and c likely caused by their proximity to the 2:1 resonance, while planets c and
d appear close to a 5:3 period commensurability, although model degeneracy meant we were unable
to retrieve robust TTV masses. Their inflated radii, likely due to extended H-He atmospheres, combined
with low insolation makes all three planets excellent candidates for future comparative transmission
spectroscopy with JWST.

The eROSITA Final Equatorial-Depth Survey (eFEDS), executed during the performance verification
phase of the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG)/eROSITA telescope, was completed in Nov. 2019. One
of the science goals of this survey is to demonstrate the ability of eROSITA to detect samples of clusters
and groups at the final depth of the eROSITA all-sky survey. Because of the sizeable point-spread
function of eROSITA, high-redshift clusters of galaxies or compact nearby groups hosting bright
active galactic nuclei (AGN) can be misclassified as point sources by the source detection algorithms.
A total of 346 galaxy clusters and groups in the redshift range of 0.1<z<1.3 were identified based
on their red sequence in the point source catalog. We examine the multiwavelength properties of
these clusters and groups to understand the potential biases in our selection process and the completeness
of the extent-selected sample. The majority of the clusters and groups in the point source sample
are indeed underluminous and compact compared to the extent-selected sample. Their faint X-ray
emission, well below the flux limit of the extent-selected eFEDS clusters, and their compact X-ray
emission are likely to be the main reason for this misclassification. In the sample, we confirm that
10% of the sources host AGN in their brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) through optical spectroscopy
and visual inspection. By studying their X-ray, optical, infrared, and radio properties, we establish
a method for identifying clusters and groups that host AGN in their BCGs. We successfully test this
method on the current point source catalog through the Sloan Digital Sky Survey optical spectroscopy
and find eight clusters and groups with active radio-loud AGN that are particularly bright in the
infrared. They include eFEDSJ091437.8+024558, eFEDSJ083520.1+012516, and eFEDSJ092227.1+043339
at redshifts 0.3-0.4. [ABRIDGED]

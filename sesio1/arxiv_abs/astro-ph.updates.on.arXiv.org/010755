Global magnetic field models use as input synoptic data, which usually show "aging effects" as the
longitudinal 360{\deg} information is not obtained simultaneously. Especially during times
of increased solar activity, the evolution of the magnetic field may yield large uncertainties.
A significant source of uncertainty is the Sun's magnetic field on the side of the Sun that is not visible
to the observer. Various methods have been used to complete the picture: synoptic charts, flux-transport
models, and far side helioseismology. In this study, we present a new method to estimate the far-side
open flux within coronal holes using STEREO EUV observations. First, we correlate the structure
of the photospheric magnetic field as observed with the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board
the Solar Dynamics Observatory (HMI/SDO) with features in the transition region. From the 304A
intensity distribution, which we found to be specific to coronal holes, we derive an empirical estimate
for the open flux. Then we use a large sample of 313 SDO coronal hole observations to verify this relation.
Finally, we perform a cross-instrument calibration from SDO to STEREO data to enable the estimation
of the open flux at solar longitudes not visible from Earth. We find that the properties of strong,
unipolar magnetic elements in the photosphere, which determine the coronal hole's open flux, can
be approximated by open fields in the transition region. We find that structures below a threshold
of 78% (STEREO) or 94% (SDO) of the solar disk median intensity as seen in 304A filtergrams are reasonably
well correlated with the mean magnetic flux density of coronal holes (cc = 0.59). Using the area covered
by these structures (A_of) and the area of the coronal hole (A_ch), we model the open magnetic flux
of a coronal hole as |Phi_ch| = 0.25 A_ch exp(0.032 A_of) with an estimated uncertainty of 40 to 60%.

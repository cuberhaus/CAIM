We present new imaging and spectroscopic observations of the exoplanet host star $\gamma$ Cep A,
and of its low-mass stellar companion $\gamma$ Cep B. We used AstraLux/CAHA to follow the orbital
motion of the companion around its primary, whose radial velocity was determined with spectra of
the star, taken with the spectrograph FLECHAS at the University Observatory Jena. We measured the
astrometry of $\gamma$ Cep B relative to its primary in all AstraLux images and determined its apparent
SDSS i'-band photometry, for which we obtained i'=9.84$\pm$0.17 mag. Using stellar evolutionary
models and the Gaia parallax of the exoplanet host star, we derived the mass of $\gamma$ Cep B to be
0.39$\pm$0.03 M${_\odot}$. This is in good agreement with the mass of the companion, derived from
its NIR photometry, given in the literature. With the detection limit, reached in our AstraLux images,
we explored the detection space of potential additional companions in the $\gamma$ Cep binary system.
In the background limited region at angular separations larger then 5 '' (or 69 au of proj. separation)
companions down to 0.11 M$_\odot$ are detectable around $\gamma$ Cep A. The radial FoV, fully covered
in our AstraLux images, exhibits a radius of 11.2 ''. This allows the detection of companions with
proj. separations up to 155 au. However, except for $\gamma$ Cep B no additional companions could
be imaged around the exoplanet host star. We redetermined the orbital solution of the $\gamma$ Cep
binary system with the new AstraLux astrometry of $\gamma$ Cep B and the additional radial velocities
of $\gamma$ Cep A, obtained from our FLECHAS spectroscopy of the star, combined with astrometric
and radial velocity data from the literature. The determined orbital elements were used to derive
the system parameters and to calculate specific future ephemeris for this intriguing exoplanet
host binary star system.

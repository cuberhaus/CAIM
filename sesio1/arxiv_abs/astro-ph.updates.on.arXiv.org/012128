We compare dynamical mass estimates based on spatially extended stellar and ionized gas kinematics
($\mathrm{M_{dyn,*}}$ and $\mathrm{M_{dyn,eml}}$, respectively) of 157 star forming galaxies
at $0.6\leq z<1$. Compared to $z\sim0$, these galaxies have enhanced star formation rates, with
stellar feedback likely affecting the dynamics of the gas. We use LEGA-C DR3, the highest redshift
dataset providing sufficiently deep measurements of a $K_s-$band limited sample. For $\mathrm{M_{dyn,*}}$
we use Jeans Anisotropic Multi-Gaussian Expansion models. For $\mathrm{M_{dyn,eml}}$ we first
fit a custom model of a rotating exponential disk with uniform dispersion, whose light is projected
through a slit and corrected for beam smearing. We then apply an asymmetric drift correction based
on assumptions common in the literature to the fitted kinematic components to obtain the circular
velocity, assuming hydrostatic equilibrium. Within the half-light radius, $\mathrm{M_{dyn,eml}}$
is on average lower than $\mathrm{M_{dyn,*}}$, with a mean offset of $-0.15\pm0.016$ dex and galaxy-to-galaxy
scatter of $0.19$ dex, reflecting the combined random uncertainty. While data of higher spatial
resolution are needed to understand this small offset, it supports the assumption that the galaxy-wide
ionized gas kinematics do not predominantly originate from disruptive events such as star formation
driven outflows. However, a similar agreement can be obtained without modeling from the integrated
emission line dispersions for axis ratios $q<0.8$. This suggests that our current understanding
of gas kinematics is not sufficient to efficiently apply asymmetric drift corrections to improve
dynamical mass estimates compared to observations lacking the $S/N$ required for spatially extended
dynamics.

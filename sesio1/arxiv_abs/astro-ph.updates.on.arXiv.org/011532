We investigated the possible cause-effect relation between the wiggling shape of two stellar jets,
MHO 1502 and MHO 2147, and the potential binarity of the respective driving stars. We present high-angular-resolution
H$_2$ (2.122 $\mu$m) and K-band images obtained with the Gemini South Adaptive Optics Imager (GSAOI)
and the Gemini Multi-conjugate Adaptive Optics System (GeMS). The profiles of the jets are depicted
in detail by the H$_2$ images. We used K-band data to search for potential close companions to the
previously suggested exciting sources, and used archive data to investigate these sources and
the environments in which the jets are located. We also applied a model to reproduce the wiggling
profiles of the jets. MHO~1502 is composed of a chain of knots delineating the wiggling jet, suggesting
that the driving source emitted them in an intermittent manner. Our K-band image of the previously
proposed exciting star, IRAC 18064, shows two sources separated by $\sim240$ AU, hinting at its
binarity. However, as IRAC 18064 is located off the jet axis at $\sim2064$ AU, it is questionable
as to whether this source is the true exciting star. Moreover, the orbital model centred on IRAC 18064
suggests a binary companion at a much greater distance ($\sim2200$ AU) than the nearby star (at $\sim$240
AU). On the other hand, the orbital model centred on the axis provides the best fits. Nevertheless,
the precession model centred on the axis cannot be discarded, despite having larger residuals and
$\chi^2$. MHO 2147 displays an S-shaped gentle continuous emission in H$_2$. We identify two other
jets in the field of MHO 2147: a previously reported quasi-perpendicular jet, MHO 2148, and a third
jet adjacent to MHO 2147. The model that best fits the morphology of the MHO 2147 jet and that of its
adjacent jet is precession. The exciting source of MHO 2147 may be a triple system.

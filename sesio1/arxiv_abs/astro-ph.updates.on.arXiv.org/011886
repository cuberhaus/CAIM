Current and upcoming high angular resolution and multi-frequency experiments are well poised
to explore the rich landscape of secondary CMB anisotropies. In this context, we compute for the
first time, the power spectrum of CMB fluctuations from plasma in a cosmological distribution of
evolving lobes of giant radio galaxies. We, also, explicitly take into account the non-thermal
electron distribution, as opposed to thermal distribution, which has important implications
for the inference of the CMB angular power spectrum. The relativistic particles are fed from the
central supermassive blackholes via radio jets leading to radio lobes expanding to megaparsec
scales into the intergalactic medium. Using a model of radio galaxy, we model the energetics and
the pressure of the non-thermal electrons. We calculate the mean global non-thermal y-distortion,
\ynt. For observationally reasonable distribution of the jet luminosities in the range of $10^{45}-10^{47}$
ergs$^{-1}$, we find \ynt to be less than $10^{-5}$, and hence not violating the COBE limit as previously
claimed. Using the unique spectral dependence of the non-thermal SZ, we show that a detection of
\ynt can be within reach at the level of $\gtrsim 5\sigma$ from a future PIXIE-like experiment. The
total non-thermal SZ power spectrum, $C^{NT}_\ell$, from the radio lobes is shown to peak at $\ell
\sim 3000$ with an amplitude $\sim 1\%$ of thermal SZ power spectrum from galaxy clusters, and is
also within the reach for a PIXIE like experiment. Finally, we show that a detection of the $C^{NT}_\ell$
with a PIXIE-like experiment can lead to $\sim 5\sigma$ constraint on the mass dependence of the
jet luminosity with the constraint becoming, at least, ten times better for the proposed more ambitious
CMB-HD survey. This will, further, lead to the tightest constraint on the central black hole mass
-to- host halo mass scaling relations.

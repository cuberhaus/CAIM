Combining 66 ultraviolet (UV) spectra and ancillary data from the Low-Redshift Lyman Continuum
Survey (LzLCS) and 23 LyC observations by earlier studies, we form a statistical sample of star-forming
galaxies at $z \sim 0.3$ to study the role of the cold interstellar medium (ISM) gas in the leakage
of ionizing radiation. We first constrain the massive star content (ages and metallicities) and
UV attenuation, by fitting the stellar continuum with a combination of simple stellar population
models. The models, together with accurate LyC flux measurements, allow to determine the absolute
LyC photon escape fraction for each galaxy ($f_{\rm esc}^{\rm abs}$). We measure the equivalent
widths and residual fluxes of multiple HI and low-ionization state (LIS) lines, and the geometrical
covering fraction adopting the picket-fence model. The $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm abs}$ spans a wide range,
with a median (0.16, 0.84 quantiles) of 0.04 (0.02, 0.20), and 50 out of the 89 galaxies detected in
the LyC. The HI and LIS line equivalent widths scale with the UV luminosity and attenuation, and inversely
with the residual flux of the lines. The HI and LIS residual fluxes are correlated, indicating that
the neutral gas is spatially traced by the LIS transitions. We find the observed trends of the absorption
lines and the UV attenuation are primarily driven by the covering fraction. The non-uniform gas
coverage demonstrates that LyC photons escape through low-column density channels in the ISM.
The equivalent widths and residual fluxes of the UV lines strongly correlate with $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm
abs}$: strong LyC leakers show weak absorption lines, low UV attenuation, and large Ly$\alpha$
equivalent widths. We finally show that simultaneous UV absorption line and dust attenuation measurements
can predict, on average, the escape fraction of galaxies and the method can be applied to galaxies
across a wide redshift range.

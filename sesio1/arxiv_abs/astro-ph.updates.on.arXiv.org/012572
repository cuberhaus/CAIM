Dynamically, cosmic rays with energies above about one GeV/nucleon may be important agents of galaxy
evolution. Their pressures compare with the thermal and magnetic ones impacting galactic gas accretion,
fountains and galactic outflows, and alter the mass cycling between the gas phases, its efficiency
depends on the properties of CR transport in the different media. We aim to study the dynamical role
of CRs in shaping the interstellar medium of a galaxy when changing their propagation mode. We perform
MHD simulations with the AMR code RAMSES of the evolution of the same isolated galaxy (dwarf galaxy
of $10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$ down to 9-pc resolution) and compare the impact of the simplest cosmic-ray
transport assumption of uniform diffusion. We have also updated the observational relation seen
between the $\gamma$-ray luminosities and SFR of galaxies using the latest detection of Fermi LAT
sources. We find that the radial and vertical distributions, and mass fractions of the gas in the
different phases are marginally altered when changing CR transport. We observe positive feedback
of CR on the amplification of the magnetic field in the inner half of the galaxy, except for fast isotropic
diffusion. The increase in CR pressure for slow or anisotropic diffusion can suppress star formation
by up to 50\%, but the dual effect of cosmic-ray pressure and magnetic amplification can reduce star
formation by a factor 2.5. The $\gamma$-ray luminosities and SFR of the simulated galaxies are fully
consistent with the trend seen in the observations in the case of anisotropic $10^{27.5-29}$ cm$^2$
s$^{-1}$ diffusion and for isotropic diffusion slower or equal to $3 \times 10^{28}$cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$.
These results, therefore, do not confirm claims of very fast $10^{29-31}$ cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$ diffusion
to match the Fermi LAT observations.

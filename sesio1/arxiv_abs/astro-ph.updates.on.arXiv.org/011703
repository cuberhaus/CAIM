We model the energetic storm particle (ESP) event of 14 July 2012 using the energetic particle acceleration
and transport model named PARADISE, together with the solar wind and coronal mass ejection (CME)
model named EUHFORIA. The simulation results illustrate both the capabilities and limitations
of the utilised models. We show that the models capture some essential structural features of the
ESP event; however, for some aspects the simulations and observations diverge. We describe and,
to some extent, assess the sources of errors in the modelling chain of EUHFORIA and PARADISE and discuss
how they may be mitigated in the future. The PARADISE model evolves energetic particle distributions
in a background solar wind generated by the ideal MHD module of EUHFORIA. The CME generating the ESP
event is simulated by using the spheromak model of EUHFORIA, which approximates the CME's flux rope
as a linear force-free spheroidal magnetic field. In addition, a tool was developed to trace CME-driven
shock waves in the EUHFORIA simulation domain. This tool is used in PARADISE to (i) inject 50 keV protons
continuously at the CME-driven shock and (ii) include a foreshock and a sheath region, in which the
energetic particle parallel mean free path, $\lambda_\parallel$, decreases towards the shock
wave. The value of $\lambda_\parallel$ at the shock wave is estimated from in situ observations
of the ESP event. For energies below 1 MeV, the simulation results agree well with both the upstream
and downstream components of the ESP event observed by the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE).
This suggests that these low-energy protons are mainly the result of interplanetary particle acceleration.
In the downstream region, the sharp drop in the energetic particle intensities is reproduced at
the entry into the following magnetic cloud, illustrating the importance of a magnetised CME model.

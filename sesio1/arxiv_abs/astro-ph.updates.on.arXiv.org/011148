In large-scale hydrodynamical cosmological simulations, the fate of massive galaxies is mainly
dictated by the modeling of feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN). The amount of energy released
by AGN feedback is proportional to the mass that has been accreted onto the BHs, but the exact sub-grid
modeling of AGN feedback differs in all simulations. Whilst modern simulations reliably produce
populations of quiescent massive galaxies at z<2, it is also crucial to assess the similarities
and differences of the responsible AGN populations. Here, we compare the AGN population of the Illustris,
TNG100, TNG300, Horizon-AGN, EAGLE, and SIMBA simulations. The AGN luminosity function (LF) varies
significantly between simulations. Although in agreement with current observational constraints
at z=0, at higher redshift the agreement of the LFs deteriorates with most simulations producing
too many AGN of L_{x, 2-10 keV}~10^43-10^44 erg/s. AGN feedback in some simulations prevents the
existence of any bright AGN with L_{x, 2-10 keV}>=10^45 erg/s (although this is sensitive to AGN
variability), and leads to smaller fractions of AGN in massive galaxies than in the observations
at z<=2. We find that all the simulations fail at producing a number density of AGN in good agreement
with observational constraints for both luminous (L_{x, 2-10 keV}~10^43-10^45 erg/s) and fainter
(L_{x, 2-10 keV}~10^42-10^43 erg/s) AGN, and at both low and high redshift. These differences can
aid us in improving future BH and galaxy subgrid modeling in simulations. Upcoming X-ray missions
(e.g., Athena, AXIS, and LynX) will bring faint AGN to light and new powerful constraints. After
accounting for AGN obscuration, we find that the predicted number density of detectable AGN in future
surveys spans at least one order of magnitude across the simulations, at any redshift.

We constrain the matter density $\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ and the amplitude of density fluctuations
$\sigma_8$ within the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model with shear peak statistics and angular
convergence power spectra using mass maps constructed from the first three years of data of the Dark
Energy Survey (DES Y3). We use tomographic shear peak statistics, including cross-peaks: peak
counts calculated on maps created by taking a harmonic space product of the convergence of two tomographic
redshift bins. Our analysis follows a forward-modelling scheme to create a likelihood of these
statistics using N-body simulations, using a Gaussian process emulator. We include the following
lensing systematics: multiplicative shear bias, photometric redshift uncertainty, and galaxy
intrinsic alignment. Stringent scale cuts are applied to avoid biases from unmodelled baryonic
physics. We find that the additional non-Gaussian information leads to a tightening of the constraints
on the structure growth parameter yielding $S_8~\equiv~\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.3}~=~0.797_{-0.013}^{+0.015}$
(68% confidence limits), with a precision of 1.8%, an improvement of ~38% compared to the angular
power spectra only case. The results obtained with the angular power spectra and peak counts are
found to be in agreement with each other and no significant difference in $S_8$ is recorded. We find
a mild tension of $1.5 \thinspace \sigma$ between our study and the results from Planck 2018, with
our analysis yielding a lower $S_8$. Furthermore, we observe that the combination of angular power
spectra and tomographic peak counts breaks the degeneracy between galaxy intrinsic alignment
$A_{\mathrm{IA}}$ and $S_8$, improving cosmological constraints. We run a suite of tests concluding
that our results are robust and consistent with the results from other studies using DES Y3 data.

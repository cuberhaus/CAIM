The BICEP/Keck Collaboration is currently leading the quest to the highest sensitivity measurements
of the polarized CMB anisotropies on degree scale with a series of cryogenic telescopes, of which
BICEP Array is the latest Stage-3 upgrade with a total of $\sim32,000$ detectors. The instrument
comprises 4 receivers spanning 30 to 270 GHz, with the low-frequency 30/40 GHz deployed to the South
Pole Station in late 2019. The full complement of receivers is forecast to set the most stringent
constraints on the tensor to scalar ratio $r$. Building on these advances, the overarching small-aperture
telescope concept is already being used as the reference for further Stage-4 experiment design.
In this paper I will present the development of the BICEP Array 150 GHz detector module and its fabrication
requirements, with highlights on the high-density time division multiplexing (TDM) design of
the cryogenic circuit boards. The low-impedance wiring required between the detectors and the
first-stage SQUID amplifiers is crucial to maintain a stiff voltage bias on the detectors. A novel
multi-layer FR4 Printed Circuit Board (PCB) with superconducting traces, capable of reading out
up to 648 detectors, is presented along with its validation tests. I will also describe an ultra-high
density TDM detector module we developed for a CMB-S4-like experiment that allows up to 1,920 detectors
to be read out. TDM has been chosen as the detector readout technology for the Cosmic Microwave Background
Stage-4 (CMB-S4) experiment based on its proven low-noise performance, predictable costs and
overall maturity of the architecture. The heritage for TDM is rooted in mm- and submm-wave experiments
dating back 20 years and has since evolved to support a multiplexing factor of 64x in Stage-3 experiments.

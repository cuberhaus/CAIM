Cosmic rays (CRs) at sub-TeV energies play a fundamental role in the chemical and dynamical evolution
of molecular clouds, as they control the ionisation, dissociation, and excitation of H$_{2}$.
Their characterisation is important both for the interpretation of observations and for the development
of theoretical models. The methods used so far for estimating the CR ionisation rate ($\zeta$) in
molecular clouds have several limitations due to uncertainties in the adopted chemical networks.
We refine and extend the method proposed by Bialy (2020) to estimate $\zeta$ by observing rovibrational
transitions of H$_{2}$ at near-infrared wavelengths, which are mainly excited by secondary CR
electrons. Combining models of interstellar CR propagation and attenuation with the calculation
of the expected secondary electron spectrum and updated H$_{2}$ excitation cross sections by electron
collisions, we derive the intensity of the four H$_{2}$ rovibrational transitions observable
in dense, cold gas: (1-0)O(2), (1-0)Q(2), (1-0)S(0), and (1-0)O(4). The proposed method allows
the estimation of $\zeta$ for a given observed line intensity and H$_{2}$ column density. We are
also able to deduce the shape of the low-energy CR proton spectrum impinging upon the molecular cloud.
We present a look-up plot and a web-based application that can be used to constrain the low-energy
spectral slope of the interstellar CR proton spectrum. We comment on the capability of the James
Webb Space Telescope to detect these near-infrared H$_{2}$ lines, making it possible to derive
for the first time spatial variation of $\zeta$ in dense gas. Besides the implications for the interpretation
of the chemical-dynamic evolution of a molecular cloud, it will be possible to test competing models
of CR propagation and attenuation in the interstellar medium, as well as compare CR spectra in different
Galactic regions.

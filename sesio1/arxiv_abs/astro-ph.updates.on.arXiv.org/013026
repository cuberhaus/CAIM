In the first few Myr the massive stars dynamically interact, produce runaways and affect the initial
binary population. Observing and interpreting the dynamics of young massive clusters is key to
our understanding of the star formation process and predicting the outcome of stellar evolution.
We have studied NGC6611 in the Eagle Nebula (M16), a young massive cluster hosting 19 O stars. We used
Gaia EDR3 data to determine the membership, age, cluster dynamics and the kinematics of the massive
stars including runaways. The membership analysis yields 137 members located at a mean distance
of 1706 $\pm$ 7 pc. The colour - absolute magnitude diagram reveals a blue and a red population of pre-main-sequence
stars, consistent with two distinct populations of stars. In line with earlier studies, the youngest
population has a mean extinction $A_V$ = 3.6 $\pm$ 0.1 mag and an age = 1.3 $\pm$ 0.2 Myr, while the older
population of stars has a mean extinction $A_V$ = 2.0 $\pm$ 0.1 mag and an age = 7.5 $\pm$ 0.4 Myr. The
latter population is more spatially extended than the younger generation of stars. We argue that
most of the OB stars belong to the younger population. We identify 8 runaways originating from the
center of NGC6611, consistent with the dynamical ejection scenario. We show that ~ 50% of the O stars
have velocities comparable to or greater than the escape velocity. These O stars can be traced back
to the center of NGC6611 with kinematic ages ranging from 0 to 2 Myr. This suggests that dynamical
interactions played an important role in the early evolution of NGC6611, which is surprising considering
the low current stellar density. Comparing this to simulations of young massive clusters, the required
initial radius of 0.1-0.5 pc is not consistent with that of NGC6611. The O stars could have initially
formed in wide binaries and possibly harden through dynamical interactions.

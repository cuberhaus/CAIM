We study the onset of vector instabilities in the post-inflationary epoch of the Universe as a mechanism
for primordial magnetic fields amplification. We assume the presence of a charged spectator scalar
field arbitrarily coupled to gravity during Inflation in its vacuum de Sitter state. Gravitational
particle creation takes place at the transition from Inflation to the subsequent Reheating stage
and thus the vacuum field state becomes an excited many particles one. Consequently this state can
be described as a real fluid, and we build out the hydrodynamic framework using second order theories
for relativistic fluids with a relaxation time prescription for the collision integral. Given
the high-temperature regime and the vanishing scalar curvature of the Universe during Reheating
(radiation-dominated-type era), the fluid can be regarded as a conformal one. The large quantum
fluctuations induced by the rapid transition from inflationary to effectively radiation dominated
expansion become statistical fluctuations whereby both a charge excess and anisotropic pressures
are produced in any finite domain. The precise magnitude of the effect for each scale is determined
by the size of the averaging domain and the coupling to curvature. We look at domains which are larger
than the horizon at the beginning of Reheating, but much smaller than our own horizon, and show that
in a finite fraction of them the anisotropy and charge excess provide suitable conditions for a Weibel
instability. If moreover the duration of reheating is shorter than the relaxation time of the fluid,
then this instability can compensate or even overcome the conformal dilution of a primordial magnetic
field. We show that the non-trivial topology of the magnetic field encoded in its magnetic helicity
is also amplified if present.

We present the first model-agnostic analysis of the complete set of Sloan Digital Sky Survey III
(BOSS) and -IV (eBOSS) catalogues of luminous red galaxy and quasar clustering in the redshift range
$0.2\leq z \leq 2.2$ (10 billion years of cosmic evolution), which consistently includes the baryon
acoustic oscillations (BAO), redshift space distortions (RSD) and the shape of the transfer function
signatures, from pre- and post-reconstructed catalogues in Fourier space. This approach complements
the standard analyses techniques which only focus on the BAO and RSD signatures, and the full-modeling
approaches which assume a specific underlying cosmology model to perform the analysis. These model-independent
results can then easily be interpreted in the context of the cosmological model of choice. In particular,
when combined with $z>2.1$ Ly-$\alpha$ BAO measurements, the clustering BAO, RSD and {\it Shape}
parameters can be interpreted within a flat-$\Lambda$CDM model yielding $h=0.6816\pm0.0067$,
$\Omega_{\rm m}=0.3001\pm0.0057$ and $10^{9}\times A_s= 2.43\pm0.20$ (or $\sigma_8=0.858\pm0.036$)
with a Big Bang Nucleosynthesis prior on the baryon density. Without any external dataset, the BOSS
and eBOSS data alone imply $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.2971\pm 0.0061$ and $10^{9}\times A_s=2.39^{+0.24}_{-0.43}$
(or $\sigma_8=0.857\pm0.040$). For models beyond $\Lambda$CDM, eBOSS data alone (in combination
with Planck) constrain the sum of neutrino mass to be $\Sigma m_\nu< 0.40$ eV with a BBN prior ($\Sigma
m_\nu <0.082$ eV) at 95\% CL, the curvature energy density to $\Omega_\mathrm{k} = -0.022_{-0.038}^{+0.032}$
($\Omega_\mathrm{k} = 0.0015\pm 0.0016$) and the dark energy equation of state parameter to $w=-0.998_{-0.073}^{+0.085}$
($w=-1.093_{-0.044}^{+0.048}$) at 68\% CL without a BBN prior.

This paper explores small-scale departures from force-free electrodynamics around a rotating
neutron star, extending our treatment of resistive instability in a quantizing magnetic field.
A secondary, Cerenkov instability is identified: relativistic particles flowing through thin
current sheets excite propagating charge perturbations that are localized near the sheets. Growth
is rapid at wavenumbers below the inverse ambient skin depth $k_{p,\rm ex}$. Small-scale Alfv\'enic
wavepackets are promising sources of coherent curvature radiation. When the group Lorentz factor
$\gamma_{\rm gr} \lesssim (k_{p,\rm ex}R_c)^{1/3} \sim 100$, where $R_c$ is the magnetic curvature
radius, a fraction $\sim 10^{-3}$-$10^{-2}$ of the particle kinetic energy is radiated into the
extraordinary mode at a peak frequency $\sim 10^{-2}ck_{p,\rm ex}$. Consistency with observations
requires a high pair multiplicity ($\sim 10^{3-5}$) in the pulsar magnetosphere. Neither the primary,
slow resistive instability nor the secondary, Alfv\'enic instability depend directly on the presence
of magnetospheric `gaps', and may activate where the mean current is fully supplied by outward drift
of the corotation charge. The resistive mode is overstable and grows at a rate comparable to the stellar
spin frequency; the model directly accommodates strong pulse-to-pulse radio flux variations
and coordinated subpulse drift. Alfv\'en mode growth can track the local plasma conditions, allowing
for lower-frequency emission from the outer magnetosphere. Beamed radio emission from charged
packets with $\gamma_{\rm gr} \sim 50-100$ also varies on sub-millisecond timescales. The modes
identified here will be excited inside the magnetosphere of a magnetar, and may mediate Taylor relaxation
of the magnetic twist.

Scalar-tensor theories of gravity provide mathematically equivalent descriptions of Einstein's
gravity with a scalar field, in a conformally connected spacetime, described in terms of the Jordan
frame and the Einstein frame. In this paper, we use the Jordan frame-Einstein frame correspondence
to explore dual universes with contrasting cosmological evolutions. We study the mapping between
Einstein and Jordan frames where the Einstein frame universe effectively describes the late-time
evolution of the physical universe, driven by dark energy and non-relativistic matter. The Brans-Dicke
theory of gravity is taken to be the dual scalar-tensor theory in the Jordan frame. We show that the
standard Einstein frame universe, with dark energy and non-relativistic matter, always corresponds
to a bouncing Jordan frame universe, if it is governed by a Brans-Dicke theory. This essentially
leads to an alternative description of the late-time evolution of the physical universe, in terms
of a bouncing Brans-Dicke universe in the Jordan frame. Previous studies have shown that for a bouncing
Jordan frame, particularly for an early-time accelerating phase of the universe, the map between
the Einstein and Jordan frames may become singular in the perturbative regime, causing the conformal
correspondence to break down. In order to check whether the present bouncing model for late-time
acceleration is free of such instabilities, we study the evolution of scalar metric perturbations.
The Jordan frame metric perturbations are numerically solved, first via the Einstein frame using
the conformal correspondence, and then directly in the Jordan frame. The evolutions of perturbations
obtained in these two cases are in a good agreement. Thus, the duality between the Einstein frame,
mimicking the physical universe, and the bouncing Brans-Dicke Jordan frame, is shown to be stable
against linear perturbations.

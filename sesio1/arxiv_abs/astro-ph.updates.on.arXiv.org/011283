Mass and spin are two fundamental properties of astrophysical black holes. While some established,
indirect methods are adopted to measure both these properties of active galactic nuclei (AGN) when
viewed relatively face-on, very few suggested methods exist to measure these properties when AGN
are viewed highly inclined and potentially obscured by large amounts of gas. In this context, we
explore the accuracy and performance of a recently proposed method to estimate the spin of AGN through
fitting their accretion disk spectral energy distribution, when adapted for highly inclined and
obscured systems, and in particular to a sample of six, local water megamasers. For these sources,
both the accretion rate and inclination angle are known, allowing us to rely only on the AGN bolometric
luminosity to infer their spin. Using the bolometric luminosity as a proxy for the accretion disk
peak luminosity, we derive the expected bolometric luminosity as a function of spin. Then, we measure
the bolometric luminosity of each source through X-ray spectroscopy, and compare it with the expected
value to constrain the spin of the AGN. The quality of the constraints depend critically on the accuracy
of the measured bolometric luminosity, which is difficult to estimate in heavily obscured systems.
Three out of six sources do not show consistency between the expected and measured bolometric luminosities,
while other three (four, when considering the [OIII] line as tracer of the bolometric luminosity)
are formally consistent with high spin values. Our results suggest that this method, although promising
(and possibly considered as a future calibrator for other methods) needs better observational
data and further theoretical modeling to be successfully applied to obscured AGN and to infer robust
results.

Atmospheric retrievals of exoplanet transmission spectra allow constraints on the composition
and structure of the day-night terminator region. Such retrievals in the past have typically assumed
one-dimensional temperature structures which were adequate to explain extant observations.
However, the increasing data quality expected from exoplanet spectroscopy with JWST motivates
considerations of multidimensional atmospheric retrievals. We present AURA-3D, a three-dimensional
atmospheric retrieval framework for exoplanet transmission spectra. AURA-3D includes a forward
model that enables rapid computation of transmission spectra in 3D geometry for a given atmospheric
structure and can, therefore, be used for atmospheric retrievals as well as for computing spectra
from General Circulation Models (GCMs). In order to efficiently explore the space of possible 3D
temperature structures in retrievals, we develop a parametric 3D pressure-temperature profile
which can accurately represent azimuthally-averaged temperature structures of a range of hot
Jupiter GCMs. We apply our retrieval framework to simulated JWST observations of hot Jupiter transmission
spectra, obtaining accurate estimates of the day-night temperature variation across the terminator
as well as the abundances of chemical species. We demonstrate an example of a model hot Jupiter transmission
spectrum for which a traditional 1D retrieval of JWST-quality data returns biased abundance estimates,
whereas a retrieval including a day-night temperature gradient can accurately retrieve the true
abundances. Our forward model also has the capability to include inhomogeneous chemistry as well
as variable clouds/hazes. This new retrieval framework opens the field to detailed multidimensional
atmospheric characterisation using transmission spectra of exoplanets in the JWST era.

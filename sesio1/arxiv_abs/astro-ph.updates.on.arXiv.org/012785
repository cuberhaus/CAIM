Only a handful of late-T brown dwarfs have been monitored for spectro-photometric variability,
leaving incomplete the study of the atmospheric cloud structures of the coldest brown dwarfs, that
share temperatures with some cold, directly-imaged exoplanets. 2MASSJ00501994-332240 is a T7.0
rapidly rotating, field brown dwarf that showed low-level photometric variability in data obtained
with the Spitzer Space telescope. We monitored 2MASSJ00501994-332240 during ~2.6 hr with MOSFIRE,
installed at the Keck I telescope, with the aim of constraining its near-infrared spectro-photometric
variability. We measured fluctuations with a peak-to-peak amplitude of 1.48+\-0.75% in the J-band
photometric light curve, an amplitude of 0.62+/-0.18% in the J-band spectro-photometric light
curve, and an amplitude of 1.26+/-0.93% in the H-band light curve, and an amplitude of 5.33+/-2.02%
in the CH_4-H_2O band light curve. Nevertheless, the Bayesian Information Criterion does not detect
significant variability in any of the light curves. Thus, given the detection limitations due to
the MOSFIRE sensitivity, we can only claim tentative low-level variability for 2M0050-3322 in
the best-case scenario. The amplitudes of the peak-to-peak fluctuations measured for 2MASSJ00501994-332240
agree with the variability amplitude predictions of General Circulation Models for a T7.0 brown
dwarf for an edge on object. Radiative-transfer models predict that the Na_2S and KCl clouds condense
at pressures lower than that traced by the CH_4-H_2O band, which might explain the higher peak-to-peak
fluctuations measured for this light curve. Finally, we provide a visual recreation of the map provided
by General Circulation Models and the vertical structure of 2MASSJ00501994-332240 provided by
radiative-transfer models.

Along their long propagation from production to detection, neutrino states undergo quantum interference
which converts their types, or flavours. High-energy astrophysical neutrinos, first observed
by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, are known to propagate unperturbed over a billion light years
in vacuum. These neutrinos act as the largest quantum interferometer and are sensitive to the smallest
effects in vacuum due to new physics. Quantum gravity (QG) aims to describe gravity in a quantum mechanical
framework, unifying matter, forces and space-time. QG effects are expected to appear at the ultra-high-energy
scale known as the Planck energy, $E_{P}\equiv 1.22\times 10^{19}$~giga-electronvolts (GeV).
Such a high-energy universe would have existed only right after the Big Bang and it is inaccessible
by human technologies. On the other hand, it is speculated that the effects of QG may exist in our low-energy
vacuum, but are suppressed by the Planck energy as $E_{P}^{-1}$ ($\sim 10^{-19}$~GeV$^{-1}$),
$E_{P}^{-2}$ ($\sim 10^{-38}$~GeV$^{-2}$), or its higher powers. The coupling of particles to
these effects is too small to measure in kinematic observables, but the phase shift of neutrino waves
could cause observable flavour conversions. Here, we report the first result of neutrino interferometry~\cite{Aartsen:2017ibm}
using astrophysical neutrino flavours to search for new space-time structure. We did not find any
evidence of anomalous flavour conversion in IceCube astrophysical neutrino flavour data. We place
the most stringent limits of any known technologies, down to $10^{-42}$~GeV$^{-2}$, on the dimension-six
operators that parameterize the space-time defects for preferred astrophysical production scenarios.
For the first time, we unambiguously reach the signal region of quantum-gravity-motivated physics.

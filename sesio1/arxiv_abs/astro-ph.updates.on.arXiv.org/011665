The composition of planets may be largely determined by the chemical processing and accretion of
icy pebbles in protoplanetary disks. Recent observations of protoplanetary disks hint at wide-spread
depletion of gaseous carbon. The missing volatile carbon is likely frozen in CO and/or CO$_2$ ice
on grains and locked into the disk through pebble trapping in pressure bumps or planetesimals. We
present the results of the first successful ACA (Atacama Compact Array) [C I] $J$ = 1-0 mini-survey
of seven protoplanetary disks. Using tailored azimuthally symmetric DALI (Dust And LInes) thermo-chemical
disk models, supported by the [C I] $J$ = 1-0 and resolved CO isotopologue data, we determine the system-averaged
elemental volatile carbon abundance in the outer disk of three sources. Six out of seven sources
are detected in [C I] $J$ = 1-0 with ACA, four of which show a distinct disk component. Based on the modeling
we find severe cold gaseous carbon depletion in the outer disk of DL Tau and moderate depletion in
the outer disks of DR Tau and DO Tau. Combining the outer and inner disk carbon abundances, we demonstrate
definitive evidence for radial drift in the disk of DL Tau, where the existence of multiple dust rings
points to either short lived or leaky dust traps. We find dust locking in the compact and smooth disks
of DO Tau and DR Tau, hinting at unresolved dust substructure. Comparing our results with stars of
different ages and luminosities, we identify an observational evolutionary trend in gaseous carbon
depletion that is consistent with dynamical models of CO depletion processes. Transport efficiency
of solids in protoplanetary disks can significantly differ from what we expect based on the current
resolved substructure in the continuum observations. This has important implications for our
understanding of the impact of radial drift and pebble accretion on planetary compositions.

The presence of large ionised gaseous nebulae found around some ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs)
provides means to assess the mechanical and radiative feedback of the central source, and henceforth
constrain the efficiency and impact on the surroundings of the super-Eddington regime powering
most of these sources. NGC~1313~X--1 is an archetypal ULX which had been reported to be surrounded
by abnormally high [O~I]$\lambda$6300/H$\alpha >$ 0.1 ratios and for which high-resolution spectroscopy
in X-rays had hinted the presence of powerful outflows. We report observations taken with the Multi-Unit
Spectroscopic Explorer of NGC~1313~X--1 in order to confirm the presence of a nebula inflated by
the winds, investigate its main sources of ionisation and estimate the mechanical output of the
source. We detect a bubble of 452 $\times$ 266\,pc in size, roughly centred around the ULX, which
shows clear evidence for shock ionisation in the outer edges. We estimate shock velocities to be
in the $\approx160-180$\,km/s range based on the line ratios. This suggests that an average and
continuous outflow power of $\sim(2-4.5) \times 10^{40}$~erg/s over a timescale of $(4.5-7.8)
\times10^5$\,yr is required to inflate the bubble. In the interior of the bubble and closer to the
ULX we detect an extended ($\sim$140\,pc) X-ray ionised region. Additionally, we detect two supernova
remnants coincidentally close to the bubble of which we also report age and explosion energy estimates.
The elongated morphology and the kinematics of the bubble strongly suggest that the bubble is being
inflated by winds and/or jets emanating from the central source, supporting the presence of winds
found through X-ray spectroscopy. The estimated mechanical power is comparable or higher than
the X-ray luminosity of the source, providing additional evidence in support of NGC~1313~X--1
harbouring a super-Eddington accretor.

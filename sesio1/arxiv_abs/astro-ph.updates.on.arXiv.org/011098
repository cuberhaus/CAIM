One probe for systematic effects in gravitational lensing surveys is the presence of so-called
B-modes in the cosmic shear two-point correlation functions \xi_\pm(\vt), since lensing is expected
to produce only E-mode shear. Furthermore, there exist ambiguous modes which can not uniquely be
assigned to either E- or B-mode shear. We derive explicit equations for the pure-mode shear correlation
functions \xi_\pm^E/B(\vt) and their ambiguous components \xi_\pm^amb(\vt), that can be derived
from the measured \xi_\pm(\vt) on a finite angular interval \tmin\le\vt\le\tmax, such that the
latter can be decomposed uniquely into pure-mode functions as \xi_+=\xi_+^E+\xi_+^B+\xi_+^amb
and \xi_-=\xi_-^E-\xi_-^B+\xi_-^amb. The derivation is obtained by defining a new set of COSEBIs,
for which explicit relations are obtained, and which yields a smaller covariance between COSEBI
modes. We derive the relation between \xi_\pm^E/B/amb and the underlying E-/B-mode power spectra.
The pure-mode correlation functions can provide a diagnostics of systematics in configuration
space. We then apply our results to SLICS simulations and the KiDS-1000 cosmic shear data, calculate
the new COSEBIs and the pure-mode correlation functions, as well as the corresponding covariances,
and show that the new statistics fit equally well to the best-fitting cosmological model as the previous
KiDS-1000 analysis and recovers the same level of (insignificant) B-modes. We also consider in
some detail the ambiguous modes at first- and second-order level, finding some surprising results;
for example, the shear field of a point mass, when cut along a line through the center, can not be ascribed
uniquely to an E-mode shear and is thus ambiguous, and the shear correlation functions resulting
from a random ensemble of point masses, when measured over a finite angular range, correspond to
an ambiguous mode.

55 Cnc e is in a 0.73 day orbit transiting a Sun-like star. It has been observed that the occultation
depth of this Super-Earth, with a mass of 8$M_{\bigoplus}$ and radius of 2$R_{\bigoplus}$, changes
significantly over time at mid-infrared wavelengths. Observations with Spitzer measured a change
in its day-side brightness temperature of 1200 K, possibly driven by volcanic activity, magnetic
star-planet interaction, or the presence of a circumstellar torus of dust. Previous evidence for
the variability in occultation was in the infrared range. Here we aim to explore if the variability
exists also in the optical. TESS observed 55 Cnc during sectors 21, 44 and 46. We carefully detrend
the data and fit a transit and occultation model for each sector in a Markov Chain Monte Carlo routine.
In a later stage we use the Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation statistic to compare with a model of constant
occultation for the complete set and a model with no occultation. We report an occultation depth
of 8$\pm$2.5 ppm for the complete set of TESS observations. In particular, we measured a depth of
15$\pm$4 ppm for sector 21, while for sector 44 we detect no occultation. In sector 46 we measure a
weak occultation of 8$\pm$5 ppm. The occultation depth varies from one sector to the next between
1.6 and 3.4 $\sigma$ significance. We derive the possible contribution on reflected light and thermal
emission, setting an upper limit on the geometric albedo. Based on our model comparison the presence
of an occultation is favoured considerably over no occultation, where the model with varying occultation
across sectors takes most of the statistical weight. Our analysis confirms a detection of the occultation
in TESS. Moreover, our results weakly lean towards a varying occultation depth between each sector,
while the transit depth is constant across visits.

The analysis of debris disk observations is often based on the assumption of a dust phase composed
of compact spherical grains consisting of astronomical silicate. Instead, observations indicate
the existence of water ice in debris disks. We quantify the impact of water ice as a potential grain
constituent in debris disks on the disk parameter values estimated from photometric and spatially
resolved observations in the mid- and far-infrared. We simulated photometric measurements and
radial profiles of debris disks containing water ice and analyzed them by applying a disk model purely
consisting of astronomical silicate. Subsequently, we quantified the deviations between the
derived and the true parameter values. As stars in central positions we discuss a $\beta$ Pic sibling
and main-sequence stars with spectral types ranging from A0 to K5. To simulate observable quantities
we employed selected observational scenarios regarding the choice of wavelengths and instrument
characteristics. For the $\beta$ Pic stellar model and ice fractions $\geq 50\ \%$ the derived inner
disk radius is biased by ice sublimation toward higher values. However, the derived slope of the
radial density profile is mostly unaffected. Along with an increasing ice fraction, the slope of
the grain size distribution is overestimated by up to a median factor of $\sim 1.2$ for an ice fraction
of $90\ \%$ while the total disk mass is underestimated by a factor of $\sim 0.4$. The reliability
of the derived minimum grain size strongly depends on the spectral type of the central star. For an
A0-type star the minimum grain size can be underestimated by a factor of $\sim 0.2$, while for solar-like
stars it is overestimated by up to a factor of $\sim 4 - 5$. Neglecting radial profile measurements
and using solely photometric measurements, the factor of overestimation increases for solar-like
stars up to $\sim 7 - 14$.

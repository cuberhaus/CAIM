Context. Determining properties of dust formed in and around supernovae from observations remains
challenging. This may be due to either incomplete coverage of data in wavelength or time but also
due to often inconspicuous signatures of dust in the observed data. Aims. Here we address this challenge
using modern machine learning methods to determine the amount, composition and temperature of
dust from a large set of simulated data. We aim to determine whether such methods are suitable to infer
these properties from future observations of supernovae. Methods. We calculate spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) of dusty shells around supernovae. We develop a neural network consisting
of eight fully connected layers and an output layer with specified activation functions that allow
us to predict the dust mass, temperature and composition and their respective uncertainties from
each SED. We conduct a feature importance analysis via SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to
find the minimum set of JWST filters required to accurately predict these properties. Results.
We find that our neural network predicts dust masses and temperatures with a root-mean-square error
(RMSE) of $\sim$ 0.12 dex and $\sim$ 38 K, respectively. Moreover, our neural network can well distinguish
between the different dust species included in our work, reaching a classification accuracy of
up to 95\% for carbon and 99\% for silicate dust. Conclusions. Our analysis shows that the JWST filters
NIRCam F070W, F140M, F356W, F480M and MIRI F560W, F770W, F1000W, F1130W, F1500W, F1800W are likely
the most important needed to determine the properties of dust formed in and around supernovae from
future observations. We tested this on selected optical to infrared data of SN 1987A at 615 days past
explosion and find good agreement with dust masses and temperatures inferred with standard fitting
methods in the literature.

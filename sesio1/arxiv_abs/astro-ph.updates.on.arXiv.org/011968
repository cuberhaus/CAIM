The advent of space-based photometry observations provided high-quality asteroseismic data
for a large number of stars. These observations enabled the adaptation of advanced techniques,
until then restricted to helioseismology, to study the best asteroseismic targets. Amongst these,
the 16Cyg binary system holds a special place, being the brightest solar twins observed by Kepler.
For this system, modellers have access to high-quality asteroseismic, spectroscopic and interferometric
data, making it the perfect testbed for the limitations of stellar models. We aim to further constrain
the internal structure and fundamental parameters of 16CygA&B using linear seismic inversion
techniques of both global indicators and localised corrections of the internal structure. We start
from the models defined by detailed modelling in our previous paper and extend our analysis by applying
variational inversions to these models. We carried out inversions of so-called seismic indicators
and provided local corrections of the internal structure of the two stars. Our results indicate
that linear seismic inversions alone are not able to discriminate between standard and non-standard
models for 16CygA&B. We confirm the results of our previous studies that used linear inversion techniques,
but consider that the differences could be linked to small fundamental parameters variations rather
than to a missing process in the models. We confirm the robustness and reliability of the results
of the modelling performed in our previous paper. We conclude that non-linear inversions are likely
required to further investigate the properties of 16CygA&B from a seismic point of view, but that
these inversions should be coupled to analyses of the depletion of light elements such as lithium
and beryllium to constrain the macroscopic transport of chemicals and potential non-standard
evolutionary paths.

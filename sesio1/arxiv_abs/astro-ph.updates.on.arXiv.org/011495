Massive stars that become stripped of their hydrogen envelope through binary interaction or winds
can be observed either as Wolf-Rayet stars, if they have optically thick winds, or as transparent-wind
stripped-envelope stars. We approximate their evolution through evolutionary models of single
helium stars, and compute detailed model grids in the initial mass range 1.5 to 70 M$_{\odot}$ for
metallicities between 0.01 and 0.04, from core helium ignition until core collapse. Throughout
their lifetime, some stellar models expose the ashes of helium burning. We propose that models that
have nitrogen-rich envelopes are candidate WN stars, while models with a carbon-rich surface are
candidate WC stars during core helium burning, and WO stars afterwards. We measure metallicity
dependance of the total lifetime of our models and the duration of their evolutionary phases. We
propose an analytic estimate of the wind optical depth to distinguish models of Wolf-Rayet stars
from transparent-wind stripped-envelope stars, and find that the luminosity ranges at which WN,
WC and WO type stars can exist is a strong function of metallicity. We find that all carbon-rich models
produced in our grids have optically thick winds and match the luminosity distribution of observed
populations. We construct population models and predict the numbers of transparent-wind stripped-envelope
stars and Wolf-Rayet stars, and derive their number ratios at different metallicities. We find
that as metallicity increases, the number of transparent-wind stripped-envelope stars decreases
and the number of Wolf-Rayet stars increases. At high metallicities WC and WO type stars become more
common. We apply our population models to nearby galaxies, and find that populations are more sensitive
to the transition luminosity between Wolf-Rayet stars and transparent-wind helium stars than
to the metallicity dependent mass loss rates.

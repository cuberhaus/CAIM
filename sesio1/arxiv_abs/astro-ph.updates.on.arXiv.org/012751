Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) contains the first release of magnitudes estimated from the integration
of Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS) spectra for a sample of about 32.2 million stars brighter
than G_RVS~14 mag (or G~15 mag). In this paper, we describe the data used and the approach adopted
to derive and validate the G_RVS magnitudes published in DR3. We also provide estimates of the G_RVS
passband and associated G_RVS zero-point. We derived G_RVS photometry from the integration of
RVS spectra over the wavelength range from 846 to 870 nm. We processed these spectra following a procedure
similar to that used for DR2, but incorporating several improvements that allow a better estimation
of G_RVS. These improvements pertain to the stray-light background estimation, the line spread
function calibration, and the detection of spectra contaminated by nearby relatively bright sources.
We calibrated the G_RVS zero-point every 30 hours based on the reference magnitudes of constant
stars from the Hipparcos catalogue, and used them to transform the integrated flux of the cleaned
and calibrated spectra into epoch magnitudes. The G_RVS magnitude of a star published in DR3 is the
median of the epoch magnitudes for that star. We estimated the G_RVS passband by comparing the RVS
spectra of 108 bright stars with their flux-calibrated spectra from external spectrophotometric
libraries. The G_RVS magnitude provides information that is complementary to that obtained from
the G, G_BP, and G_RP magnitudes, which is useful for constraining stellar metallicity and interstellar
extinction. The median precision of G_RVS measurements ranges from about 0.006 mag for the brighter
stars (i.e. with 3.5 < G_RVS < 6.5 mag) to 0.125 mag at the faint end. The derived G_RVS passband shows
that the effective transmittance of the RVS is approximately 1.23 times better than the pre-launch
estimate.

We present a statistical analysis of power distribution of oscillations in a plage region in active
region NOAA AR12651, observed jointly with ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array),
IRIS (Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph), and SDO (Solar Dynamics Observatory). We employ
coordinated ALMA Band-6 (1.25 mm) brightness temperature maps, IRIS Slit-Jaw Images in 2796 {\AA}
passband, and observations in six passbands (1600 {\AA}, 304 {\AA}, 131 {\AA}, 171 {\AA}, 193 {\AA}
and 211 {\AA}) of AIA (Atmospheric Imaging Assembly) onboard SDO. We perform Lomb-Scargle transforms
to study the distribution of oscillation power over the observed region by means of dominant period
maps and power maps. We study spatial association of oscillations through the atmosphere mapped
by the different passbands, with focus on the correlation of power distribution of ALMA oscillations
with others. We do not observe any significant association of ALMA oscillations with IRIS and AIA
oscillations. While the global behavior of ALMA dominant oscillations shows similarity with that
of transition region and coronal passbands of AIA, the ALMA dominant period maps and power maps do
not show any correlation with those from the other passbands. The spatial distribution of dominant
periods and power in different period intervals of ALMA oscillations is uncorrelated with any other
passband. We speculate the non-association of ALMA oscillations with those of IRIS and AIA be due
to significant variations in the height of formation of the millimeter continuum observed by ALMA.
Additionally, the fact that ALMA directly maps the brightness temperature, in contrast to the intensity
observations by IRIS and AIA, can result in the very different intrinsic nature of the ALMA oscillations
compared to the IRIS and AIA oscillations.

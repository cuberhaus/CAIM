After the morphological classification for the 18,190 $^{12}$CO molecular clouds, we further
investigate the properties of their internal molecular gas structures traced by the $^{13}$CO($J=$
1$-$0) line emissions. Using three different methods to extract the $^{13}$CO gas structures within
each $^{12}$CO cloud, we find that $\sim$ 15$\%$ of $^{12}$CO clouds (2,851) have $^{13}$CO gas
structures and these $^{12}$CO clouds contribute about 93$\%$ of the total integrated fluxes of
$^{12}$CO emission. In each of 2,851 $^{12}$CO clouds with $^{13}$CO gas structures, the $^{13}$CO
emission area generally does not exceed 70$\%$ of the $^{12}$CO emission area, and the $^{13}$CO
integrated flux does not exceed 20$\%$ of its $^{12}$CO integrated flux. We reveal the strong correlation
between the velocity-integrated intensities of $^{12}$CO lines and that of $^{13}$CO lines in
both $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO emission regions. This indicates the H$_{2}$ column densities of
molecular clouds are crucial for the $^{13}$CO lines emission. After linking the $^{13}$CO structures
detection rates of the 18,190 $^{12}$CO molecular clouds to their morphologies, i.e. nonfilaments
and filaments, we find that the $^{13}$CO gas structures are primarily detected in the $^{12}$CO
clouds with filamentary morphologies. Moreover, these filaments tend to harbor more than one $^{13}$CO
structure. That demonstrates filaments not only have larger spatial scales, they also have more
molecular gas structures traced by $^{13}$CO lines, i.e. the local gas density enhancements. Our
results favor the turbulent compression scenario for filaments formation, in which dynamical
compression of turbulent flows induces the local density enhancements. The nonfilaments tend
to be in the low-pressure and quiescent turbulent environments of the diffuse ISM.

Some of the radio galaxies show distortion in their jets, forming tailed or winged sources. X-shaped
radio galaxies are a subclass of winged sources formation mechanism of which is still unclear. The
focus of this work is to understand hydro-dynamical back-flows and their role in dynamics and non-thermal
emission signatures (in presence of radiative losses and diffusive shock acceleration) during
the initial phase of these galaxies. We have performed relativistic MHD simulations of an under-dense
jet travelling in a tri-axial ambient using a hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian framework to incorporate
effects of micro-physical processes. We have demonstrated the dominant role played by pressure
gradient in shaping XRGs in thermally dominated cases. We show that the prominence of the formed
structure decreases as the jet deviates from the major axis of the ambient. The wing evolution is
mainly governed by re-energized particles due to shocks that keep the structure active during the
evolution time. The synthetic intensity maps of the radio galaxy show similarities with morphologies
that are typically found in observed XRGs. This includes the cases with wider wings than the active
lobes. The characteristic emission signatures in terms of its synchrotron spectra and implication
of equipartition condition in age estimation are also discussed here. Additionally, we show that
discrepancy of age can be attributed to mixing of different aged particle populations. Further,
the effect of viewing angle on the difference of spectral index of the active lobes and the wings $(\Delta
\alpha)$ shows a large variation and degenerate behaviour. We have demonstrated the role of diffusive
shocks in the obtained variation and have concluded that the spread of $(\Delta \alpha)$ is not a
dependable characteristic in determining the formation model of XRGs.

Numerical simulations of magneto-convection have greatly expanded our understanding of stellar
interiors and stellar magnetism. Recently, fully compressible hydrodynamical simulations of
full-star models have demonstrated the feasibility of studying the excitation and propagation
of pressure and internal gravity waves in stellar interiors, which would allow for a direct comparison
with asteroseismological measurements. However, the impact of magnetic fields on such waves has
not been taken into account yet in three-dimensional simulations. We conduct a proof of concept
for the realization of three-dimensional, fully compressible, magneto-hydrodynamical numerical
simulations of stellar interiors with the RAMSES code. We adapted the RAMSES code to deal with highly
subsonic turbulence, typical of stellar convection, by implementing a well-balanced scheme in
the numerical solver. We then ran and analyzed three-dimensional hydrodynamical and magneto-hydrodynamical
simulations with different resolutions of a plane-parallel convective envelope on a Cartesian
grid. Both hydrodynamical and magneto-hydrodynamical simulations develop a quasi-steady, turbulent
convection layer from random density perturbations introduced over the initial profiles. The
convective flows are characterized by small-amplitude fluctuations around the hydrodynamical
equilibrium of the stellar interior, which is preserved over the whole simulation time. Using our
compressible well-balanced scheme, we were able to model flows with Mach numbers as low as $\mathcal{M}
\sim 10^{-3}$, but even lower Mach number flows are possible in principle. In the magneto-hydrodynamical
runs, we observe an exponential growth of magnetic energy consistent with the action of a small-scale
dynamo. (Abridged)

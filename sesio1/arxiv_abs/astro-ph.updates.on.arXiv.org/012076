Asteroseismology has proven to be a powerful method for probing stellar interiors. Analytical
descriptions of the global oscillation modes, in combination with pulsation codes, have provided
valuable help in processing and interpreting the large amount of seismic data collected by the CoRoT,
$Kepler$, and TESS missions. These prior results have paved the way to more in-depth analyses of
the oscillation spectra of stars, which requires innovative theoretical descriptions of stellar
oscillations. In this paper, we aim to analytically express the resonance condition of the spheroidal
adiabatic oscillation modes in a very general way, applicable at different evolutionary stages.
In the present formulation, a star is represented as an acoustic interferometer composed of a multitude
of resonant cavities where waves can propagate and the short-wavelength JWKB approximation is
met. Each cavity is separated from the adjacent ones by barriers, which corresponds to regions either
where waves are evanescent or where the JWKB approximation fails. The stationary modes are computed
using two different physical representations: 1) the infinite-time reflections picture 2) the
linear boundary value problem picture. Both provide the same resonance condition, which ultimately
turns out to depend on a number of parameters: the reflection and transmission phase lags introduced
by each barrier, the coupling factor associated with each barrier, and the wave number integral
over each resonant cavity. Using such a formulation, we can retrieve the usual forms derived in previous
works (e.g., mixed modes with two or three cavities, low- and large-amplitude glitches). This resonance
condition provides a new tool that is useful in predicting the stellar oscillation spectra and interpret
seismic observations at different evolutionary stages. Practical applications are left to future
work.

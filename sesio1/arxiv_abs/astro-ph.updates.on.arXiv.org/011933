We analyse FIR dust continuum measurements for 14 galaxies ($z\approx 7$) in the ALMA REBELS LP to
derive their physical properties. Our model uses three input data: (a) the UV spectral slope, $\beta$,
(b) the observed UV continuum flux at $1500$A, $F_{\rm UV}$, (c) the observed continuum flux at $\approx
158\mu$m, $F_{158}$, and considers Milky Way (MW) and SMC extinction curves, along with different
dust geometries. We find that REBELS galaxies have (28-90.5)% of their star formation obscured;
the total (UV+IR) star formation rates are in the range $31.5 < {\rm SFR}/ (M_\odot {\rm yr}^{-1})
< 129.5$. The sample-averaged dust mass and temperature are $(1.3\pm 1.1)\times 10^7 M_\odot$
and $52 \pm 11$ K, respectively. In some galaxies dust is abundant (REBELS-14, $M'_d \approx 3.4
\times 10^7 M_\odot$), or hot (REBELS-18, $T'_d \approx 67$ K). The dust distribution is compact
($<0.3$ kpc for 70% of the galaxies). The dust yield per supernova is $0.1 \le y_d/M_\odot \le 3.3$,
with 70% of the galaxies requiring $y_d < 0.25 M_\odot$. Three galaxies (REBELS-12, 14, 39) require
$y_d > 1 M_\odot$. With the SFR predicted by the model and a MW extinction curve, REBELS galaxies detected
in [CII] nicely follow the local $L_{\rm CII}-$SFR relation, and are approximately located on the
Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. The sample-averaged gas depletion time is of $0.11\, y_P^{-2}$ Gyr,
where $y_P$ is the ratio of the gas-to-stellar distribution radius. For some systems a solution
simultaneously matching the observed ($\beta, F_{\rm UV}, F_{158}$) values cannot be found. This
occurs when the index $I_m = (F_{158}/F_{\rm UV})/(\beta-\beta_{\rm int})$, where $\beta_{\rm
int}$ is the intrinsic UV slope, exceeds $I_m^*\approx 1120$ for a MW curve. For these objects we
argue that the FIR and UV emitting regions are not co-spatial, questioning the use of the IRX-$\beta$
relation.

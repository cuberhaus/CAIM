Non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic effects that rule the coupling of the magnetic field to the circumstellar
gas during the low-mass star formation process depend heavily on the local physical conditions,
such as the ionization fraction of the gas. The purpose of this work is to observationally characterize
the level of ionization of the circumstellar gas at small envelope radii and investigate its relation
to the efficiency of the coupling between the star-forming gas and the magnetic field in the Class
0 protostar B335. We have obtained molecular line emission maps of B335 with ALMA, which we use to
measure the deuteration fraction of the gas, its ionization fraction, and the cosmic-ray ionization
rate, at envelope radii $\lesssim$1000 au. We find large fractions of ionized gas, $\chi_{e} \simeq
1-8 \times 10^{-6}$. Our observations also reveal an enhanced ionization that increases at small
envelope radii, reaching values up to $\zeta_{CR} \simeq 10^{-14}$~s$^{-1}$ at a few hundred au
from the central protostellar object. We show that this extreme ionization rate can be attributed
to the presence of cosmic rays accelerated close to the protostar. We report the first resolved map
of the cosmic-ray ionization rate at scales $\lesssim 1000$~au in a solar-type Class 0 protostar,
finding remarkably high values. Our observations suggest that local acceleration of cosmic rays,
and not the penetration of interstellar Galactic cosmic rays, may be responsible for the gas ionization
in the inner envelope, potentially down to disk forming scales. If confirmed, our findings imply
that protostellar disk properties may also be determined by local processes setting the coupling
between the gas and the magnetic field, and not only by the amount of angular momentum available at
large envelope scales and the magnetic field strength in protostellar cores.

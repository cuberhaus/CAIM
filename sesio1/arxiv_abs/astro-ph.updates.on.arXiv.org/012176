We consider invisible neutrino decay $\nu_H \to \nu_l + \phi$ in the ultra-relativistic limit and
compute the neutrino anisotropy loss rate relevant for the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies.
Improving on our previous work which assumed massless $\nu_l$ and $\phi$, we reinstate in this work
the daughter neutrino mass $m_{\nu l}$ in a manner consistent with the experimentally determined
neutrino mass splittings. We find that a nonzero $m_{\nu l}$ introduces a new phase space factor
in the loss rate $\Gamma_{\rm T}$ proportional to $(\Delta m_\nu^2/m_{\nu_H}^2)^2$ in the limit
of a small squared mass gap between the parent and daughter neutrinos, i.e., $\Gamma_{\rm T} \sim
(\Delta m_\nu^2/m_{\nu H}^2)^2 (m_{\nu H}/E_\nu )^5 (1/\tau_0)$, where $\tau_0$ is the $\nu_H$
rest-frame lifetime. Using a general form of this result, we update the limit on $\tau_0$ using the
Planck 2018 CMB data. We find that for a parent neutrino of mass $m_{\nu H} \lesssim 0.1 {\rm eV}$,
the new phase space factor weakens the constraint on its lifetime by up to a factor of 50 if $\Delta
m_\nu^2$ corresponds to the atmospheric mass gap and up to $10^{5}$ if the solar mass gap, in comparison
with naive estimates that assume $m_{\nu l}=0$. The revised constraints are (i) $\tau^0 \gtrsim
(6 \to 10) \times 10^5~{\rm s}$ and $\tau^0 \gtrsim (400 \to 500)~{\rm s}$ if only one neutrino decays
to a daughter neutrino separated by, respectively, the atmospheric and the solar mass gap, and (ii)
$\tau^0 \gtrsim (2 \to 3) \times 10^7~{\rm s}$ in the case of two decay channels with one near-common
atmospheric mass gap. In contrast to previous, naive limits which scale as $m_{\nu H}^5$, these
mass spectrum-consistent $\tau_0$ constraints are remarkably independent of the parent mass
and open up a swath of parameter space within the projected reach of IceCube and other neutrino telescopes
in the next two decades.

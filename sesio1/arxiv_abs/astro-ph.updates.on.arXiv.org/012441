Most massive stars reside in multiple systems that will interact over the course of their lifetime.
Classical Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars represent the final end stages of stellar evolution at the upper-mass
end. As part of a homogeneous, magnitude-limited ($V\leq12$) spectroscopic survey of northern
Galactic WR stars, this paper aims to establish the observed and intrinsic multiplicity properties
of the early-type nitrogen-rich WR population (WNE). We obtained high-resolution spectroscopic
time series of the complete magnitude-limited sample of 16 WNE stars observable with the 1.2 m Mercator
telescope at La Palma, typically providing a time base of about two to eight years. We measured relative
radial velocities (RVs) using cross-correlation and used RV variations to flag binary candidates.
Adopting a peak-to-peak RV variability threshold of 50 km/s as a criterion found an observed multiplicity
fraction of 0.44$\pm$0.12. Using an updated Monte Carlo method with a Bayesian framework, we calculated
the three-dimensional likelihood for the intrinsic binary fraction, the maximum period, and the
power-law index for the period distribution for the WNE population. We also re-derived multiplicity
parameters for the Galactic WC population. We found an intrinsic multiplicity fraction of $0.56\substack{+0.20
\\ -0.15}$ for the parent WNE population. For the Galactic WC population, we re-derive an intrinsic
multiplicity fraction of $0.96\substack{+0.04 \\ -0.22}$. The derived multiplicity parameters
for the WNE population are quite similar to those derived for main-sequence O binaries but differ
from those of the WC population. The significant shift in the WC period distribution towards longer
periods is too large to be explained via expansion of the orbit due to stellar winds, and we discuss
possible implications of our results.

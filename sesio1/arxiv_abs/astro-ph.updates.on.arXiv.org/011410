Numerous complex organic molecules have been detected in the universe among which amides are considered
as models for species containing the peptide linkage. Acrylamide bears in its backbone not only
the peptide bond, but also the vinyl functional group which is a common motif in many interstellar
compounds. This makes acrylamide an interesting target for a search in space. In addition, a tentative
detection of the related molecule propionamide has been recently claimed toward Sgr B2(N). We report
accurate laboratory measurements and analyses of thousands rotational transitions for the syn
and skew forms of acrylamide between 75 and 480 GHz. Tunneling through a low energy barrier between
two symmetrically equivalent configurations has been revealed for the higher-energy skew species.
We searched for emission of acrylamide in the imaging spectral line survey ReMoCA performed with
ALMA toward Sgr B2(N). We also searched for propionamide in the same source. Neither acrylamide
nor propionamide were detected toward the two main hot molecular cores of Sgr B2(N). We did not detect
propionamide either toward a position located to the east of the main hot core, thereby not confirming
the recent claim of its interstellar detection toward this position. We find that acrylamide and
propionamide are at least 26 and 14 times, respectively, less abundant than acetamide toward the
main hot core Sgr B2(N1S), and at least 6 and 3 times, respectively, less abundant than acetamide
toward the secondary hot core Sgr B2(N2). A comparison with results of astrochemical kinetics model
for related species suggests that acrylamide may be a few hundred times less abundant than acetamide,
corresponding to a value at least an order of magnitude lower than the observational upper limits.
Propionamide may be as little as only a factor of two less abundant than the upper limit derived toward
Sgr B2(N1S).

We present a novel application of the extended Fast Action Minimization method (eFAM) aimed at assessing
the role of the environment in shaping galaxy evolution. We validate our approach by testing eFAM
predictions against the Magneticum hydrodynamical simulation. We consider the z~0 snapshot of
the simulation as our observed catalogue and use the reconstructed trajectories of galaxies to
model the evolution of cosmic structures. At the statistical level, the fraction of volume (VFF)
occupied by voids, sheets, filaments, and clusters in the reconstructed catalogues agrees within
$1\sigma$ with the VFF estimated from the high-redshift snapshots of the simulation. The local
accuracy of eFAM structures is evaluated by computing their purity with respect to the simulated
catalogues, P, at the cells of a regular grid. Up to z=1.2, clusters have 0.58<P<0.93, filaments
vary in 0.90<P<0.99, sheets show 0.78<P<0.92, and voids are best identified with 0.90<P<0.92.
As redshift increases, comparing reconstructed tracers and simulated galaxies becomes more difficult
due to their different biases and number densities and the purity decreases to P~0.6. We retrieve
the environmental history of individual galaxies by tracing their trajectories through the cosmic
web and relate their observed gas fraction, $f_\mathrm{gas}$, with the time spent within different
structures. For galaxies in clusters and filaments, eFAM reproduces the variation of $f_\mathrm{gas}$
as a function of the redshift of accretion/infall as traced by the simulations with a 1.5 $\sigma$
statistical agreement (which decreases to 2.5 $\sigma$ statistical agreement for low-mass galaxies
in filaments). These results support the application of eFAM to observational data to study the
environmental dependence of observed galaxy properties, offering a complementary approach to
that based on light-cone observations.

We discuss several low-energy backgrounds to sub-GeV dark matter searches, which arise from high-energy
particles of cosmic or radioactive origin that interact with detector materials. We focus in particular
on Cherenkov radiation, transition radiation, and luminescence or phonons from electron-hole
pair recombination, and show that these processes are an important source of backgrounds at both
current and planned detectors. We perform detailed analyses of these backgrounds at several existing
and proposed experiments based on a wide variety of detection strategies and levels of shielding.
We find that a large fraction of the observed single-electron events in the SENSEI 2020 run originate
from Cherenkov photons generated by high-energy events in the Skipper Charge Coupled Device, and
from recombination photons generated in a phosphorus-doped layer of the same instrument.In a SuperCDMS
HVeV 2020 run, Cherenkov photons produced in printed-circuit-boards located near the sensor likely
explain the origin of most of the events containing 2 to 6 electrons. At SuperCDMS SNOLAB, radioactive
contaminants inside the Cirlex located inside or on the copper side walls of their detectors will
produce many Cherenkov photons, which could dominate the low-energy backgrounds. For the EDELWEISS
experiment, Cherenkov or luminescence backgrounds are subdominant to their observed event rate,
but could still limit the sensitivity of their future searches. We also point out that Cherenkov
radiation, transition radiation, and recombination could be a significant source of backgrounds
at future experiments aiming to detect dark-matter via scintillation or phonon signals. We also
discuss the implications of our results for the development of superconducting qubits and low-threshold
searches for coherent neutrino scattering, and comment on design strategies that can be implemented
to mitigate these backgrounds.

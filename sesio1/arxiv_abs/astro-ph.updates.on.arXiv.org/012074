The ALMA-IMF Large Program observed the W43-MM2-MM3 ridge, whose 1.3mm and 3mm ALMA 12m array continuum
images reach a 2500au spatial resolution. We used both the best-sensitivity and the line-free ALMA-IMF
images, reduced the noise with the multi-resolution segmentation technique MnGSeg, and derived
the most complete and most robust core catalog possible. Using two different extraction software
packages, getsf and GExt2D, we identified 200 compact sources, whose 100 common sources have on
average fluxes consistent to within 30%. We filtered sources with non-negligible free-free contamination
and corrected fluxes from line contamination, resulting in a W43-MM2-MM3 catalog of 205 getsf cores.
With a median deconvolved FWHM size of 3400au, core masses range from 0.1Msun to 70Msun and the getsf
catalog is 90% complete down to 0.8Msun. The high-mass end of the core mass function (CMF) of W43-MM2-MM3
is top-heavy compared to the canonical IMF. Fitting the cumulative CMF with a single power law of
the form N(>logM)\propto M^a, we measured a=-0.95\pm0.04, compared to the canonical a=-1.35 Salpeter
IMF slope. The slope of the CMF is robust with respect to map processing, extraction software package,
and reasonable variations in the assumptions taken to estimate core masses. We explore several
assumptions on how cores transfer their mass to stars and sub-fragment to predict the IMF resulting
from the W43-MM2-MM3 CMF. In stark contrast to the commonly accepted paradigm, our result argues
against the universality of the CMF shape. More robust functions of the star-formation efficiency
and core sub-fragmentation are required to better predict the resulting IMF, here suggested to
remain top-heavy at the end of the star-formation phase. If confirmed, the IMFs emerging from starburst
events could inherit their top-heavy shape from their parental CMFs, challenging the IMF universality.

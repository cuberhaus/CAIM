We present cosmological constraints from the analysis of angular power spectra of cosmic shear
maps based on data from the first three years of observations by the Dark Energy Survey (DES Y3). Our
measurements are based on the pseudo-$C_\ell$ method and offer a view complementary to that of the
two-point correlation functions in real space, as the two estimators are known to compress and select
Gaussian information in different ways, due to scale cuts. They may also be differently affected
by systematic effects and theoretical uncertainties, such as baryons and intrinsic alignments
(IA), making this analysis an important cross-check. In the context of $\Lambda$CDM, and using
the same fiducial model as in the DES Y3 real space analysis, we find ${S_8 \equiv \sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_{\rm
m}/0.3} = 0.793^{+0.038}_{-0.025}}$, which further improves to ${S_8 = 0.784\pm 0.026 }$ when
including shear ratios. This constraint is within expected statistical fluctuations from the
real space analysis, and in agreement with DES~Y3 analyses of non-Gaussian statistics, but favors
a slightly higher value of $S_8$, which reduces the tension with the Planck cosmic microwave background
2018 results from $2.3\sigma$ in the real space analysis to $1.5\sigma$ in this work. We explore
less conservative IA models than the one adopted in our fiducial analysis, finding no clear preference
for a more complex model. We also include small scales, using an increased Fourier mode cut-off up
to $k_{\rm max}={5}{h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}}$, which allows to constrain baryonic feedback while leaving
cosmological constraints essentially unchanged. Finally, we present an approximate reconstruction
of the linear matter power spectrum at present time, which is found to be about 20\% lower than predicted
by Planck 2018, as reflected by the $1.5\sigma$ lower $S_8$ value.

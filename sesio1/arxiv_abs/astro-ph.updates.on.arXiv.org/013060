We report the results from new observations from a long-term radial velocity monitoring campaign
complemented with high resolution spectroscopy, as well as new astrometry and seismology of a sample
of 41 red giants from the third version of APOKASC, which includes young alpha rich (YAR) stars. The
aim is to better characterize the YAR stars in terms of binarity fraction, mass, abundance trends
and kinematic properties. The radial velocities of HERMES, APOGEE and Gaia were combined to determine
the binary fraction among YAR stars. In combination with their mass estimate, their evolutionary
status, chemical composition and kinematic properties, it allows to better constrain the nature
of these objects. We find that the frequency of binaries among over-massive stars is not significantly
different than that of the other stars in our sample, but that the most massive YAR stars are indeed
single, which has been predicted by population synthesis models. Studying their [C/N], [C/Fe]
and [N/Fe] trends with mass, many over-massive stars do not follow the APOKASC stars, favouring
the scenario that most of them are product of mass transfer. Our sample further includes two under-massive
stars, with sufficiently low masses so that these stars could not have reached the red giant phase
without significant mass loss. Both over-massive and under-massive stars might show some anomalous
APOGEE abundances such as N, Na, P, K and Cr, although higher resolution optical spectroscopy might
be needed to confirm these findings. Considering the significant fraction of stars that are formed
in pairs and the variety of ways that make mass transfer possible, the diversity in properties in
terms of binarity and chemistry of the over-massive and under-massive stars studied here implies
that it is not safe to directly relate the mass of the YAR stars with age and that most of these objects
are likely not young.

(abridged) Magnetic fields are fundamental to the accretion dynamics of protoplanetary disks
and they likely affect planet formation. Typical methods to study the magnetic field morphology
observe the polarization of dust or spectral lines. However, it has recently become clear that dust-polarization
in ALMA's spectral regime does not always faithfully trace the magnetic field structure of protoplanetary
disks, which leaves spectral line polarization as a promising method for mapping the magnetic field
morphologies of such sources. We aim to model the emergent polarization of different molecular
lines in the ALMA wavelength regime that are excited in protoplanetary disks. We explore a variety
of disk models and molecules to identify those properties that are conducive to the emergence of
polarization in spectral lines and may therefore be viably used for magnetic field measurements
in protoplanetary disks. We used PORTAL in conjunction with LIME. Together, they allowed us to treat
the polarized line radiative transfer of complex three-dimensional physical and magnetic field
structures. We present simulations of the emergence of spectral line polarization of different
molecules and molecular transitions in the ALMA wavelength regime. We find that molecules that
thermalize at high densities, such as HCN, are also the most susceptible to polarization. We find
that such molecules are expected to be significantly polarized in protoplanetary disks, while
molecules that thermalize at low densities, such as CO, are only significantly polarized in the
outer disk regions. We present the simulated polarization maps at a range of inclinations and magnetic
field morphologies, and we comment on the observational feasibility of ALMA linear polarization
observations of protoplanetary disks.

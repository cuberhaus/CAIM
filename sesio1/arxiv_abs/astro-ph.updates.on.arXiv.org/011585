Using 2D particle-in-cell (PIC) plasma simulations we study electron acceleration by temperature
anisotropy instabilities, assuming conditions typical of above-the-loop-top (ALT) sources
in solar flares. We focus on the long-term effect of $T_{e,\perp} > T_{e,\parallel}$ instabilities
by driving the anisotropy growth during the entire simulation time, through imposing a shearing
or a compressing plasma velocity ($T_{e,\perp}$ and $T_{e,\parallel}$ are the temperatures perpendicular
and parallel to the magnetic field). This magnetic growth makes $T_{e,\perp}/T_{e,\parallel}$
grow due to electron magnetic moment conservation, and amplifies the ratio $\omega_{ce}/\omega_{pe}$
from $\sim 0.53$ to $\sim 2$ ($\omega_{ce}$ and $\omega_{pe}$ are the electron cyclotron and plasma
frequencies, respectively). In the regime $\omega_{ce}/\omega_{pe}\lesssim 1.2-1.7$ the instability
is dominated by oblique, quasi-electrostatic (OQES) modes, and the acceleration is inefficient.
When $\omega_{ce}/\omega_{pe}$ has grown to $\omega_{ce}/\omega_{pe}\gtrsim 1.2-1.7$, electrons
are efficiently accelerated by the inelastic scattering provided by unstable parallel, electromagnetic
z (PEMZ) modes. After $\omega_{ce}/\omega_{pe}$ reaches $\sim 2$, the electron energy spectra
show nonthermal tails that differ between the shearing and compressing cases. In the shearing case,
the tail resembles a power-law of index $\alpha_s \sim$ 2.9 plus a high-energy bump reaching $\sim
300$ keV. In the compressing runs, $\alpha_s \sim$ 3.7 with a spectral break above $\sim 500$ keV.
This difference can be explained by the different temperature evolutions in these two types of simulations,
suggesting a critical role played by the type of anisotropy driving, $\omega_{ce}/\omega_{pe}$
and the electron temperature in the efficiency of the acceleration.

The hosts of long duration gamma-ray bursts are predominantly starburst galaxies at subsolar metallicity.
At redshifts z<1, this implies that most of them are low-mass galaxies similar to the populations
of blue compact dwarfs and dwarf irregulars. What triggers the massive star-formation (SF) needed
for producing a GRB progenitor is still largely unknown, as are the resolved gas properties and kinematics
of these galaxies and their formation history. Here we present a sample of six spatially resolved
GRB hosts at z<0.3 observed with 3D spectroscopy at high spectral resolution (R=8,000-13,000)
using FLAMES/VLT. We analyzed the resolved gas kinematics of the full sample and the abundances
in a subsample. Only two galaxies show a regular disk-like rotation field, another two are dispersion-dominated,
the remaining two have a double emission component associated with different parts of the galaxy,
which might indicate a recent merger. All galaxies show evidence for broad components underlying
the main emission peak (sigma = 50-110 km/s). This broad component is more metal-rich than the narrow
components, it is blueshifted in most cases, and it follows a different velocity structure. We find
a weak correlation between the SF rate and the width of the broad component, its flux compared to the
narrow component, and the maximum outflow velocity of the gas, but we do not find any correlation
with the SF density, metallicity or stellar mass. We associate this broad component with a metal-rich
outflow from star-forming regions. The GRB is not located in the brightest region of the host, but
is always associated with some star-forming region showing a clear wind component. Our study shows
the potential of 3D spectroscopy to study the SF processes in galaxies hosting extreme transients,
the need for high S/N, and the perils using unresolved or only partially resolved data for these kinds
of studies.

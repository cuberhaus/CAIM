The $H_0$ tension between low- and high- redshift measurements is definitely a serious issue faced
by current cosmologists since it ranges from 4$\sigma$ to 6$\sigma$. To relieve this tension, in
this paper we propose a new interacting dark energy model with time varying coupling parameter by
parameterizing the densities of dark matter and dark energy, this parametric approach for interacting
dark sectors are inspired by our previous work concerning the coupled generalized three-form dark
energy model in which dark matter and dark energy behave like two uncoupled dark sectors with effective
equation of state when the three-form $|\kappa X|\gg1$, for this reason, we reconstruct coupled
generalized three-form dark energy from such parametric model under the condition $|\kappa X_0|\gg1$.
In the end, we place constraints on the parametric model with the coupled generalized three-form
dark energy model proposed in our previous work in light of the Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background
(CMB) distance priors, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) data from the BOSS Data Release (DR)
12, Pantheon compilation of Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) data and the latest local determinations
of the Hubble constant from Riess et al., i.e. the so called R20. The fitting results show that, comparing
to R20, the parametric model relieves the Hubble tension to 0.05$\sigma$ with $\chi_{\rm min}^2=6.70$
and the coupled generalized three-form dark energy model relieves the Hubble tension to 0.70$\sigma$
with $\chi_{\rm min}^2=9.02$. However, it is worth noting that the tiny Hubble tension between
R20 and the parametric model is mostly due to the fact that the introduction of the parameter $k$ greatly
increase the uncertainty of the Hubble constant obtained without using a $H_0$ prior.

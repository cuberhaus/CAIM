The ESPRESSO spectrograph is a new powerful tool to detect and characterize extrasolar planets.
Its design allows unprecedented radial velocity precision (down to a few tens of cm/s) and long-term
thermo-mechanical stability. We present the first standalone detection of an extrasolar planet
by blind radial velocity search using ESPRESSO and aim at showing the power of the instrument in characterizing
planetary signals at different periodicities in long time spans. We use 41 ESPRESSO measurements
of HD\,22496 within a time span of 895 days with a median photon noise of 18 cm/s. A radial velocity
analysis is performed to test the presence of planets in the system and to account for the stellar
activity of this K5-K7 main sequence star. For benchmarking and comparison, we attempt the detection
with 43 archive HARPS measurements and compare the results yielded by the two datasets. We also use
four TESS sectors to search for transits. We find radial velocity variations compatible with a close-in
planet with an orbital period of $P=5.09071\pm0.00026$ days when simultaneously accounting for
the effects of stellar activity at longer time scales ($P_{\rm rot}=34.99^{+0.58}_{-0.53}$ days).
We characterize the physical and orbital properties of the planet and find a minimum mass of $5.57^{+0.73}_{-0.68}$
$\mathrm{M}_{\oplus}$, right in the dichotomic regime between rocky and gaseous planets. Although
not transiting according to TESS data, if aligned with the stellar spin axis, the absolute mass of
the planet must be below 16 $\mathrm{M}_{\oplus}$. We find no significant evidence for additional
signals with semi-amplitudes above 56 cm/s at 95% confidence. With a modest set of radial velocity
measurements, ESPRESSO is capable of detecting and characterizing low-mass planets and constrain
the presence of planets in the habitable zone of K-dwarfs down to the rocky-mass regime.

Many population studies have been performed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array (ALMA) to understand the bulk properties of protoplanetary disks around young stars. The
studied populations mostly consisted of G, K & M stars, with relatively few more massive Herbig stars.
With GAIA updated distances, now is a good time to use ALMA archival data for a Herbig disk population
study and take an important step forward in our understanding of planet formation. This work determines
the masses and sizes of all Herbig dust disks observed with ALMA to date out to 450 pc. These masses
and sizes are put into context of the Lupus and Upper Sco T Tauri disk populations. ALMA Band 6 and Band
7 archival data of 36 Herbig stars are used, making this work 64% complete excluding Orion. Using
stellar parameters and distances the dust masses and sizes of the disks are determined and survival
analysis is used to make cumulative distributions of the dust masses and radii. Herbig disks have
a higher dust mass than the T Tauri disk populations of Lupus and Upper Sco by factors of $\sim3$ and
$\sim7$ respectively. In addition, Herbig disks are often larger than the typical T Tauri disk.
Although the masses and sizes of Herbig disks extend over a similar range as those of T Tauri disks,
the distributions of masses and sizes of Herbig disks are significantly skewed toward higher values.
Lastly, group I disks are more massive than group II disks. Based on these findings we speculate that
these differences between Herbig and T Tauri disks find their origin in an initial disk mass that
scales with the stellar mass, and that subsequent disk evolution enlarges the observable differences,
especially if (sub)mm continuum optical depth plays a role. Moreover, the larger disk masses and
sizes of Herbig stars could be linked to the increasing prevalence of giant planets with host star
mass.

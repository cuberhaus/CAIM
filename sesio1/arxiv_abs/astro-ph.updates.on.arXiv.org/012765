Context. Gaia has been in operations since 2014. The third Gaia data release expands from the early
data release (EDR3) in 2020 by providing 34 months of multi-epoch observations that allowed us to
probe, characterise and classify systematically celestial variable phenomena. Aims. We present
a summary of the variability processing and analysis of the photometric and spectroscopic time
series of 1.8 billion sources done for Gaia DR3. Methods. We used statistical and Machine Learning
methods to characterise and classify the variable sources. Training sets were built from a global
revision of major published variable star catalogues. For a subset of classes, specific detailed
studies were conducted to confirm their class membership and to derive parameters that are adapted
to the peculiarity of the considered class. Results. In total, 10.5 million objects are identified
as variable in Gaia DR3 and have associated time series in G, GBP, and GRP and, in some cases, radial
velocity time series. The DR3 variable sources subdivide into 9.5 million variable stars and 1 million
Active Galactic Nuclei/Quasars. In addition, supervised classification identified 2.5 million
galaxies thanks to spurious variability induced by the extent of these objects. The variability
analysis output in the DR3 archive amounts to 17 tables containing a total of 365 parameters. We publish
35 types and sub-types of variable objects. For 11 variable types, additional specific object parameters
are published. An overview of the estimated completeness and contamination of most variability
classes is provided. Conclusions. Thanks to Gaia we present the largest whole-sky variability
analysis based on coherent photometric, astrometric, and spectroscopic data. Later Gaia data
releases will more than double the span of time series and the number of observations, thus allowing
for an even richer catalogue in the future.

Following the detection of CO and HCN in Pluto's atmosphere, we report on new ALMA observations of
Pluto with two main goals: (i) obtaining spatially-resolved measurements (~0.06'' on the ~0.15''
disk subtended by Pluto and its atmosphere) of CO(3-2) and HCN(4-3) (ii) targetting new chemical
compounds, primarily hydrogen isocyanide (HNC). The CO line shows an absorption core at beam positions
within Pluto's disk, a direct signature of Pluto's cold mesosphere. Analysis provides tentative
evidence for a non-uniform temperature field in the lower atmosphere (near 30 km), with summer pole
latitudes being 7$\pm$3.5 K warmer than low latitudes. This unexpected result may point to shorter
radiative timescales in the atmosphere than previously thought. The HCN emission is considerably
more extended than CO, peaking at radial distances beyond Pluto limb, and providing a new method
to determine Pluto's HCN vertical profile in 2017. The mean (column-averaged) location of HCN is
at 690+/-75 km altitude, with an upper atmosphere (> 800 km) mixing ratio of ~ 1.8 x 10$^{-4}$. Little
or no HCN (<5 x 10$^{-9}$ at 65 km) is present in the lower atmosphere, implying undersaturation of
HCN there. The HCN emission appears enhanced above the low-latitude limb, but interpretation,
in terms of an enhanced HCN abundance or a warmer upper atmosphere there, is uncertain. The first
detection of HNC is reported, with a (7.0$\pm$2.1) x 10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$ column density, referred
to Pluto surface, and a HNC / HCN ratio of 0.095+/-0.026, very similar to their values in Titan's atmosphere.
We also obtain upper limits on CH3CN (< 2.6 x 10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$) and CH$_3$CCH (< 8.5 x 10$^{14}$
cm$^{-2}$); the latter value is inconsistent with the reported detection of CH$_3$CCH from New
Horizons. These upper limits also point to incomplete resublimation of ice-coated aerosols in
the lower atmosphere.

Decades after their discovery, only four hydrogen-deficient carbon (HdC) stars were known to have
no circumstellar dust shell. This is in complete contrast to the $\sim$130 known Galactic HdC stars
that are notorious for being heavy dust producers, i.e. the R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars. Together
they form a rare class of supergiant stars that are thought to originate from the merger of CO/He white
dwarf binary systems, otherwise known as the double-degenerate scenario. We searched for new dustless
HdC (dLHdC) stars. We used primarily the 2MASS and GAIA eDR3 catalogues to select candidates that
were followed-up spectroscopically. We discovered 27 new dLHdC stars, one new RCB star and two new
EHe stars. Surprisingly, 20 of the new dLHdC stars share a characteristic of the known dLHdC star
HD 148839, having lower atmospheric hydrogen deficiencies. The uncovered population of dLHdC
stars exhibit a Bulge-like distribution, like the RCB stars, but show multiple differences from
those that indicate they are a different population of HdC stars following its own evolutionary
sequence with a fainter luminosity and also a narrow range of effective temperature. We found indication
of a current low dust production activity for four of the new dLHdC stars which could be typical RCB
stars passing through a transition time. We have evidence for the first time of a large range of absolute
magnitudes in the overall population of HdC stars, spanning over 3 mag. In the favoured formation
framework, this is explained by a large range in the initial total WD binary mass which leads to a series
of evolutionary sequences with distinct maximum brightness and initial temperature. The cold
Galactic RCB stars are also noticeably fainter than the Magellanic ones, possibly due to a difference
in metallicity resulting in different WD mass ratio. In our Galaxy, there could be as many dLHdC stars
as RCB stars.

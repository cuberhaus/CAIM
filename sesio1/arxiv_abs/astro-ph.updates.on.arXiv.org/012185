The field of planet formation is in an exciting era, where recent observations of disks around low-
to intermediate-mass stars made with state of the art interferometers and high-contrast optical
and IR facilities have revealed a diversity of substructures, some possibly planet-related. It
is therefore important to understand the physical and chemical nature of the protoplanetary building
blocks, as well as their spatial distribution, to better understand planet formation. Since PPVI,
the field has seen tremendous improvements in observational capabilities, enabling both surveys
of large samples of disks and high resolution imaging studies of a few bright disks. Improvements
in data quality and sample size have, however, opened up many fundamental questions about properties
such as the mass budget of disks, its spatial distribution, and its radial extent. Moreover, the
vertical structure of disks has been studied in greater detail with spatially resolved observations,
providing new insights on vertical layering and temperature stratification, yet also bringing
rise to questions about other properties, such as material transport and viscosity. Each one of
these properties - disk mass, surface density distribution, outer radius, vertical extent, temperature
structure, and transport - is of fundamental interest as they collectively set the stage for disk
evolution and corresponding planet formation theories. In this chapter, we will review our understanding
of the fundamental properties of disks including the relevant observational techniques to probe
their nature, modelling methods, and the respective caveats. Finally, we discuss the implications
for theories of disk evolution and planet formation underlining what new questions have since arisen
as our observational facilities have improved.

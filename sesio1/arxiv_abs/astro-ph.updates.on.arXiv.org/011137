Kination denotes an era in the cosmological history corresponding to an equation of state $\omega=+1$
such that the total energy density of the universe redshifts as the sixth inverse power of the scale
factor. This arises if the universe is dominated by the kinetic energy of a scalar field. It has often
been motivated in the literature as an era following inflation, taking place before the radiation
era. In this paper, we review instead the possibility that kination is disconnected from primordial
inflation and occurs much later, inside the Standard Model radiation era. We study the implications
on all main sources of primordial gravitational waves. We show how this leads to very distinctive
peaked spectra in the stochastic background of long-lasting cosmological sources of gravitational
waves, namely the irreducible gravitational waves from inflation, and gravitational waves from
cosmic strings, both local and global, with promising observational prospects. We present model-independent
signatures and detectability predictions at LIGO, LISA, ET, CE, BBO, as a function of the energy
scale and duration of the kination era. We then argue that such intermediate kination era is in fact
symptomatic in a large class of axion models. We analyse in details the scalar field dynamics, the
working conditions and constraints in the underlying models. We present the gravitational-wave
predictions as a function of particle physics parameters. We derive the general relation between
the gravitational-wave signal and the axion dark matter abundance as well as the baryon asymmetry.
We investigate the predictions for the special case of the QCD axion. The key message is that gravitational-waves
of primordial origin represent an alternative experimental probe of axion models.

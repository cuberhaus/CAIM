The generalized hybrid metric-Palatini gravity is a theory of gravitation that has an action composed
of a Lagrangian $f(R,\cal R)$, where $f$ is a function of the metric Ricci scalar $R$ and a new Ricci
scalar $\cal R$ formed from a Palatini connection, plus a matter Lagrangian. This theory can be rewritten
by trading the new geometric degrees of freedom of $f(R,\cal R)$ into two scalar fields, $\varphi$
and $\psi$, yielding an equivalent scalar-tensor theory. Given a spacetime theory, the next step
is to find solutions. To construct solutions it is often necessary to know the junction conditions
between two regions at a separation hypersurface $\Sigma$, with each region being an independent
solution. The junction conditions for the generalized hybrid metric-Palatini gravity are found
here, in the geometric and in the scalar-tensor representations, and in addition, for each representation,
the junction conditions for a matching with a thin-shell and for a smooth matching at $\Sigma$ are
worked out. These junction conditions are applied to three configurations, a star, a quasistar
with a black hole, and a wormhole. The star has a Minkowski interior, a thin shell at the interface
with all the energy conditions being satisfied, and a Schwarzschild exterior with mass $M$, and
for this theory the matching can only be performed at the shell radius given by $r_\Sigma=\frac{9M}4$,
the Buchdahl radius in general relativity. The quasistar with a black hole has an interior Schwarzschild
black hole surrounded by a thick shell that matches smoothly to a mass $M$ Schwarzschild exterior
at the light ring, and with the energy conditions being satisfied everywhere. The wormhole has an
interior that contains the throat, a thin shell at the interface, and a Schwarzschild-AdS exterior
with mass $M$ and negative cosmological constant $\Lambda$, with the null energy condition being
obeyed.
